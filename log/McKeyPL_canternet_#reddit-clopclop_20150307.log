[23:42:51] <samonuh> >tfw never seen pictures of most people here
[23:43:10] <cloppyhooves> I could show some sexy pictures~

[23:44:58] <Wikkit> well its ok Maybe one day you will be willing to show off your sexiness a bit more! 
[23:46:49] <Wikkit> But I understand :P
[23:47:09] <samonuh> C'est la vie
[23:47:43] <cloppyhooves> I'll think about it
[23:47:50] <cloppyhooves> The reasons are pretty tough, though D:
[23:48:34] <samonuh> What's the reason?
[23:49:23] <Wikkit> well Whatever reasons in place and if you have any rules about your  pics Or something like that  I'll be more than happy to follow Any rules given :)
[23:50:42] <RubyPinch> reason is, no one knows you are a fox on the internet, as soon as evidence shows up, boom, a saying over the last 10 years becomes a lie
[23:50:53] <samonuh> Hue
[23:54:54] <iamalion> can confirm, cloppy is a fox
[23:55:19] <samonuh> I don't believe you
