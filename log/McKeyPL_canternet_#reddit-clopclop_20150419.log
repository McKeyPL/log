[00:46:07] <princesssluttershy> then like 3 years later they slashed it

[05:03:46] <thaostra> If Tesla can get cheap enough and have more charging stations, then I'd buy it in a heartbeat
[05:04:19] <Vulpixbrew> ^this
[05:04:19] <princesssluttershy> The range on the Model s is 200 miles right?
[05:05:28] <princesssluttershy> If they can actually sel the Model 3 for 35k It would be amazing
[05:05:29] <thaostra> Around there, but 30 mile one-way trip to charge really puts a hamper on its range
[05:05:48] <princesssluttershy> You can charge it at your house no?
[05:06:19] <thaostra> Possibly, but then electric bill would go up, plus our grid really sucks around here
[05:07:32] <princesssluttershy> "Anywhere. Seriously. Where there's an outlet, you can charge. The type of outlet or charging station will determine how fast you can charge.
[05:07:48] <princesssluttershy> Taken directly from the Tesla website
[05:08:37] <princesssluttershy> You can apparently get 46 km of range per hour of charge
[05:09:13] <thaostra> I know you can charge with theoretically any socket, but that electricity will still cost money, which is exactly why I'd rather go to a supercharger
[05:09:25] <Vulpixbrew> Get Solar Panels, Charge Telsa, never buy internal combustion, Planet thabnks you,  Uoi8 mad oil companies?

[05:11:10] <princesssluttershy> Still way cheaper than buying gas
[05:12:05] <princesssluttershy> These stats are for the Model S btw
[05:12:44] <princesssluttershy> Plus in Canada at least most workplaces have outside outlets to plug into
[05:13:06] <thaostra> Not feasible around here

[05:13:34] <princesssluttershy> We only have them for people to plug their block heaters into
[05:13:51] <princesssluttershy> but I don't see any reason to not be able to plug a tesla into them
[05:14:02] <princesssluttershy> They're not monitored 
[05:14:56] <thaostra> I just need a supercharger that's within a 15-20 mile radius, and most of my worries about going full electric would instantly go away
[05:15:35] <princesssluttershy> The Model S actually has a longer range than my mom's van
[05:16:09] <thaostra> Vans aren't exactly the paragon of fuel economy
[05:16:20] <princesssluttershy> A lot longer range actually :/
[05:16:36] <princesssluttershy> My mom gets like 300k from her van
[05:16:45] <princesssluttershy> my dad can get 600k out of his
[05:16:55] <princesssluttershy> they cost the same to fill :/
[05:17:00] <princesssluttershy> same year too
[05:17:21] <princesssluttershy> Difference being my mom's is a v6
[05:17:33] <princesssluttershy> (which doesn't even matter in a van)
[05:17:39] <thaostra> As much as I hate my current car, I like that I can fill the tank with $30 and I'd be set for the week
[05:18:08] <princesssluttershy> Ours all cost at leasy $80 to fill... when gas is cheap D:
[05:18:52] <princesssluttershy> and because my dad goes to school and his girlfriend (soon to be wife ^-^) both go to work half an hour away
[05:19:05] <thaostra> Granted I'd be more than happy to take my weekly fuel expenses to $0 if I go to a supercharger with my theoretical Tesla
[05:19:05] <princesssluttershy> that gas doesn't last long
[05:20:01] <princesssluttershy> 40 minutes to fully charge the battery would be great though
[05:20:30] <princesssluttershy> I've only seen one electric charging station ever
[05:20:41] <princesssluttershy> It was in a small town in B.C :/
[05:21:46] <princesssluttershy> wow 265 miles is a long distance :/
[05:24:03] *** eyeburn is now known as Starburn
[05:24:15] <princesssluttershy> I could easily get to my mom's house on a single charge
[05:24:38] <thaostra> That's like one work week with a 25 mile commute
[05:26:19] <princesssluttershy> that's pretty much as far as it is to my dad's school
[05:26:58] <princesssluttershy> that would take our weekly gas bill from $180 to like $15
[05:27:55] <thaostra> If there was a supercharger in Boston or on the way to Boston, then a Tesla would be perfect
[05:28:03] <princesssluttershy> I never really realized how viable Teslas really were until now :/

[05:51:37] <princesssluttershy> Which is about the same as a Ford F-150 or a Honda Odyssey
[05:52:06] <princesssluttershy> Plus a full charge would be less than $10
[05:52:24] <princesssluttershy> (or free if you're using a supercharger)
[05:55:39] <thaostra> Looks like there are a couple dealerships that aren't too far away

[22:27:06] <Luvbi> 13Of which I liked so much that I can't remember the name
[22:27:11] <Luvbi> 13It was probably Teddy >.>

[22:42:43] <Frosty> I wanna be Counter Strike, too
[22:42:54] <OmarianVolcae> I haven't been playing a lot lately. I just ranked up last night.
[22:43:03] <OmarianVolcae> 35 wins
[22:43:07] * Melon_Phone is the counter strike
[22:43:10] <Frosty> You're playbing right now...
[22:43:22] <OmarianVolcae> Well, I launched the game, yes.
[22:43:41] * OmarianVolcae licks iamalion. 
[22:43:48] <Luvbi> 13SEM..... The best Google's got is "Search Engine Marketing", although I doubt that's what you're talking about.... Is it?
[22:43:55] <OmarianVolcae> Silver Elite Master.
[22:44:02] <Luvbi> 13Oh, Counter Strike. I see
[22:44:04] <OmarianVolcae> It's a rank in CS:GO
[22:44:08] <Luvbi> 13Get your shit together Google
[22:44:37] <Luvbi> 13And I thought I was being all slick. "Don't know what they're talking about, Google should tell me"
[22:44:46] <OmarianVolcae> x3
[22:45:06] <OmarianVolcae> Oh. 36 wins.
[22:45:10] <OmarianVolcae> Not 35.
[22:46:32] * Melon_Phone curls up on top of Luvbi
[22:46:52] <Luvbi> 13I should play Counter Strike. But I don't do good on computer games >.<
[22:47:06] <Luvbi> 13I don't do good on games at all. And people tell me Counter Strike is like, really competitive
[22:47:14] <Luvbi> 13Melon, nuu. I'm tiny >.<
[22:47:50] * Melon_Phone licks Luvbi's head
[22:47:57] <Luvbi> 13-_-
[22:48:18] <Frosty> Sometimes I wish I knew what you guys looked lie.
[22:48:56] <Melon_Phone> I'm a big bad wolf irl 
[22:49:36] <Luvbi> 13I have skin, a face, two arms, a mouth with teeth, and two legs
[22:49:50] <Luvbi> 13With some other small details, like my nose, ears, eyes, etc
[22:49:54] <Melon_Phone> psh 
[22:49:57] <Luvbi> 13I just included the most important stuff though XD
[22:49:57] <Melon_Phone> what a weirdo
[22:50:12] <Luvbi> 13Yep, totally ^^
[22:50:15] <Wikkit> i might show someone one day :)
[22:50:33] <Frosty> That'd be neato.
[22:50:56] * Melon_Phone bounces on the weird Luvbi
[22:51:00] <Wikkit> but it would only be in a pm or something possibly
[22:51:26] <Luvbi> 13Stahp ;~; I'm fragile
[22:52:14] * Melon_Phone nuzzles the fragile Luvbi
[22:52:23] <Luvbi> 13XD Better
[22:52:33] <Wikkit> just not sure who to show 
[22:52:44] <Frosty> Imgur. Lol.
[22:54:06] <Wikkit> hmm perhaps
[22:55:20] <Luvbi> 13Just post it on some random subreddit. And whoever finds it finds it XD
[22:56:40] * Melon_Phone sniffs at Luvbi
[22:57:20] <Luvbi> 13That's what I would do. Make it like a scavenger hunt. Like start off with a post  somewhere that has a hint (riddle or something) leading to a new subreddit. And on that one we look for a new post with a new hint. And after 5 or so there is a final hint leading to the imgur link
[22:57:30] <Luvbi> 13I would fail though XD
[22:57:32] <iamalion> hi oma
[22:57:33] <iamalion> sorry
[22:57:36] <iamalion> crazy busy
