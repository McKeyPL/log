[14:49:58] <StarStream> then why not go then 
[14:50:00] <Thunderhalk89> I'm going to asume that that is a con
[14:50:13] <JustKayneNL> no city in germany
[14:50:13] <StarStream> i guess its a place
[14:50:23] <JustKayneNL> it´s 6 hours by bike
[14:50:27] <Thunderhalk89> ah, okay
[14:50:28] <Thunderhalk89> cool
[14:50:36] <JustKayneNL> from oss the netherlands
[14:50:55] <JustKayneNL> well
[14:53:58] <StarStream> 6 hour by bike ?
[14:54:01] <StarStream> as in cycling ?
[14:54:48] <StarStream> cause tbh 130km is not far 
[14:54:56] <StarStream> if u drive only take 1 hour 30m 
[14:55:05] <StarStream> if traffic is clear that is 
[14:55:20] <JustKayneNL> TRUE
[14:55:47] <JustKayneNL> 130 is a lot if you live in the netherlands
[14:56:04] <StarStream> maybe
[14:56:08] <StarStream> but to me its still close
[14:56:33] <JustKayneNL> i want a build a bear in the netherlands
[14:56:50] <StarStream> just order one online then 
[14:56:58] <StarStream> why u wanna think so much about it 
[14:57:06] <JustKayneNL> if i have my gtx 980
[14:57:17] <StarStream> unlike me whereby i have to take an airplane just to get to one 
[14:58:30] <JustKayneNL> 3 hour by train 
[14:58:59] <StarStream> u cant drive ?
[14:59:26] <JustKayneNL> no i'm 14
[14:59:46] <StarStream> ah no wonder
[15:00:26] <JustKayneNL> correction i'm 15 years minus 1 day
[15:00:36] <Thunderhalk89> I was thinking it was a European thing. Where they actually have a mass transit system (in comparison to where I live, where I saw a Greyhound bus for the firstime in 10 or so years a few days ago)
[15:00:40] <StarStream> happy birthday then 
[15:00:59] <JustKayneNL> thanks in advance
[15:01:01] <Thunderhalk89> cool. Happy early B-Day
[15:01:40] <JustKayneNL> thanks
