[00:52:05] <Gigabit> Cousin wants me to recomend a build.
[00:52:27] <Gigabit> I personally wanted to go Intel 4690k but its 240, 
[00:53:24] <Lapsus> Gigabit: you can totally get away with an i5
[00:53:41] <Lapsus> I wouldn't go as far as an i3 though
[00:53:57] <Gigabit> But the cost, he wants to spend around 350. And he needs memory could and mobo
[00:54:02] <Gigabit> Cpu
[00:54:17] <Lapsus> what, $350 for the whole thing?
[00:54:20] <Gigabit> And right now it is 415 for all 3. 
[00:54:25] <Lapsus> sounds like craigslist time to me
[00:54:30] <Lapsus> or whatever you use
[00:54:40] <Gigabit> He won't buy used

[01:03:36] <Gigabit> Well thats the thing, if a new socket comes out.. what then? because I may be building me a new system in the fall once I actually get paid, and I was going to get identical parts too most likely x.x
[01:04:20] <Kinsley> Uh, the AM3+ socket has been around for like, 5+ years.
[01:04:50] <Gigabit> Yeah, look at intel, they are doing new sockets left and right. Plus AMD is rumoured to release the new "zen" cpu
[01:05:15] <Kinsley> So if you do go the FX line of processors, then you're good to stick with those boards. You need to watch out for certain chipset/CPU combos, like the FX 9xxx needs a 990 whatever chipset.
[01:06:45] <Kinsley> I would be willing to bet, based on the rumors I've heard, that the Zen CPU is going to be a high-end APU, technically. So it would probably fit in either existing FM2+ boards or AMD would release a new socket.

[01:08:20] <Kinsley> 8350 in a 970 board with 8GB of RAM for $280
[01:08:51] <Kinsley> The 6300? Pretty good, but the 8350 would be better. I thought it was closer to $200 than what Newegg is listing it for in that combo deal.
[01:09:09] <Gigabit> ya 170 no combo
[01:09:23] <tiwake> thats a pretty good starting kit
[01:09:29] <Gigabit> My thing is, like I said if I actually get paid this fall, then I will be doing an identical build upgrade
[01:09:44] <tiwake> does that motherboard have coreboot?
[01:10:09] <Kinsley> tiwake: no idea. I haven't run AMD parts in my own stuff since Vista.
[01:10:49] <Kinsley> I did part out some stuff for a friend to build her tower, and went with some AMD parts. I did get her a 990FX board and an FX6300 CPU.

[01:15:55] <tiwake> a badass videocard these days might use 60% of the bandwidth in a PCIe 2.0 slot?
[01:16:11] <tiwake> 16x
[01:16:20] <Gigabit> Well he will be getting probably a  270x or something around that
[01:17:11] <Gigabit> Most graphics intensive/cpu intensive game he plays is WoW and maybe WoWS/WOT
[01:17:50] <tiwake> amd r9 290 and the nvidia 970 might use 60% of the bandwidth in a 16x PCIe 2.0 slot
[01:18:12] <tiwake> (I'm kinda guessing, but I don't think I'm very far off)
[01:18:55] <Kinsley> Yeah, unless you're rocking a 3 or 4 way SLI/Crossfire (Crossfire esp.) setup, you're just not bound by the speed of a 16x PCIe 2.0 or 3.0 slot.
[01:19:04] <Gigabit> kk cool
[01:19:07] <Gigabit> sorry for asking a lot
[01:19:19] <Kinsley> That's why those setups only use 8x/8x in dual configs.
[01:19:27] <Kinsley> Or 8x/8x/4x
[01:19:51] <Kinsley> Like, you can read the motherboard specs for SLI/Crossfire compatibility, and it will list the bandwidth for each type of config.

[01:22:43] <tiwake> thats not a good way to test
[01:23:02] <tiwake> the way to test is to make it so half of the lane contacts are not touching

[01:26:54] <tiwake> different motherboard with a different chipset... who knows why there is a 10 frames/second difference

[08:37:53] <Phase4> good thing it never broke, i think they only have one
[08:38:16] <Phase4> oh, they have wo, neat
[08:38:29] <Kinsley> Because it's not like NASA couldn't just call up Boeing and be like, "Yo."
[08:39:43] <Phase4> Kinsley, you can't just buy an airliner, even ignoring price new craft are (iirc) only constructed once an order has been placed
[08:40:49] <Phase4> got them second hand, N905NA was from american airlines, N911NA from japan airlines
[08:41:18] <Kinsley> True. But unless the craft was so damaged as to be beyond repair, they could get replacement parts in a fraction of the time.
[08:41:37] * JustAberrant wishes he owned a large commercial airliner :(
[08:41:49] <GigabitPony> Anyone mind helping me a bit with firewall rules?
[08:42:04] <ThunderBolt> i knew this would happen
[08:42:08] <ThunderBolt> i buy a GTX 980 on the 22 of april, on may 1st the GTX 980Ti is confirmed

[08:42:20] <Colgate> Phase4: boeing has a waitlist of like 10 years to get an airplane
[08:42:38] <AppleDash> thank you for sending that to every channel ThunderBolt.
[08:42:56] <ThunderBolt> No Prob, just want to get the word out ;)
[08:43:19] <Phase4> Kinsley, true, though by 'broke' i sorta did mean "beyond repair", even if it wasn't it'd be a pain with only one, with two it's no real trouble though
[08:43:22] <GigabitPony> JustAberrant I want to block all traffice coming from the internet to my external Ip on port 80, since I cannot change the webserver port to allow management of the router
[08:43:41] <GigabitPony> But I want internal ips to be able to connect to the router and manage it
[08:43:50] <JustAberrant> should be simple enough
[08:43:58] <Phase4> GigabitPony, your router listens on wan?
[08:44:07] <JustAberrant> assuming you have a firewall between wan and router
[08:44:11] <GigabitPony> It can and does
[08:44:13] <JustAberrant> or the router is said firewall
[08:44:28] <GigabitPony> Router has said firewall option
[08:44:30] <GigabitPony> Let me screen shot what I have.
[08:44:36] <Colgate> should have a different interface for wan, can just have the router drop packets on that interface on part 80
[08:44:41] <JustAberrant> normally the wan side should DENY or DROP anything incoming unless you explicitly tell it not to
[08:45:11] <GigabitPony> https://www.dropbox.com/s/97wyjt8n5519856/Screenshot_1.jpg?dl=0
[08:45:15] <GigabitPony> thats what I can do
[08:45:19] <JustAberrant> if this is some cheap consumer router, there's probably a "allow remote access" checkbox somewhere ;p

[08:47:32] * JustAberrant seriously doesn't trust those cheap consumer router/firewalls 
[08:47:59] <GigabitPony> Well like I said, its a Ubiquiti AirGateway, not sure how cheap it is
[08:48:00] <JustAberrant> which I now feel has been somewhat justified with all the egregious vulnerabilities uncovered lately
[08:48:33] * JustAberrant doesn't know that brand

[08:49:39] <GigabitPony> Yeah we have a nanostation M airmax CPE
[08:50:50] <GigabitPony> The cool thing about the nanostation M is I can plug in an IP camera to it and have access. So I can monitor outside here by the device
[08:51:34] * JustAberrant would assume that's a function of the camera, not the router?
[08:52:11] <GigabitPony> The wireless radio (nanostation) has a port special for plugging in PoE devices to it for simple setup
