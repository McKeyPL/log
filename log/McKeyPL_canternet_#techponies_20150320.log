[21:55:36] <CompuDesktop> wolfyshy: hey u there?
[21:55:51] <wolfyshy> I indeed am here
[21:57:12] <CompuDesktop> wolfyshy: wanna play openttd?
[21:57:21] <wolfyshy> at work right now :(
[21:57:25] <CompuDesktop> aww :(
[21:57:39] <CompuDesktop> i tried playing on the reddit servers but their maps r too large
[21:57:44] <CompuDesktop> they make my desktop lag
[21:58:45] <CompuDesktop> i asked the openttd support channel and they said that openttd wasnt built support maps in sizes such as 1028x2048
[22:36:00] <JustAberrant> :)
[22:39:09] <WorkingData> i love this. so much.

[22:43:52] <JustAberrant> meh, like all those I call BS ;p
[22:44:18] *** eyeburn is now known as Starburn
[22:44:29] <WorkingData> they are entertaining, nonetheless
[22:44:38] <JustAberrant> meh, too unbelievable
[22:44:45] <JustAberrant> I think I've ranted about this here before.. but yeah
[22:44:56] <Blackjack> You have LO'
[22:44:57] <Blackjack> :P *
[22:45:03] <JustAberrant> :>
[22:45:07] <WorkingData> i have worked with some people that match some of these 'users' .. i believe at least half of them ;P
[22:45:29] <JustAberrant> the users, sure, it's the responses that are out there 
[22:45:57] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Pony-osmcfg.co.comcast.net)
[22:46:27] <JustAberrant> and all the obvious red flags in that writeup, the thing that jumps to mind is, "just log the errors somewhere"
[22:47:00] <JustAberrant> relying on users to report errors is just shit design
[22:47:17] <WorkingData> hehehe
[22:47:32] <WorkingData> he did say his first sql program ;)
[22:47:48] <JustAberrant> like, not everyone would do that initially, but as a response to "users arn't telling us about the problems", any decent programmer would come up with "so store them in a file" pretty quickly
[22:48:03] *** Neptune|sleep is now known as Neptune
[22:48:14] <JustAberrant> also if their software deployment process is that some random programmer sends out an email with a link.. 
[22:48:34] <JustAberrant> small company, ok, maybe.. but that too strikes me odd
[22:48:39] <WorkingData> well, you don't always want just the error - you'd want all of the input it was given.. and when it's an in-house software, it's just easier to walk over to the machine and look
[22:49:11] <JustAberrant> meh, or dump any state you care about in the error
[22:49:24] <JustAberrant> you know.. like just about every piece of software ever does..
[22:49:36] <JustAberrant> i.e. all that gogglegook they ask you to copy+paste as part of your error report ;p
[22:50:40] <JustAberrant> also how many office PCs have speakers.. maybe some do, but I wouldn't say that's overly common
[22:50:58] <JustAberrant> and either way, max volume probably just destroyed them
[22:52:04] <JustAberrant> and the whole "told them I'd take it out as long as they continued to report errors".. yeah fucking dream on
[22:52:25] <JustAberrant> more like.. "take it out right now and maybe we don't shitcan you"
[22:53:14] <WorkingData> heh.. based off the other story there, sounds like a laid-back boss, a bit like here ;)
[22:53:15] <JustAberrant> I mean small company maybe they have a sense of humor, whatever... but there's enough red flags in there that I don't believe it ;p
[22:55:16] <JustAberrant> but yeah, these stories range from kinda maybe plausible but probably not, to complete and total obvious bs :(
[22:56:20] <JustAberrant> WorkingData: reading his other story I get the same impression
[22:56:20] <WorkingData> hahahahah
[22:56:21] <WorkingData> http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2znkyx/i_had_no_idea_how_bad_i_wasuntil_i_came_here/
[22:56:21] <PinkiePieBot> [ I had no idea how bad I was...until I came here. : talesfromtechsupport ]
[22:56:30] <WorkingData> this guy xD
[22:58:28] <JustAberrant> yeah.. FAA story is definitely bs
[22:59:48] <JustAberrant> I've delt with auditors.. there's no discussion.. 
[23:01:23] <JustAberrant> they put it in their log, and it gets sorted out after the audit
[23:01:58] <JustAberrant> and no way you get away with no off-site backup
[23:02:14] <JustAberrant> and if you could, it's certainly not by convincing the auditor on the spot
[23:03:22] <JustAberrant> and those specs are interpreted to the letter, logic doesn't even enter into the equation
[23:03:38] <JustAberrant> if the spec says your machine needs a firewall
[23:04:02] <JustAberrant> doesn't matter if it doesn't have a network connection, or even have a NIC.. you install a firewall on there and they put a check in the box
[23:04:09] <JustAberrant> because it's way, way easier than getting a waiver
[23:06:43] <JustAberrant> "oh, I guess your right" ain't how this shit works :D
[23:18:27] *** GigaWork is now known as Gigabit
[23:26:43] <Kinsley> To be fair, a good amount of that shit just gets made up by a couple of morons in a conference room with a dart and a wall of bullshit.
[23:29:28] <Kinsley> I can't tell you how many times we had meetings because they changed the policy on, say, whether a box of tissues counts as a "personal item" because we need to have clean desks when dealing with people's health info.

[23:38:24] <Blackjack> Someone who knows about DNS
[23:38:28] <Blackjack> Can you CNAME @ ?
[23:41:44] <Shutter> Just test? I don't see why not though. Why?
[23:43:56] <Phase4> Blackjack, technically no
[23:44:49] <wolfyshy> not in bind
[23:45:03] <wolfyshy> it may be possible on microsoft's DNS server
[23:45:21] <JustAberrant> or required even :(
[23:45:23] <Blackjack> So you can't? :(
[23:45:48] * JustAberrant hands Kinsley the nacho cheese
[23:46:07] <Phase4> Blackjack, rfc says no
[23:46:15] <Blackjack> :(
[23:46:18] * Kinsley frowns and returns it via a railgun.
[23:46:29] <wolfyshy> namecheap's DNS lets me
[23:46:31] * JustAberrant dodges.. ineffectively :(
[23:46:32] <Phase4> cloudflare specifically lets you, but it does so by resolving the domain itself and returning an A or AAAA
[23:46:45] <Phase4> namecheap might do the same, called cname flattening
[23:46:57] <wolfyshy> Blackjack: xmpp
[23:47:01] <Blackjack> wolfyshy: ok
[23:47:34] <Colgate> Phase4: uh, what RFC states that you can't do it?
[23:48:20] <Phase4> i'm not sure, just what i've read
[23:48:30] * Lapsus just remembered to renew his domains :v
[23:48:48] <Phase4> apparently exchange server has problem with it
[23:48:49] <Lapsus> hey Blackjack let's start another pony image site on porni.es
[23:48:51] <Lapsus> :3
[23:49:01] <Blackjack> lol
[23:49:05] <Blackjack> OK
[23:49:29] <Colgate> exchange server has lots of problems
[23:49:32] <Colgate> :P
[23:49:45] <Colgate> I wouldn't use that as a basis for anything
[23:49:48] <Phase4> would have guessed as much
[23:50:24] * Phase4 enjoys the fact that exchange originated from a 3rd party
[23:51:30] <Colgate> RFC1912 is the closest I can see that says you can't, but that simply says that a CNAME rr has to be by iteself
[23:52:26] <Phase4> most of what i've read is "don't do that" "why not?" "because don't"
[23:52:52] <Phase4> issue with exchange is the only problem i'm aware of but never really looked intoit
