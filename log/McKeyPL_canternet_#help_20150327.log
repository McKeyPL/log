[01:17:51] <Starthunder> :|
[01:18:04] <Starthunder> This is the fifth time a week has been added to my idlerpg time.
[01:18:11] <Starthunder> Is anything ever going to be done about that?
[01:18:22] <Colgate> hmm... nope
[01:20:09] <Starthunder> :I
[01:20:24] <Starthunder> Why not?
[01:21:34] <Colgate> because it is idlerpg :P
[01:22:41] <Starthunder> Butâ€¦I didn't /do/ anything. I've been idle!
[01:23:01] <Starthunder> And it didn't send any kind of message saying that it was adding a week, or why.
[01:23:21] <Starthunder> There were just suddenly an extra seven or eight days in the next time it posted.
[01:27:47] <AppleDash> It's just a silly IRC "game"
[01:37:27] <Starthunder> Games aren't very fun when they're broken. :V
[01:38:27] <Starthunder> Imagine any kind of point-based game that, at intervals, subtracted a significant number of points from you or your team without any apparently justification.
[01:38:34] <Starthunder> s/(apparent)ly/\1/
[01:39:30] <Colgate> it is a silly thing I setup like 2 years ago while drunk(probably), it isn't going to change :P
