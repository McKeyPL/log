[21:59:56] <SilveR^SurfeR> hello
[22:00:03] <SilveR^SurfeR> how to link you user ids
[22:00:23] <Dusk> /ns group
[22:00:39] <SilveR^SurfeR> dust but it will group a nick
[22:00:44] <SilveR^SurfeR> i want to group my user ids
[22:00:49] <Dusk> You can't.
[22:00:57] <SilveR^SurfeR> i have done it here before
[22:01:05] <SilveR^SurfeR> one became clint of other
[22:01:23] <Dusk> Oh like letting your own names be used by someone with a specified hostmast?
[22:01:44] <SilveR^SurfeR> i think like that
[22:02:09] <SilveR^SurfeR> if i have acces on my one id the other id will have the same power without haveing access on that channel
[22:02:21] <Dusk> so /ns access add (hostmask)
[22:02:47] <SilveR^SurfeR> but it requires passowrd of other userid
[22:02:54] <SilveR^SurfeR> i forget how i did that :(
[22:03:06] <Dusk> No it doesn't
[22:03:12] <Dusk> it /asks/ for the password
[22:03:17] <Dusk> it doesn't /require/ it
[22:03:28] <SilveR^SurfeR> one id become clint of other id
[22:03:49] <Dusk> ...
[22:04:17] <Dusk> You can't actually link nickserv accounts.
[22:04:20] <Dusk> That's not a thing here.
[22:04:32] <SilveR^SurfeR> i did it before
[22:04:36] <SilveR^SurfeR> i checked
[22:04:54] <Dusk> I'm gonna say no, you did something you think looked like that before.
[22:05:05] <AppleDash> It is not doable here
[22:05:15] <SilveR^SurfeR> then what it was
[22:05:17] <AppleDash> And no matter how many times you say you did it before, that will not change.
[22:05:20] <Dusk> ^
[22:05:23] <SilveR^SurfeR> when i take info of one id
[22:05:32] <SilveR^SurfeR> it shows that i have one clint
[22:05:40] <SilveR^SurfeR> and that was my other id
[22:05:57] <Dusk> That's using access.
[22:06:13] <SilveR^SurfeR> and wheni join the chatroom i use the same access that i have on other id
[22:06:17] <SilveR^SurfeR> yes how to do that
[22:07:36] <Dusk> /ns access add *!*@desiredhostmaskhere
[22:08:54] <SilveR^SurfeR> but it contain my user id and pw
[22:08:58] <SilveR^SurfeR> some thing like this
[22:09:11] * Dusk sighs
[22:09:22] <SilveR^SurfeR> ./msg nickserv group otherid pw
[22:10:05] <Dusk> uh...
[22:10:10] <Dusk> alright then...
