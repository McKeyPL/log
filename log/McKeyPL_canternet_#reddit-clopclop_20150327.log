[00:12:20] <samonuh> My suitemate is having a girl over soon and told me to close my doors.
[00:12:36] <iamalion> go out to a movie :)
[00:12:46] <samonuh> No thanks
[00:12:50] <iamalion> :[
[00:13:19] <samonuh> It's my apartment too :P
[00:14:32] <cloppyhooves> Put a sock on your door
[00:14:35] <cloppyhooves> That'll show them
[00:14:42] <samonuh> Heh
[00:14:56] <samonuh> The issue is I'm doing laundry and I ordered food
[00:15:00] <samonuh> So I'll be moving around
[00:16:38] <cloppyhooves> Offer them snacks while they're going at it
[00:16:39] <Vulpixbrew> toss condoms at them
[00:16:55] <samonuh> I mean, he has his own separate room
[00:17:02] <samonuh> The noises will be uncomfortable though
[00:17:20] <samonuh> He's like "yea, we're here because her roommate found us annoying"
[00:17:24] <samonuh> Guess I don't matter :P
[00:22:29] <iamalion> wear headphones
[00:22:41] <iamalion> even if you arent listening to anything, just pretend

[00:23:32] <samonuh> My roommate doesn't have the courtesy :P
[00:23:48] <samonuh> Whenever my girlfriend's over, I always ask him to please text us before he returns to the room
[00:23:51] <samonuh> He never does

[00:24:16] <samonuh> One time he was out of town for the weekend and didn't tell us
[00:24:25] <samonuh> So my girlfriend and I feared he'd walk in
[00:24:33] <samonuh> Would've been nice of him to tell me
[00:24:39] <expatriate> my roommate freshman year would start fucking in front of me
[00:24:48] <expatriate> I would be doing homework or whatever
[00:24:51] <samonuh> My freshman roommates were spawns of the devil
[00:24:56] <expatriate> and he would come in with his girlfriend
[00:24:59] <expatriate> say "sup"
[00:25:05] <expatriate> and they would start fucking
[00:25:32] <samonuh> Wow
[00:25:38] <samonuh> I'd get them kicked out
[00:25:43] <samonuh> Or I'd transfer rooms
[00:26:10] <samonuh> My freshmen roommates both had their girlfriends permanently living in the dorm room
[00:26:14] <samonuh> five of us living in one room
[00:26:19] <samonuh> -.-

[05:12:40] <Flame> anyone?
[05:13:00] <Flame> Like...there was this commercial that was aimed at "showing that the idea vista was flawed was because no one actually sat down to use it"
[05:13:12] <RubyPinch> Ugh
[05:13:20] <Squirrelly> samonuh, you have failed the Queen test

[05:15:53] <RubyPinch> I feel sorry for windows devs
[05:16:49] <RubyPinch> The thing worse than a Dev saying "its not a bug, its a feature", is the client saying it instead

[05:20:51] <thaostra> It's hard to patch up what they were unable to anticipate when Vista was a departure from XP both UI-wise and internally. Windows 7 at least gave them time to evaluate problems in Vista and improve them. OS development is complicated, yo

[05:56:57] <thaostra> Quinn, It's actually fairly active if you check their repo. And it's only meant to be an open source implementation of a couple old Star Wars games, so its scope is rather limited
[05:56:59] <Quinn> I've probably put a good 2,000-3,000 hours on that agme

[05:58:42] <Flame> Quinn: :3

[05:59:51] <Quinn> nono
[05:59:56] <Flame> o.o
[05:59:57] <Quinn> it was a super popular clan system thingy
[06:00:04] <Flame> ...huh?
[06:00:18] <Vulpixbrew> oooo jedi Academy was fun
[06:00:23] <Quinn> and you had to reach a certain level of training and duel wins for your master to recommend you for Jedi Knight 
[06:00:35] <Flame> thaostra: idk what to do with OpenJK D: like...download the zip from git? what zip? default "zip download"? and where extract on opensource game?
[06:00:39] <Quinn> and then you had to pass a test on a custom map that only masters and knights have ever seen
[06:00:44] <Flame> Quinn: D: okay!!!
[06:00:47] <Flame> sounds epic :D

[06:01:39] <Quinn> only worth booting up MP if you want to play vs bots
[06:01:43] <Flame> Quinn: :( aww...
[06:02:15] <Quinn> such amazing games, but they were too involved for today's gaming market
[06:02:17] <Quinn> too hard to really learn
[06:03:02] <Quinn> the saber system was so fucking amazing
[06:03:08] <Quinn> but it didn't translate to consoles AT ALL
[06:03:17] <Quinn> so that right there kills any chance of it ever being revived
[06:04:07] <thaostra> I wish the developers would incorporate OpenJK into the games on Steam, because they'd look mighty appealing with a penguin icon
[06:05:07] <Quinn> it'd increase their sales by a whole 0.01%!

[06:06:20] <thaostra> Well, the games are well over a decade so pretty much all of their potential market has come and gone, but it'd be an excellent gesture of cooperation with open source development
[06:06:33] <thaostra> * decade old
[06:06:43] <Quinn> I guess, but it's probably way more effort than they're willing to put into an already dead game
[06:07:07] <Flame> thaostra: ...wait...incoroporate it into games? what games? :o
[06:07:18] <Quinn> outcast is worth a singleplayer run, JKJA maybe
[06:07:34] <Quinn> but MP is completely dead on both games so they don't have much replay value like they did when they were really active

[06:08:08] <Quinn> holy fuck
[06:08:16] <Quinn> this reminds me of so many good times
[06:08:20] <thaostra> That really depends, because OpenJK not only introduces multiplatform support, but fixes any longstanding engine bugs or incompatibilities with newer Windows releases that otherwise went unfixed. OpenJK is practically a drop-in replacement which they make clear in the installation notes
[06:08:33] <Vulpixbrew> ooo gods I wish I couldplay some mutliplayer

[06:10:56] <thaostra> Seriously, almost of the QA is taken care of for them when OpenJK has its own community developers and bug tracker for anyone having problems. All they'd need to do is periodically sync with the project

[21:37:59] <iamalion> I never mentioned android
[21:38:18] <thaostra> I'm *inquiring* about which version
[21:38:35] <iamalion> version of what?
[21:38:48] <thaostra> Of Fx, because there are multiple versions
[21:39:21] <iamalion> Im not following. I used noscript
[21:40:28] <thaostra> Yes, I know. I'm asking which version of Fx you're using, because Fx is available on multiple platforms and are compatible with the same extensions
[21:41:19] <iamalion> wait, by fx do you mean firefox?

[21:41:54] <iamalion> wahtever the newest version is

[21:42:19] <iamalion> yes
[21:42:34] <thaostra> What other extensions were you using?
[21:42:39] <ponder> What are we talking about?
[21:43:14] <thaostra> Firefox freezing while browsing Imgur
[21:43:32] <ponder> I don't have that problem
[21:44:05] <iamalion> it isnt my extensions, yesterday i disabled them all and it still froze it up
[21:44:08] <iamalion> but here you go anyway https://i.imgur.com/hhVtdeE.png
[21:44:09] <thaostra> Well iamalion apparently encountered that, so I'm curious to see what's causing it
[21:44:51] <thaostra> Adblock hider helper?
[21:45:06] <iamalion> so I can block entire <div>s
[21:45:17] <iamalion> a lot of these are for porn tbh
[21:45:53] <thaostra> k
[21:46:08] <iamalion> im fine with js disabled on imgur
[21:46:10] <thaostra> I suppose Imgur is running some scripts that don't play well
[21:47:00] <iamalion> they are getting to complicated
[21:47:09] <iamalion> it used to be a super simple image hosting site
[21:47:23] <iamalion> now its getting all complicated with its design, the scripts and other bullshit
[21:47:24] <thaostra> Any idea which scripts are causing it to freeze?

[21:50:02] <thaostra> I haven't run into any issues with Imgur lately, although I've been running uBlock to block ads for some time, so it might be something ad-related that slipped past ABP

[22:37:58] <RNGsus> To give credit to derpibooru, I used to use the /r/clopclop subreddit until I found derpibooru and with its awesome search engine and the ability to favorite things and view them back, ive changed over to derpi
[22:38:57] <thaostra> It's honestly the most comprehensive archive of clop out there
[22:39:05] <samonuh> Yea, I just filter out anything with less than 150 votes
[22:40:30] <thaostra> I browse with nothing filtered, mostly because I prefer to look at Derpi as it is, but also because I can't administrate content that I can't see
[22:40:54] <RNGsus> I browse with safe and all the gore tags filtered
[22:41:04] <RNGsus> And anything below 0 I think
[22:42:03] <samonuh> I just hate constantly searching through posts for good ones
[22:42:16] <thaostra> The closest thing I do to filtering is removing tags from a search, because at least I can clearly see what's being excluded and can share the URL
[22:42:19] <samonuh> Even with my filter I still think 50% of them are not good quality

[23:45:30] <samonuh> Which language did you take?
[23:47:23] <ponder> Seeing as how I'm Icelandic I have been forced since sixth grade to study Danish. I also took a few semesters of german and have taken one Italian class, and one Japanese class.
[23:47:25] <RNGsus> french and spanish
