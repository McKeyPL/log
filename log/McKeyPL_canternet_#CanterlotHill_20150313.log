[01:45:12] <Eywind> I'll have to remember that next time I want you to leave lol
[01:45:13] <Araxnus> Only One-Trick can not be kicked. Well Berry too
[01:45:19] * RandomNinja boops Flurshy with Araxnus 
[01:45:24] <Flurshy> RandomNinja!!!
[01:45:32] * Flurshy boop
[01:45:40] <RandomNinja> you can kick equal but not upwards right?
[01:45:40] * Trildar beeps
[01:45:47] <Flurshy> mhm
[01:45:50] <RandomNinja> oh hai
[01:45:55] <Eywind> Well if we use the bots
[01:45:56] <Araxnus> Might be a list for DerpyBot to not. But eh. Just like the caps one.
[01:45:57] <BerryPunch> I almost demonstrated by kicking Araxnus, but I see DerpyBot already did the honors
[01:45:58] <One-Trick> ahh, peace was removed
[01:45:58] <Eywind> Lol
[01:46:09] <Araxnus> xD Yes
[01:46:20] <RandomNinja> yeah but that's derpy kicking :P
[01:46:21] <Lrond> Can you make anyone a + or % more?
[01:46:27] <Araxnus> One-Trick: Oh that is why then
[01:46:36] <RandomNinja> how do you mean Lrond?
[01:46:52] <BerryPunch> I don't think I removed peace ... unless I was just that drunk
[01:46:54] * Araxnus gives BerryPunch Blue Brand Beer.
[01:46:58] <Flurshy> Araxnus: derpy's programming is separate from the no-caps mode
[01:47:11] <RandomNinja> we can give people + at will if that's what you mean
[01:47:14] * BerryPunch is drinking Founders. Is at a pint night
[01:47:16] <Trildar> Also, Eywind, I have no idea what Twitter you're talking about. I never made one. >.>
[01:47:16] <Lrond> Like, idk One-Trick decides that someone is deserving a "+", so a + will be added by One-Trick 
[01:47:23] <Eywind> uhhuh Trildar
[01:47:34] <Araxnus> Flurshy: I know. But she does have a list to not kick for caps
[01:47:40] <Eywind> https://twitter.com/Trildar everyone go follow this guy
[01:47:40] <RandomNinja> BerryPunch which founders? got their Imperial Stout in my glass
[01:47:51] <BerryPunch>  Lrond yeah there's more formula to it but something like that. 
[01:47:59] <Araxnus> Trildar whos that guy who folloers me den?
[01:48:01] <BerryPunch> RandomNinja: Lushious Stout
[01:48:08] <Flurshy> but caps are simply disabled for those not already on her no-kick list...
[01:48:12] <BerryPunch>  I prefer the imperial stout over this, but it's still good
[01:48:12] <Eywind> There is?
[01:48:13] <Eywind> I thought it was more like "this person seems notable enough"
[01:48:18] <RandomNinja> we had that a while back. Never picked it up because price point
[01:48:20] <Araxnus> CANTERLOCK
[01:48:21] <Lrond> ? what formula? Like a Contract someone has to sign?
[01:48:22] <Eywind> Anything that's under & can't set permanent ranks though
[01:48:30] <Eywind> so like I can add a temp % but not a perma %
[01:48:34] <One-Trick> I MOVE THE FADER BACK AND FORTH, I MOVE THE FADER BACK AND FORTH, I MOVE THE FADER BACK AND FORTH.
[01:48:39] <One-Trick> >.>
[01:48:45] <RandomNinja> Founders can do nothing wrong with stouts
[01:48:54] <Araxnus> One-Trick: Wub Queen!
[01:49:01] <BerryPunch> Aye
[01:49:07] <Moonlightning> @Ops can kick each other; %Half-Ops cannot.
[01:49:10] <BerryPunch>  Which is why I love Founders
[01:49:17] <Sketchy_Sounds> Drives around in One-Trick's Traktor
[01:49:17] <Lrond> Whats the difference between % and perma%, or is it just the duration?
[01:49:17] <Trildar> Araxnus: I dunno. Some nerd.
[01:49:20] <Sketchy_Sounds> Herp
[01:49:21] <Moonlightning> I believe &Admins cannot; Not sure about ~Founders
[01:49:24] <Eywind> perma% gets it when they log in
[01:49:25] <BerryPunch>  I'm about to try a Southern Tier Goat Boy though
[01:49:27] * Sketchy_Sounds forgot his /me

[03:48:22] <Hamtramck> I have NV, and I liked it, but I never played FO3 'cause I can't think of a single Bethesda game I liked.
[03:48:49] <RandomNinja> so you start in DC and play F3 with NV mechanics, then you take the train to Mojave when you feel like it
[03:49:03] <Hamtramck> Granted I only played their TES games (sans Battlespire and Skyrim). Maybe their old Terminator things were amazing, idk!!
[03:49:32] <RandomNinja> if not for Lonesome Road, it could have fit into canon

[03:49:48] <RandomNinja> it is

[15:26:13] * Unixkitty flails!
[15:27:40] <Unixkitty> So... I decided to install the Windows 10 Tech Preview on my home desktop this weekend
[15:28:11] <Unixkitty> I keep hearing about oh how wonderful that system is, so stable, pretty and advanced
[15:28:54] <Unixkitty> Obviously going to dual boot it at first, it is a pre-release after all
[15:29:05] <RandomNinja> well yeah
[15:29:13] <RandomNinja> looking forward to it though
[15:29:39] <Unixkitty> Right now only just installed it on a virtualbox machine, trying to see what it looks like
[15:30:34] <Unixkitty> It looks pretty so far, I'll give them that much
[15:30:46] <RandomNinja> It seems to not have a bunch of issues that W8 had
[15:30:57] <Unixkitty> Oh?
[15:31:09] <Unixkitty> I would imagine so, but anything in particular?
[15:31:12] <RandomNinja> just what I've heard
[15:31:21] <RandomNinja> a proper start menu for one
[15:31:42] <RandomNinja> and hopefully no fullscreeen only metro nonsense
[15:32:28] <Unixkitty> http://i.unixkitty.net/WnY89k7V.jpg
[15:33:06] <Unixkitty> It does have a start menu, but personally I haven't really ever had a need for one, probably comes with me being used to directly starting programs in CLI interfaces for the most part
[15:33:13] * RandomNinja flails at resolution
[15:33:14] <JockeTF> Alpacas! :D
[15:33:20] <Unixkitty> No drivers yet :P
[15:33:31] <RandomNinja> because you run unix? :P
[15:33:40] <Unixkitty> Because it's virtualbox, silly
[15:33:46] <RandomNinja> no I mean starting from CLI
[15:33:58] <Unixkitty> Oh um, yes I suppose
[15:34:17] <Unixkitty> I did like the Windows+Q thing in 8.1 though, kinda like a mix of Win+R and a simple search
[15:34:34] <RandomNinja> run if find?
[15:35:16] <Unixkitty> Mostly similar to Windows 7's start menu search box if you like, with a few minor differences
[15:36:43] <Unixkitty> RandomNinja, http://i.unixkitty.net/WgHx9Ebd.jpg
[15:37:02] <Unixkitty> I know it says Windows+S, but that's actually "search in settings"

[19:02:28] <Trildar> No, cause backwards compatibility weirdness.
[19:02:59] <Trildar> Or well, just Windows weirdness.
[19:03:17] <Trildar> system32 is 64 bit and sysWOW64 is 32 bit. Logic.
