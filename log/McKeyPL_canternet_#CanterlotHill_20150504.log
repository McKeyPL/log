[00:10:20] <Hamtramck> I was gonna get a PC awhile ago but people were narc'ing on me for not wanting to build it myself.
[00:10:53] <wobniaR> Get a pre-built if you're lazy, then fit it in with upgrades as you see fit
[00:11:32] <wobniaR> You'll spend more money but less time, and it'll be less customizable but still usable
[00:11:43] <Hamtramck> Also it sounded like whatever 2000USD would get me from DigitalStorm would have more power consumption than I'd want to deal with.
