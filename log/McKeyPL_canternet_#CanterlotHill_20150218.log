[02:04:04] <techniponi> so I've been forcing myself to mess around with python in the hopes that I will eventually accomplish something

[02:04:09] <Cloud_Zephyr> lighting*
[02:04:21] * Moonlightning boops techniponi
[02:04:26] <TripDiam> Lighting is actally my career now.
[02:04:45] <techniponi> this is the literal first thing I've started and I'm already realizing how terrible my code is, lol https://github.com/techniponi/pystupidmapthing/blob/master/main.py
[02:05:17] <techniponi> I didn't have much of a "goal" in mind with anything and kinda just kept adding on code changes whenever I thought of a neat thing to add
[02:05:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> its amazing. i probably won't be spending much on lighting since i dont hve anyone to see it apart from me
[02:05:35] <techniponi> that is now starting to give me issues because my variables are an ABSOLUTE MESS

[02:06:49] <techniponi> I'm really loving python so far
[02:07:10] <techniponi> some languages complicate things with weird confusing things that beginners won't really understand why they have to do it, or how it works
[02:07:14] <One-Trick> you should break those up into classes or define all yer globals at the top

[02:07:37] <techniponi> but with python I don't need to wrangle with the language, I just need to think of the logic behind how to accomplish something and then all I need to do is type it
[02:07:37] <Flurshy> techniponi: like Static?
[02:07:47] <One-Trick> if you define half way down, you can run into assignment before reference
[02:08:10] <techniponi> most of my variables are assigned at the top

[02:13:35] <wobniaR> I have that problem with java too

[02:14:55] <techniponi> tutorial: okay kids this is a function. You use this function for [40 examples], and as you can see, you have to tell it these specific things to make it useful. [blah blah blah 40 examples and downloadable code for studying]

[02:16:08] <techniponi> I pick up on logic very easily, so usually I can just look at code that uses something and be "oohhh that's how it works", then I can understand documentation perfectly

[02:16:37] <techniponi> my challenge is getting off my butt and actually coding something
[02:16:57] <wobniaR> I can't just look at a documentation file and be like "Oh this is ez"
[02:17:45] <wobniaR> I can plan out the psuedocode and how I want it to work, but I'm too inexperienced with most programming languages to know the syntax
[02:18:08] <wobniaR> So I get stuck looking up functions and definitions that would do certain things

[04:34:35] <Flutterknight> According to the dA linked on her profile on youtube, she's 16 now, but still. :3
[04:34:40] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> I loved them, actually :c
[04:34:43] <SilverLugia[NLR]> Parchment_Scroll[EoH]: If it's Female, if it's male I'll probably name it Tirek
[04:34:46] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Zeta's not here right now dawnseeker. :(
[04:34:47] <kingqueso> I'm not hating the song. The song was great. It's the genre in general I'm not a fan of.
[04:34:47] <Metal_Core_Pony> main thing i didn't like was the bass kicks. they could've been a lot more impactful
[04:34:54] <Tarabeat> it was a good song 
[04:34:55] <dawnseeker> dang nab it
[04:34:56] <Talguy21> Hate? You misread me, Forest. I admitted that it was a good song, but I personally don't think it ha replayability
[04:34:57] <Lightning> I live for the wubs
[04:34:58] <CitizenSmiley> It sounded great in my opinion :/
[04:35:06] <Flameheart_Kindle> The dubstep fit the song.

[04:35:33] <StrykerVylon> I agree with SyxString[EoH] here.

[04:35:55] <Hamtramck> gggg online fax thing did not appear to work
[04:36:03] <Talguy21> I might give this song another listen some time
[04:36:04] <Waveform> I like making use of silence.
[04:36:11] <Talguy21> But it'll take time
[04:36:11] <StandingLeaf> Well, I like dubstep sometime. Just not all of them.
[04:36:18] <HaviocDarkmoon> SliverLugia[NLR] probly should promote channel 
[04:36:20] <Penny> silence is sometimes more expressive than sound
[04:36:33] <wobniaR> 11/10 better than bangarang
[04:36:40] <DemonWolf_Mobile> Did you know in North Carolina it's illegal to sing off-key.
[04:36:50] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> I don't like dubstep neither, but as long as its a good dubstep, then its well-executed
[04:36:54] <dawnseeker> so syx how is your pony pillow doing
[04:37:01] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> And to me, its a well-executed dubstep

[04:55:38] <dawnseeker> oh

[04:59:56] <Waveform> Drum compression is good. But you don't want to smash them so much that they sound trashy.
[05:00:00] <theonegalen> on which song?
[05:00:07] <Waveform> Also, Parallel Compression is your best friend.

[23:58:41] <keekle> hi all
[23:58:49] <MikeM> Howdy
[23:58:53] <WildSoft> so yes, a little irritated they want money to edit that footage, then they release it for free. Also it is 12 episodes with the shortest being under 2 min and the longest around 20. Total playtime of 1:21
[23:58:57] <StrykerVylon> Afternoon keekle
[23:58:58] <Eywind> hey keekle
[23:59:08] <Eywind> WildSoft Understandable
[23:59:33] <WildSoft> also they got way more than they needed for both documentarys, and the unreleased tapes took them almost two years to edit
[23:59:55] *** snitch567 is now known as snitchAsleep
