[20:54:03] <Unixkitty> So... judging by some service people's words, apparently something like this can't be fixed http://i.unixkitty.net/04105215258.jpg

[20:55:45] <RandomNinja> the wrench hitting only works with an engineering degree
[20:55:51] <keekle> ouch, what electronics is that?
[20:56:19] <Unixkitty> Well I'm certainly not that much of a hardware expert, and I don't particularly specialize in anything of the sort

[20:57:53] <Unixkitty> Well like I said, I only kept hearing about how it can't be fixed from random service people
[20:58:04] <RandomNinja> Scootaloo, that's shouldn't really be a surprise though
[20:58:17] <keekle> they are probably right unless you can do a memory transplant into a new device
[20:58:22] <keekle> or are you just trying to make it work?
[20:58:35] <keekle> since obviously buying a new one is not saving you any money
