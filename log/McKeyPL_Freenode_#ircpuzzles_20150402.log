[14:49:00] <^j> everyone is busy working on the real levels :P
[14:50:20] <Cypi> or just stuck.
[14:50:38] <FireFly> Yeah, I'm quite stuck
[14:50:49] <^j> I hope nobody is still stuck here ):, I guess everyone stopped giving hints
[14:51:05] <_goeo> FireFly: on level 6?
[14:51:07] <FireFly> Hehe, this one ought to be easy enough
[14:51:11] <FireFly> _goeo: no, 8
[14:51:26] <_goeo> welp
[14:51:48] <_goeo> i am stuck on 6
[14:52:19] <^j> there were tons of great hints last night
[14:52:21] <FireFly> 6 is slightly evil but doable, just pay attention to the gist with tips
[14:52:24] <_goeo> will try writing a little script when i get home
[14:52:44] <_goeo> ^j: last night on what timezone
[14:52:49] <Cypi> Stuck on 2 :D
[14:53:16] <^j> last night my time zone!
[14:53:25] <FireFly> Cypi: the same for that one, the gist has a tip that would help you :P
[14:53:28] <^j> ok, in the last 12 hours
[14:53:40] <^j> basically it was confirmed that [REDACTED]
[14:54:12] <_goeo> oh yeah i know that
[14:54:24] <_goeo> i was assuming it anyway though
[14:54:24] <Cypi> Well, obviously, only the first 2 tips are helpful, since they were the only one at first, right? :p
[14:54:42] <^j> I was already assuming [REDACTED] too :P
[14:54:48] <_goeo> Cypi: where
[14:55:04] <_goeo> ^j: i can't find the key
[14:55:07] <Cypi> I meant, in the gist
[14:55:29] <FireFly> The third tip is quite useful
[14:57:18] <_goeo> the no porn one is allegedly
[14:57:22] <Cypi> Ah. For some reason I assumed something was not possible when it actually was. Well, thank you.
[14:57:25] <_goeo> made for level 5
[14:57:59] <^j> :P
[14:58:24] <^j> that tip probably isn't needed anymore, I think it was accidental that the clues led to porn >_>
[14:58:34] <^j> actually maybe it wasn't fixed so ok :P
[14:59:20] <FireFly> freenode^Wyano has a secret agenda, subtly advertising porn! (and Taylor Swift)
[14:59:25] <FireFly> (less subtly)
[14:59:26] <_goeo> -3 to 5 was actually very easy for me
[14:59:42] <^j> this is level -2 actually
[14:59:54] <FireFly> Maybe there's a secret level -3 :P
[15:00:13] <^j> level -3 was the wallops that advertised this :P
[15:01:04] <FireFly> It's nice that people are civilised/rule-obiding enough to not need to moderate the channels this time
[15:01:24] <_goeo> oh
[15:01:33] <_goeo> i thought this was -3
[15:02:03] <^j> I think last year someone accidentally did /join without the / and gave away the next level to everyone
[15:03:28] <_goeo> i nearly did it with \ once thanks to ios keyboard

[15:26:52] <Latin> =\
[15:27:10] <_goeo> well I was guessing it'd be that
[15:27:25] <_goeo> ..but I did, have, some other guesses
[15:27:43] <Latin> same here
[15:27:47] <Latin> over thinking it to the max.
[15:27:51] <klg> well, but did it actually help anyone?
[15:28:24] <klg> it just reduced the potential search space to what was deemed the most probable anyway
[15:28:55] <Latin> I'm sure it helped a many.
[15:30:20] <mniip> [16:26:19] <Latin> yano finally flipped and gave away the cipher

[15:31:40] <Cypi> Being late is bad, a lot of missing hints :/
[15:31:59] <Arch-TK> Cypi: only one hint was removed
[15:32:05] <klg> huh? you get more hints with time
[15:32:07] <Arch-TK> And when you get to that channel you will be informed.
[15:32:18] <Arch-TK> any hints given by yano are generally named
[15:32:30] <Cypi> klg : discussions in the channel might be hints, even vague
[15:32:50] <klg> oh, this kind of hints
[15:33:12] <Latin> mniip: =(
[15:33:21] <Latin> not everyone knew what is was ;p
[15:33:32] <klg> but everyone suspected that
[15:33:50] <Latin> well, a solid conclusion can help you focus directly on the task at hand
[15:33:50] <klg> (Especially since you can rule out several other possibilities from previous editions)
[15:33:57] <Latin> true.
[15:34:44] <klg> I mesn you could even before he dropped that hint; but yeah, anyway, now we can concentrate on this wihtout wondering if he made something tottaly new
[15:37:14] <Latin> exacto
[15:37:33] <FireFly> That wouldn't really be his style
