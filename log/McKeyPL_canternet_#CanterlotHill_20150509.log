[03:31:34] <Regulus> They lost.
[03:31:35] <RandomNinja> gg you lose
[03:31:39] <Regulus> Badly.
[03:31:58] <RandomNinja> deathwing is useful in like 1/20 of scenarios
[03:32:09] <Regulus> It's about knowing when to use him, and how to exploit him
[03:32:15] <Araxnus> Am I in Azeroth now?

[03:33:52] <RandomNinja> yeah
[03:34:03] <Araxnus> So I was close.
[03:34:06] <Regulus> Draw out instakills first, reduce your opponent's hand, bam
[03:34:09] <Regulus> Pain.
[03:34:26] <RandomNinja> the most likely scenario *Deathwing*... "I've got the FUN in my sight" *you lose the game

[03:34:52] <RandomNinja> pls
[03:35:09] <RandomNinja> how would you do that tho?
[03:35:21] <Araxnus> You are right. I just suck at card games :p
[03:35:25] <Regulus> That's my personal secret ;p
[03:35:31] <RandomNinja> I also do that :P

[03:35:33] <Kelazi5> I never really got into WoW or MMO stuff, I prefer my games with a bit more structure in them and less anarchy/open world
[03:35:34] <RandomNinja> I just like HS
[03:36:08] <Regulus> I don't use it often though
[03:36:22] <Regulus> I've got other combos I prefer 
[03:36:55] <RandomNinja> "Hey, get in here!"
[03:37:00] <Araxnus> There is a mount in WoW you get from Hearthstone. I am so bad I can't get it xD
[03:37:04] <Regulus> yeah
[03:37:27] <Regulus> I've got a pet name for that one, but it's definitely not PG lol
[03:37:28] <RandomNinja> Araxnus stop sucking
[03:37:43] <RandomNinja> Grim Patron is broken
[03:37:51] <Regulus> Hella
[03:38:02] <Regulus> But that's what makes it fun
[03:38:05] <BlackSentinel> hard countered by hellfire
[03:38:18] <Regulus> Kinda like Majordomo Executus + Kel'Thuzad 
[03:38:19] <RandomNinja> yeah but you still get 18 damage in before that
[03:38:41] <RandomNinja> at least, depending on scenaio
[03:38:54] <Regulus> Infinite heals to 8 hp
[03:38:56] <BlackSentinel> well its a 5 card combo
[03:39:50] <Regulus> Love my mech druid though
[03:39:57] <BlackSentinel> i made a shaman gimmick deck once
[03:40:00] <BlackSentinel> reincarnate + majordomo
[03:40:05] <BlackSentinel> multiple 8 damage fireball per turn
[03:40:11] <Regulus> lol, that works
[03:40:21] <RandomNinja> Warsong Commander +Grim Patron + hit something/Cruel Taskmaster + whirlwind/Deaths Bite + again = lolwin
[03:40:37] <Regulus> Sounds kinda like my mage deck
[03:40:54] <RandomNinja> needs more Ysera tho
[03:41:02] <RandomNinja> mostly because Ysera is fun
[03:41:14] <Regulus> Archmage Antonidas with Flamewaker works wonders
[03:41:37] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t RandomNinja
[03:41:38] <DinkyBot> RandomNinja : Dont remind me!
[03:41:41] <RandomNinja> Opponent plays Milhouse Manastorm -> Antonidas
[03:41:45] <Regulus> Nothing quite like fireball spam
[03:41:48] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Oh my, DinkyBot
[03:41:58] <Regulus> With Malygos support
[03:42:14] <RandomNinja> doesn't matter, you have unlimited fireballs
[03:42:18] <RandomNinja> for free
[03:42:28] <Regulus> True
[03:42:35] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Regulus
[03:42:36] <DinkyBot> Regulus: Been there done that BerryPunch
[03:42:38] <BlackSentinel> with thaurissan, malygos + fireball in same turn is more achievable
[03:42:47] <RandomNinja> also Malygod is an AoE support anyway
[03:42:50] <Regulus> Indeed
[03:43:17] <RandomNinja> cuz lol 6 damage fan of knives
[03:43:28] <Regulus> lol
[03:43:38] <RandomNinja> 11 damage fireball is less valuable
[03:43:50] <wobniaR> I want to say neeeeeeeeeerds but I play yugioh which is worse than hearthstone
[03:43:53] <Regulus> True, but it's still painful
[03:43:56] <RandomNinja> skrub
[03:43:58] <RandomNinja> yeah
[03:44:14] <Regulus> A 15 damage Pyroblast though is frightening 
[03:44:19] <Araxnus> Eywind plays Magic he is OUR nerd <3
[03:44:24] <RandomNinja> Malygos is very high on the Kill ASAP list
[03:44:30] <Regulus> Ya
[03:44:39] <Regulus> One great bullseye
[03:44:42] <RandomNinja> along with Ysera
[03:44:43] <BlackSentinel> so play ysera first
[03:44:49] <RandomNinja> Ysera is so good tho

[03:48:01] <DinkyBot> dont be scared ask, i only want to die by Kibbie. lol
[03:48:09] <RandomNinja> don't you pretty much have to be winning for that kind of board security anyway
[03:48:23] <Regulus> Not always
[03:48:26] <RandomNinja> like 5 mechs + taunt
[03:48:57] <Regulus> An annoy-o-tron or 2 with an arcane nullifier is a pretty solid wall
[03:49:08] <RandomNinja> ah, the annoyotron
[03:49:13] <Regulus> 3 mechs, including the head
[03:49:16] <Araxnus> Dying by Kibbie would not be bad, Death from gradient!
[03:49:16] <BlackSentinel> arcane nullfier not that good though
[03:49:24] <Regulus> So 2 taunts and a head
[03:49:29] <Regulus> Bam
[03:49:32] <RandomNinja> like a Sunwalker, except not worth using a Black Knight on
[03:50:00] <Regulus> They get the job done BlackSentinel
[03:50:23] <Regulus> Mostly they're there as a wall to synergize with the head
[03:50:24] <RandomNinja> good against weapon users, sub-par against the rest
[03:50:41] <RandomNinja> yeah I guess mech synergy
[03:50:57] * RandomNinja derivates Araxnus 
[03:51:06] <Araxnus> Gahhh. lol.
[03:52:12] <RandomNinja> but why would you pick arcane nullifier over spectral knight?
[03:52:35] <Regulus> Just for the added mechs
[03:52:39] <RandomNinja> true
[03:52:59] <Regulus> You need 2, the more youve got to spam, the better your odds
[03:53:00] <RandomNinja> I get the impressoin that mechs are slightly OP
[03:53:11] <Regulus> If done right, yes
[03:53:31] <RandomNinja> like, old hunter-tier synergy
[03:53:33] <Regulus> They synergize well
[03:53:39] <BlackSentinel> its ok they will get their counters next expansion :P
[03:53:43] <RandomNinja> :P
[03:53:47] <RandomNinja> dragons?
[03:53:48] <Regulus> Probably 
[03:53:52] <Regulus> Nope lol
[03:53:57] <Regulus> They're broke
[03:54:04] <RandomNinja> good or bad broke?
[03:54:11] <Regulus> They're terrible to build a deck around
[03:54:15] <RandomNinja> haven't seen enough to judge
[03:54:19] <Eywind> which is why you have one? :P
[03:54:20] <RandomNinja> but as supplement
[03:54:28] <BlackSentinel> the good dragon decks hardly have many dragons
[03:54:31] <Regulus> Too high cost, not enough taunts
[03:54:34] <RandomNinja> like zoo+5-10 dragon
[03:54:48] <Regulus> The BRM cards are decent supplements 
[03:55:22] <Regulus> Flamewaker is useful as is the Fireguard Destroyer and Imp Gang Boss
[03:55:46] <RandomNinja> blackwing technician is pretty good if you hold dragons
[03:55:47] <Regulus> Some of the dragonkin are useful if used right
[03:55:57] <RandomNinja> 3/5 for 3
[03:56:14] <RandomNinja> and yeah Imp gang boss seems really solid
[03:56:31] <Regulus> The sorcer is great in decks where the focus is building up cards with spells
[03:56:37] <RandomNinja> like 2/4 + 1/1 at minimum is really good
[03:56:46] <BlackSentinel> ya
[03:56:49] <RandomNinja> sorcer?
[03:56:51] <Regulus> It's great for a warlock
[03:57:06] <Regulus> Dragonkin Sorcerer 
[03:57:17] <BlackSentinel> that is actually not that good
[03:57:26] <BlackSentinel> unless you play lots of spare parts
[03:57:30] <RandomNinja> dat flavor text
[03:57:51] <RandomNinja> 'Dragonkin Sorcerers be all "I'm a wizard" and everyone else be all "daaaaang".'
[03:57:56] <Regulus> Well, it's a nice buff, especially in druid decks
[03:58:30] <BlackSentinel> the +1/1 is quite underwhelming compare to whatever you are using to buff him
[03:58:38] <Regulus> Apart from that, building a dragon focused deck ends pretty poorly.
[03:58:44] <RandomNinja> also speaking of flavor texts, Druid of the Fang
[03:58:51] <RandomNinja> "The Druids of the Fang live in the Wailing Caverns. They wear cool snake shirts and tell snake jokes and say "bro" a lot."
[03:58:59] <RandomNinja> confirmed Tunnel Snakes
[03:59:38] <Regulus> Hogger's cracks me up
[04:00:41] <RandomNinja> that's canon though
[04:00:59] <RandomNinja> if you've played WoW as alliance you'll know about Hogger
[04:01:38] <Regulus> Point is, referencing a Chuck Norris joke makes it.
[04:01:52] <RandomNinja> they need to make a Ganon card
[04:01:59] <RandomNinja> yeah pretty much
[04:02:11] <RandomNinja> but Hogger is pretty legendary

[04:55:38] <Sunset_Shimmer> StrykerVylon: Trixie said you wanted Raxy. She she got Sunny Set Shimma!
[04:55:53] <StrykerVylon> Im okay with that. :P
[04:56:00] <Sunset_Shimmer> No. Master Ball only
[04:56:09] <StrykerVylon> Okay. :P
[04:56:22] <Regulus> Impossibru 
[04:56:36] <Regulus> A pokeball is just as good
[04:57:06] <Sunset_Shimmer> Is it. Maybe is nowadays. Not in the 90s

[04:57:16] <Regulus> Even then
[04:57:23] <StrykerVylon> Actuall.
[04:57:46] <Regulus> I don't think they've ever changed the formula for capture rate significantly 
[04:58:04] <StrykerVylon> in R/G/B/R/B/Y the Masterball had a 1 in like 250 chance of failing. Or something like that.
[04:58:04] <Regulus> Apart from modifying status condition modifiers
[04:58:05] <Sunset_Shimmer> Prolly not.
[04:58:13] <Sombra> That would suck.
