[03:25:27] <Talguy21> I almost covered this song, but Sights Unseen decided my vocals sucked and used his own instead xD
[03:25:37] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> SteelChords, that particular Infinite is from his XSplit or OBS and not the episode itself.
[03:25:58] <SteelChords> Parchment_Scroll[EoH], yeah, which feeds the Infinavi joke that much more xP

[03:30:53] <Teku_Jer> as do I Talguy, along with Forest Rain and Infinite Pony and Forest was my first Brony Musician after Winter Moose
[03:31:09] <Infinitepony[EoH]> the thing is though, it that the fic isn't really that grimdark
[03:31:15] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> I like that in the author notes of Rainbow Factory, the author has acknowledged the fan nickname for the factory's device:  The Super Speedy Filly Squeezy 6000
[03:31:15] <Scooblee> he wrote along with H8Seed, don't forget that guy
[03:31:27] <StandingLeaf> Pretend?
[03:31:33] <Talguy21> It's still too grimdark for my taste, Infinite
[03:31:44] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Scooblee, "Awoken" is a hecka awesome song.
[03:31:45] <Talguy21> And being a rabid Dash fan
[03:31:48] <SyxString[EoH]> 3spooky5me
[03:31:50] <SteelChords> Rainbow Factory focused more on the grimdark, and Pegasus Device focused much more on the story and the characters

[03:41:49] <Flurshy> oh that's not new
[03:41:53] <Obsidian-Rose> Was gonna buy it.
[03:41:55] <TipsyBOT> Pokemon Shuffle
[03:41:57] <Obsidian-Rose> Forgot too
[03:42:07] <StandingLeaf> What Forest did with the music for Kiki and what hapenned in my project is two very different things on how it was done. 
[03:42:12] <Talguy21> Bleh. Pokemon Bejeweled
[03:42:16] <Talguy21> No thanks
[03:42:34] <Flurshy> omg they should have made it for phone then
[03:42:38] <Obsidian-Rose> But it's in 3D!

[03:42:40] <Scooblee> The whole thing of coming into and breaking out into the music part of the fandom seems like a huge part of luck
[03:42:57] <Talguy21> But I don't like the core gameplay!
[03:43:03] <StrykerVylon> I have Alpha Sapphire. Much better game imo.

[03:45:13] <Talguy21> Bleh. Wanna friend code me, Stryker?

[03:50:30] <SteelChords> They're all complaining about it and they continue to sing it anyway lol
[03:50:36] <Obsidian-Rose> StrykerVylon: Agreeing to something else. I'm from Ontario.

[03:50:39] <Snowblitz[EoH]> My ears...
[03:50:44] <Obsidian-Rose> Do the whole thing!
[03:50:49] <StrykerVylon> Ah.
[03:50:49] <StrykerVylon> Okay. :)
[03:51:00] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> The slightest communication latency in online communication makes it impossible to synchronize.
[03:51:04] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Ergo horrible tempo.
[03:51:09] <Obsidian-Rose> That sucks
[03:51:18] <SteelChords> Ergo, skype sucks
[03:51:21] <Scooblee> just sing half a beat early
[03:51:22] <Scooblee> hah

[03:52:20] <Infinitepony[EoH]> this is a rare moment folks
[03:52:21] <Obsidian-Rose> Aye, I remember that.
[03:52:27] <Teku_Jer> that was a good song, Standing

[03:56:00] <SteelChords> I've always thought of remixes and covers to be completely different things. Remixes i always thought to be a completely different song with the same lyrics and/or vocals, whereas I always saw a cover as trying to be different than the original but still relatively similar.
[03:56:04] <Scooblee> "How would you start a cover?" Ugh, I have no definite answer to this
[03:56:10] <Scooblee> it's different every time

[03:57:43] <StandingLeaf> But remixes could also be with instruments been sampled to put elsewhere or modified.

[13:19:37] *** chibi_away is now known as chibi_shou
[13:21:00] <CuriousHuman> Pretty good. I have been doing an unecessary amount of resaerch on a psychlogical phenomenon I discovered rcently.
[13:21:56] *** Joins: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-mjg.sl1.132.194.IP)
[13:23:33] <Jokerboxer> What sort of phenomenon?
[13:24:17] <CuriousHuman> I ended up researching tulpamancy.
[13:24:43] <CuriousHuman> Fascinating stuff actually.
[13:25:27] <Jokerboxer> Maybe you can explain this better than what I have been told.
[13:26:35] <CuriousHuman> How so? I did a ton of reading and have only discovered it yesterday. Than again, it is very literally the only thing I have been reading about... What do you know on the subject?
[13:28:15] <Jokerboxer> I have a couple of friends whom are Tulpas. It has something to do with having a physical avatar with a assign persona which can be switched with the person's own.
[13:30:15] <CuriousHuman> Sort of. The way I interpret it is that it is a more or less a second percieved sentience that is really the brain responding to its own concience. That's what I have gotten out of it. Or at least the gist of it.
[13:31:35] *** Joins: Mongoose (Goosie@ClosetGirlyMare)
[13:32:22] <Jokerboxer> That does make sense. Then, are you saying that Tulpas are more in tune with their concience than the rest of us by actually having a communication with their tulpas?

[13:33:31] *** Unikitty|Away is now known as Unixkitty
[13:33:53] *** Mongoosie|Away is now known as Mongoosie
[13:35:21] <CuriousHuman> Seems possible. They appear to be a complex product of the sub-concious, so its not out of the question.
[13:36:07] <CuriousHuman> I have read about some people having them and not knowing it until they began the practice.
[13:37:01] <Jokerboxer> But it does not lead to higher critical thinking. Is that correct?
[13:38:56] <CuriousHuman> It depends on what might be considered higher thinking. From what I know, the tulpa cannot know something tha you do not know alredy until it is sentient. But, being an entity themselves can give their own input on the actions of a host. So more or less you get a constant second opinion on descision making.
[13:40:03] <Jokerboxer> I see.
[13:41:02] <Jokerboxer> What I am trying to ask is about a tulpa's understanding of social norms.
[13:44:07] <CuriousHuman> I think that it would probably develop it'sown opinion based on experience upon becoming sentient. Consider that, for all intensive purposes, a tulpa is another human being. from much that I have read they actually nearly can be. I would assume that they would learn much in the same way that a regular person does with the exception of alredy having a bit of bias due to it being the product of a developed mind.

[13:55:43] <Unixkitty> Doesn't sound PG.
[13:56:30] <CuriousHuman> I agree. I only felt like some bachground info was needed.
[13:57:24] <RandomNinja> the drugs thing was hilarious though
[13:57:45] <RandomNinja> like "oops, accidentally legalized hard drugs for 2 days"
[13:57:55] <CuriousHuman> It's because of some kind of loophole about emergency legislation.
[14:01:53] <CuriousHuman> Still, a goofy situation to have stuck on an entire country.
[14:02:08] <RandomNinja> yeah
[14:02:17] <RandomNinja> probably won't have any real effect either
[14:03:27] <CuriousHuman> I know right? Maybe a few people overdosing and thats it. Even if its legal, I like to hope people are smart enought to not do drugs. Like all the arcades in the 80s said.
[14:04:19] <RandomNinja> the problem with 80's american sports was that winners more often than not did do drugs :P
[14:06:25] <CuriousHuman> Winners still do drugs! I love the delicious irony. But at least we still have Celebrities like Queen Latifah and Andy Samberg who are both funny and are pretty good youth role models.
[14:06:51] <CuriousHuman> I'd rather meet Queen Latifah than Lil Wayne any day.

[23:46:09] <MikeM> What if the elements didn't pick "perfect", but picked "good enough for now"?
[23:46:40] <One-Trick> !dice 1d20

[23:47:21] <Inucroft[NLR]> ^
[23:47:34] <RandomNinja> yeah pretty much
[23:47:46] <RandomNinja> but with toast
[23:48:14] <Inucroft[NLR]> butter is simular ta jam
[23:48:25] <ToothBrush> Now I know it was mostly Snips and Snails fault but is it possible Twilight was being a bully when Trixie first appeared.
[23:48:43] <RandomNinja> unpossible
[23:48:47] <One-Trick> Mike_Coltfield: http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/11/bbc-jeremy-clarkson-suspension-top-gear
[23:48:49] <Inucroft[NLR]> ToothBrush, i feel your reading too deeply into a show with continuity issues
[23:49:09] <ToothBrush> I mean yes Trixie lied and said she defeated the Ursa Major but if you think about it..does humiliating someone in public really do any better?
[23:49:22] <wobniaR> Most forms of literature will encounter continuity errors eventually
[23:49:34] <Toothpaste> Uh oh
[23:49:45] <wobniaR> But yeah you're thinking too hard about it
[23:49:48] *** Cloud_Zephyr is now known as Cloud_Zephyr|Away
[23:49:56] <RandomNinja> she was being a massive jerk at the start though
[23:50:00] <Inucroft[NLR]> ^
[23:50:06] <ToothBrush> Im just flushing my ideas that have been compiling since the show began.
[23:50:08] * Toothpaste keeps a sharp eye out for nasty little continuity errors .3.
[23:50:21] * wobniaR slaps Toothpaste with sportsball
[23:50:22] <ToothBrush> I mean its clear as day that she's insecure.
[23:50:33] * RandomNinja smoothens Toothpaste's sharp eye
[23:50:42] <wobniaR> There's no deep insecurity problems, she's just a dumb horse
[23:50:49] *** Cloud_Zephyr|Away is now known as Cloud_Zephyr
[23:51:02] <Cloud_Zephyr> no one has responded to my tweet yer
[23:51:03] <Cloud_Zephyr> yet
[23:51:03] <wobniaR> That was goaded into revealing how much of a liar she was
[23:51:04] <RandomNinja> don't let Araxnus catch you saying that :P
[23:51:06] <ToothBrush> But you'd think Twilight would atleast help harness the magic instead of again embarassing her in public.
[23:51:21] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja the truth is painful. 
[23:51:24] <wobniaR> Twilight did what the writers told her to
[23:51:27] <Toothpaste> My eyes hurt.
[23:51:27] <Inucroft[NLR]> ^
[23:51:37] *** Unixkitty is now known as Sleepykitty
[23:51:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> maybe you need more than an outrageous tweet to get trending then :P
[23:51:46] <Inucroft[NLR]> yes MLp is actualy a TV show filmed in Equestria. And we';re watching the transmision
[23:51:47] <RandomNinja> darn those dastardly writers
[23:52:37] <ToothBrush> Can people stop telling me its a show and the writers are responsible..yes thats all very true but i'm trying to get my observations out.
[23:52:56] <RandomNinja> what actually happened was twilight quit mid-recording of the season 3 finale and the only good replacement they could find on short notice was a pegasus
[23:53:17] <wobniaR> Your observations have been discussed to death already, we're quite metaphorically beating a dead horse
[23:53:17] <Twilightlicious> hillarity.
[23:53:21] <ToothBrush> Typically speaking..yes Trixie is insecure..she uses slight of the hoof magic..aka real life magic.

[23:53:47] <RandomNinja> I'm making hamburgers wobniaR, I'm litteraly beating a dead horse
[23:53:49] <ToothBrush> But the question is was Twilight in the wrong for calling Trixie's bluff and humilating her.
[23:53:53] <RandomNinja> with a meat mallet
[23:54:07] <MikeM> Where did you get horse meat?
[23:54:08] <wobniaR> Horse meat? Blasphemy
[23:54:13] <RandomNinja> it's not hard to get
[23:54:28] <Twilightlicious> Unicorn meat, now thats the hard to find stuff.
[23:54:34] <RandomNinja> most large grocery stores carry to some extent
[23:55:03] <wobniaR> Not here

[23:55:26] <Twilightlicious> You can get it on Amazon, RandomNinja :P
[23:55:33] <ToothBrush> Is it likely a barracks for the Wonderbolts reserve or is it her house all together?
[23:55:37] <RandomNinja> get what?
[23:55:43] <MikeM> Unicorn meat
[23:55:48] <Twilightlicious> ^
[23:55:49] <RandomNinja> yeah I know that
[23:55:59] <ToothBrush> The only ones really well to do are Rarity and Twilight..for obvious reasons.
[23:56:00] <Twilightlicious> the unicorn meat you linked
[23:56:10] <Twilightlicious> is a real product on Amazon

[23:56:36] <wobniaR> Cause it's made of clouds and rainbows
[23:56:38] <RandomNinja> right?
[23:56:50] <ToothBrush> Yes but that would pay i'm guessing an average salary.
[23:56:50] <wobniaR> And floating in the sky, defying all laws of science
[23:57:15] <ToothBrush> Its not likely she's leading a team or controlling the weather.
[23:57:18] <MikeM> psh...science
[23:57:23] <RandomNinja> maybe
[23:57:40] <RandomNinja> cloudsdale property could also be really cheap
[23:57:44] <RandomNinja> you know, because clouds
[23:58:21] <ToothBrush> I'm curious on whom is poorer..Flutters or AJ.
[23:58:43] <wobniaR> They make enough to live because cartoon rules
[23:58:44] <ToothBrush> Fluttershy basically looks after every animal in the everfree and beyond.
[23:58:52] <thereallynewmop12100_> Inucroft[NLR]: Go to bread
[23:58:55] <ToothBrush> AJ bucks apples but that's about it.
[23:59:04] <RandomNinja> but a farm though
[23:59:19] <ToothBrush> Have you seen an average farms profits?
[23:59:19] <RandomNinja> lots of land and property
[23:59:22] <RandomNinja> nope
[23:59:34] <ToothBrush> They make decent but not great pay.
