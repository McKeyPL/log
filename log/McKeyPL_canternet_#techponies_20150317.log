[02:30:29] <Blackjack> Guys, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I finally figured out how 240v power in America works
[02:30:48] <Blackjack> You have 2 hots, I used to think they were both 120v in the same phase so they're useless for getting 240 somehow
[02:30:54] <Blackjack> but one of them is half out of phase with the other
[02:31:07] <Blackjack> So while one is +120, the other is -120, for a total potential of 240 between them
[02:31:09] <Blackjack> am I right?
[02:32:13] <Phase4> if they're 180° out of phase, there will be 240v rms between them
[02:32:42] <Blackjack> So I'm right
[02:34:06] <Webster> Yeah.
[02:34:11] <Webster> It's called split-phase power.
[02:35:28] <Blackjack> Yay
[02:35:32] <Blackjack> I finally figured it out

[02:58:11] * Blackjack noms
[03:00:16] <Brolf_pog> now that you know this Blackjack, more power to ya!
[03:01:21] <Neptune> razer synapse is a massive pile of shit
[03:01:36] <Blackjack> Now the other question is
[03:01:55] <Blackjack> Why is everybody so scared of "mixing electricity and water" when they have no clue what they're talking about
[03:02:09] <Blackjack> They act like the entire universe is going to explode if you run a little AC through a little water
[03:02:26] <Brolf_pog> it's not electricity mixed with water
[03:02:31] <Brolf_pog> because there is always that
[03:03:01] <Brolf_pog> no it has to do with waters ability to increase conductivity, mixed with exposure to electricity
[03:03:30] <Brolf_pog> must machines are made to have the whole thing being supplied electricity,
[03:04:11] <Brolf_pog> aren't*
[03:04:38] <Blackjack> Well, yes, but if I make a specific project designed to have 120V AC running through water, I guarantee everyone will freak out about how I'm going to die just by being in the same room as it
[03:05:12] <Brolf_pog> just don't stick your hand in it
[03:05:14] <Brolf_pog> or near it..
[03:05:21] <Brolf_pog> without proper precautions
[03:05:29] <Brolf_pog> which i have no fucking idea what those are
[03:06:03] <Blackjack> Well yeah
[03:07:31] <Blackjack> I've seen in a few places the idea of taking a (lidded) container of water mixed with some sort of agent to increase conductivity, and using a pair of electrodes placed in the water (one stationary and one variable) as a way to control/limit current without buying something like a variac
[03:15:33] <Brolf_pog> by the way, to answer your question
[03:16:08] <Brolf_pog> most people are scared due to lack of education on the subject. Most people are just warned against it, not told the specifics. I barely know the specifics... if at all
[03:16:19] <Blackjack> I know the specifics
[03:16:57] <Blackjack> The specifics are "don't do anything with electricity-conducting liquid that you wouldn't do with bare, live wires"
[03:17:26] <Brolf_pog> that would be the simplest way to put it actually

[03:20:55] <Googie> It's also more difficult to contain liquids than it is to contain solids :P
[03:21:08] <Blackjack> Well, yeah
[03:21:19] <Googie> (Also, why would you want to run high voltage through a liquid anyway, the resistance would be way way higher)
[03:22:00] <Blackjack> But a well-sealed, both watertight so the liquid doesn't get out and mechanically so that the lid doesn't come off or something like that and so that you can't shove your hand in, container of water conducting power poses no risk
[03:22:10] <Blackjack> Googie, because the point is for high resistance
[03:22:18] <Blackjack> See above, using it like a variac

[03:27:04] <Googie> The only really thing is that it is inherently less safe than using solids because of the increased containment requirements. A single leak would cause a lot more problems. It's a science fair project.
[03:27:21] <Kiyiko> I feel like building a router, but I can't decide if I want an ALIX form factor, or a NAS form factor
[03:32:01] <Blackjack> Googie: Which is why you don't let it leak :P
[03:33:16] <Blackjack> Even if it did manage to somehow leak, it wouldn't be a huge issue. You'd have water on the floor and the thing would stop working
