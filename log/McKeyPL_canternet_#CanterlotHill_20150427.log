[07:19:34] <DJMidli> refresh my memory?
[07:20:06] <Hickory> There was a quick video of twilight sparkle, in the human world studying, wondering what was happening.  IE, the movie was over and twilight sparkle had already gone through the portal, but after the credits rolled it showed that there WAS already a version of twilight in the human world.
[07:20:30] <DJMidli> Oh yeah
[07:20:31] <DJMidli> mmmm

[17:07:14] <RandomNinja> dinky pls Avengers was good
[17:07:26] <RandomNinja> git Ultron hype
[17:07:31] <BerryPunch> So good. And I'm super hype about Ultron
[17:07:52] <BerryPunch> Can't wait for Agents of SHIELD  this week. Then I'll probably see Ultron on Saturday
[17:08:00] <RandomNinja> especially considering the movies just keep getting better
[17:08:02] <Unixkitty> Rather bored actually, LunaticHell... somewhat anxious, but also excited to get back to work tomorrow hopefully
[17:08:21] <LunaticHell> Do you want to play Starbound?
[17:08:21] <Unixkitty> BerryPunch, yes. Agents.
[17:08:30] <BerryPunch> Yeah ... what I really like is the ads seem to be getting more understated, and then the movies just rock
[17:08:36] * Cloud_Zephyr sadly consumes instant coffee as he has no alternative
[17:08:46] <RandomNinja> Thor, Cap: pretty good. Not really great. Winter Soldier: Great. The Dark World: Amazingsauce
[17:08:51] <Unixkitty> I absolutely love that show... and managed to put my dad on it as well
[17:09:42] <BerryPunch> Like Winter Soldier just looked dumb to me from trailers. I caught up on Agents of SHIELD due to them hyping the crossover then saw the movie and like .... it's probably my favorite of all the Marvel movies outside of Avengers
[17:09:53] <Unixkitty> And thanks for the invite LunaticHell, but not really I'm afraid
[17:09:58] <BerryPunch> Yeah. SHIELD is fantastic
[17:10:23] <RandomNinja> it's really good, I'd put The Dark World and one or two Iron Man movies above it though
[17:10:30] <LunaticHell> No need to be afraid, that's cool with me.
[17:10:55] <LunaticHell> Oh yeah, are there new Agents of Shield episode out?
[17:11:11] <BerryPunch> Yes there are
[17:11:14] <Unixkitty> Every Tuesday I believe, so far there are 18 out in the second season.

[17:12:33] <LunaticHell> Ultron was build by Tony Stark, he can't be not awesome.

[17:12:56] <Unixkitty> I don't even know what an Ultron is
[17:13:05] <LunaticHell> ...oh...kay o. ô
[17:13:42] <RandomNinja> Ultron is an AI
[17:13:48] <LunaticHell> Unixkitty: Ultron actually once was a robot-buddy build by Howard Stark as present for Tony Stark to play with, the robot got evil and now tries to overthrow humanity.
[17:14:17] <LunaticHell> According to the comic...
[17:14:38] <Unixkitty> Oh, okay
[17:15:12] <RandomNinja> how big is the Ultron arc?
[17:15:30] <Trildar> Ultron kinda confused me. Too much mind nonsense.

[17:16:37] <FruitNibbler> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_%28robot%29
[17:17:02] <LunaticHell> RandomNinja: Ultron arc is rather big-ish, but also split up.
[17:17:30] <RandomNinja> compared to Civil War?
[17:17:31] <LunaticHell> Ultron is kinda of a reaccuring big bad, one time he actually got his hands on all of the infinity stones.
[17:17:44] <RandomNinja> ah
[17:18:36] <RandomNinja> also we need Blackest Night movie arc
[17:18:36] <LunaticHell> He is on a level with Thanos, as Ultron or better said the Robot he uses as main body was used to defeat Thanos by Ironman.
[17:18:47] <LunaticHell> That'd be a two parter.
[17:19:01] <RandomNinja> Blackest Night/Brightest Day?
[17:19:10] <LunaticHell> Exactly.
[17:19:31] <RandomNinja> I feel like Blackest Night is abit huge for one movie though
[17:19:35] <RandomNinja> then again, Civil War
[17:20:00] <LunaticHell> There's also the New 52 to be considered.
[17:20:08] <Trildar> Also, when I watched Ultron there were mad amounts of motion blur. Good thing I got to watch it twice. :P
[17:20:25] <Trildar> The other time was fine.
[17:20:29] <LunaticHell> For Marvel, there is the Illuminati (no really), the recent world ending events and more.
