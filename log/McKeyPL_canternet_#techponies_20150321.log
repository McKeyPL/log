[05:57:04] <Colgate> /shrug
[05:58:19] <CompuDesktop> Colgate: the issue happens when i start quassel on windows and it starts auto connecting to the servers i was connected to when i last quit, the error only happens on freenode and i can only get around it by disconnecting from freenode before quassel gets a chance to start connecting (Sometimes theres some lag between when quassel says its connecting and when it actually connects), then i have to connect to some of the other networks i connect to, 
[05:58:19] <CompuDesktop> wait a minute or so and then connect to freenode
[05:58:34] <CompuDesktop> Colgate: can u tell me if its an issue with freenode or an issue with quassel?
[05:58:59] <Colgate> quassel
[05:59:04] <Colgate> works for me
[06:00:05] <CompuDesktop> ok
[06:06:25] <CompuDesktop> well i disabled ssl on freenode for now
[06:06:37] <CompuDesktop> Colgate: any idea why only freenode gives such an error?
[06:06:48] <Colgate> no
