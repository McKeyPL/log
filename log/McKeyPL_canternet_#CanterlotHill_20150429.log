[04:14:35] <TheTaZe> Isn't Dr. Wolf some brony analyzer or something?

[04:14:40] <Eywind> It's an analysis youtuber
[04:14:53] <PowerPlay> And part psychiatrist, apparently.
[04:14:59] <Eywind> eh
[04:15:18] <dawnseeker> actually he isn't a therepist in real life
[04:15:22] <StandingLeaf> It,s a psychologist. And only a self-taught one
[04:15:55] <Eywind> Analysis is a very polarizing aspect of the fandom

[04:17:51] <dawnseeker> sorry he actually inspired me to be more empathetic

[04:29:17] <dawnseeker> thank you that question has been nagging at me for reasons unown for quite some time
[04:29:57] <StandingLeaf> dawnseeker One has to use a "filter" to first translate from a foreign language to your native language. people skilled at another language do that very quickly and efficiently
[04:30:16] <Eywind> That's why learning language early is so powerful
[04:30:20] <dawnseeker> and i knew someone who's native language isn't english would be able to answer
[04:30:26] <Eywind> if you get the language down while your brain is still developing the translation aspect is more naturla

[05:26:25] <PowerPlay> Apparently... something about a new version of their data storage that's incompatible with many mobile devices.

[05:27:29] <PowerPlay> Thing is, I was supposed to see imploding YouTube a little more than a week ago..
[05:28:16] <ThunderPie> ugh i tried to send a message at first saying "Hi :D" and it told me i can't send a message containing more than 60% capital letters if its longer than 5 characters.. Ugh
[05:28:51] <PowerPlay> But... that's only 40-50% capitl letters...
[05:28:52] <keekle> i guess : is considered a capital letter
[05:29:14] <PowerPlay> :::::
[05:29:39] <PowerPlay> Nope. Would have blocked that one.
[05:29:46] <keekle> good point
[05:29:54] <DJMidli> strange
[05:29:56] <keekle> maybe he capitalized another letter we didnt see
[05:30:04] <keekle> someone else try
[05:30:13] <DJMidli> Hi :D
[05:30:14] <DJMidli> oh wait

[05:34:28] <PowerPlay> Yes it is.
[05:34:55] <Muffin_Spectacles> So, did anyone ever confirm whose idea it was for the three 'flower ponies' in the first episodes?
[05:35:06] <Eywind> ?
[05:35:16] <PowerPlay> ?
[05:35:17] <Muffin_Spectacles> DAisy, Lily, and Rose.
[05:35:35] <Muffin_Spectacles> They were a fixture maybe in the first 1 1/2 seasons, and then just got hauled to the back of the line.
[05:36:03] <PowerPlay> It was a show specifically marketed towards little girls during Season 1. That is the most likely reason.
[05:36:19] <Eywind> wat they're still around
[05:36:24] <Muffin_Spectacles> My guess is once the fandom embraced some of the other background ponies, they went the way of Shermy and Patty in the Peanuts comics (Shermy and Patty pretty much lost ground to newer characters as te Peanuts comics went on)
[05:36:27] <Eywind> less stuff is occurring in ponyville
[05:36:53] <wobniaR> You're not gonna see the same background ponies every episode
[05:37:02] <Eywind> They're more for the 'THE HORROR THE HORROR' situation
[05:37:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: Yeah, but it felt like even in the supporting areas, they fel by the wayside. I gues I liked Daisy's lime-green flounce to her hair.

[05:39:46] <ThunderPie> trying to do a MLP pic edit of Apple bloom :3
[05:39:46] * Eywind coughs
[05:39:56] <wobniaR> If that wasn't said a million times already I'd warn you for spoilers
[05:40:02] <Muffin_Spectacles> So, i take it there's some kind of Derp-watch for every episode? "aand, no Derpy this time. Hasbro...when will you learn? The Bronies are helping your stock prices...so, you OWE us more than this!!"
[05:40:29] <Hamtramck> what if it's all background ponies nobody cared about or applejack
[05:40:35] <wobniaR> Hasbro doesn't put Derpy in the background
[05:40:52] <wobniaR> It's DHX's outsourced animation studio that does, and she's rarely ever specifically written into an episode
[05:40:53] <Muffin_Spectacles> wobniaR: I was pretending I was one of those non-sensical, illogical, nutcases.
[05:41:52] <wobniaR> Yes there is a Derpy watch though
[05:42:03] <wobniaR> Someone will shout DERPY if she appears on screen for even half a second
[05:42:27] <Muffin_Spectacles> wobniaR: So like those people that go, 'uh-oh, cupcakes' whenever Pinkie gets upset. :[
[05:42:42] <wobniaR> Yes but you just set off like 5 ping alarms with that
[05:42:51] <Eywind> -_-
[05:43:14] <Eywind> glad I don't have sounds on anymore
[05:43:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> wobniaR: But I didn't, capitalize. :D
[05:43:19] <Eywind> still pings us
[05:43:26] <Muffin_Spectacles> Ah, I don't have my sound on.

[05:43:32] <Eywind> oh wow I have no highlights on
[05:43:38] <Eywind> must have wiped it when I updated mirc
[05:45:46] <Muffin_Spectacles> So, is it true Shining and Cadance are now at HT?
[05:46:10] <wobniaR> Yep go buy 15 or so of them
[05:46:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> I'm probably going to wait until mid-May before I go out and get em...just in case Spike isn't out yet, and that way I can all three.
[05:46:20] <Eywind> wobniaR are you gonna buy a spike?
[05:46:26] <wobniaR> Yes but he's not out yet
[05:46:27] <Eywind> so you can have OTP
[05:46:45] <wobniaR> No idea when they plan on releasing him
[05:46:55] <Hennet303> Eywind you better be talking Sparity because thats the OTP needed

[05:49:28] <ThunderPie> I love the brony community :)
[05:49:36] <Eywind> I would but his canon last name is "The Dragon"
[05:49:46] <wobniaR> Mr. The Dragon

[05:51:11] <DJMidli> Muffin_Spectacles you mean the thing 4chan made up?
[05:51:29] <DJMidli> Derpy or "derp" never EVER was originally created to be aimed at mentally disabled people
[05:51:34] <Eywind> She is Backup Racer, Bubbly Mare, Equestrian Mailmare, and Weather Mare
[05:51:44] <DJMidli> I was around when derp became a thing.
[05:52:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> DJMidli: I don't ever mention that '4-thingy.' 
[05:52:17] <DJMidli> 4chan>
[05:52:18] <Eywind> It's probably still part of the chat filter anyways :P

[05:52:30] * Muffin_Spectacles didn't start watching the series until halfway through Season 2. As such, was not there for the 'revolution on the 4-site.'

[06:11:30] <Muffin_Spectacles> PowerPlay: I think it's largely because RD is always such a boastful and very 'I'm super-cool' in demeanor. I think also because Fluttershy just threw the book at her on 'reality.'
[06:11:59] <Eywind> I enjoyed it because it showed something that was only really in fanfics :P

[09:34:05] <RandomNinja> I see no point to consoles after PS2/Xbox generation beside one or two exclusives

[09:36:43] <Ali> Whoopie

[09:36:51] <Ali> I'll take my Smash
[09:37:05] <Seoson> Apart from first party titles
[09:37:10] <RandomNinja> but yeah nintendo doesn't count in the PC v Console thing since they target a completely different niche
[09:37:15] <Ali> Launch for a Nintendo system usually does suck
[09:37:24] <RandomNinja> all systems*
[09:37:29] <Ali> But Nintendo is 95% first party
[09:37:47] <RandomNinja> best version on Rayman Legends tho
[09:38:07] <Seoson> They are great yeah. Apart from Pokémon maybe that went crazy after the first few generations
[09:38:28] <Ali> Pokemon has dipped a bit, but there are still a lot of die hards for it
[09:38:38] <Seoson> I used to play smash on the GameCube with my step brother - that was fun
[09:38:48] <Ali> Smash U and 3DS are great

[11:24:17] <Unixkitty> Couldn't figure out the problem really, other than that my installation is likely corrupt now.

[11:25:15] <Unixkitty> It wasn't about ENB by the way, I managed to fix that one at least
[11:25:42] <Unixkitty> I do believe this could be something to do with the latest mod I'd installed, "Real Estate"

[15:12:56] * DinkyBot fusses and frowns, but hugs her momma and shakes her mane out when she finishes. "Mooommmaaa! Staaaahp! Hhehe!"
[15:13:30] <Flurshy> welp, the LG G4 and Galaxy S6 come out as a difficult choice
[15:13:42] <Flurshy> though the reasons for getting the samsung phone are fewer
[15:14:07] <RandomNinja> it was also apparently super slippery
[15:14:37] <Flurshy> G4 has a removable 3000mAh battery and from what I understand includes a spare in the box. removable storage too. camera supposedly matches the galaxy's cam for speed and customizability
[15:14:43] <RandomNinja> half the point of samsung was the SD slot anyway
[15:15:06] <Flurshy> I'll have to find a hands-on demo for the G4 and play around with it. if I can find a hands-on
[15:15:16] <Flurshy> well, the primary verizon store should have one
[15:15:17] <RandomNinja> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwa5iYOjU8
[15:15:42] <Flurshy> but it doesn't launch until really close to my upgrade date so demo will have to wait
[15:15:43] <RandomNinja> highly professional first impressions
[15:15:57] <Flurshy> definitely looks like I'll probably go for the G4 this time around though
[15:16:11] <RandomNinja> I would as well
[15:16:23] <RandomNinja> also no Touchwiz, not that I use stock anyway
[15:16:24] <Flurshy> I do like the default color screen
[15:17:03] <Flurshy> oooh I like that ceramic back
[15:17:29] <Flurshy> why hasn't the ceramic back gotten any attention? I didn't even know about it
[15:17:49] <ThunderBolt> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiO9_PJ0h8Q
[15:18:12] <RandomNinja> probably because the leather is sexier :P
[15:18:19] <Flurshy> I hate that seam
[15:18:24] <RandomNinja> yeah
[15:18:33] <Flurshy> plus it's going in a case anyway
[15:18:41] <Flurshy> preferably a waterproof case
[15:18:50] <RandomNinja> needs a pink version
[15:19:19] <Flurshy> I wish the white ceramic had white front bezels
[15:19:25] <Flurshy> that's something I like about the galaxy phones
[15:19:32] <Flurshy> but not a dealbreaker
[15:19:54] <Flurshy> nnf that camera...

[15:22:15] <Flurshy> mhm :P
[15:22:17] <RandomNinja> early impression
[15:22:26] <Flurshy> I like it MUCH better than the galaxy flagship so far
[15:22:40] <Flurshy> the UI looks more aesthetically pleasing as well

[22:38:33] <RandomNinja> dat aging
[22:39:05] <BerryPunch> Huh. Isn't it too low ABV and lacking too many other things to let it age well? 
[22:39:33] <RandomNinja> It's most likely regular Bud
[22:39:52] <Cloud_Zephyr> wut if revision is a myth? :O
[22:39:57] <RandomNinja> pls

[22:49:06] <RandomNinja> apparently dozens of PR people didn't
[22:49:35] <RandomNinja> or all the other bad implications
[22:49:58] <BerryPunch> Or the have PR people like me who comes up with an idea that is clearly awful, says we should do it, then the con chair says no and spoils all my fun
[22:50:45] <RandomNinja> also fire you
[22:51:31] <RandomNinja> in other alcohol related news, Schmaltz is making a "Session Double IPA", which is clearly a lie
[22:51:53] <BerryPunch> Session Double IPA ... ?
[22:52:13] <RandomNinja> because something that's 8% abv is totally a session drink
[22:52:34] <BerryPunch> I mean, it's a Starlight session drink
