[05:18:11] <Twilightlicious> someone asked one of the AMD Higherups what their plans were for later in 2015, and they started their sentence by saying "After windows 10 launches in late july,..."
[05:18:16] <AppleDash> xD
[05:19:11] <Twilightlicious> Microsoft will probably do their usual thing of pretending the date wasnt leaked.
[05:19:33] <Twilightlicious> or, they will announce it in the next couple days so that it will seem like they did it first.
