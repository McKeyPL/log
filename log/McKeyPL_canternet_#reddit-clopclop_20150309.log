[00:29:45] <OmarianVolcae> I typed "Does this question make any sense?"

[00:32:12] <ponder> Even something simple like the definite article. English just uses "the" in front of the words, while Icelandic almost exclusively attaches the definite article on the end of words
[00:32:33] <ponder> And then there are different definite articles depending on the gender of the word.

[04:13:44] <samonuh> And it was curved
[04:13:45] <Katiepony> Why is that?
[04:13:47] <OmarianVolcae> HAM radios can be exceptionally powerful, Katiepony.

[04:14:01] <RNGsus> Ham radios can talk to ISS right?
[04:14:08] <OmarianVolcae> Huh. I suppose so.
[04:14:17] <RubyPinch> "linea vertical" is meant to be marked as foreign, because I can't tell if "linea vertical" is something to do with tattoos or not

[04:14:22] <samonuh> lol
[04:14:22] <OmarianVolcae> I mean, a powerful radio can talk halfway around the world.
[04:14:35] <RNGsus> ISS talks to people on the ground, not sure what radios they used, i thought they were ham
[04:14:41] <RNGsus> And its aloha snackbar samonuh 
[04:14:42] <samonuh> You actually typed "Aloha"
[04:14:43] <RubyPinch> (except I can, because I can work out that "linea" means "line")
[04:14:44] <samonuh> lol
[04:15:02] <samonuh> I know :P
[04:15:07] <Vulpixbrew> yes In factI think the ISS operates a shortwave radio station and uses a couple of shortwave broadcasters to stream data back to NASA
[04:15:09] <samonuh> Thought you made a mistake
[04:15:56] <OmarianVolcae> We got told we weren't supposed to use HAM radios here, and one of our instructors, who was an operator and had a station set up for classes would monitor us.
[04:16:20] <OmarianVolcae> So we figured out we could talk to each other without tipping him off by relfecting our signal off the granite buildings at low power.
[04:16:29] <OmarianVolcae> He couldn't hear us in his tower, but we could hear each other.
