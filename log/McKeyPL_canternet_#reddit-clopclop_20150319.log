[08:02:44] <Squirrelly> right shoulder blade, towards the middle
[08:02:51] <Squirrelly> I have a huge knot there
[08:03:03] <Squirrelly> It's never been this bad though randomly
[08:03:09] <Melon_Phone> yeah it's a clammed nerve

[08:04:59] <iamalion> ive become a master at finding them and fixing them
[08:05:15] <Squirrelly> How do I fix it?
[08:05:26] <Squirrelly> I pushed at it with my fingers
[08:05:31] <Squirrelly> (I'm kinda flexible)
[08:05:31] <iamalion> not much you can do D: it has to be massaged
[08:05:42] <Squirrelly> Yeah I'm trying to do that
[08:05:44] <Melon_Phone> stretch
[08:05:49] <Squirrelly> That plus the advil seems to be helping a little
[08:05:56] <Squirrelly> Which stretch should I do?
[08:05:59] <iamalion> flexible hmm?
[08:06:05] <Squirrelly> Mmhmm
[08:06:10] <Squirrelly> I've always been super flexible

[08:06:37] <Squirrelly> Oh god
[08:06:45] <Squirrelly> I just massaged it as much as I could with my finger
[08:06:48] <Squirrelly> It feels so much better
[08:06:53] <iamalion> thats what she said
[08:07:06] <Squirrelly> I have a friend who walks on my back sometimes to help me with my back problems
[08:07:31] <Squirrelly> She's not strong enough to give a good backrub, I guess
[08:10:38] <Melon_Phone> bring the arm around in circles, starting at your hip and ending there too, 10 times counter- and clockwise. try to reach up as high as you can with each pass, keeping your palm flat and straight 
[08:11:18] <Melon_Phone> really any type of shoulder based movement plus painkillers is enough to loosen it up 
[08:12:06] <Squirrelly> Ohhhh thank you
[08:12:09] <Squirrelly> That helped so much
