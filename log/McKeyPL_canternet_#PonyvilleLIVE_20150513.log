[02:01:36] <PVL_8133> Cool. It was kinda frustrating
[02:01:45] <Dusk> Understandable
[02:02:23] <PVL_8133> Lol
[02:06:11] <PVL_8133> So... Has this bug happen before?
[02:06:26] <Dusk> We just shifted the server layout
[02:06:42] <Dusk> That's why it's broken
[02:07:14] <PVL_8133> Aye... So if I try to sign in It may work?

[02:27:49] <Dusk> No PHP isn't using the datable for its sessions for some reason
[02:29:09] <PVL_8133> Then that could be a problem for the ones who use the site instead the moblie
[02:31:33] <Dusk> It's fixed
[02:31:47] <Dusk> Why would it not apply to mobile?
[02:31:57] <Dusk> They use the same database
[02:32:35] <PVL_8133> Sorry I had too much coffee It's making my brain go nuts

[21:24:42] <JustKayneNL> care to explain :)
[21:24:43] <ArchPegasusMichael> So I dropped the school
[21:25:06] <ArchPegasusMichael> Long story
[21:25:17] <JustKayneNL> make it short
[21:26:08] <JustKayneNL> whas it financial?
[21:26:15] <ArchPegasusMichael> My English vocabulary may fail to handle it, so I won't risk :/
[21:26:27] <JustKayneNL> oh okay
[21:26:30] <JustKayneNL> no probs
[21:27:14] <JustKayneNL> but now you´re probably on your own can´t you start over?
[21:28:36] <ArchPegasusMichael> I'm not on my own yet, despite having money separated from home budget - all of it is govt social
[21:29:24] * JustKayneNL heart breaks
[21:29:47] <ArchPegasusMichael> I'm still not able to work before fixing my physical and mental health
[21:30:02] <JustKayneNL> why do things like this happen I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP!!!!
[21:30:38] <ArchPegasusMichael> I know that feel ;/
[21:32:15] <JustKayneNL> i hate it when i know that there are people who have this problem
[21:35:02] <ArchPegasusMichael> Lost a friend this Christmas, because of my toxic depression
[21:35:52] <ArchPegasusMichael> I became too annoying during the fall and he had to leave me
[21:35:57] <JustKayneNL> i'm starting to get really sad, it feels like my heart sank
[21:36:19] <JustKayneNL> what did he do then?
[21:37:27] <ArchPegasusMichael> I wasn't shutting up about my situation and suicidal thoughts
[21:38:10] <JustKayneNL> a true friend doens judge you about your sitiation and should be there to help you.
[21:38:25] <JustKayneNL> Clearly he was not a true friend then
[21:38:27] <ArchPegasusMichael> He was doing his best to show me the way out, and I didn't listen
[21:38:36] <JustKayneNL> Oh in that case
[21:39:02] <JustKayneNL> thats not a reason to leave a friend
[21:39:25] <ArchPegasusMichael> That was best for me and him
[21:40:25] <JustKayneNL> i wish i knew you
[21:40:40] <ArchPegasusMichael> He has his own life to deal with, and doesn't need to make it harder by dealing with person like me
[21:41:02] <JustKayneNL> why didn't you deall with each other?
[21:41:45] <JustKayneNL> you help him and vive versa
[21:42:48] <ArchPegasusMichael> I can't give advices half as good as his were
[21:43:14] <ArchPegasusMichael> and his life is completely different
[21:44:01] <JustKayneNL> iḿ currently also in a dillema
[21:44:56] <JustKayneNL> 2 friends one is lightly autistic  and the other has some kind of problem
[21:45:32] <JustKayneNL> i don't know what probably anger managment
[21:45:59] <JustKayneNL> but the two hate each other now and i´m not gonna pick sides
[21:46:30] <ArchPegasusMichael> :I
[21:47:07] <JustKayneNL> can you relate to this?
[21:49:16] <ArchPegasusMichael> Had similar moments, but not as serious
[21:49:43] <JustKayneNL> those were not my best friends for ver but they are my friends
[21:49:59] <ArchPegasusMichael> My brother manages to sometimes get my friends angry at him
[21:50:27] <JustKayneNL> wait whats your problem actualy
[21:50:39] <JustKayneNL> is it you parents or what?
[21:52:10] <ArchPegasusMichael> Um. I wish I'd be able to tell you all of that :I
[21:52:48] <JustKayneNL> is it the language barrier or is your connection being monitored
[21:52:50] <ArchPegasusMichael> But I'd need help someone who could translate from Polish ;D
[21:53:02] <JustKayneNL> aah polish
[21:54:01] <JustKayneNL> darn thats a problem :(
[21:55:49] <JustKayneNL> i wish i could speak polish then
