[04:55:01] <Eywind> Pretty much yes

[04:55:17] <Eywind> Wish I cared about glimmer and the tumblrville ponies a little more though

[04:58:12] <StrykerVylon> Not all SJW are like that. :P But I get what you mean.

[04:58:59] <Flurshy> marxists right?
[04:59:10] <Flurshy> communism is an economic system

[04:59:17] <Blue_wings> WOW what a great preimier though!
[04:59:33] <Eywind> Well they had the whole getting alloted one article/type of clothing a year
[04:59:37] <Eywind> so that was something
[04:59:45] <Hamtramck> Nnnnno?
[04:59:54] <Eywind> No what?
[05:00:00] <Flurshy> that's kinda because the resident clothes maker had no talent :P
[05:00:12] <Eywind> One sec
[05:00:19] <StrykerVylon> Communism looks good on paper. In practice? Well history speaks for itself.

[05:01:25] <Flurshy> I work during the next episode T.T
[05:02:01] <Flurshy> communism as a model for the economy doesn't work in its base state because no motivation is given for hard, honest work

[10:50:39] <chibi_cookie> Morning people
[10:58:32] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh yeah it is morning.
[11:00:11] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yeap 2015 is 20th anniversary of Pocket Monsters.
[11:00:26] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I was only in Kindergarten then.
[11:00:55] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> And it is still going strong.
[11:00:56] <Trildar> wut kind of nerd calls it "Pocket Monsters"?
[11:01:12] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Trildar: Japanese call it that.
[11:01:16] <Trildar> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Tokutoku tokusatsu

[11:26:44] <Seto[NLR]> basically Ali :p
[11:26:51] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Ali: Yeap must be the writers.
[11:26:52] <Seto[NLR]> it doesn't get any better
[11:27:21] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Now the show is set in France basically.
[11:27:22] <Ali> Does he still try to use Electric attacks on Ground pokemon?
[11:27:38] <Seto[NLR]> the funny thing is, ash's pikachu would have to be level 65+, versus level 1 pokemon.
[11:27:49] <Seto[NLR]> it's kinda rediculous
[11:27:57] <Seto[NLR]> and yes, from time to time he does
[11:28:41] <Seto[NLR]> the most 'advanced' battles ash has ever done in the series was during the time in Battle league 
[11:28:50] <Seto[NLR]> it's been downhill since then
[11:29:01] <Seto[NLR]> the show is still entertaining though
[11:29:10] <Seto[NLR]> but more of a comedy :p
[11:29:24] <Ali> Battle Frontier :P
[11:29:25] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Speaking of age this means either Satoshi/Ash is is a Vampire or a normal Human who is going to live until he is 900 years old
[11:29:28] <Seto[NLR]> thats the one !
[11:30:15] <Ali> I remember they tried to take a serious tone with Team Rocket's Jessie and James, I prefered that after years and years of every episode ending the same way for them.

[16:25:34] <RandomNinja> probably
[16:25:51] <RandomNinja> I'd save up for a better card instead, 6570 is pretty low-end

[22:53:50] <Gummie> Best way to support the artist 
[22:53:56] <Cloud_Zephyr> probably not on bandcamp
[22:54:14] <Gummie> That sucks
[22:54:44] <Gummie> Most Bandcamp stuff is apparently 80s stuffs of chiptune
[22:54:58] <Gummie> You know, or Monstercat
