[01:58:58] <Seventh_Element> the other videos on that channel are just as good
[01:58:59] <Eywind> XD
[01:59:05] <Seventh_Element> sadly, nothing uploaded for like 4 years
[01:59:06] <Eywind> Impossible
[01:59:14] <One-Trick> eq->comp or comp->eq
[01:59:15] <Seventh_Element> er well, longer
[01:59:26] <Seventh_Element> One-Trick, it depends???
[01:59:30] <One-Trick> on?
[01:59:35] <Seventh_Element> what you want to do
[01:59:42] <One-Trick> example?
[01:59:57] <Seventh_Element> in most cases you'll probably want to do the compression after the EQ
[02:00:35] <Seventh_Element> but if you'd like to maybe get a little bit of bleeding going around with your signal you could compress before EQ
[02:00:42] <One-Trick> im watching an audio engineer using post comp EQ to get a better punch from the low-end of the kick because the EQ gets squashed the other direction and makes it more treble
[02:00:42] <Seventh_Element> something like that
[02:01:18] <One-Trick> thats just a single band, though
[02:01:24] <One-Trick> like, 63Hz
[02:01:25] <Seventh_Element> right
[02:01:34] <Seventh_Element> again it really depends
[02:01:45] <Seventh_Element> I'm not really a compression expert either
[02:01:57] <One-Trick> compression is usually what i fail at
[02:02:02] <Seventh_Element> but usually you use compression to make stuff bigger (and louder as a result)
[02:02:06] <One-Trick> i keep trying to learn the best ways to use it
[02:02:12] <Seventh_Element> I use it on drums mostly
[02:02:33] <One-Trick> well, compression is supposed to make the loud quieter and the quiet louder so its more even
[02:03:03] <Eywind> so compression is supposed to equalize the volume
[02:03:06] <Eywind> :P
[02:03:09] <Seventh_Element> not neccesarily
[02:03:13] <Seventh_Element> @ey
[02:03:16] <Eywind> yeah yeah I know

[05:45:59] <DJMidli> I forget about the first one tho
[05:46:06] <DJMidli> I started dating her just after the fandom started
[05:46:23] <DJMidli> I met her thru the anime scene, she was into everything so she also watched the show 
[05:46:32] <DJMidli> but like she watched adventure time and every other cartoon type stuff
[05:46:33] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> For me I have yet to even hold hands with a girl.
[05:46:43] <DJMidli> How old are you?
[05:47:06] <ThunderPie> I'm socially awkward in real life.. I mean i don't talk to people much..
[05:47:18] <DJMidli> cause I am 28 and I dated these three from 24-28
[05:47:21] <ThunderPie> If i do i can many many times talk about randomest things all time.. 
[05:47:24] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> DJMidli: I will be 26 years old.
[05:47:26] <ThunderPie> I blame my Autism
[05:47:33] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> So I am 25 years now.
[05:47:37] <ThunderPie> I'm 21 in decmeber i turn 22..
[05:47:52] <Hamtramck> I'm 27 and I don't like people very much.
[05:48:00] <DJMidli> Go out and meet girls in anime club or in brony meetuos
[05:48:22] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> So yeah

[05:50:41] <DJMidli> Nope
[05:51:34] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Sorry not me either since I am the one with a girl problem.
[05:53:12] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Well actually I can say this treat the girl with respect.
[05:53:28] <Snapai> I am 34 and still single
[05:54:20] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Snapai: But have you ever held a girls hand?
[05:55:36] <Snapai> ThunderPie, well, you said you have autism, so in your case, if you want to be less socially awkward, careful study of a variety of presentation styles will help you come off less awkward to others in public.
[05:57:26] <Eywind> Wow
[05:57:42] <Eywind> TokusatsuKuuga-RX that's a question lol
[05:58:11] *** Quits: Mike_Coltfield (Larscis@colt.in.the.rain) (Quit: Well, that was unexpected...)
[05:58:22] <Snapai> Most folks I know somewhere on the spectrum say they studied public speakers on youtube, or on some other video library, and figured out how to use combinations of their mannerisms, to come off almost as if they picked up social interaction intuitively.
[05:58:50] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: Only because I have not either.
[05:58:57] <Snapai> (Of course, they still have issues picking up subconscious social cues, like when they've been overriding someone else's attempts to speak for longer than appropriate)

[05:59:24] <DinkyBot> Ooooh! Now I'm hungry, momma!
[05:59:30] <Snapai> However that may not change any relationship luck. Being less afraid of others' judgement, even if you act oddly, will put you in contact with more people, and you may find someone who likes your interaction as it is.
[05:59:45] <Snapai> There are LOTS of totally tactless people who still manage to find people who like them :D
[06:00:06] <Eywind> Yeah I heard Lunatic has had a gf for a while

[06:04:18] <Eywind> I mean it was a long distance relationship while he was on base
[06:04:29] <Eywind> and he took the effort to fly back and forth as much as he could, skype, etc.
