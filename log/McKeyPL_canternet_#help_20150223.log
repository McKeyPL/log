[05:43:43] <Colgate> what dns are you using?
[05:44:15] <liamwhite1> can't see it on v6 either
[05:45:07] <Colgate> I think whatever DNS your computer is configured to use is messing up

[05:54:32] <Solis> Hallo folks. Gots a question for ya.
[05:55:28] <Colgate> ?
[05:55:49] <Solis> My client on my phone cant seem to connect to canternet anymore.
[05:56:12] <Solis> It logs onto other servers just fine, but irc.canternet.org, or any of the other server names, doesnt work.
[05:56:38] <Colgate> yeah, it appears that some dns server out there cached a negative hit
[05:56:48] <Colgate> isn't much we can do about that
[05:57:20] <Solis> Well the weird part is, it wont connect if my phone's using the house wifi.
[05:57:31] <Solis> but im connected here now on the same line.
[05:57:35] <Colgate> different dns servers problem
[05:57:38] <Colgate> probably*
[05:57:46] <Solis> odd.
[05:57:47] <Solis> ah well.
[05:58:00] <Solis> thank celestia for unlimited mobile data.
[05:58:03] <Colgate> or a cached negative hit on your computer
[05:58:10] <Colgate> you can try ipconfig /flushdns
[05:58:15] <Colgate> and then trying again
[05:58:23] <Colgate> assuming windows
[05:58:23] <Solis> dunno how to do that on android phones.
[05:58:34] <Solis> my laptop works fine, its using the wifi right now
[05:59:57] <Colgate> I don't know how to flush a dns cache on android, or if it even has one
[06:00:44] <Solis> Yeah. s weird. not a big deal though, was just curious if someone knew a fix.
[06:11:36] <Dusk> So much DNS error stuff :s
[06:12:18] <Colgate> yep, HE is usually pretty good with it
