[16:31:02] <FruitNibbler> Tastes delishiz
[16:31:13] <RandomNinja> got it from the winery?
[16:31:40] <FruitNibbler> Better than the italian wine I had before (it had straight up alcohol added to it, yuck)
[16:31:51] <RandomNinja> ew cut products
[16:32:03] <FruitNibbler> No, just upon striking the deal I had a small present from a company
[16:32:27] <FruitNibbler> Which had swiss chocolate and 2 bottles of wine
[16:32:40] <RandomNinja> still neat
[16:33:04] *** Awaykitty is now known as Unixkitty
[16:33:25] <FruitNibbler> This wine is very young (I can taste grapefruit juice in it still), but that's what I actually enjoy
[16:34:02] <RandomNinja> it varies, some drinks are better young, other are better aged
[16:35:10] <RandomNinja> also if there's grape juice taste in it it might be backsweetened with unfermented juice
[16:35:22] <ThunderBolt> so Trildar, gonna use the fourms?
[16:35:33] <FruitNibbler> There is a local variety of wine, that always tastes good young
[16:35:59] <RandomNinja> the grape variety maybe?
[16:36:17] <FruitNibbler> Hmm, I have noticed 2013 on it... not so young as I though
[16:36:21] <FruitNibbler> thought*
[16:36:27] <RandomNinja> :P
[16:36:30] <FruitNibbler> But it tastes good none the less
[16:37:06] <RandomNinja> also keep in mind that many aged wines are ruined by improper storage, so there's that
[16:37:19] <FruitNibbler> It also has minimalistic labels on it making it look very stylish
[16:37:50] <RandomNinja> I use the most minimalistic label of all: none :P
[16:38:45] <RandomNinja> but yeah minimalism is nice

[16:39:45] <FruitNibbler> RandomNinja, there is a couple of wine bottles that Jaque Eve Cousteau and his crew have picked up from a sunken Napoleon ship
[16:39:48] * Trildar flails
[16:39:54] <ThunderBolt> so Trildar, gonna use the fourms?
[16:39:56] <RandomNinja> they're probably awful
[16:40:06] <FruitNibbler> Those go for 10 000$ and upwards
[16:40:22] <FruitNibbler> ANd you have 50/50 chance that they are filled with sea water
[16:40:39] <ThunderBolt> or piss
[16:40:47] <FruitNibbler> Some corks have leaked wine, mixing it with sea waters
[16:40:51] <RandomNinja> yeah if the corks were in contact with sea water they're nost likely ruined
[16:40:59] <ThunderBolt> could be from some guy stuck on a island
[16:41:20] <FruitNibbler> The crew opened some bottles, some of those was sea water, some had wine
[16:42:29] <FruitNibbler> Well not wine exactly, rather a highly alcoholic wine remain
[16:42:34] <RandomNinja> that sounds like a financially terrible move
[16:42:38] <FruitNibbler> I forgot how it is called
[16:43:00] <RandomNinja> well it's still wine, technically, unless it's been cut too much
[16:43:16] <FruitNibbler> Well people bought those to support Custeau and his work, I doubt they cared if it's wine
[16:43:29] <RandomNinja> yeah I mean them opening bottles
[16:43:36] <FruitNibbler> Ah, yeah
[16:44:02] <FruitNibbler> But hey, who doesn't want to taste what 10 000$ tase like?
[16:44:05] <FruitNibbler> taste*
[16:44:39] <RandomNinja> not really
[16:45:00] <RandomNinja> because let's be fair, those aren't really drinks anymore, they're collectibles
[16:45:29] <FruitNibbler> They found a ship that was almost a myth by that time
[16:45:31] <RandomNinja> whoever bought them most likely will never open them
[16:45:46] <FruitNibbler> Cut them some slack for this celebration 
[16:45:50] <RandomNinja> nu :P
[16:46:01] * RandomNinja alcohols FruitNibbler 
[16:46:27] <FruitNibbler> They also found a lot of gold, silver and other valuables on that ship
[16:46:41] <FruitNibbler> So wine wasn't the only nice thing
[16:47:27] <FruitNibbler> Wine was just such an unlikely find that everyone was very surprised
[16:47:47] <RandomNinja> indeed
[16:47:52] <FruitNibbler> They also had opened those bottles because they were sure there is nothing but sea water in it
[16:47:59] * Unixkitty somewhat gently, but firmly moves FruitNibbler aside using her field and glomps RandomNinja.
[16:48:17] <FruitNibbler> But in a second bottle there was a drinkable wine (first was salty)
[16:49:00] <Trildar> Well, I'm quite sure there's something wrong with this pricelist... An R9 290 is listed with the same price as a 280X. :P
