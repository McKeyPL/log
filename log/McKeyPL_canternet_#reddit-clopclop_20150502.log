[00:30:42] <Algido> geez this friend I have known a good 15 years is been really weird lately
[00:30:59] <Algido> Really weird, like it is concerning.
[00:31:28] <Algido> I had been calling him to let him know I was going to a mutual friend later to see if he wanted to come.
[00:35:11] <Algido> Finally he answered the last time I called him as I was getting ready to leave, and said that he wasn't going to go, and then he told me to be polite etc. etc... something about someone will call the cops if I act a certain way
[00:35:34] <Algido> oh gee and he just called me to say he is going to go and acted as if nothing had just transpired...
[00:35:48] <Algido> Probably drunk.
[00:35:53] <Algido> Whatever lol.

[02:13:29] <Algido> And he starts talking to me about women not "making love to the cock" when giving blowjobs in porno and all this other stuff. (He was coked up as hell)
[02:14:02] <princesssluttershy> I'm not really sure what to make of that :/
[02:14:15] <Algido> I was kinda taken aback. I've only met this guy once and he is a friend of a friend.

[02:14:30] <Flame> princesssluttershy: hi :3 *huggles*

[02:15:19] <weisey> "He was coked up as hell" Thats really all the explanation you need
[02:15:44] <Algido> Then he kinda went into how guys can do it better. that was like his set up. And he was real talkin' me, ignoring other people like my friend askin if he had ice.
[02:15:57] <Flame> o.o
[02:16:45] <Algido> Pmuch yeah weisey, but still, to start that convo with someone

[02:36:47] <slimer> princess sluttershy lol i spoke to you like 4 years ago
[02:37:06] <Algido> Hey slimer :)
[02:37:10] <princesssluttershy> What was your name?
[02:37:14] <princesssluttershy> Do you remember?
[02:37:41] <slimer> I had a bunch
[02:38:04] <slimer> I was under 18 and that was barely tolerated and then one time i got banned by a mod, not cloppy though, but cloppy endorsed the ban pretty much
[02:38:05] <slimer> lol
[02:38:26] <Algido> D:
[02:38:28] <slimer> oh, and i think i made some music or something and showed you it
[02:38:34] <princesssluttershy> T6?
[02:38:54] <princesssluttershy> I think Type6 made music
[02:38:59] <princesssluttershy> and I know they were underage
[02:39:03] <slimer> no idea who that is
[02:39:36] <slimer> uh, we did a webcam thing once
[02:39:38] <Vulpixbrew> gah
[02:39:41] <slimer> and I showed myself "stroking the mouse" lol

[02:42:57] <princesssluttershy> lol
[02:43:41] <princesssluttershy> I can't really think of any names from back then that aren'r mods :/
[02:43:46] <cloppyhooves> Hi slimer, are you new?
[02:43:57] <princesssluttershy> He was apparently here years ago
[02:44:01] <slimer> Nope, lol can you see the text from before you signed in?
[02:44:15] <slimer> I got banned for like 10 years basically
[02:44:25] <cloppyhooves> What name did you have back then? :o
[02:44:43] <slimer> I forget
[02:44:50] <Algido> When I think about what happened earlier... I can only think he was basically saying "I wanna suck you off and I will do a damn fine job of it"
[02:45:07] <slimer> Who said that? Damn i like that sorta thing :3
[02:45:14] <Algido> Kinda creepy that he is at least twice my age. He's probably more like near 70
[02:45:23] <slimer> o.O
[02:45:33] <Algido> Oh, you just missed.
[02:46:22] <Algido> I was at this old dude's house with my friend, who knew the guy.
[02:46:28] <Algido> And he starts talking to me about women not "making love to the cock" when giving blowjobs in porno and all this other stuff
[02:46:46] <Algido> saying men know what to do and can do it so much better etc.
[02:47:09] <Algido> And I have only seen him once before, about a month ago
[02:47:33] <Algido> Can't help but still think about it. Pretty odd 
[02:47:46] <slimer> That sounds nice
[02:48:14] <princesssluttershy> slimer, did you ever talk to someone named princesslapdance?
[02:48:22] <Algido> If he were much much younger >>

[02:49:26] <princesssluttershy> me*

[04:14:06] <cloppyhooves> Hi Quinn c:
[04:14:07] <weisey> Allu is more consistent, which is probably why nip grabbed allu to replace him
[04:14:29] <Quinn> bet for navi, and against  vp
[04:14:30] <princesssluttershy> yeah maikelele was pretty unreliable
[04:14:33] <Quinn> tahts all you need to know for csgo
[04:15:17] <weisey> but Maikelele isnt named Juan Deag for nothing
[04:15:36] <weisey> quinn The ammount of falseness in that statement
[04:15:41] <weisey> is too damn high
[04:15:49] <Quinn> it's obviously not that simple :P
[04:16:02] <Quinn> but betting against navi on lan is the best way to lose money
[04:16:24] <Quinn> and vp is just not consistent enough to bet high on, ever
[04:17:12] <weisey> always bet Fnatic, against navi for EU, for vp against NA, for C9 against anything but Fnatic
[04:17:20] <Pony387> woah dude they're putting harrison ford in the new starwars movie
[04:17:29] <weisey> And always bet NIP
[04:17:31] <Quinn> im not betting on NA anytime soon
[04:17:41] *** Joins: samonuh (Mibbit@Pony-3v42to.NATPOOL.NYU.EDU)
[04:17:51] <Quinn> also, always betting on fnatic is a terrible idea as well, especially since they nerfed the tec-9
[04:18:07] <Pony387> If I had to guess I would say probably the most consistent team that I've seen is fnatic
[04:18:09] <weisey> always bet fnatic except against NiP
[04:18:18] <samonuh> Star Wars Episode VII is a movie I don't want to watch but know I will anyways
[04:18:42] <Pony387> Nip is know for they're crazy high win rate but that's mostly because they compete in a lot of small  competitions as well as the big competitions
[04:18:54] <Pony387> but fnatic usually focuses only on the big competitions
[04:18:58] <Quinn> ^
[04:19:09] <Pony387> that's why they're still the only team to have 2 major titles
[04:19:25] <Quinn> I dont like the players on fnatic
[04:19:30] <Quinn> but they've made me $100's 
[04:19:45] <princesssluttershy> I don't like the players on fnatic either
[04:19:45] <Pony387> nip is always a crowd favorite though because of their win rate their 1.6 days and the fact that they've made so many crazy comebacks
[04:19:46] <weisey> The only player i like on Fnatic is DevilWalk
[04:20:06] <Quinn> Na'vi is my favorite team
[04:20:11] <princesssluttershy> I'd fuck Pasha
[04:20:15] <Pony387> well like them or not they are still one of the most consistent teams in the scene
[04:20:36] <princesssluttershy> or rather let him fuck me ;)
[04:20:41] <Quinn> honestly I find the players in csgo rather boring
[04:20:43] <weisey> nohomo
[04:20:46] <Quinn> I like LoL better for eSports
[04:21:22] <Quinn> as far as the game itself goes, the players dont have anything particularly unique about them that stands out
[04:21:33] <Algido> I have matches I need to play ><
[04:21:37] <Pony387> I think my 2 favorite players are snax and scream
[04:21:40] <Quinn> aside from each teams respective awper, you could probably swap their names around and not be able to tell the difference between them in a match
[04:21:47] *** Quits: samonuh (Mibbit@Pony-3v42to.NATPOOL.NYU.EDU) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[04:21:50] <weisey> Snax and Pasha dream team
[04:22:29] <weisey> are you watching FaceIT Quinn ?
[04:22:29] <princesssluttershy> I had a crush on fiflaren for a while :/
[04:22:38] <Quinn> now? nope
[04:22:39] <princesssluttershy> He was so adorable
[04:22:47] <Quinn> taking a break from betting
[04:23:04] <Quinn> I dont care for the scene particularly much outside of betting
[04:23:22] <Pony387> My fantasy team is hiko, snax, scream, krimz, and kenny s
[04:23:53] <Pony387> hiko because he's known for his crazy clutches and would be the wild card of the team
[04:24:05] <Pony387> snax because he's very sneaky and makes a great lurker
[04:24:12] <Pony387> scream cause he's a headshot machine
[04:24:20] <Pony387> krimz because his game sense is on point
[04:24:32] <Pony387> and kenny s is one of the best awpers of all time
[04:25:08] <Quinn> KQLY best awper 2014
[04:25:34] <weisey> Fnatic vs Team Liquid
[04:26:11] <weisey> Brb Betting a dragon lore on Liquid for an amazing win
[04:26:11] <Pony387> I think if that team were put together with an amazing coach like devilwalk or something and they could all sort of gett a grip on working with each other after a month or 2 they could probly bring the game to a whole knew level
[04:27:10] <princesssluttershy> I'm so out of the loop when it comes to pro csgo
[04:27:28] <princesssluttershy> the only games I watch are the ones warowl casts XD
[04:27:51] <Quinn> I bet on every single fnatic game
[04:27:51] <Quinn> maxbet
[04:27:51] <Quinn> won all of them
[04:28:07] <weisey> <Pony387> scream cause he's a headshot machine
[04:28:23] <weisey> Lol Scream is the new KQLY
[04:28:38] <princesssluttershy> KQLY was one of the cheaters right?
[04:29:03] <Pony387> kqly cheated but he did it at home there hasn't been any cheating on lan
[04:29:21] <Pony387> cause it's pretty much impossible to cheat undetected on lan
[04:29:45] <weisey> nah
[04:29:46] <weisey> nah
[04:29:51] <weisey> kqly cheated at lan
[04:30:08] <princesssluttershy> and I think someone on fnatic did too
[04:30:15] <princesssluttershy> er
[04:30:22] <princesssluttershy> I don't even know
[04:30:34] <princesssluttershy> I did tell you all that I'm out of touch right?
