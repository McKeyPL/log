[01:50:18] *** SkyHigh is now known as Thomas
[01:50:22] <Mexininja> well i retract my statement.
[01:50:27] <Eywind> Thomas why do you keep changing your name?
[01:50:50] <Thomas> The first time was for something elsewhere.
[01:50:58] <Eywind> just stay as one of the names...

[01:52:49] <Eywind> yeah yeah
[01:52:52] <Eywind> but name changes are annoying
[01:53:20] <Eywind> not sure we have the nick restriction or not now but it was a major problem in efn chat
[01:53:40] <Mexininja> yeah it kinda was ill give you that
[01:54:02] <Mexininja> man sometimes i miss the simplicity of EFN.
[01:54:11] <BubbaStudios> Hehe, don't we all
[01:54:16] * Eywind shrugs
[01:54:18] <Eywind> This is the same
[01:54:41] <Octavia> All I really did was change the name of the channel
[01:54:54] <Mexininja> it is in a sense but efn will always hold a good place in my heart. 
[01:54:57] <BubbaStudios> On EFN they just had everything on a sidebar, no matter what page you were on
[01:55:06] <Octavia> Ah
[01:55:18] <Octavia> I never have used the webchat
[01:55:24] <wobniaR> So change much name very different 
[01:55:31] <Eywind> I used it maybe three times
[01:55:49] <Mexininja> just abit of nostalgia, i do like canterlothill also
[01:56:17] <BubbaStudios> Yeah, the sidebar thing doesn't really matter
[01:56:32] <Octavia> I only wish the website would evolve.
[01:56:33] <Mexininja> agreed.
[01:56:51] <Eywind> Yeah, maybe when Bash is actually able to do things it'll get updated
[01:56:58] <Mexininja> that could mean various things.
[01:57:14] <Eywind> Not sure how long he is going to be down for
[01:57:20] <Octavia> Yes, though I am about to get a lot of free time. I may be able to contribute some assistance.
[01:57:44] <Eywind> Man things would get done so fast
[01:58:37] <Mexininja> dont you guys have like a feedback thing? or is it putting to much trust in the general populace?
[01:58:37] <Octavia> I am not very good with the interfacing portion though I can code the backend very quickly and safely
[01:58:40] <wobniaR> Give me like 3 months and I'll have another degree that says I'm smurt
[01:58:53] <Octavia> And, I know Wordpress very well.
