[02:49:12] <MalevolentSpoon> Does anyone here know a lot about how wifi works? Connectivity and such?
[02:49:33] <Moonlightning> Do you have an underlying question, or are you just curious about how it generally works?
[02:50:44] <MalevolentSpoon> It's just that my internet has some kind of... issue, and I'm lef scratching my head about it
[02:50:49] <MalevolentSpoon> *left
[02:51:16] <Webster> Try to avoid having your router set to a channel used by other people. This is easier with 5GHz WiFi.
[02:51:27] <Webster> Also don't use a crappy router.
[02:52:29] <MalevolentSpoon> Our router isn't our own, it's provided by our cable company.
[02:53:00] <Webster> Get one that isn't.
[02:53:52] <MalevolentSpoon> Okay... another question.
[02:54:35] <MalevolentSpoon> Does running multiple wifi networks out of the same house cause any kind of interference or other problems? Do know, I have no clue about any of this almost, so I'm asking whatever comes to mind.
[02:55:31] <Webster> If they use overlapping channels they'll interfere with each other. Generally N can handle that to some degree as long as the networks aren't used to full capacity.
[02:56:38] <MalevolentSpoon> Good to know.
[02:59:23] <MalevolentSpoon> Thanks

[03:12:02] <Webster> I wish WiFi narrow channel was made part of the spec. >_>
[03:12:19] <Moonlightning> Narrow channel? <.<
[03:12:50] <Webster> Yes. Breaks down the 20MHz into four 5MHz channels or 20 1MHz channels. Provides much better throughput in congested areas.
[03:13:51] <Moonlightning> That sounds really useful.
[03:14:12] <Webster> Yes it does.
[03:14:17] <Moonlightning> They should make it so in a future standard.
[03:14:23] <Webster> Especially with 2.4GHz where you have a longer range.
[03:14:45] <Moonlightning> And…somehow make it backwards-incompatible to prevent manufacturers from being lazy and just keeping the old behavior
[03:15:00] <Webster> No, then it'll never get used. :P
[03:16:15] <Webster> The great thing is it is backwards compatible.
[03:17:21] <Moonlightning> But then manufacturers could just let their client devices broadcast on the entire old 20MHz range, thus utterly defeating the purpose.
[03:17:34] <Webster> They'd do that anyway.
[03:17:50] <Moonlightning> Not if you somehow made the new Wi-Fi standard incompatible with that behavior.
[03:18:02] <Webster> No, because then they can't use existing networks.
[03:18:10] <Webster> Everyone would have to replace their routers/access points.
[03:18:15] <Webster> You want to pay the billions in dollars for that?
[03:18:32] <Moonlightning> Devices can support more than one Wi-Fi standard at once <.<
[03:18:43] <Webster> Then how is it incompatible?
[03:19:31] <Moonlightning> Make using more than a 5MHz band at once invalid Wi-Fi bk or whatever the next one is going to be.
[03:20:03] <Moonlightning> If a client tries to communicate with a bk-only device with more than that, it will be rejected
[03:20:10] <Moonlightning> No idea how you'd make that happen, but seems to me it's the only way
[03:20:43] <Webster> Again, that'd require all Wi-Fi hardware to be upgraded at once.
[03:20:52] <Moonlightning> No, it wouldn't.
[03:21:13] <Moonlightning> You need new hardware if you want to join a bk-only AP.
[03:21:14] <Webster> Otherwise the new routers would have to support doing two channels at once on both bands.
[03:21:40] <Webster> Yeah, who the hell's going to use a 'bk' only AP if you can't use your existing machine on it?
[03:21:49] <Moonlightning> No one.
[03:21:55] <Moonlightning> But that's irrelevant.
[03:22:20] <Moonlightning> The AP would just have to support g|n|ac|bk, which seems entirely possible.
[03:22:36] <Webster> That's being backwards compatible. :P
[03:22:42] <Moonlightning> Yes?
[03:22:46] <Webster> You said make it not.
[03:22:55] <Moonlightning> I said make the PROTOCOL backwards-incompatible, not the DEVICES.
[03:23:18] <Webster> What's the difference in this case?
[03:23:37] <Moonlightning> Broadcasting a packet such that it leaks out beyong 5MHz is valid ac, but invalid bk.
[03:23:58] <Moonlightning> Sure, it won't change much at first, but /eventually/ we'll be on es, and people will start dropping ac support, forcing manufacturers to make their devices properly.
[03:24:35] <Webster> Point of Narrow Channel is you can separate subchannels you can use at the same time, so how would you even detect that?
[03:24:54] <Moonlightning> …I thought the point was to reduce interference.
[03:24:57] <Webster> Yes.
[03:25:09] <Webster> If there's multiple networks they back off of overlapping subchannels.
[03:25:20] <Moonlightning> Huh?
[03:26:01] <Webster> You have 4 x 5MHz subchannels for a network. If no other networks are around, you can use 20MHz of bandwidth. If there is another one and it's overlapping by 1 channel, you get 15MHz of bandwidth, as opposed to 0.
[03:26:45] <Moonlightning> Ahhh.
