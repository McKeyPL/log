[00:21:46] <Hickory> Na, I loaned my ebay account to one of my friends, and she didn't pay a guy until much later for something he bought, so now my ebay account is grossly in debt
[00:21:47] <EM-C> Hey...it's better than all those other games.
[00:22:00] <Eywind> you aren't 'grossly in debt' on your eBay
[00:22:05] <RandomNinja> (because illegal substances)
[00:22:10] <Eywind> If they paid it, no debt
[00:22:20] <EM-C> No, but I don't have anything either.
[00:22:24] <Eywind> If they didn't pay it, then they shoudln't have gotten anything Hickory
[00:22:32] <Eywind> and you can't get negative references as a buyer
[00:22:36] <Eywind> so I don't see the problem...
[00:22:56] * RandomNinja metals

[00:23:25] <Hickory> The friend I lend the account to sold an item, she didn't ship the item until much later, where as the buyer already paid for the item, after he recieved the item he claimed that the item wasn't as advertised.

[00:23:30] <EM-C> I don't have any collections (or friends, or any number of other things).
[00:23:35] <Eywind> Oh
[00:23:36] <Hoofy> hey derpy bot is derping
[00:23:40] <Eywind> The account isn't in debt, though
[00:23:45] <Eywind> it should have been reversed off of paypal
[00:23:58] <Eywind> or it -shouldn't be-... if it's still "in debt" you should pay it off.
[00:24:09] <EM-C> I got a brace for my left knee today.
[00:24:13] <Eywind> Well that's good
[00:24:16] <RandomNinja> yay?
[00:24:17] <Hickory> I'm not sure, all I know is every other day I get collection notices from ebay.
[00:24:29] <EM-C> And it doesn't feel all that bad.
[00:24:30] <Hickory> Actually I believe SHE should pay it off.
[00:24:31] <Eywind> Then you should pay it...
[00:24:41] <MikeM> Why would you "loan" your ebay account to anyone?
[00:24:43] <Eywind> She probably should pay it
[00:24:47] <Eywind> but you should pay it regardless
[00:24:49] <Eywind> since it's under your name
[00:24:53] <Eywind> and you do -not- want stuff going to collections
[00:24:58] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> One does not simply loan eBay accounts
[00:25:10] <Hickory> Is ebay run by the lannisters?
[00:25:12] <Eywind> like an actual collection agency
[00:25:15] <EM-C> Anyway, Eywind, after four years of trying and failing in every conceivable way to be noticed by the brony creative community, I've resorted to another act of desperation.

[00:26:03] <Hickory> Well, I don't know, they just keep telling me my account is susspeded, that's all that's happened, it's been that way for almost two years.
[00:26:04] <EM-C> All I'm capable of doing is writing, but my fics have for the most part been ignored.
[00:26:07] <Eywind> As are most
[00:26:16] <MikeM> True
[00:26:20] <EM-C> I've asked one of the YT fic readers to look at my fics and see if any of them are worth reading on YT.
[00:26:31] <Eywind> Ah
[00:26:34] <Eywind> Well that's something
[00:26:47] <EM-C> Just to have one of my poor fics read would put me on cloud nine.
[00:26:58] <EM-C> But I doubt it will happen.
[00:27:14] <EM-C> But at least I tried...**again**.
[00:27:24] <Hickory> Either way, the phones definetly going on craigslist, I just want a quicker sell.
[00:27:36] <Hickory> Because if it just sits in my room sealed up, I'll be tempted to open it :/
[00:27:43] <Eywind> You should still pay off that ebay debt before it ruins your credit
[00:27:56] <Hickory> Nothing can save my credit.
[00:28:07] <Eywind> ok
[00:28:12] <EM-C> My credit was shot once.  Student loans.
[00:28:23] <Hickory> Yeah that's part of it.
[00:28:33] <SkyHigh> I never really had debt
[00:28:34] <EM-C> But it's been so long that my slate has been cleared.

[00:29:10] <RandomNinja> ew
[00:29:22] <EM-C> I didn't set out not to repay my loans.  My life...just didn't turn out the way I had planned.  And nowadays, I know why.
[00:29:39] <Hickory> It's good when things turn out good and you make them good.
[00:29:56] <One-Trick> at this moment, there is no possible way i can repay my student loans
[00:30:04] <RandomNinja> sounds fun
[00:30:15] <RandomNinja> I'm also looking forward to that
[00:30:33] <EM-C> One-Trick...eventually they will be forgiven and cleaned off your record.  But it takes several years.
[00:30:35] <Hickory> Really you just shouldn't go to college unless you have the money for it.
[00:30:55] <RandomNinja> or you're not severely ripped off by everyone
[00:30:57] <MikeM> That's an interesting point of view.
[00:31:04] <One-Trick> i am still in school at the moment, my ultimate goal is to make a well-enough living to repay them before i die of old age
[00:31:08] <EM-C> I didn't have to take out any loans for college.  I got grants.  I got loans for grad school.

[00:31:27] <Eywind> Realistically scholarships are the #1 way to look at things
[00:31:27] * DerpyBot gives DinkyBot a muffin and gently pats her head
[00:31:33] <Hickory> yeah scholarships too.
[00:31:49] <Eywind> If you don't get scholarships, 2 years of community college and then maybe 2 years of a less expensive program will get you the same thing as going to a 4 year big-name college for most things
[00:31:52] <Hickory> I mean if you can't get a scholarship you're probably wasting your time going to college anyway, and wasting everyone elses money.
[00:31:58] <EM-C> At my third school they actually paid me to go...but I burned completely out after one year.
[00:32:18] <Eywind> There's always community college
[00:32:20] <One-Trick> Hickory: i didnt get a scholarship till 2 years into college
[00:32:46] <EM-C> I got a scholarship one of my years as an undergraduate.

[00:33:34] <EM-C> I couldn't have paid for college, nor could my parents.  It was either grants or nothing.
[00:33:47] <One-Trick> i have two scholarships and 3 grants but theyre all fairly small
[00:33:56] <Eywind> Grants don't have to be repaid, right?
[00:34:03] <Eywind> So they're just like other scholarships; they're not loans.
[00:34:12] <RandomNinja> shouldn't be

[00:34:27] <EM-C> No.  Not grants.
[00:34:29] <One-Trick> you dont have to pay back either
[00:34:41] <EM-C> Like I said, the only loans I ever had was for the two years on my master's program.
[00:35:28] <Hickory> I'd like to think everyone could go to college and learn lots of things, but truth be told it just isn't for everyone.
[00:35:35] <EM-C> I actually have two academic degrees and completed one year of Ph.D. work before burning completely out.
[00:35:53] <EM-C> I know I don't seem like the type.

[00:36:46] <RandomNinja> yeah
[00:36:47] <EM-C> That's initially what I planned to do.
[00:36:54] <EM-C> But...you'd have to have been there.
[00:37:10] <EM-C> I just didn't do well that year.  I couldn't even complete all the coursework.
[00:37:11] <RandomNinja> yeah I've heard about it being ridiculously hard
[00:37:31] <EM-C> I also hated the place and didn't really want to be studying the program I was.
[00:37:43] <EM-C> It was just...a big bust.
[00:38:05] <EM-C> All that education and expense essentially for "personal enrichment."
[00:38:18] <EM-C> Not that I regret it now, of course.
[00:38:32] <Hickory> I only dropped out of my two year course because of a breakup.
[00:38:52] <EM-C> Thanks to my schooling, I was able to make one of my dreams come true...the one and only thing I have ever managed to succeed at.
[00:38:52] <RandomNinja> the kind of education that's interesting but not really job-viable?
[00:38:59] <EM-C> Yeah.
[00:39:12] <EM-C> I was essentially studying for a lifetime in academia.
[00:40:15] <EM-C> But for all my failures, I cling with gratitude to the one dream I was able to fulfill.

[02:08:16] <Eywind> are you on PVFM?  I missed the first half of your intro

[02:15:12] <Snapai> Skunks, squirrels, and foxes are always cartooned with fat tails, since that's the shape of the fur, but they all actually have super thin tails with long floofy fur on em to make up the bulk.
[02:15:29] <Snapai> Mike - it's going to run a brewery. :D
[02:15:39] <Snapai> As a partnership with a black bear.
