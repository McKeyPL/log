[16:53:44] <RandomNinja> only bad thing is that it breaks in like 10 hits
[16:53:58] <RandomNinja> I used Knock, Knock to great effect
[16:54:00] <wobniaR> It works for longer than that
[16:54:08] <RandomNinja> yeah but still, it's annoyingly fragile
[16:54:31] <RandomNinja> still Old Glory best melee weapon
[16:54:41] <RandomNinja> dat rapid barrage of crits
[16:54:46] <DinkyBot> !hat
[16:54:46] <DerpyBot> May I take your hat, muffin?
[16:54:46] <DerpyBot> May I take your hat?
[16:54:47] <DinkyBot> I'm wearin' a muffin hat, momma!
[16:55:40] <RandomNinja> I should make an explosives/melee build sometime, that sounds wonderfully broken
[16:56:25] <RandomNinja> also Tunnelers are the worst
[16:57:04] <WildSoft> FN huge lol
[16:57:23] <Hamtramck> New Vegas' junk can be used in crafting n stuff
[16:57:41] <Hamtramck> also especially if you play on hardcore mode
[16:57:57] <RandomNinja> The fact that you usually can wreck Cazadores without blinking and handling Deathclaws without much issue by then just  makes the Tunnelers even worse
[16:58:00] <Hamtramck> New Vegas' built in "u need to eatndrink bro" stuff works a lot better than the Skyrim mosd for the same thing.
[16:58:02] <wobniaR> It's more useful than skyrim's junk
[16:58:07] <RandomNinja> Harcore mode is only mode
[16:58:23] <wobniaR> They even show you when you enter the tunneler area, a deathclaw gets rekt
[16:58:28] <RandomNinja> >not playing with slow regen stimpacks and ammo weight
[16:58:31] <wobniaR> You know it's getting serious then
[16:58:34] <Hamtramck> idk why it let's you not play on hardcore mode, it feels lke the game is /built/ around that
[16:58:56] <RandomNinja> yeah without hardcore you can just chug stimpacks and be invincible
[16:59:44] <RandomNinja> Project Nevada + Hardcore + Very Hard <3
[17:00:40] <Hamtramck> I never felt the need to put a lot of mods in NV. Project Nevada's subtle. I have some things that add more crafting recipes, though it's nothing really unbalanced from what I've seen, uh...
[17:00:53] <Hamtramck> Handful of NPC mods that I have to use becuse I corrupted my save.
[17:00:55] <RandomNinja> Weapons Of The New Millennia is sweet
[17:00:57] <wobniaR> Project nevada is like a compilation of mods
[17:01:05] <wobniaR> All in one
[17:01:07] <RandomNinja> Watts laser rifle best rifle
[17:01:12] <Hamtramck> IDon't use all the stuff from PN
[17:01:30] <wobniaR> I only used core and a bit of stuf from another one
[17:01:48] <RandomNinja> you should try all
[17:01:54] <wobniaR> The only thing I was upset about is that project nevada didn't rebalance old world blues
[17:02:10] <RandomNinja> yeah the enemies are still bullet spongy as hell
[17:02:12] <Hamtramck> I never messed with the DLC because I heard they weren't too groov
[17:02:14] <wobniaR> Enemies in there were tanking headshots from the anti-material rifle
[17:02:22] <RandomNinja> you heard wrong, the DLC is great
[17:02:30] <RandomNinja> except Honest Hearts, it's okay
[17:02:51] <Hamtramck> o
[17:03:04] <RandomNinja> well there's your problem wobniaR, you didn't use energy weapons in the Mad Science DLC
[17:03:23] <Hamtramck> Man now I wanna play New Vegas. >:C
[17:03:27] <RandomNinja> do it
[17:03:27] <wobniaR> My energy weapon skill was like 20 lol
[17:03:40] <wobniaR> I invested in melee and guns
[17:03:51] <RandomNinja> do a level 1 PN + Very Hard + HC run of Dead Money :P
[17:04:05] <wobniaR> tgm
[17:04:06] <wobniaR> Done
[17:04:08] <RandomNinja> pls
[17:04:21] <RandomNinja> The floor has teeth!
[17:04:47] <RandomNinja> but srsly I loved Dead Money's storytelling
[17:04:59] <wobniaR> One of my favorite DLC's
[17:05:02] <RandomNinja> yeah
[17:05:19] <wobniaR> It strips you of all your equipment and makes you use everything you got to survive
[17:05:24] <RandomNinja> not only that
[17:05:25] <wobniaR> That's how fallout should be played
[17:05:30] <RandomNinja> worldbuilding and characters
[17:05:36] <Hamtramck> I sort of want to get that uh
[17:05:40] <Hamtramck> remastered WAsteland 1
[17:05:47] <Hamtramck> Where you dont need to consult a separate manual for the text paragraphs
[17:05:56] <RandomNinja> lul
[17:05:59] <RandomNinja> get Wasteland 2
[17:06:07] <Hamtramck> Eh
[17:06:15] <Hamtramck> I want an excuse to replay Wasteland 1.
[17:06:20] <RandomNinja> ^^
[17:06:22] <Hamtramck> Also I wish Dragon Wars would get a similar remaster.
[17:06:31] <RandomNinja> played old Fallouts?
[17:06:32] <Hamtramck> wait is the remaster still included with WL2?
[17:06:44] <Hamtramck> i thought that was a preorder thing
[17:06:54] <Hamtramck> Yeah, I played Fallout 1 years ago
[17:07:13] <RandomNinja> yeah, you get W1
[17:07:43] <RandomNinja> also OST by Mark Morgan
[17:08:06] <Hamtramck> o hm
[17:08:26] <Hamtramck> Also I sort of want to get Omikron from gog so I could write a hack for it that changes how the save system works
[17:08:39] <RandomNinja> GOG is wonderful
[17:09:56] <RandomNinja> http://i.imgur.com/UdwFQDJ.jpg
[17:10:53] <Hamtramck> I see they havea bunch of Ys games now!
[17:11:01] <RandomNinja> the #burned is what gets me
[17:11:05] <Hamtramck> Also Paradox's older games but it sort of hard to go back to the older paradox games.
[17:12:21] <Flurshy> RandomNinja: woo! http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/20/west-coast-ports-dispute-union-labor-secretary-tom-perez/23744299/
[17:12:27] <RandomNinja> yaay
[17:12:41] <RandomNinja> soon you can build your shrine
[17:12:47] <Flurshy> yessss
[17:12:54] <Flurshy> now I just have to wait for monies
[17:12:55] <Hamtramck> I have a hard time going back to older 4xes in general though. That's a genre that's made a /lot/ of advancements over time. Like the Imperialism games are certaintly well made but they just don't have as much stuff to do as Vicky.
[17:13:28] <RandomNinja> Crusader Kings 2?
[17:13:55] <Hamtramck> What about it?
[17:14:11] <RandomNinja> Paradox games and whatnot
[17:14:26] <RandomNinja> being good
[17:14:30] <Hamtramck> I mean CK's another good example. CK1's not as comparatively archaic/simple as EU1 is but like... it had some really bad bugs and balance issues, which CK2 fixed.
[17:14:41] <Hamtramck> And then CK2 built a ton of other features on top of that. I need to pay more CK2...
[17:14:53] <RandomNinja> I need to play CK2...
[17:15:06] <wobniaR> It was free for the weekend to try
[17:15:36] <Flurshy> RandomNinja: also waiting for korra book one, which is coming in today or monday I expect
[17:15:45] <RandomNinja> oh, I should try it tomorrow then
[17:15:49] <Flurshy> gunna start watching it now that... it's over :P
[17:16:03] <RandomNinja> Book 3 best book
[17:16:03] <Flurshy> hard to believe the sequel series is already over and I've only watched season one once on tv
[17:16:34] <RandomNinja> keep it mind that Korra is much more of a slow burner than TLA
[17:16:47] <Hamtramck> Man I never saw the last two episodes of avadar
[17:16:52] <RandomNinja> wat
[17:16:58] <RandomNinja> go do that now, those are great
[17:17:01] <Flurshy> >last two
[17:17:11] <Flurshy> do you mean last half episode, or last five episodes?
[17:17:21] <Flurshy> the finale was 4 episodes long
[17:17:28] <RandomNinja> also Azula best villain
[17:17:31] <Flurshy> yessss

[17:18:20] <Hamtramck> the last two <absolute value bars>episodes</absolute value bar>
[17:18:25] <Flurshy> wait woah, black sun came before boiling rock?
[17:18:35] <Hamtramck> yeah
[17:18:43] <Hamtramck> Everyone at boiling rock was captured cause black sun were't they?
[17:18:47] <Flurshy> will just watch sozin's comet then
[17:18:50] <RandomNinja> yeah

[17:26:24] <Flurshy> can't get enough of Azula either
[17:26:31] <Flurshy> >.<
[17:27:59] <Hamtramck> The problem with Korra is that like, everyone from Avatar is dead in it.
[17:28:08] <Hamtramck> Because between the two series, the Old Nation attacked.
[17:28:13] <Hamtramck> And turned everyone into Old People.
[17:28:14] <Flurshy> I uh
[17:28:15] <RandomNinja> the vacation episode: "maybe Azula isn't that bad really.... Okay no I was totally wrong!"
[17:28:19] <Flurshy> I don't want spoilers for korra.
[17:28:26] <Hamtramck> That's not really a spoiler.
[17:28:33] <Flurshy> oh, you mean they grew old and ded
[17:28:37] <Hamtramck> It takes place a long dang time after avatar
[17:28:51] <RandomNinja> semi-spoiler tease: not everyone is dead!

[17:58:58] <Hamtramck> No

[17:59:16] <Hamtramck> she was like 10
[17:59:24] <Hamtramck> And Bumi was like 200 years old in Airbender
[17:59:30] <RandomNinja> no

[23:34:28] <wobniaR> Also classes on friday and sunday late at night ew
[23:34:41] <One-Trick> i was fortunate enough to use up all the electives and social sciences requirements by my advisor feeling bad for me that the community college screwed me over and had me take a bunch of crap i didnt need, so he just used those to fill in those spots :)
