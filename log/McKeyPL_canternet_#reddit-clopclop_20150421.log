[01:21:04] <Squirrelly> I want a kog'maw plush
[01:21:05] <Veigar> I just don't like that since bjergsen played kogmaw mid all my bronze games are being filled with kogmaw mids who miss everything and go 0/10
[01:21:16] <Squirrelly> Lol
[01:21:28] <Veigar> fucking bjergsen why you do dis to me ;-;
[01:21:33] <Squirrelly> That's cuz you're in bronze, silly
[01:21:36] <Squirrelly> :P
[01:21:54] <Michael> ELO hell is real
[01:21:57] <Veigar> well yeah but I think I have the skill of silver 3 at least at my peak
[01:22:00] <Squirrelly> Eh
[01:22:16] <Veigar> but my b game and c game are definitely bronze 3
[01:22:20] <Squirrelly> I'm gold. So I'm bad, is what I'm saying.
[01:22:21] <Veigar> and my tilt game
[01:22:28] <Veigar> oh boy my tilt is aweful
[01:22:28] <Michael> my rank is dirt
[01:23:09] <Veigar> half the reason I'm stuck where I am is because I go on tilt very easily and when I do my play suffers significantly
[01:23:21] <Squirrelly> Heh
[01:23:34] <Squirrelly> Why do people tilt? It does nothing
[01:24:29] <Veigar> well it's just frustrating when you get an urgot jungle who makes every gank extremely obvious and a kogmaw mid who feeds and misses everything and for some reason your support is nunu but he's going full ap and you have teemo top
[01:24:45] <Squirrelly> That's why you just carry
[01:24:59] <Squirrelly> Or do what my friend did, and support-carry
[01:25:00] <Veigar> can't do that when my team is getting shredded
[01:25:13] <Squirrelly> Support so hard your team CANT LOSE
[01:25:30] <Veigar> it's one thing to carry it's another thing to 1v5 when the enemy team has malph vi and leo ult
[01:26:02] <Veigar> some games are unwinnable and that's what's frustrating
[01:26:28] <iamalion> lunch time!
[01:26:32] <iamalion> i was about to starve tod eath
[01:26:32] <iamalion> afk
[01:26:43] <Veigar> then when you get into a game you can win coming off of an unwinnable game you're already on edge and every mistake you make is a big "fuck!" and you suffer and suffer and suffer
[01:27:08] <Veigar> then again at the same time I do suck at the game so if I was better I wouldn't be bronze
[01:28:04] <Veigar> it'd be so much easier to get better if I didn't tilt at all.
[01:28:16] <Veigar> give me a month without tilting and I'll make it to gold V
