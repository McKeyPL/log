[01:14:41] <AppleDash> I'll make them all open networks, too, and have all ports but 80 and 443 blocked, and every request on either of the unblocked ports routed to derpibooru over tor or something

[01:21:52] <Phase4> AppleDash, no, can have as many ssids per radio as you want
[01:22:04] <AppleDash> weird
[01:22:13] <Phase4> excluding software and hardware limits
[01:22:22] <Phase4> the latter actually being firmware limits
[01:22:33] <AppleDash> Either way, I want my APs outside where they will be seen, instead of in here where they will be blocked by concrete rebar walls :P

[01:27:09] <ShivalPonyWolf> just have to wait 6 weeks for them
[01:27:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> i can actually use the 07s in some embeded projects with their extra IO and deep sleep option
[01:27:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> you can do deep sleep on the 01 but it requires manaulyl doing a wire to one of the ics
[01:28:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> and its too small for me to work with

[18:54:47] <JustAberrant> I've got like a list of commands I've figured out at various times, and I just use them
[19:00:14] <ola> ok, so it is sort of viewable

[19:00:28] <ola> with QuickTime 4.0.3
