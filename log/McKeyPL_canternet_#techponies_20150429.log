[10:19:56] <Kinsley> So I did not know this until I started looking into what size drives my laptop can accept, but apparently my model has an empty 2.5 bay that just needs a caddy and it can fit up to 9.5 mm drives.
[10:20:39] <Kinsley> Totally changes my options for upgrading the drive. Suddenly I can look at lower capacity SSDs. "Lower" being the 120 to 256 GB range.
[10:20:58] <LegionRed> Duel drive bay laptops <3
[10:22:32] <Kinsley> So... to that end.
[10:32:38] <Kinsley> I've got it narrowed to a few choices.
[10:34:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> The Scammiest Scam To Yet Anonymity Scam - https://gist.github.com/0xabad1dea/633a7ff7f561263bba34
[10:34:13] <Kinsley> The Samsung 850 EVO in either 120GB or 250 GB, the Crucial BX100 in 250 GB, and the Muskin Enhanced ECO2 in 240 GB. Thoughts, experiences?
[10:34:14] <PinkiePieBot> [ Sever Scam ]
[10:34:51] <worthless> I'm going for the evo when I get enough money. Which should be in 7 days
[10:35:46] <worthless> all the data I found about it shows that it is the best drive for the money out right now
[10:37:29] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[10:39:56] <Kinsley> Yeah, the EVO in the 120 GB looks like a solid deal.
[10:40:30] <Kinsley> $80 on Newegg, free shipping, free thumb drive (wouldn't mind having another for random shit but don't NEED one)
[10:41:02] <worthless> Really hope the deal is still on when my money comes in..could use another flash drive
[10:41:05] <Kinsley> And ShivalPonyWolf, someone please tell me there is a software project somewhere called "drano" that will kill network applications running on certain ports.
[10:44:03] <Shnuggles> that's oddly specific
[10:44:23] <Kinsley> Or $78 on Amazon and it'll be here on Friday because Prime shipping rules.
[10:44:50] <Kinsley> Or hell, $118 for the 250 and it'll be here Friday...
[10:54:44] <Kinsley> Or just pay an extra $4 to overnight it...
[10:57:10] <Kinsley> Though, geez. Even two day shipping is fast. I ordered something else and it went across the country in 11 hours.
[10:57:28] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[11:04:56] <Lapsus> Kinsley: samsung drives ftw
[11:06:33] <Googie> The thing about Solid State drives that I've always found; performance on paper matters very little compared to just the significant increase in performance compared to HDDs due to the decreased latency.
[11:17:54] <Lapsus> ShivalPonyWolf: What the fuck am I reading. This is gold :v
[11:20:19] *** Joins: Phase5 (Phase4@Pony-5d0.cld.209.118.IP)
[11:20:32] <Kinsley> Googie: that's the idea with adding an SSD to this laptop. I am so bottlenecked with I/O that this will sometimes perform WORSE than my 4 year old laptop rocking an i5, compared to this i7. It's... bad.
