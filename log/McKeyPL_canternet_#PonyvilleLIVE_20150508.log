[11:53:46] <Lunia> not a concept

[13:06:32] <El> there were no phones or Internet, thus nobody asked "how are you" all the time
[13:07:32] <El> "the most lonliest day of my li~i~i~fe"

[13:12:46] <Lunia> nurses and doctors cant be muted
[13:13:38] <Lunia> and i dont know why i  got better
[13:14:35] <El> every raid boss has the button like "that's it, I'm tired if this shit"
[13:14:50] <El> and wipes the raid with one swing
[13:15:15] <Lunia> I'd rather know why im healthy then why i was sick
[13:15:26] <El> maybe you are like that raid boss
[13:16:21] <Lunia> i cannot relate to your point of view
[13:16:27] <Lunia> what raid boss?
[13:16:38] <El> any raid boss
[13:17:27] <Lunia> I dont think i encountered one in games i've been playing
[13:17:54] <El> something like 15 min enrage timer
[13:18:27] <Lunia> some bosses became stronger when damaged
[13:19:00] <El> true, but enraged ones are overpowered with no chances to beat them
[13:19:41] <Lunia> apparently you are not good enough in games
[13:20:19] <El> I know
[13:20:22] <Lunia> I usually get enraged befoere them
[13:21:00] <El> I did not get enraged yet :|
[13:21:29] <Lunia> boss fight is simple after you analize the enemy moves
[13:21:40] <Lunia> and limitations
[13:21:45] <Lunia> weak spots
[13:22:15] <El> of course, but when you need other 9 people to fight along your side
[13:22:28] <El> things get complicated
[13:22:43] <Lunia> knowledge is power, when you finish analize you can go berserk and finish
[13:22:59] <Lunia> why do you need them?
[13:23:12] <El> because it's a raid boss
[13:23:37] <El> to kill one you need to compile a raid with different classes and roles
[13:23:46] <Lunia> i dont play this types of games apparently so i cant relate
[13:24:05] <El> no, you can
[13:24:06] <Lunia> im a solo type planner
[13:24:26] <El> reverse your point of view
[13:24:45] <El> imagine that you are a raid boss and everything fit
[13:24:59] <Lunia> so this is more like SOA
[13:25:06] <Lunia> SAO**]
[13:25:39] <Lunia> human biology and boss  battles are vastly diffrent

[13:27:12] <El> I would not say that
[13:27:54] <El> any scintist can use simplifing tool to solve a problem

[13:28:57] <TheFlutterGuy> El: i would refer you to th spherical cow http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow
[13:29:02] <Lunia> I prefer analysis of variaqbles
[13:29:02] <TheFlutterGuy> not all models are usable
[13:29:47] <Lunia> like, I dont feel connection to my body
[13:30:32] <Lunia> in psychology it would be called post traumatic dysphoria
[13:31:01] <El> we still do not know where are we living in global scale, TheFlutterGuy, so yeah, every discussion is like spherical cow
[13:31:02] <Lunia> my body has been damaged/changed too much for my mind to feel it the same way

[13:31:52] * TheFlutterGuy hugs Lunia 
[13:31:53] <Lunia> so it refuses to connect and treat my body as part of me
[13:32:02] <Lunia> it feels more like a vessel

[13:32:11] <TheFlutterGuy> I may be wrong though, hard to really know.
[13:32:23] <TheFlutterGuy> it's definetly disconnected from who "I" am.

[13:36:24] <Lunia> +memory and hormones and you have a human mind
[13:36:47] <Lunia> if you do it hard enough to fracture brain

[13:40:53] <Lunia> those people areignorants full of prejudice
