[01:49:28] <wobniaR> I got the knockoff Flutterbat one and woona
[01:49:34] <Hamtramck> Tokusatsu: I want to buy a lot of Sega Saturn games. The problem is I did that already.

[01:50:09] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Hamtramck: That is a bad idea.
[01:50:10] <Eywind> No new Seventh_Element? :(
[01:50:11] <CyberFoxx> Huh, a De Beers ad on the radio? ^_^
[01:50:27] <Tavilicious> I love this song, I tried to request it last week :D Excellent song to end with.

[01:51:24] *** PinkiePie is now known as StrawberryDitz
[01:51:29] <Eywind> well we were trying to get it on LRT
[01:51:32] <Eywind> but no dice
[01:51:51] <Hamtramck> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dsk6Idl1-FA/VMONdbkFAvI/AAAAAAACIXk/AZmnP8WWXbI/s1600/shining.jpg anyway yeah, this could turn out cute or dumb looking. I wanna see it irl. Unless this was a fake leak in which case oh welpers.
[01:51:52] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Or just make your own plushy if that helps.
[01:51:54] <Tavilicious> OnlyFactory makes very nice plushes when they were available, not nearly a nice as commissions, but at 1/20th the price a lot more affordable for most
[01:52:07] <Hamtramck> God though IRL build a bears are creepy, like most of the people there are 60 year old women buying bear undergarments.
[01:52:11] <wobniaR> Onlyfactory are the knockoffs I'm talking about
[01:52:24] <StrawberryDitz> BAB stuff is over-priced.
[01:52:36] <StrawberryDitz> Half those clothes can be made or even bought with stuff from a crafts store for 1/100th the price.
[01:52:47] <wobniaR> They're not perfect but they're better than most of the other stuff at a more affordable price than custom-made
[01:52:53] *** Quits: misiek200m (miskof@mysterious.chocolate.muffin) (Quit: Yay!)
[01:53:04] <StrawberryDitz> And the business isn't that old but they charge more than Ty does for Ty Beanie Baby MLP stuff.
[01:53:14] <StrawberryDitz> Ty has a name you can rely on, I'm okay paying their price.
[01:53:20] <wobniaR> StrawberryDitz you can't just watch one youtube tutorial on plush making and become a master
[01:53:30] <Eywind> step 1: make pony out of material
[01:53:39] <Eywind> step 2: take filling from other lesser plushie and insert
[01:53:39] <Tavilicious> Indeed, I have a White Dove Rarity of the best minky, but seriously how many in the fandom can drop 300$ plus on a plush
[01:53:45] <Eywind> step 3: profit?
[01:53:46] <wobniaR> The people who make customs usually put years into that kind of practice
[01:53:55] <wobniaR> And making just one commission takes a lot of effort
[01:53:58] <StrawberryDitz> I was talking about the clothes.
[01:54:10] <StrawberryDitz> The plushies can still be found even cheaper with decent enough quality.
[01:54:54] <Araxnus> Ah here we go, Tavilicious .This is J's "Wall of shame" https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsiDHGxCUAAOcDe.jpg:large

[02:19:19] <StrawberryDitz> I didn't follow them back myself.
[02:19:27] <StrawberryDitz> Bronymate and some other dating site for bronies exists.
[02:19:34] <Hamtramck> well
[02:19:38] <Hamtramck> oh that reminds me
[02:19:48] <Hamtramck> I have this bottle of guayusa, which is related to yerba mate
[02:19:53] <Hamtramck> and it has a warning on the side about caffeine
[02:20:10] <Hamtramck> "Caution: Not recommended for children under the age of 12, pregnant, or nursing women and other people sensitive to caffeine."
[02:20:40] <Hamtramck> The fun thing with ambiguous parses is that you can read that as being targetted at children who are nursing women and other people sensitive to caffeine
[02:20:48] <Tavilicious> Sounds like a rather interesting drink :D
[02:21:15] <Hamtramck> It's in the holly family.
[02:21:19] <Hamtramck> Lot of caffeine.
[02:21:33] <Hamtramck> Not nearly as strong tasting as yerba mate, though I think mate's smoked before it's brewed.
[02:21:54] <Tavilicious> Probably makes it popular, high caffine energy drikns seem to be al lthe rage nowadays
[02:22:56] <Hamtramck> This is a traditional south american thing :V
[02:22:59] <Tavilicious> Oh, and as fior BronyMate, I did follow them back, they do send out funny tweets every now and then

[23:51:56] <Eywind> Hey parchy
[23:52:09] <M3reel|Live> found some remix of an older track today XD
[23:52:29] <Cloud_Zephyr> it appears the tweeter has stopped working
[23:52:32] <Eywind> Oh infinity like 2006 remix?
[23:52:50] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuuu mai treble
[23:52:59] <Eywind> 2009? 2012? whatever, some year.
[23:53:03] <Eywind> Ah interesting
[23:53:38] <Eywind> M3reel|Live, fun fact for Infinity: I coded a game when I was in high school, some cheesy RPG I never finished but people played anyways.  The intro song for the game was a midi of Infinity.  I had no idea what the original song was until I heard the song on Sirius a couple years ago lol
[23:53:39] <Cloud_Zephyr> also my amp stinks of dodgy electronics
[23:53:58] <M3reel|Live> lol 
[23:54:13] <Eywind> Legends of Might was quite a fun game though

[23:55:05] <Hamtramck> o
[23:55:11] <Eywind> I coded a few -- one was a perfect emulation of Dragon Warrior Monsters from the GBC
[23:55:26] <Eywind> including the map moving only when you walked off the edge when in towns
