[01:00:44] <Phase4> older thinkpad, bug in the wifi driver i'm guessing
[01:00:55] <Phase4> don't think it crashed over ethernet

[01:02:41] <Phase4> tried 3 times to make sure it wasn't a coincidence
[01:03:05] <Colgate> I don't think it would be the wifi driver, since isn't youtube tls only now?
[01:03:20] <Phase4> it was many years ago
[01:03:23] <wolfyshy> wifi is just a network card
[01:03:29] <wolfyshy> TLS goes over it the same as other protocols
[01:03:40] <Colgate> yes, but the point was that the data sent would be different every time
[01:03:46] <Colgate> since tls
[01:03:50] <wolfyshy> it was probably the weight of how youtube pushes at max speed in the start, then trickles, then pushes max speed again, as it buffers
[01:04:12] <wolfyshy> that actually killed a buggy gigE driver back when I was testing gigE on linux
[01:04:14] <wolfyshy> back when it was new
[01:04:49] <Phase4> Colgate, wifi driver is what i concluded at the time, could have been anything tbh
[01:04:59] <Phase4> but that particular video reliably bluescreened my machine
[01:05:26] <Colgate> just... odd

[01:17:51] <wolfyshy> holy moly what
[01:17:55] <wolfyshy> I need this
[01:18:11] <sniperfox> You know how when you first cold load up firefox all your tabs are kind of grey out
[01:18:23] <sniperfox> BarTab Heavy lets them return to that state after they idle too long
[01:18:30] <wolfyshy> wow

[01:23:39] <wolfyshy> sniperfox: they don't work, they're slow, they eat RAM, they eat CPU, they crash, they can't handle connection interruptions (which happen A LOT when you're tethered to a phone)
[01:23:50] <wolfyshy> no thank you no thank you no thank you I'll stick by Thunderbird
[01:24:05] <JustAberrant> thunderbird sucks
[01:24:07] <JustAberrant> :(
[01:24:24] <JustAberrant> imo there is no decent open source desktop email client ..
[01:24:48] <JustAberrant> outlook is one of the few things windows got that actually doesn't suck (at least the client.. mostly)
[01:25:02] <JustAberrant> I find thunderbird clunky and unreliable
[01:25:14] <JustAberrant> gmail _was_ good.. but they keep penising with the UI
[01:26:20] <ola> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14556313/PowerMacintoshG3IsBestMac.png
[01:26:29] <ola> outlook sucked and always will
[01:26:37] <ola> Sylpheed is best client
[01:27:33] <wolfyshy> outlook is okay
[01:27:36] <Colgate> I would consider using bartab... if I had memory issues
[01:27:41] <wolfyshy> ola: no ShadowIRC?  SHAME!
[01:28:04] <ola> wolfyshy: i mean mail
[01:28:07] <Colgate> also, I use thunderbird as well
[01:28:11] <ola> wolfyshy: and for IRC, hrm... only Weechat!
[01:28:13] <wolfyshy> and no classila
[01:28:21] <ola> wolfyshy: ah
[01:28:30] <ola> wolfyshy: the compatibility isn't still as good as i wish it was
[01:28:36] <ola> wolfyshy: and again, i use irc from shell
[01:29:06] <wolfyshy> ssh on OS 9?  how?!
[01:29:25] <Colgate> I tried using mutt, but I couldn't get into it
[01:29:40] <ola> wolfyshy: nio, i don;'t do this, although there IS a program for that
[01:36:16] <tiwake> outlook? including all its security issues?
[01:37:07] <wolfyshy> there haven't been a whole lot of them, at least not disclosed, in many years
[01:37:27] <wolfyshy> the problem is, outlook grew out of microsoft's internal mail solution, where all senders could be trusted
[01:37:29] <JustAberrant> tiwake: tthe client ;p
[01:37:33] <wolfyshy> it was not designed for the 'real' internet
[01:37:39] <wolfyshy> so the first few versions trusted too much
[01:37:40] <JustAberrant> * the
[01:37:48] <JustAberrant> by all accounts, exchange server is a pile of shit
[01:37:51] <JustAberrant> but the client is nice ;p
[01:37:53] <wolfyshy> they've locked it down starting with the 2002/2003 versions and I don't think I've even heard of any vulns in 2010/2013
[01:38:12] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: exchange server is shit mainly because for 10 mailboxes it uses about 4 GB RAM
[01:38:22] <wolfyshy> sweet jesus, I run 100 mailboxes off 1 GB RAM with dovecot+qmail
[01:38:41] <wolfyshy> (mail for the local LUG + friends + family)
[01:39:19] <tiwake> they kinda stopped making the client though didnt they?
[01:40:03] <wolfyshy> nope, outlook still exists
[01:40:31] <JustAberrant> I just find it integrates with everything really well
[01:40:39] <JustAberrant> communicator, calendar, etc
[01:41:34] <JustAberrant> thunderbird and friends just feel really rough and unpolished by comparison
[01:41:35] <tiwake> meh
[01:41:37] <wolfyshy> netscape used to do that
[01:41:42] <wolfyshy> back in the 90s
[01:41:54] <JustAberrant> hehe
[01:42:06] <wolfyshy> in 1998, I was one of the first people to use their 'collabra' thing, integrated calendar / group todo list / etc
[01:42:08] <JustAberrant> oh yeah.. netscape communicator was actually decent too.. in it's time
[01:42:15] <wolfyshy> it was quite nice
[01:42:30] <wolfyshy> the problem was navigator would crash with too many CSS rules...
[01:42:38] <JustAberrant> it's nice to be able to email someone a task
[01:42:40] <wolfyshy> you can imagine how well it fares now...
[01:42:49] <JustAberrant> or get an email, click a button, and have it added to your task list
[01:42:52] <JustAberrant> or your calendar
[01:42:53] <JustAberrant> etc
[01:42:53] <wolfyshy> YES
[01:43:01] <wolfyshy> netscape 4 and outlook 98 both pioneered that
[01:43:21] <JustAberrant> not great for large scale project managementr
[01:43:23] <wolfyshy> google's tried something similar with their calendar/mail thing but it doesn't feel quite as nice
[01:43:33] <JustAberrant> but quick "oh I gotta get back to that guy" type stuff.. works wonders
[01:45:18] <tiwake> never had to do that before
[01:46:30] <tiwake> IRC has always been my preferred method of communication
[01:48:01] <tiwake> also
[01:48:11] <tiwake> I still want AMD to release their A1100 processor
[01:48:29] <JustAberrant> yeah but you don't strike me as someone who communicates with co-workers/managers/customers on a constant basis ;p
[01:48:54] <tiwake> JustAberrant: I have rather recently, with my shiny new CNC machine shop business
[01:49:34] <JustAberrant> yeah, but I'm guessing you don't have a few dozen people you need to talk to daily ;p
[01:50:58] <tiwake> not yet
[01:51:04] <tiwake> getting there
[01:52:17] <tiwake> is a MIPS based motherboard and processor I can just buy?
[01:52:35] <JustAberrant> point is, email starts to make a lot more sense when things scale up ;p
[01:54:45] <tiwake> right now we have two main customers that we push a lot of product for both
[01:56:27] <tiwake> we (I) have been working closely with a startup company for designing, prototyping, and production of competition archery equipment
[01:57:25] <tiwake> if you hunt or shoot bow competitively, look out for performance archery gear... they will be on the rise :)
[01:57:44] <JustAberrant> :)
[01:57:58] <wolfyshy> tiwake: MIPS, you might want to look at Loongson boards
[01:58:00] <wolfyshy> that's mips64 though
[01:59:16] <tiwake> wolfyshy: not the same thing?
[01:59:47] <wolfyshy> tiwake: well it's 64-bit, the same way 64-bit intel core 2 duo isn't the same architecture as 32-bit intel pentium 3/4
[02:00:31] <tiwake> wolfyshy: oh, thats no problem... I just want a nice not-x86 based server for my own home use
[02:00:45] <JustAberrant> sounds reasonable
[02:00:59] <Phase4> wolfyshy, aren't loongson the ones who did that accelerated x86 emulation thing?
[02:01:00] <JustAberrant> cause you know, using a platform that most of the software you'll want to use was primarily developed for is silly ;p
[02:01:05] <wolfyshy> MIPS is more suited for embedded/routers/stuff... you could run a server on it but for servers I'd more readily recommend one of tyan's POWER boards
[02:01:08] <wolfyshy> it's good
[02:01:22] <JustAberrant> you want something where there'll be untold weird issues that most devs won't give a shit about because who the hell uses MIPS ;p
[02:01:39] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: every cisco router made since 2008, both enterprise and consumer
[02:01:56] <JustAberrant> which is great if your making a router ;p
[02:02:06] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: some brocade switches, some netgear consumer routers though there are a lot of arm ones there
[02:02:09] <wolfyshy> well
[02:02:11] <wolfyshy> they all run linux
[02:02:13] <JustAberrant> running ngnix on it or whatever.. maybe not ;p

[02:03:04] <wolfyshy> yes they are
[02:03:05] <wolfyshy> I hate them
[02:03:09] <wolfyshy> but they use MIPS underneath
[02:03:11] <tiwake> JustAberrant: hey, the MIPS assembly instruction set is pretty nice
[02:03:14] <wolfyshy> it is
[02:03:30] * wolfyshy <- former hobby kernel dev, still contributes to linux and freebsd
[02:03:55] * wolfyshy has a few SGI boxes, R5k and R10k mostly
[02:03:59] <tiwake> ARM is slightly clunkier, but still flankloads better than X86
[02:04:03] * JustAberrant slacker, doesn't contribue shit to anything any more
[02:04:25] <wolfyshy> tiwake: I really recommend POWER, it is very well supported by everything, ubuntu even has a power distribution iirc
[02:04:44] <tiwake> wolfyshy: PowerPC?
[02:04:50] <tiwake> or Power7?
[02:04:50] <wolfyshy> not quite
[02:04:53] <wolfyshy> power7/8
[02:05:02] <tiwake> you cant buy just a botherboard though
[02:05:10] <tiwake> I dont want a U-rack mount thing
[02:05:32] <tiwake> at least you cant as far as I know

[02:05:49] <wolfyshy> oh, you don't want a rack mount
[02:05:55] <wolfyshy> you can run them not in a rack, fwiw
[02:06:01] <JustAberrant> (kidding aside, some of the VME stuff I've worked on is the nicest gear I've ever dealt with)

[02:06:52] <JustAberrant> and still survive being dropped like 3 feet
[02:07:04] <tiwake> wolfyshy: http://tiwake.com/img_0063_small.jpg is what my goal is
[02:07:18] <tiwake> smallest volume possible, and rather low power
[02:07:22] <wolfyshy> oh wow
[02:07:28] <wolfyshy> you definitely want loongson then
[02:07:30] <JustAberrant> also you can get powerpc boards for them ;p
[02:07:31] <wolfyshy> or another MIPS board
[02:07:50] <wolfyshy> gentoo has a stage3 for loongson
[02:07:56] <tiwake> that box is 8"x9"x9.5" :P

[02:09:14] <wolfyshy> ARM really sucks, just my opinion though
[02:09:40] <wolfyshy> aarch64 which is 64-bit ARM is much better
[02:09:41] <tiwake> hmm
[02:10:13] <wolfyshy> unfortunately the only production aarch64 machines I know of are SoCs, samsung galaxys, and apple iphones
[02:10:15] <wolfyshy> :P
[02:10:16] <tiwake> the A1100 is def. 64bit...
[02:10:43] <wolfyshy> ah, if that is the case then that should be okay as a server I suppose
[02:11:20] <tiwake> yeah I wouldent want 32bit
[02:11:42] <tiwake> as far as I know it will work with DDR4 ECC memory
[02:13:22] <tiwake> my old intel atom D510 is getting old too

[05:41:36] <Chocolate_Chip> No error. The metadata just isn't relaying

[05:49:17] <Chocolate_Chip> hmm. k
[05:49:24] <Phase4> Chocolate_Chip, it's pulling the same stream, probably just looking for different tags
[05:49:39] <Chocolate_Chip> Uh...
[05:50:18] <Phase4> no idea where geherh6e5 is coming from

[05:51:07] <Chocolate_Chip> See. I just changed it. My only problem is this player isn't showing it
[05:51:48] <Chocolate_Chip> I found a better player, which charged money to relay it. I found JSPlayer, which is beyond my understanding so I sorta abandoned that

[05:55:16] <JustAberrant> sounds like a denture adhesive product :(
[05:55:24] <Blackjack> :(
[05:55:50] <Phase4> Chocolate_Chip, for example, you can get libraries that implement websockets for browsers that don't support them via a flash plugin
[05:56:05] <Chocolate_Chip> k...
[05:56:06] <Phase4> presents the same api either way so your code doesn't need to know about it
[05:56:55] <Phase4> Chocolate_Chip, point is: <audio><source href="http://24.20.13.79:80/stream"/></audio> should work on every browser with one of those
[05:57:02] <Phase4> i don't think that's the right syntax, dont' remember
[05:57:15] <Chocolate_Chip> it does
[05:57:22] <Chocolate_Chip> But my problem is metadata
[05:57:30] <Chocolate_Chip> Now playing, Stream Name
[05:57:33] <Chocolate_Chip> That stuff
[05:57:56] <Phase4> Chocolate_Chip, the issue is you're not sending metadata
[05:58:10] <Chocolate_Chip> I linked you my XSL
[05:58:15] <Phase4> where's icecast getting the stream?
[05:58:24] <Chocolate_Chip> localhost
[05:58:38] <Chocolate_Chip> 24.20.13.79:8000
[05:58:59] <Phase4> that is the icecast server
[05:59:26] <Chocolate_Chip> yeah
[05:59:42] <Phase4> what's putting audio into that is what i want to know
[05:59:47] <Chocolate_Chip> Ah
[05:59:58] <Chocolate_Chip> Line in connected to my radio. I'm sdtreaming static to test it
[06:00:16] <Phase4> well the radio obviously isn't emiting metadata
[06:00:31] <Chocolate_Chip> But my broadcaster is
[06:00:41] <Chocolate_Chip> BUTT (Broadcast With This Tool)
[06:00:52] <Phase4> o_O
[06:00:54] <Chocolate_Chip> And I see it on the Icecast Server's public home

[06:03:05] <Chocolate_Chip> Do you see the problem?
[06:03:27] <Chocolate_Chip> it has to be in my XSL

[06:06:05] <Phase4> reading
[06:06:20] <Phase4> http://icecast.org/ices/docs/ices-2.0.2/inputs.html list "metadatafilename" as a way to specify metadata

[06:06:46] <Chocolate_Chip> That's an old versuioinm though
[06:08:20] <Phase4> don't know then
[06:08:26] <Chocolate_Chip> I don't evben see the directory it's refering to
[06:09:13] <Chocolate_Chip> Wait
[06:09:20] <Chocolate_Chip> This is their own broadcaster
[06:09:26] <Chocolate_Chip> I said I'm using BUTT
[06:09:36] <Chocolate_Chip> I configured the metadta di nthat
[06:09:48] <Chocolate_Chip> it is appearing on the public home, on port 80

[06:11:13] <PinkiePieBot> [ Icecast Docs — Config File ]
[06:11:51] <Chocolate_Chip> I read this already
[06:12:01] <Phase4> that seems to be what you want, the stream-name and stream-description tags
[06:12:06] <Phase4> your config isn't using them
[06:12:23] <Chocolate_Chip> I added them, and it overwrote the BUTT meta
[06:12:31] <Chocolate_Chip> And still ddidn't broadcast to the player...
[06:12:55] <Phase4> can you set them again and i'll check what's actually in the stream?
[06:13:54] <Chocolate_Chip> It's broadcasting already
[06:13:56] <Chocolate_Chip> Never stopped
[06:14:08] <Chocolate_Chip> 21:03:

[06:14:27] <Chocolate_Chip> yep
[06:14:30] <Phase4> so your player is the problem
[06:14:35] <Chocolate_Chip> You sure?
[06:14:50] <Phase4> well i don't know, all it's sending is icy-title

[06:14:59] <PinkiePieBot> [ stream24™ - Flash / HTML5 web radio livestream player ]
[06:15:04] <Chocolate_Chip> It's not even sending that
[06:15:22] <Chocolate_Chip> he correct recognition of the stream status and META data on external Icecast servers requires that the mountpoint is non hidden (configuration: <hidden>0</hidden>). The file status.xsl must be available inside the "web"-directory as well.
[06:15:28] <Chocolate_Chip> All this is true
[06:16:48] <Chocolate_Chip> The META-data (broadcast, title | charset ISO-8859-1) are read directly from the stream server and are updated automatically every 60 seconds
[06:16:51] <Chocolate_Chip> Correct
[06:17:02] <Phase4> no idea then
[06:17:03] <Chocolate_Chip> is it the players falt then?
[06:17:32] <Phase4> you're sending icy-title, it's ignoringi t
[06:17:36] <Chocolate_Chip> If it's the player, I'm going to be so mad. IU've been working on it on and off since noon
[06:18:04] <Phase4> if that's not the tag it's looking for then *shrug* i'm still not sure how these bits are pieced together
[06:19:46] <Chocolate_Chip> Well, fuck
[06:21:25] <Chocolate_Chip> So, if I did find a working player, everythign is set up to strem the the metadata, right?

[07:24:41] <Moonlightning> Any suggestions, then?
[07:25:07] <Moonlightning> Preferably something with per-window or per-tab process separation, so that one derpy page doesn't bring down the entire session (a la Safari)
[07:25:21] <Moonlightning> And also something that isn't a total resource hog
[07:25:58] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: yeah there's literally nothing, Firefox is what I recommend
[07:26:08] <wolfyshy> they are working towards process separation
[07:26:15] <Moonlightning> … :|
[07:26:17] <wolfyshy> it hasn't happened yet
[07:26:19] <Moonlightning> How about Chromium?
[07:26:21] <wolfyshy> there's some tests in Nightly
[07:26:42] <Moonlightning> My browser tends to stay running as long as my IRC client and my OS
[07:26:47] <Moonlightning> i.e. all the fuckin' time
[07:27:03] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: I've hit 12 days uptime with firefox, it only uses ~700-800MB RAM here with 31 tabs open
[07:27:15] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: but it will easily go to 2gb if I try and watch flash videos in hd
[07:27:20] <wolfyshy> but that's because flash is sucky
[07:27:21] <wolfyshy> and stupid
[07:27:23] <wolfyshy> and needs to die
[07:27:30] <wolfyshy> .... :o oopsie, got a little sidetracked
[07:27:34] <Moonlightning> 12 days?
[07:27:37] <Moonlightning> Try two months
[07:27:43] <wolfyshy> I reboot a lot, kernel development does that
[07:27:55] <wolfyshy> some things you can't test in VMs
[07:27:56] <Moonlightning> Also, again, process separation…
[07:28:05] <Moonlightning> I really can't have one page bringing down my entire session
[07:28:10] <Moonlightning> That's a deal breaker
[07:28:11] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: well, firefox has pluginviewer/nsp.bin which separates flash
[07:28:19] <Moonlightning> wat?
[07:28:25] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: I can kill those processes and still have a usable browser
[07:28:25] <Moonlightning> (I am working on bailing from Chrome right now though)
[07:28:34] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: like Chrome's "Plugin Process"
[07:28:40] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: Firefox's name is "pluginviewer"
[07:29:32] <Moonlightning> So…what should I assume? :/
[07:29:34] <Moonlightning> Because…geez…
[07:30:05] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: if you continue to use chrome, multiple governments (at least the US and UK) can see everything, is what you should assume
[07:30:08] <wolfyshy> oh, and AU
[07:30:25] <Moonlightning> Fuck.
[07:30:30] <Moonlightning> So I need to change passwords and shit. :/

[07:37:22] <Blackjack> Hey Moonlightning, the Linux kernel has a backdoor in it, all keys and mouse input are logged and screenshots are taken every 10 seconds, Better switch to BSD.
[07:37:39] <tiwake> heh
[07:40:04] <Moonlightning> I should be using more FOSS anyway
[07:40:38] <tiwake> huh, why is my firefox crashing
[07:41:01] <Blackjack> Moonlightning: I have your alternative
[07:41:06] <Blackjack> It's called "chromium"
[07:41:09] <Googie> Moving away from Google dependence was my biggest reason for switching back to Firefox, before a lot of the Snowden leaks.
[07:41:48] <Blackjack> Does nobody know about Chromium .-.
[07:42:17] <tiwake> apt-get install chromium
[07:42:18] <Googie> Sure, but I'd rather support Mozilla.
[07:42:27] <Blackjack> I wouldn't
[07:42:32] <tiwake> why?
[07:42:45] <Blackjack> Because I don't like their software :(
[07:43:00] <tiwake> chromium does not have tab groups
[07:43:08] <tiwake> at least not last I knew
[07:43:12] <Moonlightning> I do have a challenge, though, wolfyshy
[07:43:18] <Googie> Still Google "dependence" with Chromium. Firefox's e10s is also going to be released soon, which will be a major improvement.
[07:43:19] <Moonlightning> Why isn't this mentioned on the Wikipedia article?
[07:43:26] <Moonlightning> e10s?
[07:43:44] <Googie> Moving to a multi-process model with sandboxing.
[07:43:51] <Blackjack> What is a tab group.
[07:44:09] <Blackjack> Googie: You have the option to login to a Google account 
[07:44:12] <Blackjack> That's not dependence
[07:44:21] <tiwake> Blackjack: http://i.i.cbsi.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim//2010/08/24/firefox-panorama.jpg
[07:44:41] <tiwake> that is 4 different tab groups
[07:44:49] <Blackjack> Such a thing does not seem useful at all to me :P
[07:45:04] <tiwake> its fantastically useful for me :P
[07:45:10] <Googie> It is dependence, just look at what happened with IE6 :P
[07:45:17] <Blackjack> I don't understand
[07:45:31] <Googie> Everyone using the same browser is a bad thing. Everyone depending on Google's choices is a bad thing
[07:45:40] <Blackjack> I'm not depending on anything
[07:45:55] <Googie> Sure you are. You always have to depend on something
[07:45:57] <Blackjack> I can fork Chromium right now and make it sync to my own server
[07:46:05] <Blackjack> I can do whatever I want to use it
[07:46:16] <Blackjack> Sure, I'm depending on something, I'm depending on blackjack-browser now
[07:46:31] <Blackjack> The only solution is apparently to not use the computer
[07:46:33] <Googie> Yeah, you can, congrats, now you have a fork that nobody cares about and will never get merged upstream, and is still dependant on Chromium for updates.
[07:46:48] <Blackjack> Why would I want it to be merged?
[07:46:58] <Blackjack> The whole point would be to make my own changes, for me.
[07:47:46] <Googie> The point is, Chromium (which is mostly Google) still decides for you, simply because they have the manpower to actually maintain Chrome/Chromium properly.
[07:48:07] <Blackjack> So what is your solution?
[07:48:24] <Blackjack> Use Firefox and rely on Mozilla?
[07:48:36] <Googie> Trading Google dependence for Mozilla dependence.
[07:48:49] <Blackjack> ...Why?
[07:49:13] <Googie> Because I don't trust Google, and I think they are getting a little too much market control in too many areas.
[07:49:15] <Blackjack> Why should I trust people who make a slow, non-threaded browser and a mail client that crashes if I have any reasonable amount of mail?
[07:50:31] <Googie> Why should I trust a company that has been shown to have major privacy issues ?
[07:50:45] <Blackjack> At least their browser is good.
[07:51:04] <Googie> Firefox is pretty good also :V

[07:53:17] <wolfyshy> they haven't.

[07:53:38] <Blackjack> I could self-host my own email but I don't own the domain I'm using so it'd be a pain to swith over

[08:25:58] <Moonlightning> I mean, I'm all for helping improve stuffs, but obviously I don't want e.g. what sites I visit to be in any way linked with any personally-identifiable information
[08:26:01] <Moonlightning> including stuff like IP
[08:31:59] <Fallfeathers> Who wants to take a look at my firewall rules with me to see why they aren't working
[08:34:14] * Moonlightning raises hoof
[08:35:02] <worthless> why what isn't working about them?
[08:36:21] <Fallfeathers> This company's IP phone provider is trying to access a device on the LAN from the WAN through port 3306. I've created a SAT rule which forwards incoming connections from the WAN to the device, and then an Allow rule after that to allow incoming traffic from the WAN to access the device on 3306. However they're still unable to connect and portscanning says the port isn't open.
[08:37:07] <worthless> Behind a router?
[08:37:16] <Fallfeathers> Router/firewall combo
[08:37:53] <worthless> Set port forwarding from the destination port to the internal IP/port?
[08:38:08] <Fallfeathers> Yep, that's what the SAT rule does
[08:39:02] <worthless> not sure without looking. besides you would be better off with help from someone else besides me

[21:36:05] <Twilightlicious> i'm thinking about getting the GTX 960
[21:36:10] <Twilightlicious> because it's cheap :3
[21:36:24] <Twilightlicious> But it only has one DVI port.
[21:36:53] <Twilightlicious> which means i plan on keeping my current GPU attached as well for my 2nd moniter.
[21:37:06] <locodash11[server]> gotta get some old radeon cards, still more powerful, and cheaper

[21:45:02] <Kinsley> Twilightlicious: the 960 has at least one DisplayPort output as well, yeah?
[21:45:17] <Kinsley> Because you can get a DisplayPort to DVI adapter for like $8
[21:48:42] <Twilightlicious> I need Display port to VGA
[21:48:55] <Twilightlicious> Which exists, but.

[21:54:08] <Twilightlicious> thats why im getting a 960 lol
[21:54:57] <Twilightlicious> i could get one new moniter as my main moniter that supports displayport?
[21:55:03] <Twilightlicious> and then use my current DVI moniter as my 2nd.
[22:01:07] <wolfyshy> I haven't had any issue with dp->vga
[22:01:23] <AppleDash> Twilightlicious: Using 2 different GPUs to drive 2 different monitors is not ideal, and I'm not certain if it will even /work.
[22:01:26] <wolfyshy> it's worked well for me, up to 1600x1200.. never tried with 1920x1080... might be blurry because they didn't set the resolution right
[22:01:28] <AppleDash> /work/*
[22:01:34] <wolfyshy> with those adaptors, you have to set the mode manually
[22:01:39] <wolfyshy> the reviewer may not have known that
[22:01:51] <Twilightlicious> i had a DVI to VGA adapter be blurry once.
[22:02:02] <Twilightlicious> And it wasnt because of the resolution
[22:02:09] <Twilightlicious> was a cheap chinese adapter lol
[22:02:15] <AppleDash> Then it was because of your GPU
[22:02:26] <Twilightlicious> no because another adapter worked fine
[22:02:29] <AppleDash> A DVI to VGA adaptor is literally just a thing that connects pins together
[22:03:02] <wolfyshy> well
[22:03:05] <wolfyshy> DVI-A to VGA is
[22:03:11] <wolfyshy> DVI-D to VGA is a bit different
[22:03:17] <wolfyshy> rather
[22:03:19] <AppleDash> That;s no longer an adaptor
[22:03:21] <wolfyshy> DVI-A to VGA is just pins
[22:03:35] <wolfyshy> sure it is, it's an adaptor with a lil chip inside to convert digital signals to analogue
