[00:00:00] <Colgate> with lightirc, if you accidently have 2 copies of it open, it can mess with it and cause problems with constant reconnects, can you make sure you only have the one open?
[00:00:27] <Star_Spotter> well i did have two open and that messed with it, but it never has before
[00:00:36] <Star_Spotter> and i dont have it right now

[22:57:00] <Starthunder> Well, I just googled /my IP address/ and got a v6 address back
[22:57:26] <Starthunder> And it checks out with `ifconfig
[22:57:26] <Starthunder> `
[22:57:58] <Colgate> try an unencrypted port
[22:58:05] <Colgate> and see if it connects through and receives data
[22:58:26] <Colgate> the ircd should send 1-2 lines

[22:59:39] <Starthunder> It's just not linked into /usr/local/bin
