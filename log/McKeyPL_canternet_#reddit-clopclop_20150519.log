[04:51:31] <samonuh> ???
[04:51:32] <Vulpixbrew> ^this
[04:51:46] <Flame> it's simple: click the adblock button, "disable adblock on 12345.com"
[04:51:47] <Wikkit> well you could just block yt with it 
[04:51:56] <samonuh> Nah
[04:51:56] <SoniaEV> In adblock, when you go to a site, you can tell it to not block ads on that site
[04:52:07] <samonuh> I'll just be irrational

[07:01:10] <iamalion> no worries
[07:03:11] <iamalion> so i normally dont trust bungee cords right
[07:03:20] <iamalion> and i needed to adjust the derailer on my bike
[07:03:35] <iamalion> so i used a bungee cord to hang a metal hook from the garage rafters
[07:03:40] <iamalion> which i used to suspend my buke
[07:03:49] <iamalion> so im down there pedaling it by hand tuning it

[11:35:18] <Melon_Phone> ok guys
[11:35:45] <Melon_Phone> would you rather orgasm every time you sneeze or sneeze every time you orgasm?
[11:36:19] <Cel> wait... that's not the same?
[11:36:47] <Katiepony> As someone with a cold at the moment
[11:36:52] <Katiepony> i can confirm it is the same
[11:37:17] <Katiepony> Or, at least, sneezing feels like an orgasm ¦3
[11:37:26] <Melon_Phone> like when you get a fit of sneezes, you orgasm as much
[11:37:53] <Melon_Phone> or when you orgasm you sneeze hard
[11:38:05] <Melon_Phone> it wouldn't loop 
[11:38:41] <Melon_Phone> ok fuck it

[12:04:24] <Melon_Phone> would you guys rather have a full on orgasm each time you sneeze or have the phone right each time you orgasm

[12:10:06] <Katiepony> I'm never in public :3
[12:10:09] <Katiepony> And I'm ill all the time
[12:10:25] <Katiepony> It would make being sick a lot better. Probably more tiring, though.
