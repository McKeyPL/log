[09:13:41] <MirSar> yeah, quiet day at work and my boss have taken the day off, so I can actually chat a bit ^^
[09:14:23] <TheFlutterGuy> very evil morning.
[09:14:25] <MirSar> Usually he walks behind uss making sure we're not on Facebook, youtube, IRC and other non-work related stuff -.-
[09:14:46] <TheFlutterGuy> there is an orc code that makes the chat look like .net code.
[09:14:51] <TheFlutterGuy> irc client
[09:15:20] <MirSar> Problem is that I'm support, not a coder :P
[09:15:23] <Electron> as if that stuff can interfere the work drastically :|
[09:15:35] <MirSar> ^exactly what I said
[09:16:21] <Electron> have you watched new 6 episodes?
[09:16:22] <MirSar> A human needs time to just do nothing, a breake from what we define as work and just relax
[09:16:52] <MirSar> I've watched the first 2 eppisodes on the release day, but nothing more yet

[13:20:32] <JustKayneNL> is it legal there?
[13:20:40] <Lunia> i smoke. i dont care about peoples opinion

[13:21:15] <Lunia> oh i smoge a lot of that
[13:22:14] <MirDurr> Lucky bastard who can smoke pot without worrying about any laws...
[13:22:14] <Lunia> i dont live in those places bye brb
[13:22:59] <JustKayneNL> pot is legal to prevent criminal activities
[13:23:43] <ArchPegasusMichael> Smoking pot seems a lot less health damaging than tobacco anyway.
[13:23:50] <JustKayneNL> true
[13:23:55] <MirDurr> exactly why it shoud just be legal everywhere, it's not addictive, better than tobaco and have a way better affect. it should be controlled like alcohol..
[13:24:00] <JustKayneNL> it´s even less addictive
[13:24:14] <TheFlutterGuy> ArchPegasusMichael: and less health damaging than alcohol
[13:24:15] <JustKayneNL> and tastes better
[13:24:23] <TheFlutterGuy> probably less than coffee too

[13:31:00] <Lunia> ?
[13:31:09] <JustKayneNL> not in the netherlands
[13:31:23] <Lunia> thats retarded
[13:31:32] <Electron> come on, get down already, MirDurr, there ain't no spider here
[13:31:51] <MirDurr> ....b..bbut..spider..
[13:31:56] <MirDurr> it can be ANYWHERE!
[13:32:04] <MirDurr> they are conspiering against uss!
[13:32:12] <MirDurr> Planing to take over the whole world!
[13:32:13] <WestJ> Retardation is more than just a mental condition. It is synonymous with inhibition.
[13:32:18] <Electron> calm down, I'll crush any spider for you, MirDurr
[13:32:20] <MirDurr> right beneath out hoves
[13:32:30] <JustKayneNL> brb baking bacon
[13:32:48] <WestJ> To retard means to slow, stop or inhibit.
[13:32:51] <MirDurr> I thought you fried bacon
[13:33:10] <JustKayneNL> no bake it´s esier
[13:33:25] <MirDurr> whatever floats your goat
[13:33:39] <Electron> oh, I think I now your nightmare now, MirDurr, it's a big spider with tentacles
[13:34:00] <MirDurr> Nahh Electron that's just a normal hentai dream :P
[13:34:07] <Electron> damn it
[13:34:08] <ArchPegasusMichael> XD
[13:34:12] <WestJ> Literally, a retarded person is a slow person. That's where the stigma arises, as with that label comes the attachment of being less.
[13:34:17] * Electron is shocked a bit
[13:34:41] <WestJ> High School English, anyone?
[13:34:45] <TheFlutterGuy> i take retard pills
[13:34:50] <TheFlutterGuy> as in, they are "slow acting".
[13:35:18] <WestJ> You get the idea, but not the context.
[13:35:19] <MirDurr> Does weed count as a retard smoke?
[13:35:54] <Electron> I get it now, all my country is on weeds considering your definition :D
[13:35:57] <TheFlutterGuy> Lunia: "is calling peoples Retards considered a major offence" <- yeah. 
[13:36:00] <WestJ> No, but weed could be called a retardant
[13:36:14] <MirDurr> ^ROFL
[13:36:33] <Electron> light up your retardant
[13:36:46] <Electron> get ready for flying as lightning
[13:37:38] <WestJ> Had the word been used differently, you could say those who waste your time or slow you down are "retards", however, it was society's choice to pin that name on the mentally infirm instead.
[13:37:41] <Electron> I call TheFlutterGuy as meanie, does it count as offence?
[13:38:40] <WestJ> Has TheFlutterGuy been frugal in his offers to you, Electron?
[13:39:05] <MirDurr> The current society and education systems are not buildt to teach you to think for yourself and be creative, it's madte to make you fall in line and accept the rules..
[13:39:11] <WestJ> If so, you could use the colloquium "meanie" in this context correctly.
[13:39:15] <Electron> no, he is generous
[13:39:32] <WestJ> Then that title doesn't apply

[13:43:58] <WestJ> You may need to re-evaluate your grading of pornography
[13:44:07] <JustKayneNL> and lolicon then?
[13:44:20] <WestJ> loli is short for lolicon iirc
