[12:50:07] <Twili> his own principles in life...I think *Trots off to find a book*
[12:50:28] <Joshua> Oh... I was on an empty chatroom. *hides head in shame*
[12:50:53] <Electron> what do you want?
[12:51:06] <Joshua> Look, I'm sorry for causing trouble here.
[12:51:20] <Electron> trouble? what trouble?
[12:51:58] <Joshua> Ponychat's going through server problems, so for now, this is the only IRC chatroom I can reach for help since I am banned from ponyimagenazis.com's IRC chatroom.
[12:52:17] <Joshua> I POST MY WORK ON THAT SITE TO MAKE THEM HAPPY, FOR CELESTIA'S SAKE!!!
[12:52:37] <Electron> but they are not, apparently :D
[12:52:46] <Joshua> UGGGHH!!
[12:52:58] <Joshua> Let me just show you what I'm talking about.

[12:53:06] <Electron> you could hurt somepony's feelings
[12:53:28] <Joshua> And, just in case you might ask me, YES; she's wearing what you think she's wearing.
[12:53:58] <Electron> Twi in diaper, lawl
[12:54:13] <Joshua> I'm sorry, Electron. It's just that I got a little peeved after I caused a like/dislike war on that image. I was ALMOST on the verge of deleting it, but I have faves.

[12:54:54] <Electron> not bad Twi face though
[12:54:54] <Joshua> I can only hope that things cool off and this thing gets more likes than dislikes. I wasn't really expecting this at all!
[12:55:02] <Joshua> You think it's cute?

[12:55:16] <Joshua> I thought you'd might look at it in disgust, or something.
[12:55:48] <Electron> disgust? nope, it's definitely not disgust
[12:56:20] <Joshua> I'm glad you like it, but it's a diaper. Only people who would wear these kinds of things are babies and people who suffer from incontinence.
[12:56:41] <Electron> or just derping around
[12:56:54] <Joshua> Yeah, that too.

[12:58:04] <Electron> you got banned because of that picture?
[12:58:18] <Joshua> That was just one, but if I make more diapered pony images like that, I may have to post them on a different site. Even if it's clean, Derpiboo.ru just can't accept stuff like it.
[12:58:36] <Joshua> Also, no, I didn't get banned from the site thanks to that image, I got banned from it's IRC.
[12:58:56] <Electron> that's silly :)
[12:59:01] <Joshua> And WHY I got banned from the site's IRC, I'd rather not say. *blushes in embarrassement*
[12:59:17] <Electron> why? tell me
[12:59:22] <Joshua> Well...
[12:59:42] <DinkyDoo> Oh my...
[12:59:57] <Joshua> Okay. They thought I was overreacting over something that isn't very serious, or something.
[13:00:10] <Electron> what was that?
[13:00:10] <Twili> the same ip range or w/e as the example that guy asking about earlier was using as an example or true or give them ban, be aware....I think *Trots off to find a book*
[13:00:21] <Joshua> Well, technically, I have no idea why I was banned in the first place, but I guess they don't want me there.
[13:00:45] <Electron> what did you do there?
[13:00:57] <Joshua> On the IRC?
[13:01:14] <Electron> yes
[13:01:43] <Joshua> I used to come to them for council, but later on, I found out there are other chatrooms I can visit.
[13:02:18] <Electron> so? you joined wrong channel?
[13:02:32] <Joshua> I don't think so.
[13:02:59] <Electron> why they banned you? tell me
[13:03:14] <Joshua> I don't really know.
[13:03:32] <Joshua> They just kicked me out, and I never got a full explanation why.
[13:03:55] <Lunia> I wore a diaper like 2 weeks ago
[13:04:10] <Joshua> Really? What happened?
[13:04:29] <Electron> you blushed in embarrassment, Joshua, you know why they banned you but don'y want to tell me, right?
[13:05:07] <Joshua> I only blushed because it's kind of a degrading memory.
