[00:41:36] <Frosty> wat? What is mega?
[00:42:05] <RNGsus> each pokerman can carry a megastone which allows them to mega evolve in battle
[00:42:36] <Frosty> Like, forever? Or just until end of battle?
[00:42:48] <Frosty> And when did that shit happen?
[00:43:15] <RNGsus> whenever he presses the megaevolve button and till the end of battle
[00:43:28] <thaostra> Until they faint, more accurately
[00:43:55] <RNGsus> i dunno if they faint do they switch back until you exit the battle screen/
[00:43:58] <RNGsus> I dont think they do
[00:44:18] <thaostra> They stay Mega until they faint or the battle ends
[00:46:07] <Frosty> That sounds stupid.
[00:46:17] <Frosty> Do they just hit harder?
[00:46:23] <Frosty> and have thicker skin?
[00:46:33] <RNGsus> their stats change, usually for the better but not always
[00:46:53] <RNGsus> and its not stupid because now we get mega blazekin and mega lucario to jack off to
[00:47:14] <thaostra> Their stats change, they usually get a new ability, and sometimes they get a different typing
[00:48:05] *** Dusk is now known as Night
[00:48:56] <thaostra> For instance, one of Charizard's mega evolutions changes it from Fire/Flying to Fire/Dragon
[00:51:29] <RNGsus> Oh
[00:51:42] <RNGsus> Also you can only megaevolve one poksterman per battle
[00:54:53] <thaostra> And since a pokemon needs to hold a mega stone, they can't use hold items you'd normally use for competitive battling like Life Orb or Choice Band
[00:55:14] <thaostra> So there's some strategy involved in this mechanic

[02:52:51] <Vulpixbrew> heya expatriate
[02:53:29] <cloppyhooves> Tibetan foxes always look so done with everything D:
[02:53:47] <expatriate> hola
[02:53:51] <Vulpixbrew> but they are cute while doing it
[02:53:58] <expatriate> I just played my first formal game of DnD
[02:54:06] <expatriate> was p. fun
[02:54:14] <Vulpixbrew> sweet
[02:54:17] <Vulpixbrew> what ediion?
[02:54:35] <expatriate> 1st
[02:54:41] <Vulpixbrew> awesome
[02:55:07] <expatriate> our DM was raised playing it with his dad, who has just always played 1st ed since it came out
[02:55:33] <Frosty> I'm partial to 3.5.
[02:55:44] <Frosty> That's what I played. Didn't like 4th very much
[02:56:33] <Vulpixbrew> 4th edition made some decent changes to casters
[02:56:46] <Vulpixbrew> no more magic missile twice then wanting togo to bed
[02:57:47] <Frosty> I played as the assassins with the shourds. That was fun. 
[02:58:08] <Frosty> I just had a completely different DM who wasn't imaginative, so it wasn't as fun.
[02:58:22] <Vulpixbrew> hye expatriate what class did you take?
[02:58:34] <expatriate> Thief ^__^
[02:58:39] <Vulpixbrew> sweet
[02:58:43] <expatriate> I always play stealth classes in RPGs
[02:58:50] <Frosty> Me too
[02:59:01] <expatriate> too bad level 1 thieves in DnD are terrible at stealth haha
[02:59:13] <expatriate> dat 15% chance of hiding
[03:00:21] <expatriate> how does magic work in 4thEd? I do find the fixed number of spells per day thing kind of weird
[03:00:24] <Frosty> I always rolled pretty well. Except in combat. lol
[03:00:46] <expatriate> because you get in two fights and then have to find somewhere to sleep or else your casters are useless
[03:03:40] <Vulpixbrew> thats what 4th changed a bit of
[03:03:59] <Vulpixbrew> some spells have many unlimited used
[03:04:17] <Vulpixbrew> I really cna't remmeber what cause I only did a demo campain when it first came out

[04:54:06] <samonuh> I went to BronyCon 2012. It was horrendous
[04:54:21] <expatriate> and then rainbow rocks
[04:54:22] <expatriate> omg

[04:54:52] <samonuh> Hahahaha

[04:55:26] <expatriate> and then there was a problem so it couldn't be shown

[04:55:32] <samonuh> A lot of people here wear it well
[04:55:33] <expatriate> so this theater worker comes in to tell us
[04:55:44] <expatriate> and as soon as he sees us he just makes this pained expression

[10:10:57] <Vulpixbrew> if you haven't already get a mission editor and give your self Legion in 2 just after arring at Omega for the first time
[10:11:27] <Vulpixbrew> in ME2 of course
[10:11:54] <Katiepony> What happens? o:
[10:16:09] <Vulpixbrew> in masss effect 2 all the charaters at first were going to be unlockable, instead of the way it is, as development went along Bioware needed two disk for the consoles, so the way charater unlocks worked was changed to a progression, instead of deleting the content it was left in and with an editor you can unlock charaters early and hear quite a bit of unique dialog and convo opitions
[10:16:52] <Katiepony> oo :3

[18:48:21] <Melon_Phone> I guess I could go for the 113 for $170 
[18:48:27] <Evelina> Is it the same in that you can only have over planes per flight path?
[18:48:29] <RNGsus> #planesforlife
[18:48:44] <Vulpixbrew> over planes?
[18:48:51] <Evelina> In pocket trains each track is claimed by a train
[18:48:56] <Vulpixbrew> nooooo
[18:49:06] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[18:49:15] <Vulpixbrew> Planes can go to anyairport you want as long as you "own it"
[18:49:37] <Evelina> Oh that's a he'll of a lot less b.s.to put up with
[18:49:56] <Melon_Phone> http://i.imgur.com/yxUeK81.jpg <-best plane
[18:50:03] <Evelina> in pocket trains only one train per route. Ever.
[18:50:19] <Evelina> Those planes are fun to use melon

[18:50:39] <Evelina> I like trains but I think I'll try pocket planes
[18:50:50] <Evelina> Hah
[18:50:57] <RNGsus> http://www.richard-seaman.com/Wallpaper/Aircraft/Bombers/B25YankeeWarrior10oClock.jpg
[18:51:02] <RNGsus> Best plane or go home
[18:51:05] <Evelina> Sr71 black bird is best plane
[18:51:17] <Evelina> Or the a10
[18:51:23] <Vulpixbrew> yes the hog
[18:51:25] <RNGsus> wrong and wrong b 25 best plane evar
[18:51:40] <Vulpixbrew> just the BRRRRRRRRRP
[18:52:03] <Evelina> Please shoot our pilot and gunner add we just have glass protecting us
[18:52:13] <RNGsus> its armored glass
[18:52:26] <Evelina> Also that plane had no maneuverability
[18:52:35] <Melon_Phone> flying in gta is hard
[18:52:37] <RNGsus> Wanna know how much armor is protecting the a-10's computers used for targeting?
[18:52:40] <RNGsus> Jack shit
[18:52:53] <RNGsus> B-25 was maneuverable enough to be a ground attacker
[18:52:56] <Vulpixbrew> then again I like the b25 due to the dolittle raid
[18:53:20] <Evelina> A10 is the ground attacker
[18:53:33] <RNGsus> it is a ground attacker yes
[18:53:44] <Evelina> Cut tracks in half
[18:53:48] <Evelina> tanks
[18:53:55] <Evelina> anyway I gotta go
[18:54:02] <RNGsus> Apache is better
[18:54:05] <Evelina> work sucks
[18:54:10] <Vulpixbrew> aawwww

[18:54:56] <RNGsus> post pics of b 25s
[18:55:00] <Vulpixbrew> Apache is good but can't rplace what the a10 does RNGsus
[18:55:12] <RNGsus> Explain Vulpixbrew 
[18:55:36] <weisey> Not fast enough 
[18:55:43] <RNGsus> Fast?
[18:55:53] <RNGsus> The A-10 is slow as shit
[18:55:55] <Vulpixbrew> a-10 isnt that fast weisey
[18:56:01] <weisey> As in
[18:56:04] <weisey> Maximum forward velocity
[18:56:09] <RNGsus> It is very slow
[18:56:42] <weisey> Yeah but its faster than the apachw
[18:56:55] <RNGsus> And The F-15 strike eagle is twice as fast as the A-10 
[18:57:03] <RNGsus> Why not just use those?
[18:57:40] <Vulpixbrew> I mean the a-10 is a big tough machine, the apache/longbow by sheer nature being a helicopter is more fragile, then again they both have their own own roles
[18:57:55] <Vulpixbrew> f-15 can't lioter like an a-10 can
[18:58:00] <Vulpixbrew> fast mover
[18:58:06] <Vulpixbrew> drinks a lot of fuel
[18:58:16] <Frosty> A-10's are powerhouses, but they're being phased out
[18:58:59] <RNGsus> apache has a similar loiter time as the a-10
[18:59:15] <RNGsus> Except it can hover, and pop up over mountains 
[18:59:44] *** Quits: Melon_Phone (u931732@Pony-9jfb6q.dynamic.simnet.is) (Connection closed)
[18:59:53] <weisey> But it can more easily be taken out by smaller arms
[19:00:17] <RNGsus> How would the small arms kill you when you pop up over a mountain and go back down?
[19:00:47] <Frosty> The arguement isn't how, it's that they can.
[19:00:58] <Vulpixbrew> of course if we talk about time in air as far aclose supoort platforms go the AC-130 spooky has it all beat
[19:02:35] <RNGsus> Yeah
[19:02:35] <RNGsus> But one got shot down and that ruined the whole fun
[19:02:35] <RNGsus> A single sam will give the A-10 the hardest time
[19:02:50] <RNGsus> So fast movers need to clear the area of sams
[19:03:16] <RNGsus> But then if you already cleared the area of sams, anything will be able to kill light targets like people with ak 47s in houses
[19:04:16] <Vulpixbrew> well if you have sams your puttung nothing but the stealth planes up
[19:04:26] <Vulpixbrew> b-2 and now the f22
[19:04:29] <RNGsus> F-16s with magnums?
[19:04:48] <RNGsus> Er I mean anti radiation missiles
