[21:20:21] <Pony387> I feel like listening to music while studying helps a lot cause it rewards your brain as you go through stress rapidly strengthening the connections in your brain
[21:21:20] <Pony387> like as your brain gets tired the opiate release(or maybe endorphins) simultaneously re-up your energy making the recovery rate a bit more rapid
[21:21:53] <Vulpixbrew> they say chewing gum while studing and then chewing the smae flavor during the test helps
[21:22:38] <Pony387> that makes sense because your brain will associate the act of chewing that flavor of cum with the connections you made
[21:23:10] <Pony387> plus the sugar in the cum makes that reaction a positive one because opiates
[21:23:21] <cloppyhooves> I think your keyboard is broken
[21:23:36] <Pony387> no no I'm saying cum instead on purpose
[21:23:50] <Pony387> cause I like to be lewd
[21:24:30] <cloppyhooves> I don't think you can chew that D:
[21:24:53] <cloppyhooves> Also I think the brain doesn't release opiates
[21:25:06] <Pony387> what word am I thinking of then?
[21:25:25] <Melon_Phone> mmm, high protei cum. so chewy 
[21:25:42] <weisey> also sugar isnt derived from poppy seeds and flowers
[21:27:26] <Pony387> woops I mean dopamine

[21:30:58] <Luvbi> 13o.o I either spaced out for a really long time, or fell asleep...
[21:31:06] <Luvbi> 13I hate being sick like this. Ruins me
[21:31:22] <Luvbi> 13I'm going to go take more medicine. Be right back
[21:34:01] <Luvbi> 13>.> Yeah, just took my temperature too, fever back to 101
[21:34:09] <Luvbi> 13Someone take care of sick Luvbi ;-;
[21:34:09] <cloppyhooves> Awww :c
[21:34:31] <Luvbi> 13Cloppy <3 Make me feel better >.<
[21:34:37] * cloppyhooves offers hugs at the very least
[21:35:05] <cloppyhooves> Do you have a cold or the flu? D:
[21:36:32] <Luvbi> 13I don't know. I was pretty sick last night, fever of like 102.6. I've had some aches, especially in my back and legs. Other than that I have a bit of a sore throat
[21:36:55] <cloppyhooves> That sounds like the flu D:
[21:36:55] <Pony387> my mom is sick right now too so I've been putting a scarf over my face and gloves on every time I go upstairs
[21:37:06] <Pony387> not getting a virus a month before my big test >:C
[21:37:26] <Luvbi> 13My entire family has it in stages right now. It just kinda hit me like a brick wall though
[21:37:27] <Luvbi> 13Or a train
[21:37:31] <Luvbi> 13Whichever one is more painful
[21:37:40] <Luvbi> 13Probably the train
[21:37:55] <Pony387> the train has more velocity so I'd assume it hurts more
[21:38:02] <Luvbi> 13Yeah. That
[21:38:04] <Luvbi> 13Physics
[21:38:06] <cloppyhooves> That definitely sounds like the flu D:
[21:38:20] <Pony387> cumics
[21:38:32] <Luvbi> 13;-; I missed school today because of this. I don't wanna miss tomorrow >.>
[21:38:41] <cloppyhooves> :(
[21:38:43] <Pony387> what are you going to school for?
[21:39:02] <Melon_Phone> educatiooone
[21:39:27] <Pony387> I should ask everyone what they're working/going to school for that'd be a good convorsation starter.
[21:39:32] <Luvbi> 13Nothing yet. Still high school
[21:39:36] <weisey> The train could have a heck of a lot less velocity than the brick wall, it just has way more mass and therefore kinetic energy being transferred 
[21:39:48] <Melon_Phone> engineering
[21:40:31] <Pony387> I thought brick walls had more mass behind them since they're usually attatched to other brick walls and make up big buildings

[21:41:00] <Luvbi> 13I think the point of being hit by a brick wall is it's just that: A brick wall, nothing else
[21:41:11] <Pony387> the problem is that they're stagnant and so it depends on how fast you're going to them but a train can go even faster than you can
[21:41:14] <Luvbi> 13I always imagined someone building a random brick wall in the middle of the desert or something XD
[21:41:31] <Pony387> like in bugs bunny or road runner?
[21:41:35] <Luvbi> 13Yeah
[21:42:18] <Pony387> I remember seeing those cartoons where the guys are carrying glass and feeling sorry for them when someone ran into the glass and broke it
[21:42:31] <Pony387> poor glass movers just trying to do their jobs ;-;
