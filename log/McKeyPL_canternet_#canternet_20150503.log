[18:49:27] <Starthunder> Assuming you only have one connect block for general users…
[18:50:51] <Starthunder> Couldn't you just add `<connect parent=... allow="*" requireaccount="on" modes="">` to work around the bug where Insp replaces a vhost with a masked host?

[20:54:54] <Princess_Starlight> Starthunder what?
[20:55:30] <Starthunder> If you don't understand it, it wasn't directed at you. XD
[20:55:48] <Starthunder> That said, I'd be happy to explain any or all of what I said. :3
[20:58:30] <Princess_Starlight> Starthunder that's what I was asking :/
[20:58:36] <Princess_Starlight> For the explanation
[20:59:27] <Colgate> is this an issue? I haven't seen it
[20:59:28] <Starthunder> What part of it?
[20:59:40] <Starthunder> Yeah, it's an issue.
[20:59:47] <Starthunder> You use SASL, right?
[21:05:17] <Starthunder> I get three hostname changes. One to my vhost as SASL auth completes, another to a masked host right after registration, and a third back to my vhost after that.
[21:05:50] <Starthunder> Sometimes `JOIN`s get processed before the third change.
[21:09:30] <Starthunder> …oh. The problem with that is that not everypony who's registered has a vhost. x.x
[21:09:36] <Starthunder> So there's gonna have to be an actual fix.
