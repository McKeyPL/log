[08:53:05] <ModusPonens> Is there a way to find out where somebody went to high school just from their IRC info?
[08:54:52] <Colgate> uh... no?
[08:55:07] <Colgate> try like, classmates.com or something :P
[08:55:23] <wolfyshy> I suppose if they've set their gecos to their real name and email address and they have cloaking off so you can see their IP and you geotrace it...
[08:56:41] <ModusPonens> he can see my host mask
[08:56:50] <ModusPonens> which tells him I'm using a university wifi
[08:56:55] <ModusPonens> So he knows where I study
[08:57:07] <ModusPonens> but to go from that to my high school? Seriously creepy
[08:57:19] <wolfyshy> maybe he knows you irl
[08:57:19] <ModusPonens> "geco"
[08:57:22] <ModusPonens> ?
[08:57:25] <ModusPonens> No way
[08:57:33] <wolfyshy> or just searched high schools in your area and got lucky
[08:57:34] <ModusPonens> I've never used this handle outside IRC
[08:57:45] <wolfyshy> also gecos is the "real name" part of your profile
[08:57:47] <ModusPonens> I've never shared this handle with anyone
[08:57:54] <ModusPonens> "real name"?
[08:58:02] <wolfyshy> yours is set to "realname" so you probably haven't set it
[08:58:49] <wolfyshy> oh, hexchat
[08:58:55] <wolfyshy> they don't even let you set the real name any more :)
[09:00:18] <ModusPonens> I've never disclosed anything about my IRL self in IRC
[09:00:24] <ModusPonens> so how?
[09:01:13] <ModusPonens> he is a mod in the chat
[09:01:30] <Kinsley> Mod for a channel?
[09:01:38] <Kinsley> Or for the network?
[09:02:23] <Kinsley> Because I'm a ChanOP, and except for clever Googling, I can't tell shit about people's IP or hostnames.
[09:02:50] <ModusPonens> channel
[09:03:03] <ModusPonens> can you locate where people are and have logged in from?
[09:03:19] <Kinsley> Just hostname stuff, like I said.
[09:03:20] <wolfyshy> you can only see the hostmask
[09:03:35] <wolfyshy> you *could* see prior hostmasks using /whowas and/or your own logs
[09:03:40] <Kinsley> Like your ModusPonens@Pony-6q1ndb.xnet.uga.edu
[09:04:35] <wolfyshy> also, while this is very unlikely, if this person is a netadmin at your uni, he could probably very easily figure out who you are irl :P
[09:04:42] <Kinsley> A couple of universities have different hostnames for being on campus or in residence halls.
[09:04:44] <wolfyshy> there are lots of possibilities
[09:04:53] <ModusPonens> that would tell him my university.
[09:05:07] <ModusPonens> But he also said where I went to high school
[09:06:28] <Phase4> a lot of records are public, never looked to far into what you can find beyond google but you'd be amazed what people just leave online
[09:07:11] <ModusPonens> he'd have nothing to google
[09:07:25] <ModusPonens> besides "ModusPonens" and "UGA"
[09:07:33] <Phase4> well he has your hostname, which gets you university of georgia
[09:07:49] <ModusPonens> sure
[09:08:15] <ModusPonens> but he also knew or guessed my high school
[09:08:23] <Phase4> and he's probably got something else from something you've said, or guessed
[09:08:33] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[09:08:55] <Phase4> ModusPonens, i mean you're on the uni connection now, have you logged in from home before?
[09:09:06] <ModusPonens> yes
[09:09:12] <ModusPonens> but not right now
[09:09:37] <Phase4> well how many high schools could probably be near your homes subnet
[09:09:40] <Phase4> possibly'
[09:09:43] <Kinsley> I've got hundreds of megabytes of logs for this and a bunch of other channels.
[09:10:14] <Kinsley> I assume someone else could easily keep those kinds of logs and just grep 'em to find your nick and get other hosts from that.
[09:10:22] <Kinsley> I used to do it all the time to fuck with people.
[09:10:24] <ModusPonens> Phase4, so it is possible that he, a channel mod, could see where I've logged on to in the past?
[09:10:31] <Phase4> ^ i've done this to help get rid of trolls
[09:10:55] <Kinsley> Him being a channel mod has nothing to do with it at this point.
[09:11:08] <Phase4> ModusPonens, no, i'd assume network ops have some logging but anyone can make a channel and be a mod, it grants no privilages outside of that channel
[09:11:12] <Kinsley> ANYONE with an IRC client can gather this kind of information.
[09:11:17] <Phase4> ^
[09:11:26] <wolfyshy> ^ I have all this information as well, in my ~/.weechat/logs dir
[09:11:32] <wolfyshy> well, for this channel
[09:11:38] <wolfyshy> and I am definitely not a mod
[09:11:45] <Kinsley> It's just that channel mod tends to correlate with other knowledge of networks and IRC.
[09:11:53] <wolfyshy> I'm just a woof that likes logging 'cause sometimes someone gives me advice I need later
[09:12:24] <ModusPonens> Kinsley, could you figure out where I went to high school?
[09:12:38] <Kinsley> Dunno. Don't care.
[09:12:53] <ModusPonens> Just from my host info?
[09:13:07] <ModusPonens> Without me actually saying anything on IRC?
[09:13:24] <Phase4> depends on the isp
[09:13:24] <ModusPonens> If you can't, how can you say "ANYONE with an IRC client can gather this kind of information"?

[09:15:43] <Phase4> hexchat got osx support
[09:15:45] <wolfyshy> os x
[09:15:46] <Phase4> neat
[09:15:48] <wolfyshy> yes
[09:16:23] <Kinsley> ModusPonens: I mean anyone has access to your hostmask when you join a channel or message them.

[09:16:29] <PinkiePieBot> [ Overclocking your bluray drive destroyed your harddrive. : talesfromtechsupport ]
[09:16:40] <Kinsley> And anyone can keep those logs for as long as they please.
[09:16:41] <ModusPonens> oh, that makes a lot more sense, Kinsley 
[09:16:55] <wolfyshy> didn't know 10.9.3 ran on anything with a 1.3ghz CPU either
[09:17:15] <ModusPonens> so could have gotten my hostmask when I logged in from home
[09:17:26] <ModusPonens> and then used that to figure out where home is
[09:17:28] <Kinsley> And I grepped my logs. Only other thing I found was that you're a Comcast subscriber.
[09:17:38] <Kinsley> Or you were, circa the beginning of January.
[09:17:39] <Phase4> ah, Darwin version != osx version
[09:17:44] <Phase4> because that would be far too convenient
[09:18:00] <ModusPonens> I don't know what internet provider my school uses
[09:18:09] <ModusPonens> comcast sounds like when I was at home
[09:18:16] <Kinsley> Not Comcast.
[09:18:17] <ModusPonens> my home internet is comcast
