[00:22:39] <AppleDash> :)
[00:22:44] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: you use gentoo right?
[00:22:48] <JustAberrant> aye
[00:22:57] <AppleDash> Mind helping me with something?
[00:23:01] <JustAberrant> mebbie
[00:23:58] <AppleDash> JustAberrant, I'm trying to emerge a package and I'm getting something about multiple package instances in a single package slot
[00:25:18] <JustAberrant> mm
[00:25:38] <JustAberrant> do a oneshot upgrade to whatever the highest listed version of that package is
[00:25:46] <JustAberrant> usually fixes that
[00:25:48] <AppleDash> Tried that
[00:25:50] <AppleDash> It didn't fix it
[00:26:06] <JustAberrant> :(
[00:26:24] <AppleDash> Indeed :(
[00:26:39] <JustAberrant> do you have something that depends on a specific version of something?
[00:26:47] <AppleDash> I don't know
[00:27:16] <JustAberrant> you can get that kinda problem if you are mixing branches (i.e. have some that were ~amd64 masked that you unmasked)
[00:27:18] <AppleDash> I'm not smart JustAberrant, I just looked over my terminal history
[00:27:26] <AppleDash> I oneshot'd the lower version, not the higher
[00:27:33] <JustAberrant> ah
[00:27:37] <JustAberrant> yeah, that won't help much ;p

[00:33:46] <JustAberrant> maybe try upgrading ffmpeg\
[00:34:11] <AppleDash> sure, why not
[00:34:45] <AppleDash> nope
[00:34:51] <JustAberrant> also, did you try --backtrack=30 as is recommended, cause that does actually sometimes help
[00:35:05] <AppleDash> What's that meant to do?
[00:35:41] <JustAberrant> no idea
[00:35:50] <JustAberrant> oh, the backtrack thing
[00:35:55] <JustAberrant> it just tries harder to figure this out ;p
[00:35:58] <AppleDash> lol
[00:36:14] <AppleDash> I will try
[00:36:35] <JustAberrant> do you have mplayer or similar installed?
[00:36:42] <JustAberrant> cause I think it still doesn't like libav
[00:37:00] <AppleDash> not unless it comes with gentoo
[00:37:45] <AppleDash> adding the backtrack thing has not helped
[00:39:27] <AppleDash> It feels that gst-plugins-ffmpeg wants a libav version less than 10
[00:39:30] <AppleDash> err, seems*
[00:40:43] * JustAberrant really doesn't know :(
[00:40:47] <AppleDash> :(
[00:40:53] <JustAberrant> the whole mplayer/ffmpeg/libav thing is kinda a nightmare
[00:41:07] <JustAberrant> I don't use libav specifically because I wuv mplayer
[00:41:16] <AppleDash> It is
[00:42:05] <JustAberrant> if you want to do that I can tell you how, otherwise, sorry :(
[00:42:14] <JustAberrant> can try asking in #gentoo-amd64 on freenode
[00:43:57] <JustAberrant> but yeah, systemd and libav/ffmpeg are the two bits of gentoo that make gentoo still a pain
[00:44:20] <AppleDash> I'll see if I can make it work first
