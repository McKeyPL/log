[04:17:16] <Quinn> I can almost take the whole thing :o
[04:18:33] <Quinn> I guess it's just I see myself sucking a dildo and realize that if 99% of people I know saw me doing this they'd think it was terrible D:
[04:18:59] <Vulpixbrew> I stand by my last statement
[04:19:50] <Quinn> I can suction cup it to the shower wall and suck on it while I shower :o

[04:29:13] <Squirrelly> like, being forced to do sexual stuff in public/in front of others
[04:29:28] <Quinn> like suck on a dildo in the shower :o
[04:30:19] <Quinn> or fuck yourself with a dildo while they watch
[04:30:37] <Squirrelly> ^
[04:30:47] <weisey> Or exhibitionism 
[04:30:51] <Squirrelly> ^
[04:31:07] <Quinn> or like he'd record me sucking him off and then make me watch it :o
[04:31:14] <Quinn> that was fun, but probably really weird
[04:33:09] <Quinn> I kinda wish I still had that video :/
[04:34:10] <Quinn> I know cocks aren't normally considered cute but
[04:34:13] <Quinn> he had the cutest cock
[04:34:53] <Squirrelly> lol
[04:35:10] <Quinn> I became like pavlov's girlfriend
[04:35:16] <Quinn> every time I saw it I'd start drooling
[04:37:31] <Squirrelly> rofl
[04:38:26] <Quinn> and I remember sometimes when we'd be falling asleep he'd get hard under the sheets and I'd just sorta grab it and hold it until he fell asleep <3
[04:45:25] <Quinn> and if I wanted him to come to the bedroom I could just reach into his pants and lead him there by his cock :3
[04:48:04] <RNGsus> That is adorable
[04:49:10] <Quinn> and any time I could always convince him to do anything by just reaching in there and fiddling with it before pulling my hand out, and promise him more if he did whatever it was
[04:50:23] <Squirrelly> That's....that's adorable
[04:50:48] <Quinn> honestly the favorite place for me to keep my hand was down his pants :3
[04:51:00] <RNGsus> how about your new friend?
[04:51:02] <Quinn> even just watching a movie or chilling or anything my hand would find it's way into his pants
[04:51:44] <Quinn> so far the most we've done is kissed RNGsus D:
[04:51:54] <RNGsus> That's fine
[04:52:22] <Quinn> it was a good kiss though :3
[04:52:31] <Quinn> and he held my hand during dinner
