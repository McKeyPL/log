[07:19:23] <Hickory> What was the last video jananimations did?
[07:21:18] <ThunderBolt> eyyy buddy
[07:21:30] <Angel_Bunny> well that's actually up in the air there Hickory
[07:21:37] <Angel_Bunny> you can find information about it on EQD today

[07:24:13] <Angel_Bunny> well I mean he came out today and said he might have to be done with all pony stuff
[07:27:12] <Angel_Bunny> so as I said you can go find the info out there
[07:27:23] <ThunderBolt> i'll give it 5 more years until the C&D reaches its final verdict
[07:27:59] <ThunderBolt> because its legal stuff, this takes ages with C&D/Copyright stuff
[07:28:11] <Angel_Bunny> it's a lot easier to just bury it under paperwork
[07:28:17] <Angel_Bunny> doesn't cost you much legal fees
[07:28:29] <Hickory> So we can pretty much forget about that, for a while.  Until season 6.

[11:00:23] <Ali> I blame EA more than Maxis
[11:01:36] <RandomNinja> Skylines seems to do everything right that EA did not
[11:02:47] <Seoson> There is no Maxis anymore, so no one can blame em now ... However speaking about the past I would still make them responsible. At the end of the day it's their game and they decide what they do. Some of the things that were messed up were clearly their fault not EA's
[11:03:16] <RandomNinja> the always online thing was probably EA though
[11:03:21] <Seoson> Yeah
[11:03:32] <RandomNinja> and I'm sure many issues derive from that decision
[11:03:37] <RandomNinja> like mimimal build space
[11:03:43] <Seoson> But city size? Really? Fake simulation? I don't think so.

[11:04:39] <Seoson> I'd love to hear an insider on that. 
[11:05:05] <RandomNinja> I'm sure there's plenty around from angry ex-maxis employees
[11:05:27] <Seoson> The one doing Skylines mods for example :P
[11:05:36] <RandomNinja> there is? nice
[11:06:10] <Seoson> Never red one so far. And even if unless the ident. is confirmed by a site a trust you can never be sure.
[11:06:29] <Seoson> I trust*
[11:06:48] <RandomNinja> meaning not Kotaku? :P
[11:08:26] <FruitNibbler> TYOu mean the most objective gaming journalism in existence?
[11:08:59] <Seoson> Here is the source for that mentioned person: http://www.pcgamesn.com/cities-skylines/ex-maxis-artist-turns-to-patreon-to-fund-design-of-cities-skylines-buildings My original source is a Germany site which I'm not going to link.
[11:09:04] <RandomNinja> clearly
[11:09:27] <RandomNinja> Gawker media is the most professional news organization around
[11:09:34] * Seoson doesn't read Kotaku.
[11:09:44] <FruitNibbler> That was a joke 
[11:09:45] <RandomNinja> also, Buzzfeed is great
[11:10:48] <Seoson> They are (Kotaku) used as a source very often. From Buzzfeed I do only recall those strange YT videos.
[11:11:08] <RandomNinja> I mean, https://41.media.tumblr.com/af7984edb3875aa90c253bb581710b50/tumblr_n9811eXAuC1sr1upko1_500.png
[11:11:23] <Seoson> woot
[11:11:32] <FruitNibbler> Cities: Skyrime 25% profit edition
[11:11:59] <RandomNinja> sure, Kotaku is big enough to get confirmable facts a lot. Their journalism is what sucks
[11:13:04] <Seoson> I don't like German gaming sites either. They are more often than not unprofessional and buyest.
[11:14:06] <RandomNinja> I like Sweclockers for the tech part
[11:14:08] <FruitNibbler> Yeah when their lead journalists sparks controversy, thenclaims that his brand of journalism was never objective - but pute subjective and we need more of that, then gets booted from the journal and ethics policy added for other journalists... yeah sure Kotaku metaratings of games suddenly seems so just
[11:14:18] <FruitNibbler> pure*
[11:15:23] <Seoson> Sadly that's also the reason I can no longer honor LinusTechTips, which is a Canadian YT channel. They failed to disclose sponsorship of video way to often.
[11:15:47] <RandomNinja> Linus is still good though
