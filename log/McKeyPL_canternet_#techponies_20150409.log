[07:21:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> what does windows actual overwrite
[07:21:26] <ShivalPonyWolf> just curious havent been lookign into any of the boot stuff gthats going on recently
[07:22:40] <tiwake> the (typically fat32) partition that has everything EFI needs to boot the system
[07:23:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> oh then 100mb one at the start of the disk?
[07:23:28] <tiwake> erm, I don't think windows overwrites the whole thing, just certain configuration files it seems
[07:23:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> the data in there is just bootloader cotnent and a registry hive
[07:24:03] <ShivalPonyWolf> full of settings and stats info on the partitions
[07:24:09] <tiwake> it can be a lot more though, EFI is really flexible
[07:24:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> and i think a boot loader
[07:24:18] <ShivalPonyWolf> isorry boot log
[07:24:30] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah theres alot of stuff there
[07:24:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> i was poking at that afew weeks back
[07:25:00] <tiwake> such as drivers to boot off of complex file systems such as ZFS or BTRFS
[07:25:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> trying to work out how works full disk encryption was working and if it was modifying anything there
[07:25:18] <ShivalPonyWolf> all it did was put a driver in there
