[15:47:03] <miggyb> unless you want to hand the channel over to someone else
[15:47:25] <GiftRibbon> Alright
[15:47:45] <GiftRibbon> Will that command work even when there are others in the channel?
[15:48:59] <miggyb> Yeah, just doesn't list you as the founder anymore
[15:49:07] <miggyb> it should work, anyway

[18:40:03] <MysterAla> The channel admin is unable to give my account OP without chanserv immediately revoking it. What do
[18:41:09] <Colgate> /chanserv set #channel secure off
[18:41:25] <MysterAla> WHat does that do?
[18:41:49] <Colgate> it stops chanserv from enforcing the access lists
[18:42:16] <MysterAla> But why is it just me who's having this issue?
[18:42:27] <Colgate> it isn't
[18:42:48] <MysterAla> Err, in that room, I mean
[18:42:58] <Colgate> it isn't
[18:43:01] <MysterAla> Okay
[18:46:10] <Colgate> but that's what the secure tag does, if theywant to make you an op, they have to add you to chanserv's access list using /chanserv aop #channel add, or similar first
[18:46:27] <MysterAla> But why does it keep revoking that?
[18:46:39] <MysterAla> And not the others
[18:47:51] <Colgate> because they must be on the access list
