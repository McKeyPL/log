[22:12:42] <One-Trick> on headphones o.o
[22:12:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> i've never seen that on headphones
[22:13:30] <RandomNinja> One-Trick because they can, probably
[22:14:21] <One-Trick> doesnt make much sense cuz most people wont have that
[22:14:42] <RandomNinja> most people won't sink £2500 on headphones either
[22:15:07] <RandomNinja> apparently all Audeze have XLR as well
[22:15:18] <One-Trick> price aside, xlr headphones are a dumb idea
[22:15:23] <RandomNinja> why?
[22:15:53] <One-Trick> no advantage and going against the standard of TRS
