[07:51:19] <Moonlightning> Looks like we mad a mass +P
[07:51:49] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: Most likely in preparation for server upgrades
[07:52:24] <AppleDash> If they kill a server on which all of a channel's users reside, that channel will lose its modes etc
[07:55:08] <Moonlightning> Fair enough. There was no global, though.
