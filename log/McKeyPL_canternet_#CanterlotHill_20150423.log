[15:19:03] <Unixkitty> Hello Flurshy 
[15:19:50] <RandomNinja> Also you want a mod manager, I prefer Mod Organizer. Though you don't really need it for those 3 mods I think
[15:20:43] <Unixkitty> Would Nexus work? I was planning on reinstalling that for Skyrim anyway
[15:21:00] <RandomNinja> Yeah
[15:21:06] <RandomNinja> It sucks though
[15:21:18] <Unixkitty> Does it?
[15:21:32] <Unixkitty> I've only ever used that one though, so I don't really have anything to compare with
[15:21:43] <RandomNinja> It's bloaty as hell and prone to crashing when overworked
[15:22:00] <RandomNinja> It works though
[15:22:49] <Unixkitty> Hmm... since my Skyrim installation is intact, mods from the previous NMM installation should be as well somewhere on the disk I think
[15:23:03] <Unixkitty> Just need to find them somehow, maybe at least that game won't require too much work
[15:24:20] <Unixkitty> Oh. How convenient of the past me. "G:\Gaming\Nexus Mod Manager\Skyrim\Mods"

[15:29:17] <Unixkitty> Not spending money...? That sounds horrible
[15:29:44] <Flurshy> well that way I have more money to spend than I originally planned on spending
[15:30:09] <Flurshy> little mind trick, like how you round down the money you have and round up the cost of what you're buying
[15:30:14] <RandomNinja> And you can spend even more later!
