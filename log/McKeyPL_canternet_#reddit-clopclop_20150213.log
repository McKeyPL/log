[00:17:09] <Drago> I grew up on Nintendo. I remember getting an NES. I can't give up on Nintendo. I hadn;t played anything nintendo since GB advance. I am having tons of fun with this DS. The new one just has a new joystick thing so you can look around at different angles in certain games and changed the placement of star and select buttons. No bog deal. Plus it's not that much
[00:17:13] <Drago> to just get a new one
[00:17:29] <weisey> YouTube is 10 years old on saturday :o
[00:18:21] <Nikashi> Drago: The new one is just the old one + pro controller
[00:18:24] <Drago> Sounds about right. Go youtube. I am glad it got better since google fucked it up. still isn;t the same, ofc.
[00:18:30] <Nikashi> so you can add that on to get 90% of the same functoinality
[00:18:40] <Nikashi> and Ithink there's an addon to do the RFID thing too, coming
[00:18:57] <Nikashi> the processing power boost will be like the number of DSi-specific games there were
[00:18:59] <Nikashi> like 10?
[00:19:26] <Drago> That's what I thought Nikashi. Thanks for making me not think too much of it :)
[00:19:43] <Nikashi> but you can get the 2nd analog stick attachment for the XL :)
[00:20:35] <Drago> Really? Huh. I wonder how that would work. Got a link that kinda shows it? c:

[10:27:25] <Squirrelly> I've decided that sleep is more important than studying
[10:27:36] <Squirrelly> Alternately, I'll just take the test late and get 10% off
[10:27:37] <iam[a]lion> D: I was interrupting your studying?!
[10:27:44] <Squirrelly> It's fine

[10:28:51] <Squirrelly> Yeah screw it
[10:29:02] <Squirrelly> I'll take the 10% off the test and do it next week
[10:29:13] <iam[a]lion> what grade level if i may ask?
[10:29:16] <Squirrelly> It's better than getting like a 70% tomorrow

[10:29:32] <iam[a]lion> oh yea 
[10:29:58] <Squirrelly> I missed a bunch of class, so I'm behind on notes, and I was reading somebody else's. It seems like a relatively easy test if I have more time to study.
[10:30:17] <iam[a]lion> well then get some sleeps
[10:30:20] <iam[a]lion> am going to sleep as well
[10:30:20] <Squirrelly> I'm gonna take the 10% late penalty and just do it next week, and hope to get like a 80 something
