[16:54:00] <DinkyDoo> Can anyone tell me what happened here?
[16:54:13] <DinkyDoo> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/P5s7A9lC/IMG_3669.PNG
[16:54:15] <Black> It's called a net split.
[16:54:41] <Black> Oh that
[16:54:42] <DinkyDoo> Said I was de-oped but I never was oped?
[16:55:11] <Black> there was probably no mode P in there
[16:55:33] <Black> some channels didn't get it, like my #Wheat channel didn't have P for a while after the thing
[16:56:00] <DinkyDoo> Oh ok
[16:56:14] <DinkyDoo> This is just #silly so I guess not
[16:57:04] <Black> When a channel is empty it resets... oh that means the ban and exempt lists are probably reset too X3
[16:57:14] <Black> and mode X
[17:01:03] <DinkyDoo> But silly isn't empty Iv never seen it empty
[17:01:27] <Shutter> DinkyDoo: I upgraded the software on one of the servers, that's why
[17:01:41] <DinkyDoo> Oh ok then :p
[17:01:44] <Shutter> Black: If the channel is registered it should be retrained.
[17:02:11] <Shutter> All registered channels should have +P
[17:02:38] <Black> Wheat was registered before the mode P change

[17:02:52] <Black> It took a few days but it got the +P
[17:03:11] <Black> But yeah, listen to Shutterbutt :P
[17:03:49] <DinkyDoo> What +P
[17:06:16] <Black> Uh...
[17:06:24] <Black> check canternet/support :D

[20:56:04] <Colgate> DinkyDoo: basically what happened with that picture is this: you connect to daring, which was just restarted for an update, and so it didn't know about any channels, you were the first one in that channel on that server, so you were given op, when daring reconnected to the network, it found that that channel already existed and it existed before you joined(that's what that Twilight Sparkle
[20:56:06] <Colgate> number is at the top, a timestamp, lower number == newer), so it dropped all its modes and took the modes from the other servers, which meant de-oping you, oping lots of the people who joined, and setting the other modes
[20:56:25] <Colgate> Twilight Sparkle == TS*, lolautreplace
[20:58:56] <DinkyDoo> Oh lol ok
[21:00:30] <Colgate> that's the long explanation!
[21:02:24] <DinkyDoo> Right now windows is refusing to giver files that all of there computers ship with but I don't have :(
