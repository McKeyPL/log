[05:36:14] <Quinn> he wasn't creepy about it, he was super charming
[05:36:29] <iamalion> yep Squirrelly

[06:11:30] <Quinn> how do you count it?
[06:11:36] <thaostra> I'd imagine there would be a bunch of beds joined together to accommodate everyone (with posts for handcuffs), and there'd be bins full of sex toys and lubricant
[06:12:08] <Quinn> and condoms everywhere
[06:12:22] <cloppyhooves> One time I was part of a fivesome, and I've been to a various play parties, some with more sex than not

[06:14:21] <Quinn> that means I've been to an orgy I suppose :o

[22:05:42] <Drago> I'm putting crown molding in this house is just put cabinets in on monday. Doing the whole bottom floor. I dislike doing crown nut it's paying very well.
[22:05:52] <Drago> but*
[22:06:13] <Drago> Not looking forward to that.
[22:07:32] <Drago> It's amazing how many rich people there are out here. I don't know why they would want to live here lol.
[22:08:16] <Vulpixbrew> aren't property taxeds out there like stupidly low?
[22:12:10] <Drago> It's just over 3%
[22:14:06] <Drago> Well it's all relative and calculations need to be taken into consideration but it's not that low. The highest I think is new jerset at like 5.5%
[22:14:33] <Drago> of the "average American"
[22:14:54] <Vulpixbrew> then again you also have hotel and casino owners
[22:15:09] <Vulpixbrew> or ceos majority shareholders
[22:16:08] <Drago> They don't live here though. They are so god damn rich, lol.
[22:16:18] <Drago> They might have several houses here :P
[22:19:03] <Drago> Maybe it's because we hae no income or corporate tax
[22:19:14] <Drago> That's gotta be why.
[22:35:05] <Drago> aww man... looks like Riot took total takedowns, CS, and wins. wtf

[22:36:06] <iamalion> ... tried to say "kill two birds with one stone" to a customer... accidentally used the one I use which is "get two birds stoned at once"
[22:36:07] <iamalion> woopxz
[22:37:04] <Melon_Phone> well the latter option is a little better
[22:39:38] <Drago> oh no
[22:40:48] <Drago> I just got a call asking about someone named andrea using me as a refererence and I don't think I know anyone named andrea recently. I hope I didn't mess something up for someone lol
[22:41:31] <iamalion> D:
[22:42:07] <Drago> I'm sure I don't know an Andrea IRL, at least that I have talked to in the last couple years.
[22:42:59] <iamalion> as long as you didnt say anything negative i think you will be okay
[22:43:07] <iamalion> did anyone ask you recently if they could use you as a reference?

[22:48:28] <Vulpixbrew> I cant seem to start it
[22:48:44] <iamalion> Initiating the quest
[22:48:44] <iamalion> To initiate this quest, the Dragonborn must travel to Windhelm at around midnight. If the Dark Brotherhood quest-line has been started or completed, it could hinder the possibilities of starting this quest. If this happens and the murder scene doesn't appear, killing Grelod the Kind may fix this issue.

[23:00:27] <Drago> I tried to start a new skyrim game but the dialogue in the wagon never stops and the carriage just keeps on going into the wall and just ghost walks. I started a new game my my original copy then made a save, then threw my GOTY version back in and it's glitchy as hell. Man, I wanted to play SO bad that day.
