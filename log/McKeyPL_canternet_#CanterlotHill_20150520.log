[04:34:22] <Sombra> I know I'm wondering about canterlot hill itself, if it's apart of efn or something that broke off or what
[04:34:28] <Eywind> It was a show on EFN
[04:34:29] <dawnseeker> yep
[04:34:31] <Eywind> If that's your question
[04:34:36] <Eywind> Oh about CLH itself?
[04:34:40] <Eywind> Spiritual successor, so to speak.
[04:34:41] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Canterlot Hill was not. 
[04:34:41] <Sombra> So EFN is no longer around?
[04:34:43] <Eywind> But not really
[04:34:46] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> EFN is gone.
[04:34:49] <Eywind> Like... we took over some stuff

[04:35:01] <Sombra> Oh okay
[04:35:03] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Eywind, nope, it's now just CLH Radio.
[04:35:05] <dawnseeker> Discrod blew it up
[04:35:10] <Eywind> Is it Parchy? 
[04:35:16] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> It is, as of, like a month ago?
[04:35:16] <Eywind> Did we get rid of the everfree bumps?
[04:35:17] <dawnseeker> discord blew it up
[04:35:17] <Midli> Sombra everything EFN radio and such was passed down to the CLH team
[04:35:21] <MikeM> It was the ducks. They burned EFN down.

[04:36:16] <Sombra> Good luck.
[04:36:23] <Midli> Sombra some EFN shows moved to CLH, some moved to other stations (like Mixology > PVFM/PVL) and others decided to retire when EFN shutdown (OsakaJack's into the spotlight)

[17:51:15] <Unixkitty> What do you think?

[17:51:47] <RandomNinja> that mouse is super MLG
[17:52:20] <Unixkitty> I love it's design and the colourful blazing pattern lighting
[17:52:37] <RandomNinja> perfect for those 360 quickscopes
[17:52:55] <Unixkitty> Used a bloody mouse before, loved it, so I guess :P
[17:53:32] <RandomNinja> wow there's so much Xtreme GameR nonsense on the page

[17:54:00] <Unixkitty> Isn't there, I wanted to link official pages though
[17:55:01] <RandomNinja> who not something like a G400 or something though
[17:55:04] <RandomNinja> why*
[17:55:27] <RandomNinja> this looks like 50% of the price is image
[17:57:05] <Unixkitty> Because this one goes with the overall theme, and also what I said before?
[17:57:14] <Unixkitty> It's actually rather cheap too
[17:57:29] <Unixkitty> Or well, for a gaming mouse anyway
[17:57:53] <RandomNinja> go ahead then
[17:58:09] <Unixkitty> What about the keyboard?

[17:59:23] * RandomNinja flails
[17:59:24] <FN> RandomNinja, kevlar fiber may be weaker on paper with 338N vs 920N values for steel, but steel snaps, while kevlar stretches, and it remains intact and load-bearing until a staggering ultimate strength of 2920MPa vs miesely 550MPa of steel at the breaking point 
[17:59:26] <Unixkitty> It's actually only €19 here, RandomNinja :P
[17:59:39] <RandomNinja> can't really go wrong then
[17:59:52] <FN> PTFE is an amazing material
[18:00:08] <bikey> you can even fry stuff on it
[18:00:19] <FN> PTFE = kevlar = teflon
[18:00:28] <FN> It's all the same stuff
[18:00:49] <FN> And it is on the bottom of your mouse because PTFE is one slippery plastic
[18:01:06] <Unixkitty> And considering the last one of the same brand I'd bought was about €15 and was the most amazing mouse I'd ever used, I'd guess so as well
[18:01:49] <RandomNinja> they do look pretty good for the price

[18:05:44] <FN> It is quite nifty in games

[18:06:29] <Unixkitty> And about keyboards, for the love of everything technology I simply was not able to find one I liked with a red theme, quality mechanical switches, high profile keys which also wouldn't be ridiculously expensive
[18:06:31] <FN> Current FPS games have a lot of extra stuff 
[18:06:41] <Seoson> Here is the perfect mouse for you :P http://images.gizmag.com/hero/combimouse-8.jpg
[18:07:03] <FN> Looks about right, but too bulky
[18:07:36] <FN> Also scroll is on the wrong side
[18:08:11] <FN> I am used to use scroll as a knifing in FPS: it feels kind of appropriate gesture wise
[18:08:36] <Seoson> Unixkitty: mechanical and cheap? Uhh that's tough. I'm on MX Browns now and very happy. But we better not take a look at the price tag
[18:08:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> looks a bit hipstery
[18:09:05] <Unixkitty> Well, that is why the bloody b120 one was like the only choice I could go for in the end, Seoson 
[18:09:13] <bikey> I have a barebones mechanical keyboard that was... about 50€
[18:09:20] <FN> I would love to have a mechanical keyboard, but I want one that "clicks" only in tactile manner, but doesn't noise
[18:09:26] <bikey> but it has almost no extra keys or backlight
[18:09:30] <Unixkitty> I'm not entirely sure what switches it has, but I think they are of the green kind
[18:09:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> aren't the red ones kinda quiet?
[18:10:09] <bikey> reds and blacks don't click, but they also have no tactile feedback
[18:10:17] <Seoson> brown's don't click but are still loud. Used O rings - made a bit better
[18:10:18] <Cloud_Zephyr> darn
[18:10:42] <Unixkitty> Blue ones would be your classic click-clack ones I believe
[18:10:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> must be more tactile than membrane keyboards though? or you should just get a membrane keyboard

[18:12:30] <Cloud_Zephyr> the keyboard i intend on getting has the red switches
[18:12:36] <FN> Cloud_Zephyr, yes a little bit more "snappy" than membrane ones, I'd like to feel that exact moment when it "breaks in"
[18:12:55] <Cloud_Zephyr> lul
[18:13:20] <FN> Because on membrane keyboards there is this limbo state where you think you didn't press hard enough, but you find kkkkkkkkkkkk on the screen
[18:13:24] <Unixkitty> Red ones are supposed to feel rather smooth, and require less actuation force than most others I think
[18:13:39] <FN> And also sometimes you think you have hit hard enough, but you didn't
[18:13:49] <bikey> our families 386 had a Cherry keyboard with their red switches, but I didn't like it too much
[18:13:59] <bikey> black ones are even softer than reds
[18:14:04] <Cloud_Zephyr> i'll focus on getting my computer first though. some day i'll feel like spending a day and a bits work money on a keyboard
[18:14:29] <Cloud_Zephyr> my cheap logitech keyboard is pretty good for a membrane keyboard
[18:15:08] <FN> But the click-clack noise of most mechanical keyboards is very annoying to me; also they often come in humongous size formats, where I want the most minimalistic thing that would fit between my gaming pad and mouse on the table
[18:15:19] <bikey> membrane keyboards aren't that bad actually, especially not for gaming in my experience
[18:15:28] <FN> They aren't
[18:15:34] <Cloud_Zephyr> my school keyboards are way to squishy
[18:15:47] <bikey> however I bought my mech kb before I had to write my thesis, and that was so worth it
[18:15:50] <FN> They are just not the best kind of tactile feedback for me, and they wear off
[18:16:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> I kinda like the click clack sounds, but its not so useful at night time lul
[18:16:37] <Unixkitty> That would be why Red or Black switches could work for you

[18:29:09] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuuu
[18:29:29] <FN> Quick Cloud_Zephyr how much will the doubling of voltage in audio system be in dB???

[18:30:11] * FN has major in acoustics
[18:30:41] <bikey> and if you plan on using the keyboard for gaming, I'd choose the browns
[18:30:49] <FN> I have to mention that those are construction acoustics, so that not aexactly a general course
[18:31:08] <RandomNinja> assuming linear relationship between voltage and output effect, 3.
[18:31:18] <RandomNinja> otherwise things get much trickier
[18:31:30] <FN> Acoustics are tricky
[18:31:47] <RandomNinja> well yeah
[18:31:50] <FN> I still need to check with the tables to not mess up when I do calculations
[18:32:09] <RandomNinja> especially if you add more than one sound source
[18:33:31] <bikey> so wait what's the correct answer, 3?
[18:33:31] <FN> It is 6dB increase
[18:33:58] <RandomNinja> that's for 2 speakers in constructive superposition though, isn't it?
[18:34:30] <FN> 3dB is double the power
[18:34:41] <FN> Aka sound intensity
[18:34:46] <RandomNinja> yeah
[18:34:56] <Unixkitty> Such nerdery
[18:35:00] * Unixkitty runs
[18:35:04] <RandomNinja> you're a nerd
[18:35:04] <FN> And 10dB is perceived doubling of sound for human ear
[18:35:11] <Unixkitty> You!
[18:35:18] * RandomNinja flops Unixkitty 
[18:35:27] * Unixkitty squeaks at RandomNinja 
[18:35:29] <RandomNinja> sounds about right
[18:35:31] <bikey> ... but... double the voltage would only be 1.4 times the power
[18:35:36] <FN> Unixkitty, you sound like nerdery is somehow bad...
[18:35:46] <Unixkitty> I was talking to RandomNinja, FN
[18:36:24] <FN> Hm, I might have them mixed up bikey, it's so easy to do that our acoustics prof had done it all the time
[18:36:31] <RandomNinja> bikey, we assumed 1:1 ratio for the sake of simplicity since this was a basic physics question
[18:36:42] <FN> http://www.sengpielaudio.com/Cause-Effect-Perception.gif
[18:36:47] <RandomNinja> you might very well be right though
[18:36:48] <bikey> but P = U^2/R
[18:36:50] <Hennet303> you fillies behaving?
[18:36:51] <FN> I don't think this table lies to me
[18:37:08] <bikey> so if you double the volts, you'd only  get sqrt(2) more power
[18:37:16] <FN> The best of examples I ever saw
[18:37:44] <RandomNinja> does that apply to this though?
[18:37:58] <RandomNinja> keep in mind there's some loss from heat as well
[18:38:16] <RandomNinja> Hennet303, no :3
[18:38:24] * RandomNinja hides
[18:38:36] <bikey> well, it's assuming an ideal system, but power loss wouldn't be that big relatively
[18:39:48] <RandomNinja> true
[18:40:33] * DerpyBot hugs her muffin and straightens her mane
[18:40:33] * DinkyBot fusses and frowns, but hugs her momma and shakes her mane out when she finishes. "Mooommmaaa! Staaaahp! Hhehe!"
[18:40:52] <FN> Hue, if power loss to heat would be a thing, companies wouldn't dump thousands into silencer research
[18:41:01] * Unixkitty steals RandomNinja for his... behaviour.
[18:41:06] <RandomNinja> so the real answer to FN's original question is 3 + log10(sqrt(2))
[18:41:20] <RandomNinja> unless I'm mathing wrong
[18:41:29] <FN> Gun silencers are the most underappreciated thing out there
[18:41:34] <Unixkitty> Mathing? Who does that?
[18:41:56] <RandomNinja> gun silencers are great for not suffering permanent hearing loss
[18:42:07] <bikey> I'm not sure how the formula looked like exactly
[18:42:14] <RandomNinja> Unixkitty, I do :P
[18:42:16] *** Zero is now known as Zero|Packing
[18:42:46] <FN> It gets progressively harder and harder to get more decibels removed form a shot, but customers go like "this is like only 20dB difference, but it is so much more expensive, bal bla bla, bad greedy company"
[18:42:52] <RandomNinja> Unixkitty, https://www.ifm.liu.se/courses/TFYA13/oh/fo2.pdf
[18:43:15] <RandomNinja> yeah people don't consider that dB is logarithmic
[18:43:25] <FN> But dB is logarythmic so from 10dB to 130dB there a trillion times of a difference
