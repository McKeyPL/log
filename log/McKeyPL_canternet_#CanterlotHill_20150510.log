[03:17:21] <RandomNinja> neither do we Lycan :P
[03:17:57] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr ur playback speed is set to 105% :P
[03:18:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> but how? i didn't know itunes had such options
[03:18:25] <Sombra> Quick question
[03:18:39] <Lycan> The problem is, there is only 25 million people for the land mass the size of America, which has 250 million people. So a lot of the cost is moviing the food around (shipping costs)
[03:18:48] <Sombra> Anyone else ever hear of a group on youtube called DJO ?
[03:20:53] <RandomNinja> also, shipping halfway across the island
[03:21:02] <wobniaR> You don't "have" to tip here, but it's sorta an obligatory thing
[03:21:11] <wobniaR> Some places will include it in the bill, but those are few
[03:21:15] <RandomNinja> I'm not in murica tho
[03:21:21] <Sombra> Costomer service is better in America...
[03:21:23] <wobniaR> Mostly because waiters are paid really bad here
[03:21:38] <Sombra> That's because they get tips.
[03:22:04] <wobniaR> Yeah except tips can range from $0 to anything above that
[03:22:13] <RandomNinja> because otherwise they can't afford to live
[03:22:20] <Sombra> That's why they usually want to do a good job.
[03:22:21] <RandomNinja> which isn't a good system 
[03:22:34] <Sombra> It's a great system, do a good job or don't get enough money.
[03:22:38] <wobniaR> It's still not guaranteed or a steady source of income

[03:22:55] <Sombra> I wouldn't say being a waiter is exactly a steady career.
[03:23:24] <wobniaR> Many people who get jobs as waiters don't do it as their first choice
[03:23:35] <wobniaR> Sometimes you just need money to pay the bills asap
[03:23:36] <RandomNinja> no, but you shouldn't have to depend on tips when you have a source of income
[03:23:47] <Sombra> What should you have to depend on?
[03:23:49] *** Hoofy is now known as Hoofy1
[03:24:02] <RandomNinja> your salary
[03:24:20] <wobniaR> Salary is a steady source, there's also paid by the hour, self-employed etc
[03:24:20] <Sombra> Yes, you should get paid what you're worth.  Waiting isn't worth that much.
[03:24:30] <RandomNinja> if you don't do your job you get fired, just as in any other job
[03:24:50] <RandomNinja> eh, it can be a ton of work
[03:25:10] <RandomNinja> there's lots of dead time followed by periods of high intensity
[03:25:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> omg i found some real trance!
[03:25:23] <Sombra> Just because you put a lot of work into something doesn't make it valuable.  
[03:25:42] <Sombra> Work required to make something does not dictate the value of something
[03:26:04] <RandomNinja> sure, but your employer thinks your work is valuable, otherwise you wouldn't have it
[03:26:23] <Sombra> .Right, it's minimum wage valuable, which... I think is $7.50 in the states.
[03:27:02] <Cloud_Zephyr> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MGEJglNop4 darn why have i only just payed attention to this record label
[03:27:04] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[03:27:04] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Araya - Relativity (Original Mix) [OUT NOW]
[03:27:09] <RandomNinja> which is crap, but that's a different issue
[03:27:41] <RandomNinja> anyway I should bread
[03:28:03] <Sombra> Unfortunately, if you mess with the minimum wage you're going to mess with the entire economy, and devalue the dollar.  In otherwords, everyone would have more money, but it wouldn't matter because everything would be more expensive
[03:28:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> ur minimum wage is rubbish
[03:28:23] <RandomNinja> yeah it's not that easy unfortunately
[03:28:55] <wobniaR> It really depends
[03:29:34] <Sombra> If someone flipping burgers now gets 15$ an hour... well... my roomate who does hard labor in a factor, chucking out 700$ freezers on an assemblline, that's what he makes.  Electrolux thinks his work is more valuable than making crap hamburgers.  So him and his union are going to want more.
[03:30:16] <Hamtramck> Well

[03:36:47] <Eywind> I totally agree with that
[03:36:48] <RandomNinja> mostly because they suck
[03:37:21] <Eywind> but if companies continued to increase wages of unskilled labor then skilled labor would/should/workers would feel entitled that it increased and the costs to paying the unskilled labor would be pushed to the consumers

[12:18:34] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Yea, glad I payed less than 50% then ^^
[12:19:03] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> But I did have to wait 3 weeks for it.
[12:19:09] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Even though I ordered it in 2013
[12:19:32] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So, yea. Not gonna buy anything from that store again.
[12:19:32] <SilentHoofsteps> Okay... how did THAT happen?
[12:19:58] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Aparently their system was changed since 2013, so my order couldn't be confirmed anymore.
[12:20:06] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> But they never noticed me about that.
[12:20:17] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So I lost all pre-order bonuses
[12:20:23] <SilentHoofsteps> that sucks
[12:20:45] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> And had to wait 3 weeks for them to get me my discount cupon so I could buy it again for the original price.
[12:21:52] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> But oh well. I got it crazy cheap, that's really all I care about.

[19:07:13] <Unixkitty> I only look up in local stores anyway for the most part if I'm actually looking to buy something
[19:07:22] <RandomNinja> my point is that Beyerdynamics is way more expensive in the US, whereas they're more competetive in europe

[20:50:53] * RandomNinja progs Unixkitty 
[20:52:19] <Unixkitty> So far it seems that prog metal is about telling stories with full albums rather than standalone songs?
[20:52:40] <RandomNinja> not necessarily
[20:53:47] <RandomNinja> prog is characterized as being somewhat experimental and complex, with songs that change and often reference rather than repeat previous sections
[20:54:50] <RandomNinja> for example, changing or adding things to the last chorus, while still obviously being the same
[20:55:17] <Unixkitty> Hmm, I think I can kind of see what was meant on that "different kinds of metal" picture you'd linked the other day
[20:55:18] <RandomNinja> concept and full story albums happen to be a very good way of experimenting with a single theme
[20:56:03] <RandomNinja> so prog has a disproportonate amount of concept albums and operas compared to "simpler" styles
[20:56:28] <RandomNinja> to quote Cracked: "Progressive rock is categorized by a sacking of traditional song structure, complex rhythms, odd time signatures and a sense of inherent superiority over other rock genres"
[20:57:44] <Unixkitty> Rock? I thought we were listening to metal?
[20:58:12] <RandomNinja> well metal is a development of rock
[20:58:43] <Unixkitty> Oh, even wikipedia lists the two supposedly different sounding genres under the same album
[20:58:44] <RandomNinja> same things apply, just that prog metal generally is heavier
[20:58:50] <RandomNinja> lots of overlap
[20:59:19] <RandomNinja> Symphony X and Dream Theater are good examples of prog metal rather than rock
[20:59:39] <Unixkitty> Oh, so that was prog as well?
[20:59:49] <RandomNinja> yes
[20:59:59] <RandomNinja> DT is arguably the most prolific prog metal band
