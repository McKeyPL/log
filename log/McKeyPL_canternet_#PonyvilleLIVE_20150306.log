[11:11:08] <Electron> I did not remember such behaviour from you

[11:19:30] <MirSar> Nope, I work
[11:19:52] <Electron> but did you go there?
[11:20:31] <MirSar> Our education system works a bit diffrently. Better way to explain, school until I was 18, then work
[11:21:23] <TheFlutterGuy> MirSar: https://i.imgur.com/D1kw3CS.jpg
[11:21:29] <MirSar> I don't have any fancy title or anything, just the most basic education. I don't need more to work with what I love ^^
[11:25:23] <Electron> in 18, huh
[11:25:48] <Electron> that's very good that you do not need any final papers to get a work
[11:26:16] <MirSar> At 18 I actually get my final papers :P
[11:26:38] <MirSar> well, I can go to more school to get better papers, but mehh
[11:26:57] <Electron> maybe I picked wrong words to call them "final papers" or something
[11:28:59] <Electron> did you do Microsoft exams, MirSar?
[11:33:44] <MirSar> Yeah, got Windows 7 and 8
[11:36:32] <Electron> nice
[11:37:38] <MirSar> This is gonna be a stressfull day... got 45 sec responce time now, usually we have around 5-20 sec
[11:37:54] <MirSar> I don't like this Frieday
[11:39:08] <Electron> two worst things in the world: to wait and to catch up
[11:40:53] <MirSar> I love how the company is very serious about giving a good support impression to customers, resolve cases quickly and always respinding within the day. But it creates a stressfull enviroment and one gets very tired from it
[11:44:45] <TheFlutterGuy> MirSar: is it a green day?
[11:46:21] <MirSar> Not yet.. But I think the boss man will change that
[11:49:19] <Electron> do you support clients in your city only or over the whole country?
[11:50:11] <MirSar> All over Norway and some international, we have 8 or 9 rather large customers outside scandinavia
