[05:57:58] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: I think the reason I never watched alot of horror stuff, was because they rarely ever made me care about anyone.
[05:58:23] <MikeM> Yeah, there's gotta be some kind of connection.
[05:59:48] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: I think the first two Alien films are about the closest I have to horror.

[06:08:31] <MikeM> So strange.
[06:08:36] <One-Trick> he was notorious for destroying budgets and killing studios
[06:08:53] <Muffin_Spectacles> One-Trick: I did see him at Comic-Con in 2000, and did ask him why he didn't direct the American Tail sequel.

[12:34:34] <Bitcrusher> so finally, yesterday, I bought a Mac. it arrives in the mail today and I'm so excited :3
[12:34:40] <RandomNinja> nuuu :P
[12:34:48] <Bitcrusher> wat
[12:34:59] <RandomNinja> not teh macs
[12:35:15] <Bitcrusher> yasss
[12:35:28] <Bitcrusher> mac is master race computer
[12:35:43] <RandomNinja> pls even Cloud_Zephyr|Away disagrees with you nowadays :P
[12:35:54] <Bitcrusher> PC is for gamers, I don't game :3
[12:36:48] <Bitcrusher> mac is faster, doesn't get viruses, has better software, more efficient... 
[12:37:16] <jaw> Bitcrusher: sounds like you'd want a chromebook, half the price!
[12:37:24] <jaw> and macs have super bad security
[12:37:36] <RandomNinja> lies, debatable, subjective, yes but not when you factor in price
[12:37:38] <jaw> apple are notorious for not fixing bugs until several months
[12:38:12] <RandomNinja> the difference is that when mac malware appears everyone is taken by surprise and it wrecks widespread havoc
[12:38:24] <jaw> the best oxymoron is that people believe macs are performant for video rendering etc.
[12:38:32] <Bitcrusher> meh. to each their own. I have a good feeling about this
[12:38:35] <jaw> and for graphics in general
[12:39:01] <jaw> yea, people primarily buy macs for the environment impact by the pretty aluminium case :P
[12:39:12] <RandomNinja> Zenbook tho
[12:39:56] <jaw> my home laptop is a zenbook
[12:39:59] <Bitcrusher> newest model made with real bamboo

[12:40:28] <RandomNinja> high end Zenbook is probably the only computer that's made me fall in love at first sight

[12:42:58] <jaw> laptops are good for web dev and stuff
[12:42:59] <RandomNinja> price/performance a desktop usually beats out consoles
[12:43:11] <RandomNinja> which is another hilarious thing
[12:43:31] <jaw> you can buy the exact same APU chip from AMD with a PC motherboard that are in the consoles now
[12:43:37] <jaw> but it's pretty crappy
[12:43:38] <RandomNinja> but why would you?
[12:43:49] <RandomNinja> but muh 8 cores

[12:44:00] <jaw> which compete with consoles presumably
[12:44:14] <RandomNinja> which will probably rek them hard

[20:30:05] <Flurshy> pretty sure it supports the output
[20:30:15] <Flurshy> it's a matter of its ability to maintain framerate
[20:30:27] <Trildar|Bread> Yeah, that's what I meant.
[20:31:01] <Trildar|Bread> 4k gaming is still in the somewhat insane range of requirements.
[20:31:42] <Flurshy> I know
[20:31:59] <Flurshy> I'm probably going to keep gaming limited to my consoles and just use this for movies for now
[20:32:20] <Araxnus> "<Flurshy> anyone here know how the GTX 750 Ti card performs by chance?" For 1080p with games running from mid to high it is pretty great. However I would look at the GTX 960. Worth it for a bit more.
[20:32:27] <Flurshy> probably play minecraft though, and I'm not sure how it would perform
[20:32:50] <Araxnus> Yeah. 750 Ti or 960 would be great for that.

[20:36:52] <Flurshy> hmm, the 960 does look good, and I wouldn't have to buy a bigger PSU down the line
[20:36:58] <Trildar|Bread> If you want screen space, you want more screens. 4k doesn't really change that since it's just higher PPI.
