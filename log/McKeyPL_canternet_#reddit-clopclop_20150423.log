[09:01:32] <Drago> It was kinda hard to explain and brought up sadness that I hadn't thought of in awhile.
[09:03:17] <Drago> I pretty much started at a very low point in my life when I was drinking very heavily. It gave me something positive to kind of hold on to in the fog. 
[09:04:40] <Drago> He seemed to get what I was talking about. 
[09:05:28] <VulpixBrew> aye
[09:05:45] <Drago> Used to do drugs with him for a long time. Only person I talk to from back then. because he is actually a smart guy and has also kept clean.

[20:15:01] <Vulpixbrew> do you think batman ever goes around and sing nanananananananana me
[20:18:18] <Melon_Phone> it's probably his ringtone 
[20:18:39] <Veigar> I think batman likes waffles more than pancakes because it has holes to hold the butter and syrup in
[20:19:10] *** Quits: Cel (Cel@Silver.Horizon) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:19:21] <Frosty> Waffles are way better than pancaes.
[20:19:38] <Melon_Phone> Icelandic pancakes tho
[20:19:58] <Veigar> what is an icelandic pancake
[20:20:52] <Melon_Phone> kinda like a soft Mexican pancake except sweet
[20:21:18] <Melon_Phone> put a little line of sugar on it then roll it up tight
[20:21:27] <Melon_Phone> serve
[20:22:14] <Frosty> Where did the Tree of Harmony come from? Because it bore fruit, the Elements. But here did the tree come from?
[20:22:23] <Veigar> one thing I don't understand about spanish is that "I" ispronounced "E" like in tortilla I always want to say it with an ill sound not an eee sound
[20:23:05] <Melon_Phone> it's a very satisfying sound, the 'll's 
[20:24:09] <cloppyhooves> That's how a lot of other languages pronounce it
[20:24:23] <cloppyhooves> Also, I odn't think there's an answer to that, Frosty 
[20:24:32] <Melon_Phone> in Iceland it's a hard dl sound 
[20:25:05] <Melon_Phone> one L is soft but 2 is sharp or hard
[20:25:23] <cloppyhooves> Oh, I meant "I"
[20:25:31] <cloppyhooves> But yeah, that's interesting that it's hard :o
[20:25:34] <Melon_Phone> oo
[20:26:01] <Veigar> I suppose a letter is just a symbol after all you can't really capture how a language works with just symbols
[20:26:02] <Melon_Phone> rolla, or sheep is kind of a rodla
[20:27:00] <Melon_Phone> alright imma get ready to pizza roll
[20:27:13] <Frosty> So, in this scene, Twilight was in full gallop. Spike was, at most, jogging, next to her,not even breaking a sweat. Like, it's no big deal.
[20:27:56] <Melon_Phone> maybe twi runs really slow
[20:28:12] <Frosty> Or maybe Spike is actually a tri0athelete.
[20:28:33] <Veigar> spike is a dragon after all
[20:28:53] <Veigar> dragons are usually described as very athleticly gifted
[20:29:14] <Veigar> when your lungs breathe fire you have to have a good cardio system
[20:29:25] <Melon_Phone> I don't think swimming is healthy for a fire breather 
[20:29:44] <Frosty> It'd be fine.
[20:29:45] <Veigar> swimming in lava is
[20:29:56] <Frosty> They can swim in water, too
[20:30:02] <Melon_Phone> it's kinda like taking your pet pikachu or jolteon to a swimming pool 
[20:30:22] <Veigar> not sure if dragons conduct electricity
[20:30:32] <Veigar> pretty sure they just conduct heat
[20:30:33] <Frosty> No, of course not
[20:30:52] <Frosty> Their scales protect them.
[20:31:06] <Melon_Phone> I'm saying you'd get zaphassled if you swum with either
[20:31:17] <Veigar> I wish I had some protective scales
[20:31:25] <Veigar> the world can be a scary place
[20:31:35] <Veigar> if I had proctective scales I'd be less scared
[20:31:37] <Melon_Phone> I have scales! 
[20:31:39] <Frosty> I have oritective scales.
[20:31:48] <Melon_Phone> I year then to weigh my flour 
[20:31:51] <Frosty> They're made of steel plates and kevlar.
[20:31:54] <Melon_Phone> use
[20:32:18] <Veigar> do you have a linex coating on your scales
[20:32:36] <Veigar> in order to prevent the copper from splattering everywhere
[20:32:50] <Frosty> I doubt it
[20:34:09] <Veigar> I always thought they decided to not use steel plates cause they were too weak to stop boolets now I feel like people are using steel a lot more 
[20:34:40] <Melon_Phone> real steel made from huge jacked man
[20:34:51] <Frosty> It's a certain alloy that's also treated.
[20:35:21] <Veigar> well that'll show our stupid ancestors who said steel can't stop boolets
[20:35:39] <Veigar> we're smarter these days
[20:35:51] <Melon_Phone> Samsung smart steel
[20:35:56] <Melon_Phone> HD
[20:36:03] <Veigar> apple isteel
[20:36:08] <Frosty> Like I said, steel and kevlar. Steel alsone, unless really thick, wouldn't stop.
[20:36:37] <Veigar> I've watched a ton of review vids where steel plates are blocking 308
[20:36:57] <Frosty> Yeah, but how thick are the plates?
[20:37:10] <Veigar> about a quarter inch thick
[20:37:22] <Frosty> Oh, that's ain't too bad
