[07:00:00] <Michael> it wasn't that bad
[07:01:46] <plushie_pegasus> If you want to take out wrinkles, put the shirt in the dryer with some ice cubes, the steam will take out the wrinkles
[07:02:03] <plushie_pegasus> (From hack my life on tv)
[07:02:14] <Quinn> or hang it on the door while you shower
