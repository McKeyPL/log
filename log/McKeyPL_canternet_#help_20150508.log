[02:32:15] <y007ghg7> just wondering, did canternet recently change something with ipv6? my ZNC is throwing errors now when trying to connect
[02:32:34] <y007ghg7> <*status> Disconnected from IRC (Server address is IPv4-only, but bindhost is IPv6-only). Reconnecting...
[02:33:25] <Colgate> ipv6 is currently having an issue upstream, been going on all day :/
[02:33:30] <y007ghg7> ugh :/
[02:33:55] <Colgate> you can try irc6.canternet.org if you want, but there is a good chance it won't work
[02:34:06] <y007ghg7> lemme test it real quick
[02:35:07] <y007ghg7> oh boy. time to wait for the ZNC to ask me if I want to accept the SSL cert.
[02:35:13] <y007ghg7> this takes so long for some reason...
[02:35:30] <Colgate> well, if you got an ssl cert, that means you can connect
[02:35:38] <Colgate> or should be able to at least
[02:35:43] <y007ghg7> just sitting at <y007ghg7> connect
[02:35:43] <y007ghg7> <*status> Connecting...
[02:35:57] <Dusk> y007ghg7: Why don't you just save the fingerprint?
[02:36:08] <y007ghg7> did, not sure if it will ask me to change it
[02:36:12] <Dusk> oh
[02:36:15] <y007ghg7> since I am now using a different ip
[02:37:15] <y007ghg7> gah, nope
[02:37:15] <y007ghg7> <*status> IRC connection timed out.  Reconnecting...
[02:37:27] <y007ghg7> guess I can just wait this out.
[02:37:55] <Colgate> don't have any timeframe for when it will be fixed
[02:43:52] <y007ghg7> tis fine
