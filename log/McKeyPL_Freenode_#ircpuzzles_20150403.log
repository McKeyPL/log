[06:32:58] <Klaghills> and how he may have gotten here
[06:33:00] <Klaghills> the hacker
[06:33:03] <yano> lol
[06:33:26] <Klaghills> he arrived in #poketext about an hour before probably using the nick FatBack
[06:33:34] <Klaghills> or about half an hour earlier i think using NlackBigger
[06:33:35] <walle303-mobile> Yano what about google auth like keys generated on a website after inputting evidence of solving
[06:33:52] <Klaghills> and tried to send everyone keyloggers and porn
[06:34:10] <yano> no one hacked freenode for the competition
[06:34:26] <walle303-mobile> Well thats good
[06:34:31] <Klaghills> he attempted to take over several people's accounts after
[06:34:38] <jacob1> that's actually why they hacked freenode last year, to get all the answers to the puzzle this year!
[06:34:47] <walle303-mobile> He succeeded once
[06:35:04] <walle303-mobile> He got illya
[06:35:32] <Klaghills> ^
[06:35:41] <Klaghills> and also possibly jasonjang
[06:36:40] <walle303-mobile> Then i upped security on my account
[06:36:43] <Klaghills> so he came to our group of related channels first
[06:36:49] <Klaghills> then possibly followed one of us here
[06:37:14] <Klaghills> as when he was NlackBigger, he was always only on these channels
[06:37:34] <Klaghills> while on FatBack he was on 30-40 ones at a time but they always changed

[06:38:37] <Klaghills> i assume
[06:38:53] <walle303-mobile> I didn't ignore him

[19:45:55] <yano> probably in a few weeks once i figure out a better solution for the website
[19:45:58] <jacob1> I don't think there will be a blog post since this isn't as official as before, but they will probably be on the website eventually
[19:46:00] <MinceR> :)
[19:46:07] <MinceR> ic
[19:46:15] <Cassini> why's it not "official" this year anymore?

[19:48:02] <yano> there won't be a posting on blog.freenode.net
[19:48:08] <yano> but there will be on ircpuzzles.org
[19:49:57] <ser_berry> will there be cake?
[19:50:20] <bcode> Cassini, iirc freenode staff didn't have anything prepared so yano went ahead and made some nice puzzles and while this channel was wallopsed (to continue the tradition I guess), that's about it regarding affiliation with the official april fools events i think
[19:50:34] <yano> yea
[19:50:43] <yano> ser_berry: there is no cake

[19:51:36] <jacob1> yay cake
[19:51:44] <yano> actually among the 3 people who made it to the winners circle, 2 of them refused to do the last step until i pestered them to do it
[19:53:40] <ser_berry> last step is ritual sacrifice of pokemon
[19:53:56] <bcode> and this is why erry will never win this challenge

[22:32:44] <krasnayarsk> slidercrank: You completed it last year :)
[22:33:14] <slidercrank> krasnayarsk, yes, and in 2013 too. But I've never made to top-10
[22:33:36] <slidercrank> *never made it
[22:33:47] <krasnayarsk> These quizes require a good understanding of hacking?
[22:33:55] <slidercrank> no, not this year
[22:34:01] <krasnayarsk> *Do
[22:34:31] <slidercrank> krasnayarsk, kurahaupo is already on the next level:) this level is easy
[22:34:56] <slidercrank> krasnayarsk, just think of how these clues are connected
[22:34:57] <krasnayarsk> slidercrank: Where do I find level 0? I'm not sure if I'm able to do this tho.
[22:35:14] <slidercrank> krasnayarsk, you start from -2 to 10
[22:35:19] <krasnayarsk> The initial clues you mean?
[22:35:25] <slidercrank> krasnayarsk, yes
[22:35:28] <krasnayarsk> Okay
[22:35:35] <krasnayarsk> So leve -2? haha
[22:35:40] <krasnayarsk> *level
[22:35:46] <slidercrank> you're on level -2
[22:35:50] <krasnayarsk> mmm
[22:35:53] <slidercrank> that's the starting level
[22:35:58] <krasnayarsk> okay
[22:36:04] <slidercrank> the next level will be -1
[22:36:12] <krasnayarsk> I see.
[22:36:27] <krasnayarsk> And when you find a relationship between them, what do I do next?
[22:36:48] <slidercrank> krasnayarsk, you go to the channel ####answer. where answer is your guess
[22:36:59] <slidercrank> note four hashes
[22:37:15] <krasnayarsk> Aah. Thank you slidercrank ;-)
[22:37:17] <slidercrank> if it's empty, your guess was wrong :)
[22:37:23] <krasnayarsk> okay
[22:37:49] <krasnayarsk> Nice
[22:37:52] <slidercrank> alternatively you can do /mode ####channel to see if channel exists
[22:38:04] <slidercrank> without joining it
[22:38:09] <krasnayarsk> haha. Kinda like cheating.
[22:38:13] <slidercrank> no
[22:38:13] <krasnayarsk> hihi
[22:38:19] <slidercrank> you can't cheat with it:)
[22:38:22] <krasnayarsk> I understand.
