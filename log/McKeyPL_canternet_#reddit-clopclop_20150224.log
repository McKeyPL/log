[02:52:43] <cloppyhooves> Do you have any good tutorials about creating webm with vlc?
[02:54:06] <thaostra> cloppyhooves, What is it you're trying to convert? I could try making a gif with my knowhow
[02:54:23] <cloppyhooves> I used ShadowPlay to get a video of Crypt of the Necrodancer
[02:54:37] <cloppyhooves> But I'd rather have it as something that's not a video to make it easier to link

[10:03:17] <cloppyhooves> Hi Squirrelly c:
[10:03:25] <Squirrelly> Hi!
[10:03:48] <cloppyhooves> Whatcha up to? c:
[10:03:58] <Squirrelly> Just came back because I finished clopping to this amazing hardcore bdsm hentai doujin I found
[10:04:43] <cloppyhooves> Oooh c:
[10:04:56] <Squirrelly> Mmhmm
[10:05:22] <Squirrelly> It's...well it's probably really intense and a bit much for some people, but I love it
[10:05:33] <cloppyhooves> Fair enough c:
[10:05:41] <Squirrelly> I'll give it to anybody who asks for it in PMs
[10:05:51] <Squirrelly> It's a bit much to post in main chat
[10:14:29] <iamalion> dammit such a big letdown
[10:14:35] <iamalion> so i have an old yahoo account right
[10:14:39] <iamalion> made it in like 2006
[10:14:46] <iamalion> last logged in prob sometime 2008
[10:15:00] <iamalion> my old gvoice account used it as a pw reset email
[10:15:10] <iamalion> so i have to recover that yahoo account to recover my gmail account
[10:15:31] <iamalion> been trying off and on for a year now, allegedly sends a text to a number that ends with the same as my brothers, but he never gets it
[10:15:38] <iamalion> so today i was trying it
[10:15:54] <iamalion> and i had the idea to look through my old hotmail accounts for login stuff
[10:16:03] <iamalion> and i found a password reset email for xmarks
[10:16:14] <iamalion> so i was like, hey! I used to sync my bookmarks and passwords back then
[10:16:18] <iamalion> so i recovered the xmarks account
[10:16:24] <iamalion> isntalled the addon in chrome since i never use it
[10:16:30] <iamalion> and had it download all the bookmarks and passwords
[10:16:43] <iamalion> went through all the passwords, they were all the ones ive tried and stuff
[10:16:47] <iamalion> nothing for yahoo or gmail in there
[10:16:59] <iamalion> then i come across one that was an old login for one of my old servers way back
[10:17:09] <iamalion> and hte password was one that I had forgotten about
[10:17:14] <iamalion> using my ex's name and stuff
[10:17:17] <iamalion> so i got super excited
[10:17:28] <iamalion> because surely that MUST be the password for that yahoo account and even that gmail!
[10:17:29] <iamalion> nope
[10:17:34] * iamalion grumbles
[10:18:11] <iamalion> on the plus side in this endevour, i found a super old file hosting site where i had put all of my gaming screenshots from 2005-2009
[10:18:13] <iamalion> gigs of them
[10:18:17] <iamalion> i thought they were gone forever
[10:18:19] <iamalion> am so excited
[10:18:36] <iamalion> still no access to my yahoo and subsequently my gmail account
[10:18:48] <iamalion> I want access to my phone number that is 918-543-LION
[10:19:01] <iamalion> like, if you text that, I still GET them via email to one of my hotmail ones
[10:19:06] <iamalion> but I cant get back into the account D:
