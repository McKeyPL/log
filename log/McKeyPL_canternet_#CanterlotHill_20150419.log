[05:23:47] <JustBloom> Well, I guess the real question with those restaurants is "is the food worth 10 bucks?"
[05:24:20] <wobniaR> I'd rather go to nathan's
[05:24:34] <JustBloom> Woah, nathan's is an actual store?

[20:34:41] <Eywind> Well it's 2-4PM EST on Saturdays
[20:34:53] * Copper-Cap hides
[20:34:53] <Eywind> quite scary really
[20:35:15] <RandomNinja> do they also have a really unhealthy relationship?
[20:35:21] <Copper-Cap> yesterday's episode of MLP was a little unnerving
[20:35:32] <Eywind> but derp dolphin
[20:35:37] <RandomNinja> ^
[20:35:40] <Copper-Cap> xD
[20:35:43] <Eywind> My roommate was kinda drunk watching the ep
[20:35:51] <Eywind> and was like "Well now we just need a Scootaloo dream episode" "Umm..."
[20:36:02] <Eywind> "oh well at least there weren't Dolphins" "Umm..."
[20:36:19] <Eywind> His mind was continously blown
[20:36:22] <Copper-Cap> At what point did you realize it was a dream episode Eywind and RandomNinja 
[20:36:29] <Eywind> When she woke up
[20:36:32] <Eywind> the first time
[20:36:32] <RandomNinja> ^
[20:36:41] <Eywind> It was too obvious of a transition
[20:36:47] <RandomNinja> it was pretty obvious with the explicit breading
[20:36:52] <Hamtramck> I'm still not convinced she never stopped dreaming.
[20:36:59] <Hamtramck> Like that one star trek episode
[20:37:02] <Eywind> Lol Hamtramck conspiracy theory = sleeping never ends
[20:37:02] <Hamtramck> where riker does the thing

[20:37:46] * DerpyBot hums a lullaby for DinkyBot
[20:37:49] <Copper-Cap> The whole bug catcher thing seemed a little off though...nothing really tipped you off before she got zapped?
[20:38:04] <Eywind> Who are you asking?
[20:38:14] <Eywind> Given that we all said that we knew before that part lol
[20:38:18] <Copper-Cap> anypony who cares to answer ^_^
[20:38:33] <Eywind> I'd say the latest you should have realized it was a dream was when she woke up with her cutie mark
[20:38:42] <Eywind> well the AJ/AB scene
[20:38:58] <Copper-Cap> did you notice the breakfast change every time?
[20:39:03] <Eywind> Of course
[20:39:12] <thereallynewmop12100_> Copper-Cap: Today is the final day of my birthday
[20:39:13] <Eywind> Boring pancakes to I'm Pancakes to actual Cakes
[20:39:29] <Copper-Cap> thereallynewmop12100_: happy birthday brother ^_^
[20:39:40] <Copper-Cap> Eywind: yus
[20:39:49] <Eywind> also the rooster changed every time
[20:40:03] <thereallynewmop12100_> Copper-Cap: *my birthday week
[20:40:27] <Copper-Cap> did either of you think that the voice in the shadows was Glimmer?
[20:40:37] <Eywind> I would have if it wasn't a dream

[20:43:01] <Eywind> wat
[20:43:37] <Eywind> I think my response to wobniaR was "Is this guy Tesla or a Ghostbuster?" and the response was "Kinda both"
[20:43:42] <Copper-Cap> my money is on for Starlight to find a huge plot device that takes Celestia's and Lunas cutie mark at the season finale
[20:43:47] <Eywind> Meh

[20:43:58] <Eywind> I could see her just following off the face of equestria for a few seasons (or I hope)
[20:44:35] <Copper-Cap> either way, this season has not disappointed...so far
[20:44:47] <Hamtramck> You know what is dissappointing though?
[20:44:47] <Eywind> Yeah I mean I wasn't a huge fan of obligatory episode that happened yesterday
[20:44:50] <Hamtramck> My inability to spell dissappointing

[20:58:12] <Eywind> so probably was a Pinkie thing
[20:58:16] <Eywind> but there is art of that too
[20:58:17] <Hamtramck> Imagine scootaloo happily flyin' around at the end of the dream
[20:58:20] <Hamtramck> and then she wakes up.
[20:58:34] <Hamtramck> "Oh... WELP, back to bed."
[20:58:35] <Eywind> so pretty much the same thing that happens to me on dreams I'm flying?
[20:58:38] <Snapai> Only she wakes up six feet above the floor
[20:58:40] <Snapai> And promptly falls
[20:58:47] <Copper-Cap> Will we ever find out about Scootaloo's family, will the cutie mark crusaders get thier cutie marks, will we ever know if Vermites are real in the equestrian world...find out...NOT on this episode
[20:58:54] <Eywind> Twittermites
[20:58:58] <Snapai> Because SOMEHOW she can sleep-fly, just not do so while awake

[20:59:10] <Snapai> I am surprised I hvaen't seen more twittermites on twitter
[20:59:14] <Eywind> yeah I know
[20:59:30] <Eywind> If there's a ponified version of twitter add-on they need to change the twitter pic with a twittermite
[20:59:30] <Snapai> Not that I've been browsing, because avoiding spoilers
