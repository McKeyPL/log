[07:50:39] <cloppyhooves> [22:46:16] <cloppyhooves> Was reading a book, but then saw something inappropriate, and told my aunt
[07:50:42] <cloppyhooves> [22:46:19] <cloppyhooves> And she talked to the teacher
[07:50:44] <cloppyhooves> [22:46:28] <cloppyhooves> She mentioned the name of the book and I think I had found it
[07:50:47] <cloppyhooves> [22:46:32] <cloppyhooves> But could never access it
[07:50:49] <cloppyhooves> [22:46:35] <cloppyhooves> I just bought it on google play

ON and on until the pleasure climaxed and fire erupted from both their mouths.  But then he suddenly withdrew and she gasped from the shock of the sudden cessation of pleasure..."

[09:22:37] <Flame> I read a reason why we have such crappy used game stores in America: We tend to hoard/hold onto things for a long time, storing them, and tend to have garage sales or flea markets to get rid of that stuff. Meanwhile, in Japan, space is precious, so people tend to sell off older games/etc, and there are many stores having retro stuff.

[23:32:13] <Algido> I like how
[23:32:17] <Connor> Unless they're the right kind of weird
[23:32:46] <Algido> You are talking about masturbating to ponies but use the word weird :P oh relativity.
[23:32:54] <Algido> you so funny
[23:33:36] <Algido> I'm gonna be happy once I get my cam up real soon ^w^
[23:33:50] <Algido> My one now is too much of a hassle
[23:34:31] <samonuh> I want a webcam not attached to my laptop
[23:34:42] <samonuh> That way my screen isn't bent down when I do this stuff :P
[23:35:23] <Connor> They aren't super expensive
[23:35:37] <samonuh> Better than nothing
[23:36:12] <Algido> Me too. My current laptop is basically used as a tower with my yv as a monitor while I use wireless keyboard/remote. But once my new comp comes in I will at least be able to do video stuff again :)
[23:36:25] <Algido> tv as a monitor*
[23:36:26] <samonuh> Woo!
[23:37:59] <Algido> I've been wanting to make special vids for years (Yeah, my comp is old and I just never got around to getting a cam and made do with my phone alone)
[23:38:13] <samonuh> I just enjoy exhibitionism
[23:38:21] <Algido> me too ^^
[23:38:25] <samonuh> :D
[23:38:47] <Vulpixbrew> ooooo
[23:38:49] <Vulpixbrew> its fun
[23:39:08] <Algido> I definitely need new content of myself.
[23:39:18] <samonuh> Real life would be best but the internet works I guess
[23:39:28] <Algido> I feel bad when someone asks for something and all I have is something kinda old. lol
[23:39:46] <samonuh> Hehe
[23:39:49] <Melon_Phone> watching an episode of my strange addiction - coffee enema
[23:39:53] <Melon_Phone> this is weird
[23:39:58] *** Quits: Cel (Cel@Silver.Horizon) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:40:00] <Algido> I have in real life a few times
[23:40:06] <samonuh> Oooo
[23:40:12] <samonuh> Stories? Heh.
[23:40:26] <Connor> Content of yourself? 
[23:40:30] <Algido> Actually my most recent job involved it.
[23:40:41] <samonuh> :O
[23:41:22] <Algido> I escort women on the side and sometimes the woman's husband likes to watch.
[23:41:51] <samonuh> That's very interesting...
[23:42:34] <Algido> Most recently was a client (clients?) I have seen several times and the husband is a Marine who had an injury that made his dick not work so good so that's what got them started. Apparently he can fuck her again, it's just a thing they have now.
[23:42:55] <samonuh> So you're kinda like a hero in their sex life
[23:43:33] <Algido> Heh, yeah I guess.Never thought of it that way that I may be saving their sex life in one way or another.
[23:43:50] <samonuh> Are you really muscular?
[23:43:54] <Algido> The first time was very awkward for me and i felt SO bad.
[23:44:02] <samonuh> How does one become an escort? lol
[23:44:02] <Algido> No
[23:45:11] <Algido> I used to model and I met a guy who runs a business and he aranges everything. More than you think it's just going out to dinner and a movie.
[23:45:18] <Algido> Like a third.
[23:45:42] <Algido> Generally business woman from California.
[23:45:49] <samonuh> Cool
[23:46:00] <samonuh> Sounds kinda nerve wracking
[23:46:26] <Algido> Yeah... it's... something.
[23:46:33] <samonuh> Heh
[23:47:05] * Vulpixbrew will bbl gonna go lay down for a moment
[23:47:07] <Algido> In the few years I have been doing this, I have only done it maybe 50 times. Not like I'm a street hooker lol.

[23:48:08] <Algido> I get paid $500-$700 just for a couple hours, it's amazing. I just like to make people happy. 
[23:48:19] <samonuh> Damn
[23:49:17] <Algido> Yeah, it allows me to do a lot of nothing... so I get bored a lot. I need to find a good job.
[23:49:33] <samonuh> I need to figure out life
[23:49:38] <Algido> I've been thinking of becoming an electrician
[23:50:21] <samonuh> I've been thinking of becoming a hobo. Seems pretty fun.
[23:50:27] <Algido> lol
[23:50:41] <Algido> Makin sweet hobo trashcan fires
[23:50:53] <samonuh> Yea. Just doing hobo stuff
[23:51:28] <Algido> finding a bad ass flannel jacket under the over pass while pissing in a bottle
[23:51:42] <Algido> The good life^^
[23:51:57] <samonuh> I thinking you're confusing hobo for homeless :P
[23:52:23] <samonuh> A hobo makes a steady income doing odd jobs while travelling the country
[23:52:32] <Algido> They are synonyms to me. Only a hobo is a level 3 homeless or above
[23:52:54] <Algido> That, I would call a gypsy
[23:52:58] <samonuh> Most hobos live a good life.
[23:53:09] <samonuh> A gypsy are nomadic people who do no work lol
[23:53:29] <samonuh> I need to fix these blue balls
[23:53:44] <Algido> I am unfamiliar with the people of whom you speak of.
[23:53:56] <Algido> I'd help :P

[23:58:48] <samonuh> Nah, it's cool
[23:58:58] <Algido> congrats. Sounds like you have something beautiful going!
[23:59:30] <Algido> I long for someone special by my side.
[23:59:42] <samonuh> Yup. I wouldn't mind being more sexual open, but she's 100% monogamous 
[23:59:46] <samonuh> sexually*
