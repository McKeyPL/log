[04:42:07] <MisterSkids> hey is anypony on
[04:42:13] <MisterSkids> i got a really quick question
[04:42:48] <MisterSkids> Whats the cord called to the monitar, the one that connects it to the computer itself
[04:43:08] <JustAberrant> mm
[04:43:15] <JustAberrant> video cable?
[04:43:23] <JustAberrant> there's different types
[04:43:31] <JustAberrant> vga, dvi, hdmi, displayport, etc
[04:44:10] <JustAberrant> but if you say video cable or monitor cable .. pretty much anyone in the right context is gonna know what you mean
[04:44:39] <JustAberrant> if your trying to actually get one, you'll want to know what type ;p
[05:09:31] *** Joins: MistVeil (aqua@Pony-prm9c8.static.axtel.net)
[05:15:13] <locodashie11> for most monitors, a VGA is what you want I guess
[05:17:20] <JustAberrant> maybe 10 years ago ;p
[05:17:34] <locodashie11> everything I have is VGA, lol
[05:17:37] <locodashie11> even my laptop
[05:17:57] <JustAberrant> a lot of newer monitors don't even have vga any more :>
[05:18:04] <locodashie11> never had a monitor of any sort to work with displayport
[05:18:19] <JustAberrant> yeah, I've managed to avoid display port
[05:18:21] <locodashie11> and every single monitor I've had is VGA...
[05:18:31] <JustAberrant> that's just sad ;p
[05:18:34] <locodashie11> heh
[05:19:45] <JustAberrant> VGA starts to look like shit at higher resolutions and framerates, unless you've got a really high quality cable
[05:20:22] <locodashie11> well, I just have a bunch of cables that came with the monitors that seem to all work as well as eachother
[05:20:36] <locodashie11> but I have no displays above 1080p 20

[06:02:07] <Moonlightning> Okay.
[06:02:14] <Moonlightning> So /I/ must be missing something here.
[06:02:19] <Moonlightning> Clearly.
[06:02:28] <Moonlightning> I mean, how likely is it that someone else fucked this up?
[06:02:38] <JustAberrant> ?
[06:03:09] <Moonlightning> I run a tiny network. Like Canternet in that it's InspIRCd+Atheme; unlike Canternet in that it's only one server.
[06:03:14] <JustAberrant> also holy balls I should get to bed
[06:03:23] <Moonlightning> Server just went down. Blah blah maintenance blah.
[06:03:33] <JustAberrant> linode by any chance?
[06:03:37] <Moonlightning> No.
[06:03:40] <Moonlightning> These are super rare.
[06:03:45] <JustAberrant> cause yeah, they are rebooting everything due to some xen bugs
[06:03:55] <Moonlightning> This is the first actual reboot since I brought the machine up.
[06:04:06] <Moonlightning> There've been one or two network outages
[06:04:09] <Moonlightning> But that's beside the point.
[06:04:19] <Moonlightning> Server comes back up, Insp and Atheme both kick in.
[06:04:19] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: Even my new 1440p monitor has VGA
[06:04:33] <AppleDash> it has VGA, DVI, HDMI, and displayport
[06:04:35] <JustAberrant> the last two monitors I bought didn't have VGA :(
[06:04:42] <Moonlightning> Insp loads m_permchannels, reads in the database file, sets all the modes back. Yeah?
[06:04:44] <AppleDash> (And comes with all 4 cables)
[06:04:51] <Moonlightning> And then Atheme, Atheme
[06:05:02] <Moonlightning> Atheme connects to Insp, does the whole burst thing
[06:05:07] <Moonlightning> And unsets all the modes.
[06:05:39] * JustAberrant shruggles .. I dunno anything about atheme.. 
[06:05:43] <Moonlightning> What am I missing here.
[06:06:02] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: /list isn'
[06:06:05] <AppleDash> 't working
[06:06:22] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: I think there is a band where monitors won't have VGA.. and it's the band I buy within ;p
[06:06:28] <JustAberrant> like.. the ultra cheap monitors will have it
[06:06:29] <AppleDash> lol
[06:06:32] <JustAberrant> and the expensive monitors will
[06:06:38] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: how is it not working?
[06:06:40] <JustAberrant> but the ~$100 to $200 ones.. might not :>
[06:06:46] <AppleDash> I guess mine is expensive? 700$ or so?
[06:06:54] <JustAberrant> yeah, I'd say so ;p
[06:06:54] <Googie> The funny thing, Canternet isn't actually that tiny. It's just not one of the "big" networks.
[06:06:57] <JustAberrant> at least relatively
[06:07:04] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: It is returning nothing.
[06:07:08] <AppleDash> Immediate end of list
[06:07:09] <Googie> Apparently we're in the top 50 or something for size.
[06:07:17] <JustAberrant> Googie: cool :>

[17:36:52] <DataByte> i figured out a roundabout way to get extra story stats, like publish date, characters, sequels, etc :)
[17:37:29] <DataByte> also how to grab every fic featured on eqd, canterlot library, and twilight's library xD
[17:38:04] <DataByte> accidentally went through 2GB of cell data testing the scanner on eqd.. oops
[17:39:05] <DataByte> re-scanning all the fics now.. interesting: 4 of the first 3000 seem to have been removed in the past week
[17:40:23] <DataByte> there is one thing i'm not sure about, though.. fimfic only shows updated for new chapters, not when an author posts edits or revisions
[17:40:47] <DataByte> and that's 4+GB of txt alone to scan
[18:04:27] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, How are you scanning that text? Depending on how you go about it should be quick enough.
[18:05:00] <DataByte> well, scanning isn't the issue..
[18:05:25] <Marble_Gargle> Then? I'm curious what you're doing exactly.
[18:05:30] <DataByte> the issue is that all that text is on fimfic, and i want to compare it to the cache of text on my server
[18:05:38] <DataByte> ;)
[18:06:18] <DataByte> it's alot to scan.. and the api can't help much, especially if all was changed was a spelling typo
[18:07:26] <Marble_Gargle> Hmm. What exactly are you doing? And doesn't the API offer a "last changed date" header or something?
[18:10:51] <DataByte> last modified is only the last time a chapter was added
[18:14:29] <Marble_Gargle> Just curious what you were doing exactly.

[18:37:54] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, Yea but I mean... you want to do a search engine. Say I type in, uh, "scootaloo". What do you do? Do you search the entire text every time?
[18:38:27] <DataByte> oh, no.. right now, i don't even scan the text
[18:38:37] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, Ah, so how do you match 'scootaloo' to a fic?
[18:38:51] <DataByte> title, description, author name
[18:39:27] <Marble_Gargle> That seems, hmm, like it's not a lot. Can't you get a list of characters? Ratings? Tags?
[18:39:41] <Marble_Gargle> A story can be tagged with 'scootaloo' but not have her name in the title or description.
[18:40:03] <DataByte> i figured out how to grab character tags, and a nifty way to store them in the database (i wrote a mysql function in c++ to retrieve them) xD
[18:40:23] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, Any particular reason you're doing such a text-search-heavy task in C++?
[18:40:24] <DataByte> so that'll be once i finish re-scanning all of fimfiction to get the extra data
[18:40:52] * AppleDash gives DataByte a perl
[18:41:22] <DataByte> well, i'm new to search engines.. how would a normal search engine work for a string search?
[18:41:43] <Marble_Gargle> Tags, mostly. But search engines aren't "normal"
[18:42:10] <Marble_Gargle> You'd also need to rate sites for fitness... essentially you'd do a fitness graph where you basically... rate sites based on how many in-links they have, for example. Sites with many out-links are demoted in value etc.
[18:42:17] <DataByte> (also, the number of results is obscene.. no idea why mysql tells me it found 200,000 results for a query when there aren't even 140k in the table)
[18:42:32] <AppleDash> Because MySQL estimates sometimes
[18:42:42] <AppleDash> For huge result sets
[18:42:42] <Marble_Gargle> Wait wait wait.
[18:42:44] <Marble_Gargle> MYSQL?
[18:43:01] <AppleDash> At least fimfiction has a semi-useful search now... I remember when the only option was Google Custom Search on fimfiction.net :)
[18:43:03] <Marble_Gargle> For the love of god stop whatever you're doing right now and post to PostgresQL.
[18:43:39] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, Nobody can help you with MySQL. it is broken. It is insane. It is dangerous. Do not use MySQL for anything ever.
[18:43:40] <Colgate> uhoh, the db performance wars
[18:43:46] <AppleDash> For the love of god stop whatever you're doing right now and switch away from SQL :)
[18:43:47] <Marble_Gargle> It's not even performance. :/
[18:44:03] <Marble_Gargle> I mean... the default is to cut off your data if you try and insert more than the limit. It's default UTF isn't and is case insensitive...
[18:44:08] <AppleDash> Nobody can help you with SQL. it is broken. It is insane. It is dangerous. Do not use SQL for anything ever.
[18:44:11] <Marble_Gargle> To get MySQL to do things even remotely sanely takes a lot of effort.
[18:44:29] <Marble_Gargle> AppleDash, That's ridiculous though. NoSQL is good for some things, but most of the databases aren't mature for relational data at all.
[18:44:35] <Marble_Gargle> Don't tell me you're a mongotard.
[18:44:38] <Colgate> /shrug, it has some default settings that need changed, big deal, everything is like that
[18:44:45] <AppleDash> I prefer to refer to myself as a mong :P
[18:44:45] <Marble_Gargle> ... Hang on.
[18:44:49] <AppleDash> Umm, case insensitivity in a database is rather useful, actually
[18:44:51] <Marble_Gargle> You're insane Colgate. :P I'll show you.
[18:45:05] <DataByte> i agree, dash xD
[18:45:06] <Marble_Gargle> This post I like in particular: http://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/12/28/terrible-choices-mysql/
[18:45:07] <PinkiePieBot> [ Terrible choices: MySQL | ionel's codelog ]
[18:45:22] <AppleDash> Just because postgres does what you want by default and mysql doesn't, doesn't make it any better
[18:45:22] <Marble_Gargle> AppleDash, You can't just... can't just make text case insensitive by default. It even breaks UNIQUE constraints....
[18:45:38] <Colgate> I don't see why you can't
[18:45:40] <Marble_Gargle> Yes. Yes, it does. MySQL is objectively bad. That's a good intro to why it's bad, BTW. 
[18:45:41] <AppleDash> Marble_Gargle: So how do I perform case insensitive queries then?
[18:45:47] <Colgate> and I'm sure it is configurable
[18:45:52] <Marble_Gargle> AppleDash, There's a way to do it...
[18:45:52] <Colgate> so... what's the big deal?
[18:45:57] <AppleDash> Someone tags a story with Spike, I search for "spike". That story doesn't come up.
[18:46:02] <Marble_Gargle> I use ilike in my ORM.
[18:46:06] <AppleDash> Because the casing is different
[18:46:18] <Marble_Gargle> And it has a LOWER function.
[18:46:23] <Marble_Gargle> But MySQl in particular is insane.
[18:46:32] <Marble_Gargle> If anything use Maria, but yeesh. Just use Postgres.
[18:46:36] <Colgate> so far you haven't said a reason why that was valid
[18:46:38] <AppleDash> You should not be doing stuff like LOWER in a DB.
[18:46:43] <Marble_Gargle> it truncates data by default.
[18:46:54] <Marble_Gargle> It quietly deletes things.... it's insane.
[18:47:01] <AppleDash> Also, Marble_Gargle, bet I could find a similar article to yours about any DB you ask me
[18:47:08] <AppleDash> It's not insane.
[18:47:13] <AppleDash> You should be doing validation on your end
[18:47:18] <DataByte> ^
[18:47:20] <Colgate> default settings are things that can be changed
[18:47:25] <AppleDash> You shouldn't just be blindly inserting arbitrary length data into tables
[18:47:44] <AppleDash> Unrelated, I had the weirdest dream
[18:47:55] <Marble_Gargle> But how can a database just... SILENTLY truncate things?
[18:47:57] <Marble_Gargle> That's scary.
[18:47:58] <Colgate> I would like it if my db didn't accept a random 7000 MB entry I fucked up and inserted
[18:48:02] <Colgate> :P
[18:48:14] <AppleDash> In which I bought a 1.2TB 10k RPM SAS drive at a thrift store for 2$
[18:48:16] <Marble_Gargle> I can't think of one good reason to use MySQL instead of Postgres. :/
[18:48:28] <AppleDash> I can't think of one good reason to do the opposite
[18:48:40] <Marble_Gargle> Colgate, It will give you an exception which your sane code will handle. It won't silently truncate it....
[18:48:45] <Marble_Gargle> Sane behaviour?
[18:49:01] <Colgate> again, configurable length
[18:49:05] <Colgate> not an issue
[18:49:05] <AppleDash> Simple solution
[18:49:27] <AppleDash> if (data.length < maxLength) { insertData(); } else { raiseError(); }
[18:49:39] <Marble_Gargle> http://grimoire.ca/mysql/choose-something-else
[18:49:40] <PinkiePieBot> [ The Codex » Do Not Pass This Way Again ]
[18:49:57] <Marble_Gargle> AppleDash, If you miss something, your should be getting exceptions. Errors shouldn't just be silently ignored.
[18:50:00] <Marble_Gargle> That's just terrible.
[18:50:11] <AppleDash> And there we are, raising an exception.
[18:50:20] <Marble_Gargle> And now your code is littered with checks like that instead of doing exception handling...
[18:50:34] <AppleDash> You could argue that something like malloc in C doesn't raise an exception if you mess it up :)
[18:50:38] <Marble_Gargle> MySQL defaults to silently breaking and malforming your data rather than giving you errors.
[18:50:51] <Colgate> there's that word again
[18:50:53] <Colgate> "defaults"
[18:50:57] <Marble_Gargle> Yes, but there's a good reason it does that... MySQL is a danger to your data which should be your most precious asset.
[18:51:12] <Marble_Gargle> I'd be willing to bet you don't know all the settings it takes to make MySQL behave sanely.
[18:51:12] <AppleDash> k
[18:51:26] <Colgate> I bet I don't know either, but that's what `man` is for
[18:51:29] <AppleDash> "sanely" depends on the person defining it (I know there's a term for that I just don't remember)
[18:51:46] <AppleDash> MySQL defaults work fine for me.
[18:52:13] <Marble_Gargle> You really should read that article on grimoire.
[18:52:27] <Colgate> I'm not reading any webpages while at work, /shrug
[18:52:46] <AppleDash> I'm OK, personally
[18:52:55] <Colgate> so far, all I've heard bad from you about mysql is, "I don't like their default settings"
[18:53:02] <Marble_Gargle> MySQL is... broken. I'd say it's even less sane than PHP. It's one of those pieces of technology I fail to see a good reason to use. And I'm not a language or DB nazi. I don't like Mongo because it's immature, but to me basically anything but MySQL and Mongo might be very reasonable.
[18:53:02] <AppleDash> ^
[18:53:07] <AppleDash> ^ to Colgate
[18:53:49] <Marble_Gargle> AppleDash, But... it silently truncates data. It will let you corrupt your database and fill it with garbage rather than giving you errors. That's just insane for a database to do. :|
[18:53:55] <Marble_Gargle> Seriously, SQLite is saner.
[18:54:27] <AppleDash> Yes, and in my eyes, if you've got say a VARCHAR(10) and you stick in an 11-char string, that is a programming error on your end
[18:54:42] <AppleDash> You should make sure maximums and such match in your DB and your code.
[18:54:57] <Marble_Gargle> It IS an error.
[18:55:08] <AppleDash> So then you need to fix your code if you're doing that.
[18:55:18] <Marble_Gargle> But it shouldn't just... silently chop off the data. ASSUMING it even does what you think, and doesn't implicitly cast it to another encoding and then cut your code in half.
[18:55:46] <Marble_Gargle> ... why should my code have to fight the insanity of the database? I want an exception I can log and then act on rather than just have broken data being inserted and me never finding out. It will never tell you these insane things it does.
[18:55:58] <AppleDash> Are you listening to me?
[18:55:59] <Marble_Gargle> You only notice once you see that your data is bad.
[18:56:06] <Marble_Gargle> Yes.
[18:56:47] <AppleDash> Any good ORM will let you define a field in your object that maps to a DB field. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. Generally, when you define a text field in an ORM, you define the max length too. If you try to set that field to something bigger than the limit, guess what it does?
[18:56:52] <AppleDash> 05I04T 07R08A03I09S10E11S 02A12N 06E13X05C04E07P08T03I09O10N
[18:57:17] <Marble_Gargle> So now we need a good ORM to deal with the database's insanity? Why not use a sane database?
[18:57:31] <AppleDash> You shouldn't be using database functions directly, honestly
[18:57:59] <Marble_Gargle> No, of course you shouldn't. But your database should behave sanely.
[18:58:17] <Marble_Gargle> And you need to work hard to configure your ORM so you get at least a medium level of sanity from MySQL.
[18:58:19] <AppleDash> Again, our definitions of "sanely" are different
[18:58:27] <AppleDash> I can put data in, I can query it back out.
[18:58:29] <Marble_Gargle> Sanely as in... acts in a way that implies it cares about your data.
[18:58:30] <AppleDash> Database.
[18:59:01] <Marble_Gargle> It might decide to silently truncate that data. Or implicitly cast it and loose information.
[18:59:16] <AppleDash> I give up
[18:59:24] <AppleDash> Too early for this
[18:59:45] <Marble_Gargle> Yea sure. DataByte Please for the love of jebus use anything except MySQL. You will not regret it.
[18:59:51] <Marble_Gargle> And read this: http://grimoire.ca/mysql/choose-something-else

[19:00:54] * Marble_Gargle twitches
[19:01:02] <Marble_Gargle> Erhgarble.
[19:01:13] <Marble_Gargle> It's like arguing for PHP. Possible but pointless.
[19:01:20] <DataByte> Marble_Gargle: if you can give me something that works with preparedstatements in java, works for a php website, can import from mysql, and can easily configure replication, then maybe
[19:01:22] <AppleDash> Marble_Gargle: Read this: https://appledash.org/postgres/choose-something-else.php
[19:01:37] <AppleDash> Just because it's on some random web page doesn't mean it applies to anyone or if it's even correct
[19:01:47] <DataByte> lol
[19:01:53] <Marble_Gargle> Did you actually read it? It lists specific issues with MySQL's design.
[19:02:04] <Marble_Gargle> It's not just a "MysQL sucks lol", it has a list of things MySQL does badly.
[19:02:17] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, Postgres, as it happens.
[19:02:29] <DataByte> oh, and i wrote a custom dll for mysql.. i'll need that, too
[19:02:49] <Marble_Gargle> wait, why?
[19:03:09] <AppleDash> I totally wrote an sqlite class for C++ once, I forget why though
[19:03:37] <DataByte> i'm storing character tags as strings, since 128 bits is too large - so i needed a function to compare two tags
[19:04:11] <Marble_Gargle> This is like some sort of special insanity zone I'm in...
[19:04:19] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, What's wrong with build-in string comparison?
[19:04:24] <DataByte> ..
[19:05:02] <DataByte> ok, this is what i mean by tags: are you familiar with bit flags?
[19:05:19] *** Bit is now known as Rhys
[19:05:20] <Marble_Gargle> Yea.
[19:05:34] <DataByte> that's what i'm using for categories and character tags
[19:05:46] <Marble_Gargle> Hmm. Alright. Why?
[19:06:17] <DataByte> but i can't store a 128-bit value in mysql, so i stored them as strings "0001010000010" etc
[19:06:30] * Marble_Gargle is lost for words
[19:06:31] <Marble_Gargle> Why?
[19:07:22] <DataByte> now, i need to find an intersection of "00010001010010000" and "00000001000000000" - for an int, all i'd need is (val1 & val2) != 0
[19:07:40] <Marble_Gargle> Why do you store tags like that?
[19:07:42] <DataByte> but mysql treats them as ascii values, so that's worthless
[19:08:15] <Marble_Gargle> And I'm confused, why can't MySQL store it as binary data if that really is the optimal way to do it?
[19:08:33] <DataByte> as for why, it's because i don't want to make 128 columns, and building a whole other table would be too much of a hassle to filter the results
[19:09:19] <DataByte> and i don't want to use a blob, because that's stored externally - i want speed here
[19:09:25] <Marble_Gargle> Hmm so it's a performance question that keeps you from normalizing it? That's not too insane, it's just an unusual approach.
[19:09:46] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, What do you mean stored externally? But you know it's a little funny, MySQL, PHP and Java all at once is like a nightmare, heh.
[19:10:00] <Marble_Gargle> Java being the only sane thing in the list although it still leaves a funny taste in my mouth.
[19:10:39] <Marble_Gargle> Java isn't garbage, don't give me wrong, and it has been getting better lately, trying to catch up with C#. But... PHP. I honestly fail to see why people use that language.
[19:11:17] <DataByte> i get the feeling you don't do a great deal of application development, honestly...
[19:11:36] <Marble_Gargle> As in desktop application? I mostly do API's but I've done some.
[19:11:58] <DataByte> AppleDash: http://i.imgur.com/7hb8aav.jpg
[19:12:07] <Marble_Gargle> PHP just have no advantages over other technologies, same as MySQL. Java is sane enough although I do think C# outdid it.
[19:12:25] <Marble_Gargle> Oh yea but obviously I only disagree with you because I'm unskilled
[19:12:33] <Marble_Gargle> Because it's not like PHP is the empowered amateur's favourite tool.
[19:12:35] <AppleDash> DataByte: lol
[19:13:45] <Marble_Gargle> I really do believe that nobody who really knows their tools would prefer PHP to anything. For any task.
[19:13:57] <Marble_Gargle> It's a useable language, but it's just... badly designed and filled with traps.
[19:14:20] <Marble_Gargle> DataByte, And it actually happens to be a very relevant slide, now that you post it. But I can see I'm not gonna get anywhere.
[19:14:30] <DataByte> i used php to generate a bunch of cards against equestria cards i printed for a party /shrug/
[19:14:34] <AppleDash> I used to use PHP quite a bit, now I don't really use it too much
[19:14:39] <AppleDash> I've switched to Python for web stuff
[19:15:02] <Marble_Gargle> Which is completely sane. Python obviously has problems like any programming language, but PHP has no real reason to be used anymore.
[19:15:10] <Marble_Gargle> I mostly use Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy as my primary webstack.
[19:16:50] <Colgate> oh, you must be Ginger_Pop on ponychat
[19:17:36] <Marble_Gargle> Yes. I'm sorry, but just... PHP/MySQL is honestly the worst stack I know that's still used. I am genuinely surprised it's being advocated. Actually, genuinely surprised.
[19:17:59] <Marble_Gargle> And I honestly go out of my way t onot language fan boy.
[19:18:44] <AppleDash> Marble_Gargle: Flask, seriously?
[19:19:19] <Marble_Gargle> AppleDash, Eh, I don't need all that much stack, a request object, basic app structure and jinja2 is all I end up using mostly.
[19:19:28] <AppleDash> Flask is not good for anything over like 5 pages
[19:19:31] <AppleDash> Gets messy
[19:19:58] <AppleDash> I most often use it to turn existing projects into web apps
[19:20:26] <Marble_Gargle> AppleDash, I don't see how. It doesn't get in your way mostly. And it doesn't somehow stop you from structuring your app well.
[19:20:28] <AppleDash> Like, seriously, initialize the app, add one decorator to an existing function, app.run(), and ta da, this thing is suddenly web-compatible
[19:21:10] <Marble_Gargle> Which is a large part of why I like it. You can structure things how you want / what makes sense in your apps internal logic, and you don't have to change everything. Its not powerful obviously, but it doesn't have to be.
[19:21:17] <Marble_Gargle> What would you use?
[19:21:27] <AppleDash> I'm looking into django right now
[19:21:30] <AppleDash> It appears to be OK
[19:21:50] <Marble_Gargle> Hmm yea AFAIK it is, it just made some assumptions about my data I didn't care to try and fight, so flask.
[19:22:13] <AppleDash> Yeah, it's got some weird defaults but they can be disabled easily if you don't care for them
[19:36:04] <Marble_Gargle> I know what you're doing and those are not actually analogous situations. Flask does not destroy your data and undermine your effort by default.

[23:22:55] <Neptune> Moonlightning: Yes?
[23:23:15] <Moonlightning> About your song! x3
[23:23:27] <Neptune> What about it?
[23:23:35] <Moonlightning> Firstly. I really like the first part (0:00..0:29) and the last part (3:50..4:32).
[23:25:05] <Neptune> thanks
[23:25:10] <Moonlightning> Mhm ^^
[23:25:28] <Moonlightning> The key changes start at 2:23 right now. I feel like that's too late.
[23:26:00] <Moonlightning> Maybe you could start them at 0:30 or 0:43 instead.
[23:26:06] <Moonlightning> Or 0:57
[23:26:38] <Moonlightning> Or even 1:12 or 1:27
[23:27:25] <Moonlightning> They should probably also stop for the last part or two that the bass is there (i.e. at 3:57 or 4:04).
[23:27:56] <Moonlightning> And maybe use three or four keys instead of two.
[23:28:07] <Moonlightning> Adding them in the first place was definitely an improvement, though. x3
[23:30:08] <Kinsley> Throwing my two cents in: the song sounds good but you really badly need to lower the volume because it's just too loud to enjoy.

[23:38:06] <Moonlightning> Neptune: One more thing: the part at 0:29..1:29 seems kinda repetetive. I'm thinking maybe kill the bassline at 1:29 and bring it back at 1:51, or something.
