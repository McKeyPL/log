[04:12:23] <Quinn> I can't imagine that there are many parents who wouldn't be a cunt about their daughter drawing porn
[04:12:44] <princesssluttershy> I know a few poeple who draw porn 
[04:12:51] <princesssluttershy> their parents are all fine with it :/
[04:13:18] <Quinn> my mom'd be pissed if she knew I watched porn
[04:13:23] <princesssluttershy> My mom wouldn't be ok with it but my dad would be fine with it
[04:14:14] <princesssluttershy> I remember my mom once said that watching porn was as bad as rape :/

[04:14:35] <ponder> your mums don't know what they're talking about
[04:14:47] <princesssluttershy> she divorced my dad over porn and weed

[04:16:23] <princesssluttershy> weisey, he says he doesn't want to know about me smoking until I'm 20, then he's fine with it

[04:17:18] <weisey> heeeelllll yeeeh
[04:17:27] <Quinn> my dad was a blind ultra-religious asshole who hated my guts, so I just ignored him growing up
[04:17:40] <Quinn> he probably wouldn't care if I smoked or not, nor anything else

[04:19:23] <princesssluttershy> My dad is uncomfortable with gay stuff but doesn't seem to mind it *that* much
[04:19:47] <Quinn> and tried to sign me up for some islamic relationship workshop after my husband died, she's been trying to "convert" me to be straight ever since
[04:20:27] <princesssluttershy> but it would be hypocritical of him to be mad at me watching porn
[04:20:52] <princesssluttershy> Quinn, your mom is a cunt
[04:21:02] <Quinn> oh well
[04:21:26] <Quinn> if I ever need an arranged marriage to a girl who only wants to clean and cook, I'll know where to go. Cause she's tried that a bunch of times too
[04:21:41] <princesssluttershy> Wow
[04:22:03] <princesssluttershy> can I just say that your mom is the kind of person I hate most in the world?
[04:22:25] <Quinn> sure, why not
[04:22:44] <Quinn> she literally tried to talk me into marrying a woman and "becoming straight" about a week after he passed away
[04:23:02] <RNGsus> What the fuck
[04:23:04] <Quinn> mentioned all these friends of hers who had daughters my age

[04:33:50] <Quinn> yea
[04:35:11] <Quinn> then again I'm sure a lot of people would go back if they had the chance
[04:35:40] <ponder> Yeah, probably.
[04:36:25] <Quinn> so many things I'd do differently
[04:36:44] <ponder> Y'know, the Trolls in Discworld believe that time is going backwards, because the think they're walking along the timeline and that they should be able to see what's ahead of them.

[05:50:42] <Melon_Guy> the series is set around 850's yet they use regular month names
[05:51:03] <Melon_Guy> they didn't change until the 1300's
[05:51:28] <Melon_Guy> and even then they changed it to something completely different
[05:51:39] <cloppyhoofs> I have a few things to wash: shorts, a shear vest-ish thing, a white undershirt, some thick, dark things, and some underwear
[05:51:53] <cloppyhoofs> I could either wash them all in one load
[05:51:58] <cloppyhoofs> Or do all of the rest of my laundry too
[05:52:05] <cloppyhoofs> (Since it's cost-per-use machinese)
[05:52:16] <cloppyhoofs> I usually put the white undershirt in my lights, and the shear vest in delicates
[05:52:22] <cloppyhoofs> Should I just throw everything as if it were colors?
[05:52:28] <cloppyhoofs> Or everything as if it were delicates?
[05:52:37] <cloppyhoofs> Or just go for doing the rest of my laundry?

[07:37:28] <Futashy> the thing is if its not filmed for 120fps
[07:37:34] <Futashy> it'll be adding in a bunch of 'extra' frames
[07:37:43] <Futashy> so its not really 120fps

[23:20:52] <Squirrelly> AND
[23:21:09] <Squirrelly> I got random calls from people I don't know, even though it said it was my friend's number.
