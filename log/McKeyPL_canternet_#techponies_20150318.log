[00:17:37] <Compu> hmmm
[00:17:41] <Compu> im wondering
[00:18:19] <Compu> why isnt there a standard for images that arent square? why not have a round image standard with a radius pixel measurement?

[00:39:21] <Pikachu> I think because computers find it easier to work with integer math than with floating point math, and using floating ooint can suffer from rounding errors, making compression much more difficult to achieve.
[00:39:59] <Pikachu> As well as the fact that memory allocation is more straightforward with AxB than it is with pi*R^2

[00:42:06] <Pikachu> And that pixels are being made square currently, meaning that in a circular system you can't get a nice image without changing how pixels are arranged - making a new standard that is only partially compatible
[00:43:13] <Pikachu> Unless someone can manage to somehow make a standard for that sort of system that gets around all these issues...

[22:27:00] <JustAberrant> mm
[22:27:04] <JustAberrant> look in logs
[22:27:10] <JustAberrant> possible one of your disks is failing
[22:27:15] <JustAberrant> that can jam a system up pretty good
[22:27:18] <endoriazel> still it shouldnt screw up I/O insensitive stuff like game servers
[22:27:31] <JustAberrant> great as md is, it really doesn't handle a failing disk well imo
[22:27:39] <JustAberrant> at least not out of the box
[22:28:15] <JustAberrant> if you see a bunch of ATA freeze messages and such.. probably what it is
[22:28:16] <endoriazel> as far as i can tell from /proc/mdstat and smartctl all my disks are working
[22:28:35] <JustAberrant> do dmesg ?
