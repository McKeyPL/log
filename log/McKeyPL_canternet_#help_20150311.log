[14:58:55] *** Pony_87277 is now known as Vampire
[14:59:07] *** Vampire is now known as SilveR^SurfeR
[14:59:23] <SilveR^SurfeR> is there any one to listen me
[14:59:30] <Dusk> I'm here
[14:59:37] <SilveR^SurfeR> hi Dusk how are you
[14:59:45] <SilveR^SurfeR> there was one question in my mind
[14:59:47] <Dusk> I'm tired, but I'm here.
[15:00:01] <SilveR^SurfeR> oh i feel sorry for you Dusk
[15:00:11] <Dusk> It's fine, what's your question?
[15:00:20] <SilveR^SurfeR> can you tell me if some one group 2 user ids
[15:00:51] <SilveR^SurfeR> and login one and donot login other for 30 days. the other one will be suspended ?
[15:01:09] <Dusk> No
[15:01:17] <Dusk> The other will still need to be logged into
[15:01:33] <Dusk> However  you can grant another user account access to your nicks and they yours.
[15:01:37] <SilveR^SurfeR> means group donot have any concern with logins
[15:01:43] <Fluttershi> assuming "other" in this case is the original nick of the account
[15:02:14] <Fluttershi> if you have grouped nicks, but don't use em, they'll go poof
[15:02:19] <Dusk> Yes
[15:02:31] <Dusk> I think he's referring to linking two user accounts though
[15:02:40] <SilveR^SurfeR> you are rite Dusk
[15:02:47] <Dusk> Alright
[15:03:02] <SilveR^SurfeR> i m asking about linking to different accounts
[15:03:44] <Dusk> So if you want to use another user account's nicks (This won't let you access their permissions or the account itself) you can set up nickserv access
[15:04:02] <SilveR^SurfeR> suppose i linked account b to account A. i use account a continuesly but didnot login account be which is linked to account a. then account b will be lost if not login with 30 days?
[15:04:10] <Dusk> Yes
[15:04:14] <Dusk> There's no way around that
[15:04:24] <SilveR^SurfeR> got it boss
[15:04:35] <SilveR^SurfeR> means login is must to prevent suspension
[15:04:54] <Dusk> Yes
[15:05:03] <Dusk> You can set !vacation
[15:05:04] <SilveR^SurfeR> thanks boss
[15:05:15] <SilveR^SurfeR> yes thats a good idea
[15:05:17] <Dusk> Which will extend the amount of time, but you cannot login
[15:05:29] <SilveR^SurfeR> yes if i login i have to vacation again
[15:05:33] <Dusk> Mhm
[15:06:18] <SilveR^SurfeR> vacation extend from 30 to how many days
[15:06:22] <Dusk> 60
[15:09:03] <SilveR^SurfeR> thanks Dusk Fluttershi
