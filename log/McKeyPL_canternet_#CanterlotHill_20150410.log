[03:21:15] <Muffin_Spectacles>  I was trying to remember - has anyone ever tried to doÂ Â a list of what a writer's strengths and weaknesses are for the Mane 6?

[03:22:47] <Muffin_Spectacles> "Hey, she was wearing that Fluttershy-patterned bra before I imagined it!" (oops, said tht outloud)
[03:23:06] <MikeM> You mean a complete comparison of every episode by writer, analyzing the treatment of each pony?
[03:23:09] <Araxnus> Bahahaha!
[03:23:25] <wobniaR> Mane 6 - All trash, Spike - Best pony
[03:23:27] <wobniaR> Done
[03:23:46] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Watching Cutie Map, and thinking of the EqG films, I think I found Meghan McCarthy's least-fave character to write for.
[03:23:49] <Playstation> The yellow one is my favorite
[03:23:50] <MikeM> Ah, but what would Spike be without his mares?
[03:23:50] <Araxnus> Um. Spike is not a Pony
[03:23:52] <Playstation> butter pone
[03:24:07] <wobniaR> He'd find new mares MikeM
[03:24:23] <MikeM> lol...yeah
[03:24:40] * Muffin_Spectacles prefers Sugar Belle over Coco Pommel.

[15:43:41] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr nu ur a skrublord
[15:43:50] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuuu
[15:44:47] <Unixkitty> Now don't be rude, RandomNinja :P
[15:44:48] <Cloud_Zephyr> cloud everything seems stupid
[15:44:54] <RandomNinja> Unixkitty, what? :P
[15:45:00] <RandomNinja> I agree
[15:45:01] <Cloud_Zephyr> i'd rather keep my 1s and 0s on my own hard drives
[15:45:02] <Unixkitty> Nothing :P
[15:45:22] <Cloud_Zephyr> and process the 1s and 0s using my own processor
[15:45:25] * RandomNinja rudes Unixkitty 
[15:45:36] <Unixkitty> Cloud everything seems more like rely on someone else to store your personal files
[15:45:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[15:46:03] <Unixkitty> But then again, if something breaks you may have someone else to blame and not just yourself
[15:46:07] <RandomNinja> also, cloud gaming
[15:46:18] <Unixkitty> So I suppose it couldn't be that terrible
[15:46:26] <RandomNinja> how will they fix the horrendous input lag
[15:46:52] <Flurshy> there are two kinds of computer users
[15:46:57] <Flurshy> those who use cloud storage
[15:47:04] <Flurshy> and those who use SSD
[15:47:09] <RandomNinja> and those who own decent computers
[15:47:13] <Flurshy> ^
[15:47:25] <Flurshy> which reminds me I need to get a boot SSD >.<
[15:47:31] <RandomNinja> do it filly
[15:47:41] <Cloud_Zephyr> if i was rich i would be using ssds
[15:47:48] <RandomNinja> ascend further
[15:48:00] <Unixkitty> And this reminds me I should probably take this SSD I have to some kind of service to hopefully fix the connector
[15:48:06] <RandomNinja> pls you don't need to be rich for a 60 GB OS SSD
[15:48:13] <Unixkitty> Otherwise it's just laying there without use
[15:48:27] <Flurshy> what ninja said
[15:48:30] <Cloud_Zephyr> but then i'd have to give up my dvd drive (which i dont use)
[15:48:40] <Cloud_Zephyr> (or get a decent computer)
[15:48:46] <Flurshy> get a decent computer then
[15:48:51] <Cloud_Zephyr> nu
[15:48:59] <Trildar|Icecube> ye stop with teh macbutts
[15:48:59] <Flurshy> my mobo has 6 or 8 SATA connections
[15:49:10] <Cloud_Zephyr> never!
[15:49:14] <Flurshy> case has room for four 5 inch drives and EIGHT hard drives
[15:49:28] <Trildar|Icecube> Butt gaming, the best gaming.
[15:49:45] <Cloud_Zephyr> apples move to SSDs on its macbook line has proved to be a problem for me
[15:49:53] <Cloud_Zephyr> not enough space
[15:50:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> and no choice for a hard drive cus they are too thin
[15:50:12] <Trildar|Icecube> So stop being an appulskrub
[15:50:14] <RandomNinja> pls, just get a usb connected dvd drive
[15:50:22] <Unixkitty> Buy five SSDs and create a RAID 10. What was cloud storage again?
[15:50:40] <RandomNinja> volume storage though
[15:50:47] <Flurshy> when I do get an SSD the only stuff going on it is boot programs
[15:51:05] <RandomNinja> gotta keep those entirely legal terabytes of music and movies somewhere
[15:51:12] <Cloud_Zephyr> i guess wut RandomNinja said. but meh no point im upgrading soon
[15:51:14] <Unixkitty> Oh yes, SSDs don't exactly live long if you write on them too much.
[15:51:22] <RandomNinja> Flurshy, also common use programs
[15:51:24] <Flurshy> Windows, drivers, wallpapers, razer surround
[15:51:36] <Flurshy> yeah and HydraIRC >.>
[15:51:46] <RandomNinja> web browser, music, 7-zip etc
[15:51:55] <RandomNinja> anything small you use often
[15:52:16] <Trildar|Icecube> Music is small? :P
[15:52:30] *** Trildar|Icecube is now known as Trildar
[15:52:36] <Unixkitty> Hail Hydra!
[15:52:49] <RandomNinja> Trildar pls, the music player is
[15:52:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> but ye, i could replace my dvd drive with an ssd
[15:53:00] <Trildar> Oh, the player.
[15:53:07] <Flurshy> um, web browser is already fast to start
[15:53:14] <RandomNinja> but now it will be instant!
[15:53:18] <Flurshy> >.>
[15:53:30] <RandomNinja> Gotta go fast!
[15:53:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> this is why these older macbook are pretty good. too bad apple wants things to be thin now
[15:53:44] <Trildar> Do you really use 7-zip that often?
[15:53:55] <RandomNinja> a few times a month
[15:54:11] <RandomNinja> there's no reason to not put in ot the SSD though, it's like a few MB
[15:54:33] <Trildar> Tell that to all the small programs I have. :P
[15:54:43] <Unixkitty> Now things like photoshop for example would benefit greately from being on an SSD for example.
[15:54:47] <RandomNinja> ^
[15:55:07] <RandomNinja> you definitely want photoshop on SSD
[15:55:09] <Unixkitty> And somehow I said for example twice

[16:07:00] <Unixkitty> Oh my.
[16:07:14] <Flurshy> I remember putting my RAM in
[16:07:19] <Flurshy> was afraid I was gunna break it
[16:07:19] <johnsey> also wtf is an apple user doing with ram chips, go to an apple store and pay $$ to get them installed like a good apple user
[16:07:26] <Flurshy> you really have to ram it in there
[16:07:54] <Unixkitty> If you want to break your chips, then yes.
[16:08:12] <Flurshy> just respect the pun >.<
[16:08:31] <Unixkitty> Oh. It was a pun even.
[16:08:40] * Unixkitty slaps Flurshy around a bit with a fluffy trout plushie
[16:08:46] <johnsey> i'm surprised apple doesn't use custom RAM that can be inserted both ways around, magnetically without any force at all, at 3 times the price
[16:08:47] <Flurshy> maybe I shoulda been more overt about it
[16:09:11] <Flurshy> why do that when they can just sell ordinary RAM for 3 times the price anyway?
[16:09:25] <johnsey> then again, I'm surprised they use RAM that's not soldered in anyway
[16:09:34] <Flurshy> I thought they did
[16:09:45] <johnsey> then what's Cloud_Zephyr doing?
[16:09:53] <Flurshy> accidentally windows
[16:10:03] <Cloud_Zephyr> :P
[16:10:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> apple has started using soldered ram
[16:10:52] <johnsey> impossible, he should know that there's a severe penalty on renouncing apple
[16:10:52] <Flurshy> I would imagine that's what they use in their super slim imac

[21:17:10] <Eywind> oh Cloud_Zephyr|Live
[21:17:17] <Eywind> I found the A&B acoustic album on youtube yesterday
[21:17:21] <Eywind> have you heard some of those? It's pretty awesome
[21:17:29] <Cloud_Zephyr|Live> yup its amazing
[21:17:50] <Inucroft[NLR]> tossing ewoks into lakes of liquid methane
[21:17:52] <Sunset_Shimmer> Trxie, Sunset, Twilight are my top ponies. Starlight Glimmer is trying to push her way in ;)
[21:17:56] <Inucroft[NLR]> best pass time
[21:18:18] <Eywind> Ew = pony
[21:18:34] <Eywind> I wish she wasn't just generically nefarious
[21:18:43] <Eywind> like if she actually had an = as her cutie mark and that was her talent or something
[21:18:47] <Eywind> or the staff gave her that as her 'talent'
[21:19:21] <Eywind> I mean you still wanted the marxist comparison and whatever but yeah
[21:19:24] <MikeM> Instead of having "Manipulation" (ponypulation?) as her talent?
[21:19:26] <Sunset_Shimmer> She does have her own CM. I just wish I knew the meaning
[21:19:31] <Eywind> Meh
[21:19:39] <Eywind> I liked the explanation that like
[21:20:02] <Eywind> Shimmer and Starlight are both AU representations of Twilight effectively
[21:20:37] <RandomNinja> evil twi and other evil twi?
[21:20:38] <Sunset_Shimmer> Pretty much. But she reminded me of Trixie
[21:20:45] <LinuxPenguin> one sparkles, one shimmers, and one glimmers
[21:20:47] <Eywind> Shimmer is an ambitious/entitled version of Twilight in the first movie, and Starlight is the Twilight that didn't have friendship but power
[21:20:52] <Unixkitty> Evil RandomNinja!

[21:22:27] <Hi-Tec_Rain|CZA> Do you know about Digital Distortion?

[21:23:34] <RandomNinja> hmm do I Pringles or store brand chips?
[21:23:36] <Eywind> just a different version
[21:23:40] <Mike_Coltfield> Ali: Tell them that Flash is a bloated piece of crap and to move the standards over to HTML5

[21:24:02] <RandomNinja> Pringles, not even once
[21:24:03] <Unixkitty> Depends on what "store brand chips" are really, RandomNinja 
[21:24:08] * Ali tells Mike_Coltfield she doesn't actually talk to these people.
