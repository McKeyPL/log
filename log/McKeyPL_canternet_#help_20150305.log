[09:13:43] <Boomer> How does one set someone to automatically become halfopped in a channel each time they join?
[09:14:48] <Colgate> /chanserv hop #channel add name
[09:17:32] <Boomer> Is that the one that locks it to automatically do it every time?
[09:17:42] <Colgate> yes
[09:20:08] <Boomer> I've tried it twice now and when the user logs out and back in, the badge does not return
[09:20:36] <Colgate> channel name?
[09:21:01] <Boomer> #EquestriaDailyOOC. I'm not the one trying to set it
[09:22:21] <Colgate> well uh, that's the command, not sure what to say
[09:22:46] <Colgate> do they ahve the right permissions to add hops?
[09:24:20] <Boomer> Hold one, we may have found the issue. Is there a difference between using [/cs hop #channel /nick] and  [/cs halfop #channel /nick]?
[09:24:40] <Colgate> yes, they are completely different
[09:25:10] <Colgate> "/cs halfop" is as if you just did a /mode #channel +h nick
[09:25:28] <Colgate> "/cs hop" adds them to the chanserv access list
[09:25:41] <Colgate> which means chanserv will automatically do it again later
[09:25:49] <Boomer> Very well
[09:31:09] <Boomer> Thank you for the assistance
