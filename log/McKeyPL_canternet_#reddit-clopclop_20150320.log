[00:09:13] <iamalion> and out of shock i looked up
[00:09:19] <iamalion> and made eye contact with their passenger

[02:56:12] <Vulpixbrew> open office?
[02:56:20] <RNGsus> i dunno man
[02:56:24] <RNGsus> i like using microsoft word
[02:56:56] <samonuh> Google Doc is like...legitimately very similar to Word
[02:57:01] <RNGsus> i see it right now
[02:57:39] <RNGsus> might use this instead, im not sure
[03:00:29] <OmarianVolcae> There's also Libre Office
[03:00:41] <OmarianVolcae> and LaTeX
[03:00:50] <RNGsus> im using google docs, its pretty good i admit
[03:01:09] <OmarianVolcae> Requires connectivity though.
[03:01:15] <OmarianVolcae> Remember that.
[03:01:19] <RNGsus> yeah
[03:01:25] <OmarianVolcae> I agree, though, it's a nice alternative.
[03:01:55] <OmarianVolcae> It also stores your stuff online, which calls security into question for the paranoid.
[03:04:07] <RNGsus> no spell check
[03:04:09] <RNGsus> seriously?
[03:05:19] <OmarianVolcae> In google?
[03:05:28] <RNGsus> yeah
[03:05:31] <RNGsus> there isnt a spell checker
[03:05:39] <OmarianVolcae> It's not a word processor, after all.
[03:06:15] <RNGsus> "Google Doc is like...legitimately very similar to Word" "alternative"
[03:06:28] <OmarianVolcae> I never said the first one
[03:06:35] <OmarianVolcae> It's still an alternative.
[03:06:58] <RNGsus> It isn't an alternative without spell check :/
[03:07:25] <Katiepony> Just spell stuff right :3
[03:07:31] <OmarianVolcae> Then try one of the other suggestions I gave you.
[03:07:45] <RNGsus> Katiepony lol
[03:07:50] <RNGsus> I probably will OmarianVolcae 
[03:08:05] <OmarianVolcae> If spelling is too hard for you, I would avoid LaTeX
[03:08:07] <Katiepony> Google says there's a spell check function, I dunno though.
[03:08:11] <OmarianVolcae> But Libre Open Office is nice.
[03:08:35] <RNGsus> torrent microsoft office it is
[03:09:59] * Vulpixbrew points to open office again mainly due to the fact it's the one he uses
[03:10:17] <Quinn> ms office > all
[03:10:26] <RNGsus> ^
[03:10:45] <OmarianVolcae> Pro tip: Access google docs' spellcheck function by following Tools > Spelling
[03:11:04] <RNGsus> Also unrelated, dont you hate it when you are trying to look for a problem and there a ton of results, but all of them are really long answers that dont actually answer the question?
[03:11:35] <OmarianVolcae> Feels like thinly veiled hostility.
[03:11:41] <RNGsus> OmarianVolcae all that does is say 'no suggestions' even though i have werk as the last word
[03:11:53] <RNGsus> towards the people on the forums yes OmarianVolcae 
[03:12:13] <RNGsus> come on even this chat has spell check, it baffles my mind that programs dont have it
[03:12:42] <Katiepony> You could probably get an extension/plugin 
[03:13:11] <RNGsus> 66% done on office ill see if i can get that working
[03:14:09] <OmarianVolcae> Idunno man. Google Docs definitely has spellcheck. For some reason werk is in your dictionary.
[03:14:22] <OmarianVolcae> I just typed werk into a new google docs document and it was highlighted in red.

[04:36:50] <Araiya> I'm not sure what was more disturbing: The fact that I knew it was a Winger pic, or the fact that I knew the original was posted in 1996.
[04:37:05] <samonuh> 1996?
[04:37:05] <thaostra> I've studied Spanish, Arabic, and Japanese in school
[04:37:15] <samonuh> That's like 30 years ago!

[04:37:34] <samonuh> I've studied French, Arabic, and a bit of Irish
[04:37:41] <Araiya> The picture is old enough to vote and buy tobacco in the US.
[04:37:48] <plushie_pegasus> i know a tiny bit of spanish, french and german, just a few phrases

[05:16:05] <thaostra> I don't develop Hexchat, but what I did was make a standalone version of Hexchat that was preconfigured to connect to this channel, so all one needed to do was extract the downloaded file and click on the executable
[05:16:17] <sleepyPone> oooo

[05:17:19] <sleepyPone> that would require that one used the FAQ ;)

[05:25:25] <thaostra> With JPEG you just need to run the file through jpegtran which takes no more than a second. PNG on the other hand requires a multi-stage process depending on how far you want to go. First you run it through a reducer to get the smallest possible IDAT stream that could represent the rendered pixels, then you run it through a compressor that'll try to shrink the Deflate stream as much as it can, and FINALLY you run it through a 
[05:25:25] <thaostra> stream compactor that'll do any dirty trick it can to pack those streams as tight as the format will allow. This whole process can easily take tens of minutes or hours depending on the size of the PNG

[05:27:13] <thaostra> On average I've gotten 10%-15% savings, with the more extreme cases getting 70% savings, so it can be worth the effort if you're paying for the bandwidth or just want the images to load faster

[05:30:26] <thaostra> I don't think many people notice, but nearly every image I've posted on Reddit is losslessly optimized beforehand, because I understand that bandwidth isn't always readily available and cheap so every byte counts

[05:43:56] <thaostra> I could probably make a guide about the different steps I take to make a post. I tend to put a lot of effort into each one, unlike a few people who'll just make waves of posts from e621 :P
[05:45:41] <RNGsus> I could make a guide on how to not make dupes in an album...
[05:45:54] <sleepyPone> step one: Look at them :P
[05:46:48] <RNGsus> with 2000 image albums its hard to remember every single picture and remember if image 24 is a dupe of 1978
[05:47:10] <RNGsus> with more than maybe 100 pictures theres no way to do it by hand
[05:48:41] <thaostra> A tactic I've seen is to sort them by width/height, which works fantastically if you just get the full images
[05:49:06] <RNGsus> Huh?
[05:50:06] <thaostra> Some image viewers let you sort by dimension, so duplicates will often appear next to each other
[05:50:07] <plushie_pegasus> [yiff]   http://www.join.toonfanclub.com/furry-yiff/furry-yiff-4.jpg
[05:50:32] <RNGsus> I just use a program that looks at images in a folder and notifies you of the dupes, auto selects based on which is better quality, size, ect, and deletes them
[05:50:48] <RNGsus> you can change the amount it looks for too if you have a lot of pictures that are close to each other
[05:52:39] <thaostra> I don't think I'll ever release a 2,000 image album in this day because Imgur's UI scales horribly for large collections. What they need is some sort of tagging system for finding a particular image in a collection
[05:53:02] <Squirrelly> I think they only let you upload like 500 images at a time

[05:58:36] <RNGsus> Oh yes
[05:58:43] <RNGsus> I wasnt talking about clop though :P
[05:59:04] <RNGsus> Set it so that the tag 'safe' is blocked on derpi, and you are set
[06:00:18] <thaostra> I don't use any filtering, instead I add "-safe" to the search

[09:34:00] <Katiepony> Went to our local cafÃ© to order breakfast for husband horse and I. The girl on staff seemed to be in her own little world.
[09:34:34] <Katiepony> I ordered a Full english breakfast, and a breakfast bun. She brings me a bun and a wrap. I tell her she's got it wrong, and I wanted a full english, not a wrap.
[09:35:04] <Katiepony> She apologies and brings me another bun. I explain to her it was supposed to be a full english. She apologises and brings me back and fucking wrap.
[09:35:12] <Katiepony> 30 mins standing in there.
[09:35:29] <Katniss> wtf
[09:35:31] <cloppyhooves> :(
[09:35:33] <Araiya> ... wow.
[09:35:34] <Katiepony> I gawk at her, telling her it's wrong again, she says 'Oh, I thought you said a wrap'
[09:35:47] <Katiepony> And then i said no, and she asks 'Well, is a wrap not good enough then?'
[09:35:48] <Araiya> It's now a refund. Gimme my cash.
[09:36:00] <Katiepony> So I just took the wrap because I was hungry.
[09:36:14] <Katiepony> Also, she got the breakfast items in both the bun and the wrap wrong.
[09:36:44] <Katiepony> I just don't understand how that can happen.

[10:20:53] <Katniss> What's the biggest thing you've put up your butt?
[10:22:18] <cloppyhooves> Medium chance
[10:22:23] <Katniss> :o
[10:22:23] <cloppyhooves> Got it about 2/3 inside me
[10:22:42] <Katniss> Could you not fit any more in?
[10:22:58] <cloppyhooves> It was getting difficult D:
[10:23:02] <cloppyhooves> Like it was compressing air inside
[10:23:07] <Katniss> :c
[10:23:08] <cloppyhooves> So it started to build pressure and hurt
[10:23:13] <cloppyhooves> Oh well :o
[10:23:40] <Katniss> I've pretty much got a whole medium Kelvin inside of me
[10:24:12] <Katniss> I kinda wish I would have started out with a Chance, because Kelvin is kinda weird to ride, especially without a suction cup

[10:31:16] <cloppyhooves> 69, 69, 6969, 6.9, 69/9/69, my eye color is 69
[10:31:36] <Katniss> And... That's funny, you have $69.69 in your bank account!
[10:31:41] <cloppyhooves> :D
[10:32:22] <Katniss> Also, did you grow up on 69 Sixty-Nine Street, Sixty-Nine, 69 69696?
[10:32:33] <cloppyhooves> How did you know? :o
