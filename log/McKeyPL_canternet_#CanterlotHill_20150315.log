[01:36:25] <RandomNinja> why?
[01:37:09] <Hamtramck> stuff i wanted from last year mostly.
[01:37:19] <RandomNinja> ya but why physical?
[01:38:21] <Hamtramck> I've purchased digital music before that I can't redownload, due to download links deactivating or the storefronts going out of business.
[01:38:25] <Hamtramck> Remember Lala?
[01:38:32] <RandomNinja> yeah true
[01:38:39] <RandomNinja> but...<.<
[01:38:40] <RandomNinja> yarr
[01:38:48] <Hamtramck> I mean I /doubt/ Amazon would go out of business any time soon, but still :P
[01:38:56] <Hamtramck> Also buying directly from the labels proved kind of weird.
[01:39:00] <wobniaR> I like bandcamp

[01:41:03] <Hamtramck> also amazon's mp3 quality seems weird to me
[01:41:12] <RandomNinja> is it not 320?
[01:41:29] <RandomNinja> also needs more non-mp3
[01:41:30] <Hamtramck> Not necessarily?
[01:41:36] <Hamtramck> I think they get whatever they get sent
[01:41:50] <MikeM> I think it's usually around 256
[01:41:53] * Cloud_Zephyr noms itunes
[01:41:54] <RandomNinja> boo
[01:42:06] <RandomNinja> needs OGG/ACC 320 at least :P
[01:42:06] <MikeM> Google Play is 320
[01:42:30] <Hamtramck> I don't know to what extent I can hear the difference between 256 and 320, but eh. I'd rather go with 320 because then I'd be certain.
[01:42:44] <Hamtramck> Other alternative is to keep flacs around but those are huge
[01:42:48] <RandomNinja> good headphones and good mastering, you will notice
[01:42:50] <wobniaR> Slight difference if you got the speakers/headphones to hear it

[01:44:29] <Seventh_Element> "Radio and TVs most hilarious boners!" - the cover
[01:44:38] <RandomNinja> it's got a tiny nick on the back side that causes it to skip and loop, which is a shame on an otherwise great quality vinyl
[01:45:03] <Hamtramck> I feel weird listening to music by dead people
[01:45:10] <RandomNinja> butt why?
[01:45:16] <Seventh_Element> I love classical music so it happens to me all the time haha
[01:45:30] * RandomNinja applies best opera to Seventh_Element 
[01:45:39] <Seventh_Element> I have an opera vinyl as well

[01:46:21] <Seventh_Element> Cloud_Zephyr, what's that?
[01:46:30] <Hamtramck> Wait is that that new album by the Aphex Twins?
[01:46:31] <RandomNinja> needs moar Ring Des Nibelungen :P
[01:46:37] <Cloud_Zephyr> whats wut? the amp? the record?
[01:46:41] <Seventh_Element> the record
[01:46:44] <Seventh_Element> what's the record
[01:47:00] <Cloud_Zephyr> Far From in Love by Above & Beyond
[01:47:06] <Seventh_Element> oh, trance stuff
[01:47:07] <Seventh_Element> I see
[01:47:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> Original Mix and some other mix
[01:47:13] <Cloud_Zephyr> :3
[01:47:17] <Seventh_Element> the most recent vinyl I got is Random Access Memories

[01:47:56] <Cloud_Zephyr> :3
[01:48:00] <Seventh_Element> Hamtramck, over ear or in ear?
[01:48:10] <RandomNinja> also budget
[01:48:17] <wobniaR> inb4 m50's
[01:48:20] <RandomNinja> pls
[01:48:23] <Hamtramck> Thinking in-ear, 70 dollarish range, prefer not needing an amp
[01:48:45] <Seventh_Element> I don't know many in ear ones that are any good :/ they are usually kind of uncomfortable for me
[01:49:02] <Hamtramck> I have a hard time with over-ear for comfort reasons :V
[01:49:11] <RandomNinja> madness
[01:49:12] <Seventh_Element> I use Sennheiser HD280 pro's because they fit my fat head well
[01:49:14] <Hamtramck> I have a pair of Sennheiser 419?s that I can hardly wear
[01:49:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> m50 $100ish master race
[01:49:19] <RandomNinja> good over-ear are the comfiest
[01:49:28] <RandomNinja> they shouldn't touch your ears at all
[01:49:50] <Hamtramck> also i think the 419s sound pretty bad anyway. I guess they need an amp.
[01:50:03] <wobniaR> It takes a while before I feel discomfort from wearing headphones, and by then I need a break anyway
[01:50:06] <Seventh_Element> I've never heard of those ones :x
[01:50:09] <RandomNinja> 500-series is supposed to be way better
[01:50:22] <RandomNinja> HD518 is the real entry level model
[01:50:35] <Seventh_Element> really, the way to go is to not spend less than $100 on your headphones haha
[01:50:39] <Seventh_Element> general rule of thumb
[01:50:40] <RandomNinja> ^
[01:50:55] <Cloud_Zephyr> this record player is a bit rubbishy. but the other one is too big and slightly too slow
[01:50:59] <RandomNinja> if you can grab M50 on a sale it's worth it, because they go on sick sales a lot
[01:51:02] <RandomNinja> like $50
[01:51:09] <Seventh_Element> I produce with these 280 pros because they have a decently flat freq response
[01:51:11] <wobniaR> $50 for m50's? Where
[01:51:18] <Hamtramck> I broke the plug on the 419s after about three months so uh
[01:51:25] <Seventh_Element> yikes
[01:51:26] <wobniaR> I'll buy a 2nd pair for $50
[01:51:45] *** Joins: thereallynewmop12100_ (Mibbit@Pony-sum0i9.acanac.net)
[01:51:52] <RandomNinja> regular m50, not m50x
[01:51:54] <wobniaR> For headphone emergencies
[01:52:02] <RandomNinja> wobniaR do you use Massdrop?
[01:52:07] <wobniaR> Regular m50 still good
[01:52:13] <wobniaR> I have those not the 50x
[01:52:23] <RandomNinja> yeah they're the same minus detachable cable
[01:52:38] <wobniaR> They charge like $40 for extra cables anyway
[01:52:44] <wobniaR> It's crazy
[01:53:07] <Hamtramck> Also be nice if there were any places around here that let you try headphones before buying them
[01:53:22] <RandomNinja> I've heard good things about the Soundmagic E10 for cheapish in-ear
[01:54:01] <MikeM> I have a set of Etymotics that are very comfortable. 
[01:54:21] <RandomNinja> oh also if you like on-ear headphones, Grado is supposedly amazing
[01:54:28] <wobniaR> Ah so massdrop is basically selling off stuff in bulk with a semi-guarantee that a set number of people will buy it
[01:54:36] <RandomNinja> yeah something like that
[01:54:53] <RandomNinja> it's useless for non americans so I haven't looked into it though
[01:55:22] <wobniaR> Murica, land of the free and good deals
[01:55:24] <RandomNinja> also http://www.amazon.com/AKG-240-Semi-Open-Studio-Headphones/dp/B0001ARCFA/ref=sr_1_16?s=aht&ie=UTF8&qid=1426380843&sr=1-16&keywords=grado
[01:55:28] <RandomNinja> yeah kinda 
[01:55:44] <MikeM> RandomNinja, I also have those headphones.
[01:56:04] <RandomNinja> how worth it that price?
[01:56:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> murica, land of teh butts
[01:56:33] <Hamtramck> are there any stores that sell headphones
[01:56:37] <Hamtramck> like physical stores
[01:56:41] <RandomNinja> yeah plently
[01:56:44] <MikeM> Very comfortable, and they're my first open/semi open style. Flat response, but might benefit from an amp.
[01:56:47] <RandomNinja> the best ones are usually local ones though
[01:56:54] <Hamtramck> We don't have any of those around here.
[01:56:54] <RandomNinja> not chain stores
[01:57:15] <Hamtramck> Like FYE's the only store in C-bus that has some sort of selection
[01:57:21] <RandomNinja> so you'll have to look for audio/music stores on google locally
[01:57:22] <Cloud_Zephyr> chain stores like their beats
[01:57:23] <Hamtramck> Maybe Guitar Gallery would have stuff idk
[01:57:57] <RandomNinja> drop by any store you'd imagine sells headphones and ask if they let you try it
[01:58:31] <wobniaR> AKG's look pretty good
[01:58:51] <RandomNinja> yeah
[01:58:55] <FN> Whaat? Here you can ask to test headphones in any shop
[01:59:02] <RandomNinja> also look pretty professional :P
[01:59:13] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup this record player is nooby. i can hear the motor move
[01:59:14] <wobniaR> Not as professional looking as beats
[01:59:22] <FN> Like how the hell you'd know if you like them or not if you buy them blind... or rather deaf in this case?
[01:59:28] <RandomNinja> FN yeah but we live in europe where people aren't trying to rip each other off all the time :P
[02:00:04] <FN> BOSe even has a couch to relax on in their store while you listen to their headphone quality

[02:00:43] <Hamtramck> Yeah there are no locally owned audio stores here.
[02:01:09] <RandomNinja> Marques Brownlee is good
[02:01:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[02:01:23] <RandomNinja> a bit over Hamtramck's budget though
[02:01:25] <Cloud_Zephyr> he played with drones at deadmau's house
[02:01:35] <Hamtramck> Okay I said I'd be interested in speding 70.
[02:01:38] <RandomNinja> except the Grado ones :P
[02:01:40] <Hamtramck> My theoretical max budget here is like 10 grand.
[02:01:47] <Hamtramck> I don't want to go that high :P
[02:01:52] <FN> It is not about owning, it is about allowing a client to have a test run of the product before purchase
[02:02:04] <wobniaR> 10k on headphones? Better be gold plated
[02:02:13] <RandomNinja> is 12K too much= http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Sennheiser-HEV90-Orpheus-the-amplifier-for-HE90-and-all-STAX-pro-/301531587827?pt=UK_MP3_Player_Accessories_Headphones_Earphones&hash=item4634aee4f3
[02:02:40] <wobniaR> 350 pounds in postage fees lol
[02:02:45] <RandomNinja> wait no never mind that was just the amp  :P
[02:02:54] <wobniaR> And it's used
[02:03:15] <FN> Fancy amp
[02:03:18] <Cloud_Zephyr> RandomNinja wait so i've been living a lie my entire life? all music is rubbish without that amp? :P
[02:03:32] <RandomNinja> here's the reasonable endgame http://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-2-planar-magnetic-headphone/dp/B00B3TEZ30/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1426381378&sr=8-2&keywords=audeze+lcd-3
[02:03:32] <MikeM> That's like paying $500 for a steak. How many people can actually appreciate it?
[02:03:59] <FN> I want a headphone amp on 9v battery with a slider equaliser on it
[02:04:30] <RandomNinja> this is what I'm considering down the line http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-650-Headphones/dp/B00018MSNI/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_10?ie=UTF8&refRID=1PEKAE9XQ2YQRM2TQCF9
[02:05:19] * wobniaR steals RandomNinja's dream headphones
[02:05:26] <RandomNinja> from amazon?
[02:05:29] <wobniaR> Yes
[02:05:39] <RandomNinja> go ahead, I'm not losing anything
[02:05:57] <Cloud_Zephyr> i just want accurate frequency response :P
[02:06:21] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr apply http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-W5000-Audiophile-Closed-Headphones/dp/B000PGAPR2/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1426381562&sr=1-4&keywords=denon+d7000
[02:06:36] <Cloud_Zephyr> so whats the difference between audiophile headphones and accurate headphones?
[02:06:48] <wobniaR> One is more expensive than the other
[02:06:53] <RandomNinja> audiophile headphones just have to sound great
[02:07:00] <RandomNinja> also what wobniaR said
[02:07:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> lel
[02:07:15] <RandomNinja> but they can be less accurate but more detailed and stuff
[02:07:32] <RandomNinja> and by accuracy I mean frequecy response curve
[02:07:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> hmm my headphones are too mainstream :P
[02:07:43] <MikeM> Audiophile stuff is a whole system
[02:07:48] <RandomNinja> nerd
[02:07:58] <MikeM> You can't just buy great headphones and be done.
[02:08:35] <Cloud_Zephyr> hmm i could have brought these and looked cool. but i'd rather look  pro http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50xWH-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLURL8/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1426381643&sr=1-3&keywords=ath-m50x
[02:08:44] <RandomNinja> you start by trying headphones in the 150-200 range and get blown away by how much better they are than your current ones
[02:09:19] <RandomNinja> then you start looking at sound curves and stuff, and eventually upgrades to something better (K701, HD650 range maybe)
[02:09:49] <RandomNinja> then you try on the flagship models on an ideal system, and realize that you one day must have this
[02:09:51] <Trildar> wut is all this nerd talk
[02:09:55] <RandomNinja> nerdery
[02:10:17] <RandomNinja> and then you sink $2k into a single setup
[02:11:17] <Cloud_Zephyr> lelnerds just get some beats :P
[02:11:24] <RandomNinja> pls you know better now
[02:11:33] <Cloud_Zephyr> indeed

[02:14:56] <Cloud_Zephyr> these are some mid tier headphones!
[02:15:09] <Mike_Coltfield> What are? The Sennheiser HD 518?
[02:15:35] <Cloud_Zephyr> the ath-m50x's
[02:15:54] <Mike_Coltfield> The M50X's are good headphones.
[02:16:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[02:16:43] <RandomNinja> sure
[02:16:50] <RandomNinja> but there are other options as well
[02:16:56] <Mike_Coltfield> In the same class range are the Sony MDR-7510
[02:17:05] <RandomNinja> also Grado's entry level ones
[02:17:18] <Mike_Coltfield> Ah, now that depends on the use
[02:17:22] <RandomNinja> of course
[02:17:35] <RandomNinja> but for home use
[02:17:41] <Mike_Coltfield> Grado garners a lot of respect from me, especially for their new e line
[02:17:56] <RandomNinja> I want grado, but I hate on-ear :/
[02:18:19] <Mike_Coltfield> For home use, in a quiet room, the Grado SR80e and Sennheiser HD 558 (or 518 if you want to save $20, they use the same drivers) are good choices
[02:18:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> ah i finally found those headphones i see a lot of djs using
[02:18:36] <RandomNinja> also ATH-AD500x
[02:19:27] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr you should get BeyerDynamics T1
[02:19:55] <Cloud_Zephyr> £500! nu
[02:20:17] <Mike_Coltfield> Ah, the Beyerdynamic Tesla T1. The problem is that they're not significantly better than the Sennheiser HD 650, and they are noticeably more expensive
[02:20:35] <RandomNinja> oh really
[02:20:54] <RandomNinja> I'm considering the HD650 actually, down the line
[02:21:43] <Mike_Coltfield> In fact, the Sennheiser HD 700, which are better than the 650 and around the same price as the T1, are better than the T1
[02:21:54] <RandomNinja> because what I understand they are the biggest bang for the buck in the high-end
[02:22:30] <RandomNinja> by a significant amount
[02:22:42] <Mike_Coltfield> Biggest bang for the buck in the high end? Look at AKG.
[02:23:04] <RandomNinja> K712?
[02:23:30] <Mike_Coltfield> And the problem with the T1s is that they're $1200. That's Audeze LCD-2 money, and both are going to require around the same class of amplifier to really play well.
[02:24:03] <RandomNinja> well yeah, but you should know that in that price range :P

[02:25:13] <Mike_Coltfield> Now the K712's biggest competition are the K701s (which are clearer) and the Sennheiser HD 600 (which are some of the most balanced things in any price range)
[02:25:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> lel
[02:25:38] <RandomNinja> well K701 is like 60% of the K712 here
[02:25:44] <RandomNinja> so that's a bit of a no-brainer then
[02:26:26] <Mike_Coltfield> Actually, the K712 have an MSRP of $700... That's $50 off from the Sennheiser HD 700.
[02:27:29] <RandomNinja> K701-1800, HD600-2800, K712-3300, HD650-3100, HD700-500 here
[02:27:39] <RandomNinja> HD700-5500*
[02:28:10] <Mike_Coltfield> From that list, I'd pick the K701
[02:28:26] <Mike_Coltfield> Actually... How much are the Grado RS2e?
[02:28:35] <RandomNinja> yeah me too after pricechecking
[02:28:55] <Mike_Coltfield> Oh, and the AKG K550 for a sealed headphone option
[02:29:14] <Eywind> god such a nerd.  j/k :P
[02:29:27] <RandomNinja> 5600, but sold out. RS2 is about the same, if those are similar
[02:29:34] <RandomNinja> K550 is 1600
[02:29:48] <Mike_Coltfield> Go for the RS2e
[02:30:05] <Mike_Coltfield> They'll absolutely cream the K701 and the K550.
[02:30:08] <RandomNinja> but those are all sold out
[02:30:17] <RandomNinja> also aren't they on-ear?
[02:30:27] <Mike_Coltfield> Right, you want around-ear
[02:30:52] <Mike_Coltfield> Yeah, stick with the K701 or K550. The K550 are what I end up defaulting to in my house.
[02:30:55] <Hamtramck> http://www.amazon.com/HiFiMAn-Electronics-RE-400-HiFiMan-Headphones/dp/B00AWLEAH6 these sound promising and they're on sale but people are saying they break, hrm
[02:30:56] <RandomNinja> they do cost about 3 times as much as K701 though and I'm poor :P
[02:31:30] <RandomNinja> I've heard good about the HiFiman over-ear headphones, no idea about earbuds though
[02:33:28] <RandomNinja> also, why are Beyerdynamics so expensive in the US?

[02:46:06] <RandomNinja> there's lots of numerical solutions via computer simulation in physics, so I guess that's why we learn it
[02:46:09] <wobniaR> Computer science: Mostly math and stuff
[02:46:15] <One-Trick> im taking physics next semester and theres no requirement for cs, just college algebra and a 3-credit science class with a lab

[02:47:59] <One-Trick> my bachelors conists of more math than a major in microbiology, which i am doing as a job
[02:48:19] <RandomNinja> what kind of math though?
[02:48:37] <Hamtramck> by the way, do the mh50 whatvers need a separate amp
[02:48:42] <wobniaR> Triangles and stuff
[02:48:46] <One-Trick> calc 1, 2. combinaltorics, statistics, and linear
[02:49:17] <wobniaR> I don't use an amp with my m50's Hamtramck
[02:49:35] <RandomNinja> linear algebra, the course that's the worst to learn but ridiculously useful
[02:49:43] <RandomNinja> m50 are easy to drive, they don't need an amp
[02:50:00] <RandomNinja> you might benefit from a better DAC though, but that's about it
[02:50:15] <RandomNinja> they're still going to sound great from your cellphone
[02:50:23] <wobniaR> pls
[02:50:25] <One-Trick> most of the time i just know theres a formula to accomplish what i want, then i look up how its used, then let the computer figure out the details
[02:50:42] <Eywind> My friend got one of the free fiio ones with his and said it was dramatically different
[02:50:44] <RandomNinja> assuming it's not garbage and stuff and you don't use 96 kbps mp3
[02:50:49] <wobniaR> I google stuff
[02:50:53] <RandomNinja> I'm sure it is
[02:51:24] <RandomNinja> I need to get around to learning laplace transforms and better linear algebra, so I can dominate all the maths
[02:51:25] <wobniaR> The fiio portable amps are good if you're listening to music on your phone
[02:51:29] <Hamtramck> I probably want a better dac at some point athough I think there's something weird going on in my laptop on a software level cause like
[02:51:39] <RandomNinja> but who carries around an amp in their pocket
[02:51:45] <Eywind> urmum
[02:51:47] <wobniaR> ^
[02:51:52] <RandomNinja> nerd
[02:52:00] <One-Trick> depends on the output of the amp
[02:52:00] <Hamtramck> For some reason stuff sounds better in exclusive mode. That shouldn't matter, so I'm thinking some of the bundled software on the laptop was doing something goofy
[02:52:04] <One-Trick> but quite often, we all do
[02:52:07] <RandomNinja> M50 in this case One-Trick 
[02:52:10] <RandomNinja> no need
[02:52:43] <RandomNinja> but honestly when you're on the go, maximizing sound quality probably isn't your top concern
[02:53:05] <Hamtramck> btw i hate other people so if I drill holes in te back of the phoneswill they start pumping sound outwards??????
[02:53:13] <wobniaR> Yes
[02:53:13] <Eywind> lolol
[02:53:21] <Eywind> no you have to drill through the phone
[02:53:25] <Eywind> so it'll output on both sides
[02:53:30] <RandomNinja> just get open back headphones and sit down on the bus
[02:53:31] <Hamtramck> also i was planning on only playing drill and bass with these
[02:53:49] <One-Trick> my ipad does a fantastic job at mobile production. i wouldnt release a song that i made solely on it, though.
[02:53:50] <Hamtramck> compressed at like 96 kbps

[06:20:38] <Faith> I like to seperate them as Football and Futbol.
[06:20:38] <FN> And F1 = international rally
[06:20:54] <Eywind> You're not making an equivalent argument
[06:21:02] <Faith> F1 = Jolly good zoom zoom rock around the clock
[06:21:09] <FN> Why do you like on insisting to use a confusing terms?
[06:21:33] <FN> Is it hard to call it american football?

[06:22:11] <Eywind> because you don't care about what other people say lol
[06:22:23] <Eywind> and whatever you say about soccer won't make me think it's any less of a horrible sport
[06:22:38] <FN> Yep you don't care
[06:22:39] <Hamtramck> wait are you talking american soccer or european soccer?
[06:23:00] <Faith> Soccer has some pretty sweet riots
[06:23:15] <Hamtramck> man i'm tired
[06:23:19] <FN> Oh pls, dumb fans 
[06:23:21] <MikeM> Wow. This sure is a spirited sportsball conversation.
[06:23:24] <Eywind> There's been like what, 2-3 fan killings in the US?
[06:23:24] <Hamtramck> maybe i should've spent less time getting exercise and more time playing videogames
[06:23:37] <Hamtramck> eywind that's nothing comapred to euroep
[06:23:38] <Eywind> compared to how many people getting killed in the last year internationally? lol
[06:23:54] <FN> Uhm america has no riots?
[06:24:02] <Faith> St. Louis pls
[06:24:03] <Eywind> They don't KILL PEOPLE
[06:24:08] <Eywind> about sports games
[06:24:17] <Eywind> except the occasionally bad seed that would probably kill someone anyone
[06:24:19] <Eywind> anyway*
[06:24:21] <Faith> we just burn jerseys when people get traded
[06:24:24] <Eywind> ^
[06:24:25] <FN> They kill for different silly things, so what's the point?
[06:24:28] <Eywind> and then rejoice them returning
[06:24:35] <Faith> Thanks, leBron

[17:14:57] <Snapai> I keep trying it in different combinations, but it always tastes awful :(
[17:15:55] <Snapai> I think it's some genetic-determined thingie, like cruciferous veggies are.
[17:16:30] <Hamtramck> MAybe you've only had bad coffee
[17:16:36] <Hamtramck> the flavor of coffee can vary a LOT
[17:16:43] <Hamtramck> depending on where it's grown, how it's roasted, etc.
[17:17:51] <RandomNinja> also most non-homebrewed is bad
[17:17:55] <RandomNinja> I don't know why
[17:18:24] <Trildar> Blame Starbucks. Or something.
[17:18:47] <Snapai> I've had cheap coffee, wholefoods coffee, coffee icecream, tiramisu, etc...
[17:18:54] <Snapai> It's always bad.
[17:19:10] <RandomNinja> never actually been to starbucks, but other cafes and stuff
[17:19:13] <Snapai> And that's not normally the case with foods for me.
[17:19:30] <Snapai> So I suspect it's setting off a taste receptor for me that it doesn't for others.
[17:19:48] <Snapai> On the other hand, I love all the brassica veggies.
[17:19:49] <RandomNinja> or you haven't built up enough caffeine addiction yet :P
[17:20:15] <Snapai> Sure I have, that's what the tea is for.
[17:20:34] <Snapai> cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, brussel sprouts, etc - they all taste good to me. I don't have the trait that makes them taste bitter to me.

[18:43:32] <Trildar> I can too, but I think µ is the only one I can do without having to remember unicode values.
[18:44:09] <RandomNinja> I just added greek keyboard layout to windows and switch between them as needed
[18:44:32] <Trildar> That would work as well. :P

[18:53:46] <RandomNinja> φ and θ are used for angles, ω is for angular velocity, α is angular acceleration, ρ is used for radius. also π
[18:53:52] <RandomNinja> those are probably the most common ones
[18:54:32] <Trildar|Bread> Ah yes, theta. Not sure if I did angular acceleration.
[18:55:17] <RandomNinja> I don't think I encountered it before college basic mechanics
[18:55:27] <Trildar|Bread> I've not used rho for radius.
[18:55:41] <RandomNinja> concept is pretty obvious though
[18:56:36] <Trildar|Bread> Well, I did angular velocity. Not angular acceleration specifically I think. Maybe that was there and I don't remember it cause it's just acceleration with angles.
[18:56:57] <RandomNinja> I've used both r and ρ, ρ is useful for when generalizing integrals using r as the limit
[18:57:42] <RandomNinja> yeah it's pretty basic

[22:47:21] <Unikitty> Tunnel Snakes rule?
[22:47:22] <RandomNinja> various metallic oscillations in the local air?
[22:47:28] <wobniaR> Another hour of the day wasted?
[22:47:29] *** Quits: Angel_Bunny (Eywind@drifting.aimlessly) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[22:47:44] <RandomNinja> that's all the time Unikitty 
[22:47:49] <Unikitty> Clearly.
[22:48:37] <wobniaR> There should be a mod that makes tunnel snakes outfit +75 dt, +10 all stats
[22:50:03] <Unikitty> Is there a mod that makes them rule? Or wait what in the world am I asking.
[22:50:14] <RandomNinja> Tunnel Snakes don't need those stat boosts, they're already at 10 for everything because they RULE
[22:50:38] <Unikitty> :P
[22:50:52] <RandomNinja> when  in doubt, refer to this stat build http://www.reddit.com/r/tunnelsnakes/comments/2jgff6/tunnel_snakes_build/clbpsol
[22:51:24] <wobniaR> Also super mutants are much tougher in a tale of two wastelands
[22:51:40] <wobniaR> It doesn't help that I have really limited ammo and weapons right now
[22:51:45] <thereallynewmop12100_> The_Iron_Pony[RzR]:  CNN Philippines starts their first broadcast at 6pm EST/6am PH. same time as Razor Radio
[22:51:46] <RandomNinja> yeah because muties in NV are mid-end game enemies
[22:52:05] * Unikitty has still never played any fallout.
[22:52:22] <RandomNinja> there's an optional mod that changes super mutants back to Fo3 levels somewhere on the website, I think
[22:52:24] <wobniaR> You must!
[22:52:34] <RandomNinja> how else will you rule?
[22:52:51] <LocDogX86X> Cazadors are the worst
[22:53:13] <wobniaR> Ultimate edition of new vegas is $20 in the steam store right now
[22:53:18] <wobniaR> On sale it drops <$10

[22:55:15] <RandomNinja> also I disagree kind of
[22:55:18] <RandomNinja> Nightstalkers
[22:55:19] <LocDogX86X> Noooooooo
[22:55:24] <wobniaR> Also I had to hit the behemoth at Galaxy news radio with 6 mini-nukes to kill it with a fully repaired fat man
[22:55:38] <RandomNinja> lel
[22:55:43] <RandomNinja> at least you rekt him
[22:55:58] <wobniaR> The nukes kept him knocked down permanently
[22:56:11] <thereallynewmop12100_> The_Iron_Pony[RzR]: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Philippines 
[22:56:38] <RandomNinja> why not just nuke him once, then apply more expendable/free damage?
[22:56:43] <RandomNinja> and nuke as needed
[22:56:55] <RandomNinja> basically hunting rifle spam
[22:56:58] <wobniaR> My only other weapon with ammo was a 44 magnum with 6 shots
[22:57:09] <wobniaR> And that wouldn't even tickle him
[22:57:38] <RandomNinja> lel
[22:57:41] <wobniaR> Also .308 ammo is very scare at level 4
[22:57:45] <wobniaR> scarce*
[22:58:01] <wobniaR> Otherwise I'd hunting rifle everything
[22:58:16] <RandomNinja> yeah because that gun is really good in new vegas
[22:58:23] <wobniaR> Especially with project nevada
