[04:20:48] <Quinn> that's not really editing, that's just a part of writing

[04:35:14] <samonuh> Hello!
[04:35:42] <samonuh> All of you were right when you convinced me to not clop last night
[04:37:11] <plushie_pegasus> I was trying to get you to clop then think about pony porn when yiffing the GF
[04:37:21] <samonuh> Hahaha
[04:37:38] <samonuh> I did think about ponies momentarily
[04:37:45] <plushie_pegasus> :)

[04:38:33] <iamalion> I had that problem
[04:38:43] <samonuh> How'd you fix it?
[04:38:48] <iamalion> The second time I almost oculdnt cum
[04:39:22] <plushie_pegasus> The meds I take make it hard for me to cum
[04:39:24] <iamalion> basically just stood back and thought "you are in the girl of your dreams, isnt taht awesome"

[04:41:28] <weisey> The ones that don't require balance of some kind
[04:41:31] <Quinn> which kinda turned me off
[04:41:37] <samonuh> I'm usually better at getting into it when I'm facing my girlfriend. 
[04:41:40] <weisey> I end up thinking about CSGO xD
[04:41:41] <iamalion> my problem was that it was my second orgasm so I wasnt like super on edge to get off 
[04:41:48] <samonuh> But when's she's facing away like doggy style it's harder

[04:43:02] <iamalion> I want to play but im on mumble 
[04:43:05] <RNGsus> Holy shit weisey really?
[04:43:06] <iamalion> HAHA weisey IM HIGHER RANKED
[04:43:10] <iamalion> :
[04:43:10] <samonuh> I'm debating to get it
[04:43:11] <plushie_pegasus> I get right on the edge and can't cum right away
[04:43:12] <iamalion> :)
[04:43:13] <RNGsus> Also yes samonuh i have a 60k pop city
[04:43:19] <weisey> I wish you could reset ranl
[04:43:19] <samonuh> Is it good?
[04:43:23] <RNGsus> Its amazing
[04:43:27] <y007ghg7> RNGsus, I have also gotten ace as a silver 1 :P
[04:43:30] <y007ghg7> with my mag-7
[04:43:30] <RNGsus> i can stream if you want to see it and specifics
[04:43:33] <samonuh> And can it run well on a semi-decent laptop?
[04:43:39] <RNGsus> Uhhh
[04:43:46] <RNGsus> Does it have a good graphics card?
[04:43:52] <RNGsus> Also how much do you value FPS
[04:43:59] <weisey> iamalion: its because my kfactor got fucked early
[04:44:03] * Futashy has no idea what she missed
[04:44:09] <samonuh> I checked on a website. I satisfy the minimum requirements, but not the prefered ones
[04:44:19] <RNGsus> Ehhhh
[04:44:23] <weisey> So now its certain I'm a silver 2, even when I top frag, and thus gives me less elopoints
[04:44:24] <RNGsus> It will run but not well?
[04:44:41] <samonuh> I fucking hate how my computers can never run games well
[04:44:50] <Quinn> weisey as far as anyone knows your personal performance doesn't effect your elo
[04:44:53] <Quinn> just win/loss
[04:44:53] <samonuh> The poor life
[04:45:01] <y007ghg7> I bought a prebuilt that could run the games I played at the time
[04:45:05] <weisey> Quin, actually it does in GO
[04:45:09] <y007ghg7> slowly been upgrading it since then
[04:45:15] <Quinn> proof? I've read time and time over that it doesn't
[04:45:16] <y007ghg7> still need a new mobo/CPU
[04:45:21] <samonuh> I can run Skyrim on high, though. Does that mean much?
[04:45:22] <weisey> Getting MVPs GREATLY affects your elo
[04:45:26] <RNGsus> Yes
[04:45:30] <RNGsus> You can run it most likely
[04:45:40] <RNGsus> its not the cpu or ram that matters much its the graphics card
[04:45:49] <RNGsus> 6b of ram should be enough 8 is preferred
[04:45:53] <samonuh> I just don't want to buy it and be stuck with not being able to play well

[04:45:56] <Quinn> need some proof. I've played a bazillion matches and I've noted that mvp doesnt effect my rank up, and I've also read that quite frequently on reddit weisey 
[04:46:13] <RNGsus> samonuh pirate it first
[04:46:58] <samonuh> My video card is AMD Radeon HD 8650G + 8600/8700M Dual Graphics

[04:50:19] <iamalion> fffff
[04:50:22] <weisey> Quinn, that guide has so much research behind it
[04:50:22] <iamalion> WHY EVERYONE GOT SCHOOL WORK
[04:50:23] <iamalion> ITS FRIDAY
[04:50:26] <samonuh> I've already used that site
[04:50:29] <y007ghg7> the best part about a friend who works at a computer shop is the free old hardware he gets
[04:50:31] <y007ghg7> heh
[04:50:34] <weisey> Plus some valve confirms/denys
[04:50:38] <princesssluttershy> iamalion, because this project was due a month ago
[04:50:39] <y007ghg7> he sent me his old ram for my desktop
[04:50:48] <samonuh> It says I satisfy minimum, but not preferred
[04:51:11] <Quinn> weisey: I can't find it on the page, where is it? D:
[04:51:13] <iamalion> well imma play deathmatch or whatevers then
[04:52:09] <weisey> Quinn: Section titled "Factors Affecting Elo Points"
[04:53:29] <weisey> The topfragger getting MVPs will get a smaller MVP reward than a non topfragger getting the MVP
[04:54:04] <weisey> BUT, they will still get more points than any other player on the team
[04:57:13] <weisey> So really topfragging is not the best place to get mvps
[04:57:32] <weisey> And 2nd fragging and getting a shit load of MVPs is better
[04:57:34] <Quinn> well, iunno where he's getting that info though, and it's the only place I've read it. Even just googling for it only returns that one post
[04:57:34] <weisey> But
[04:58:58] <y007ghg7> I normally 2nd frag and get MVP
[04:59:36] <y007ghg7> or also get top frag and 8+ MVP

[05:06:21] <princesssluttershy> When they cuddle colts release a substance that impregnates mares
[05:06:24] <cloppyhooves> They touched cutie marks
[05:06:39] <iamalion> psh
[05:06:43] <iamalion> he totally plowed her like a field
[05:07:09] <Quinn> they made contact involving penetration, especially the insertion of a male's erect penis into a female's vagina, typically culminating in orgasm and the ejaculation of semen.

[10:07:19] <cloppyhooves> The probability that you'd get that time exactly is 0
[10:07:23] <Nikashi> yes

[10:07:33] <Nikashi> if you watched it the entire time
[10:07:39] <Nikashi> the probability if you seeing it

[10:31:10] <Vulpixbrew> Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some have chosen to see it as the final proof of the NON-existence of God. The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing." But," says Man, "the Babel fish is a 
[10:31:10] <Vulpixbrew> dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves that You exist, and so therefore, by Your own arguments, You don't. QED" "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.  "Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.
