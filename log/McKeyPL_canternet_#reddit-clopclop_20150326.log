[04:06:10] <samonuh> Thin Mints have the carbs
[04:06:17] <Vulpixbrew> THEY USED TO BE ANIMAL SHAPES BUT NOOOO
[04:06:23] <Squirrelly> They're good, Vulpixbrew, but they're not as good as Tagalongs
[04:06:26] <samonuh> I dislike candy by itself. I prefer cookie with it

[17:47:35] <Katiepony> In all seriousness, that does sound like it would be a good idea.
[17:48:08] <weisey> RubyPinch, why not make it $X.>50 to $X+1.00

[18:30:26] <RubyPinch> welp, lets see how hard javascript is
[18:30:58] <Puddles> Oof, have fun with that.
[18:31:18] <RubyPinch> atleast JS culture has chaining
[18:32:25] <Puddles> True.
[18:33:24] <Puddles> What little Java I've dabbled in, it's frustrating but rewarding, I guess.
[18:33:45] <Puddles> It's like.. yay this works and does exactly what I want it to do... it only took me five fucking hours to get it to work but hey
[18:33:52] <RubyPinch> Java != JavaScript AAAA
[18:34:03] <Puddles> I'm aware, I've worked with both
[18:34:16] <Puddles> Frustration level is abouts the same
[18:34:18] <Puddles> or has been for me.
[18:34:34] <RubyPinch> at least strongly typed for J
[18:34:50] <RubyPinch> maybe I should write in ASM, hmm
[18:45:32] <cloppyhooves> What does strongly typed mean? :o
[18:46:54] <RubyPinch> if I want to be crucified, it means that types are important, 1.00 == "1.00" would be false if something is strongly typed, true sometimes if something is weakly typed
[18:47:17] <RubyPinch> since its a number type, and a string type, that are being compared
[18:47:40] <cloppyhooves> Oh, okay c:
[18:47:49] <cloppyhooves> It does'nt mean you have to hit the keyboard really hard? :3

[19:57:54] <RNGsus> College?
[19:59:18] <Puddles> Elementary.
[19:59:27] <Puddles> Custody issue, I need an up to date address for him to serve him.
[19:59:33] <RNGsus> Ah
[19:59:54] <Puddles> I've no intention of seeking child support, I just want sole custody, 'cause he's not in the picture anyway.
[20:00:18] <Puddles> I'm just not interested in paying over $500 to "serve" him via newspaper.
[20:00:25] <Puddles> Nor can I afford it
[20:00:34] <Puddles> and the longer it doesn't get done, the longer my son is not in school.
[20:00:56] <Puddles> So its like, hey let me mail you something you can just throw away because I legally have to
[20:00:59] <Puddles> because why the fuck not
[20:01:00] <RNGsus> Man it sucks that that has to happen and he isnt getting the education he needs
[20:01:43] <Puddles> He's an IEP student that before this crap was in a specialised behavioral program in a class with less than ten kids...
[20:01:49] <Puddles> and he's been home for a month for this shit.
[20:01:53] <Puddles> I'm pissed.
[20:02:13] <Puddles> And all I need is a fucking address?
[20:02:15] <Puddles> :l
[20:02:16] <Puddles> blah
[20:02:28] <Puddles> beaurocracy, folks, itsdabest
[20:03:00] <Puddles> Also the fact that I can be incarcerated for him not going to school over ten days when I can't enroll him.

[20:38:35] <thaostra> https://www.reddit.com/r/ClopClop/comments/30enwd/e621_posts_room_for_improvement/ "I love the new influx of posting links to the e621 images" <- New influx? HCB has been posting e621 links since the beginning
[20:39:02] <thaostra> I don't think the RES devs are going to be thrilled about supporting a furry imageboard, so the easier solution is to have the one poster using e621 to stop posting links from there.. but that'll never happen
[20:43:50] <RubyPinch> RES needs competition x-x
[20:45:03] <thaostra> RES shouldn't even be necessary when there are quite a few features we take for granted yet have yet to be implemented in vanilla Reddit
[20:46:07] <RubyPinch> ya know, I don't think they'd be that off about supporting furry sites, they already add features specifically for NSFW subs
[20:47:20] <thaostra> Yeah but not all NSFW subs are equal
[20:47:54] <thaostra> pony porn and furry porn in general still gets kneejerk reactions
[20:49:18] <thaostra> Patching RES to support e621 isn't out of the question, but good luck getting that into upstream without facing ad hominem
