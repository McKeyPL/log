[11:13:26] <Luvbi> 13That's pretty cool looking Frosty. And that's good, if you like it better
[11:13:51] <Frosty> Othar than that, I plan on going home for a visit soon. Gonna be a long drive.
[11:14:39] <Luvbi> 13Heh, when I want to go home I just walk upstairs and say hi to my grandmother. She enjoys when I visit
[11:15:02] <Frosty> Lol. It's a bit more complicated for me, unfortunatly.

[23:20:18] <JasonFirebolt> srry about any miss spelled words my keybord sucks
[23:20:46] <JasonFirebolt> sometimes im just typing a little fast
[23:20:54] <ponder> It isn't about what people younger than 17 look up on their own. The rules of this chat say it is 18+ only, and many countries and US states have laws against those younger than 18 being supplied porn and such, and this chat might be looked on unfavorably by those laws if we allowed young'ins
[23:21:17] <ponder> I mean, I was into some hardcore shit when I was 13, I admit that.
[23:21:36] <JasonFirebolt> ehh dude i was scarred for life at nine
[23:21:42] <ponder> But if a 13 year old came into this chatroom, said 13 year old would be booted with no hesitation.

[23:55:59] <ponder> http://imgur.com/a/RqwqS I wonder what her sex life is like...
[23:56:00] <FineLine> [ World's bendiest woman - Album on Imgur ]
[23:56:09] <ponder> Also: Human, non-porn, but sexy.
[23:56:22] <ponder> if you're into very limber people, that is.
[23:56:46] <Luvbi> 13I wonder how bendy-ness is measured...
[23:57:08] <ponder> bend-o-meters?
[23:57:26] <Luvbi> 13bends-per-inch sounds scientific enough
[23:57:50] <ponder> Nah. Imperial system is too imprecise. Has to be bends per centimeter
[23:58:57] <Luvbi> 13Or maybe it's measured in mass, some how. How many grams of bend do you possess?
