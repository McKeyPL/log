[09:54:22] <Googie> Well, apparently Chrome has dropped support for Linux Kernel versions <= 3.16. Huh...
[09:57:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> why would a browser care about the kernel its on
[09:58:27] <Googie> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9164251
[09:58:28] <PinkiePieBot> [ Google Chromium drops support for Linux 3.16 and earlier | Hacker News ]
[09:59:01] <Googie> Apparently reliant on a feature that doesn't exist in earlier versions
[10:00:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> sounds like something that shoudl be used if its there and not used if it isnt
[10:00:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> seems like their just being dicks
[10:01:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> a browser being kernel dependant still seems very stupid
[10:03:01] <Googie> Especially such a new version.
[10:04:00] <Googie> They'll backtrack on it and apologize within a few days I imagine
[10:04:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> maybe
[10:04:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> or someone will make yet another fork
[10:05:31] <Googie> Nah, I doubt they'd want to basically drop support for every stable distro in existence. 3.16 isn't even a year old yet.
[10:05:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> maybe
