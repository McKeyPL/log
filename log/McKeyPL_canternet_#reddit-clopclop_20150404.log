[05:33:18] <Quinn> I'm assuming that's pretty uncommon
[05:33:46] <Quinn> it's just my parents would get pissed/grossed out about that stuff so I was that way, until my first year in college where I kinda figured it out
[05:36:04] <Quinn> and looking back, my best friend (future husband) was pretty damn gay too but I never noticed somehow
[05:36:21] <Quinn> and he didn't tell me because he thought I was homophobic ;-;

[05:52:51] <Quinn> so far it's been /mainly/ sex, and 21 to 25 doesn't really matter that much I guess
[05:53:22] <Quinn> I can't tell if he's just a more happy/energetic person, or if it's the age difference, or if I've just become a boring asshole in the past 4 years
[05:54:43] <RubyPinch> each year I live, I think I've finally stopped growing mentally, but then I look back at the last year, and see things change every time
[05:54:49] <expatriate> I've met 50 year olds more energetic than me
[05:54:55] <Quinn> hm :/
[05:54:59] <expatriate> personality is a bigger deal than age in that respect
[05:55:22] <Quinn> like we went to dinner and he was just so happy and energetic and willing to try new stuff on the menu and I just felt really dull and muted in comparison

[06:22:08] <expatriate> it's a writing exercise but it can produce cool results
[06:22:22] <expatriate> you basically just write vivid memories you have, starting with "I remember"
[06:23:11] <expatriate> like, here's part of one of my old ones http://mibpaste.com/mJ8sPY 
[06:23:12] <FineLine> [ Mibpaste.bin ]
[06:24:00] <Quinn> that's pretty cool
[06:24:47] <Quinn> every time I write something I always hate it though :/
[06:25:02] <expatriate> see that's why this is so good
[06:25:16] <expatriate> because you know it's not going to be good from any objective standpoint
[06:25:31] <expatriate> but the formula to it gives it something to stand on
[06:26:02] <expatriate> it's intentionally disjointed, with fluctuating degrees of detail and emotion and tone
[06:26:08] <expatriate> you should try it
[06:26:17] <Quinn> maybe
[06:26:38] <expatriate> no
[06:26:40] <expatriate> do it right now
[06:26:44] * expatriate cracks a whip
[06:26:56] <expatriate> (not in a sexual way you deviants)
[06:27:43] <Quinn> is each "I remember" a separate memory? 
[06:28:18] <expatriate> usually, yeah, but if you want to use it more often you can
[06:28:27] <expatriate> I pretty much start every sentence with it
[06:37:07] <Vulpixbrew> IO'ma open a resturant that serves mutton and mead

[07:10:03] <expatriate> yeah

[08:31:51] <Vulpixbrew> panel on what?
[08:32:13] * Quinn goes in for another kiss but misses, she thinks maybe the wine was too much
[08:32:15] <Evelina> The benefits of proper lube usage
[08:32:33] <cloppyhooves> How MLP has helped people discover, become comfortable with, and feel supported for their queer identities c:
[08:32:49] <Quinn> ooooooooooooh
[08:32:55] <Quinn> will there be a recording of it?
[08:32:57] * Vulpixbrew giggles and  puts a hand on Quinn's cheek and kisses her
[08:32:58] <Quinn> I'd so much love to watch that
[08:33:02] <Vulpixbrew> oooo nice topic
[08:33:12] <cloppyhooves> Here's the problem, unfortunately :c
[08:33:18] <cloppyhooves> There could be
[08:33:42] <Katniss> :c
[08:33:45] <cloppyhooves> But I was thinking of asking them not to record it, so that people would feel more comfortable telling their stories without worrying about being outed by the recording
[08:34:04] <Quinn> maybe you could give them the option to opt out?
[08:34:10] <Evelina> Just record the audio!
[08:34:13] <Vulpixbrew> I'm out of rum
[08:34:14] <Quinn> turn it off/edit it out for people who don't want it recorded?
[08:34:17] <Vulpixbrew> brb getting wine
[08:34:18] <Quinn> or what Evelina said!
[08:34:29] <cloppyhooves> Unfortunately it's also a live stream so it's hard to do that so easily :c
[08:34:32] <cloppyhooves> I could try asking
[08:34:39] <cloppyhooves> Or talking to my panelists to see what they think
[08:34:45] <Quinn> where will it be streamed? :o
[08:34:49] <cloppyhooves> It was a tough decision on my part :(
[08:34:51] <Vulpixbrew> oooo link for the livestream?
[08:34:55] <Katniss> I think in most queer safe spaces most people would rather not be recorded, privately or not
[08:34:55] <cloppyhooves> Ponyville Live, I think?
[08:35:41] <Quinn> that's why I think it'd make sense to have them sign something to say they're okay with their segment being recorded, or something along that line
[08:36:01] <cloppyhooves> That's not practical, alas :c
[08:36:15] <cloppyhooves> I know you want a recording
[08:36:19] <cloppyhooves> And I wish I could give it to you
[08:36:23] <cloppyhooves> I'm still struggling with the question
[08:36:31] <cloppyhooves> And I'm really sorry if you won't be able to see it :(
[08:36:33] <Quinn> :c
[08:36:37] <Quinn> when is it being streamed?
[08:36:41] <Quinn> I'll try and catch it 
[08:36:48] <cloppyhooves> Ponyville Live, if it is
[08:36:48] <Katniss> If you want to get the most, don't record it at all
[08:37:05] <cloppyhooves> That's what I was thinking, Katniss :o
[08:37:21] * Evelina licks cloppyhooves tail
[08:38:04] <Katniss> It's like wiritng questions about sex on pieces if paper so the person asking the question doesn't have to be outed
[08:38:26] <Quinn> honestly I just wish I could be there
[08:38:31] <Quinn> I feel like I'd have stuff to say
[08:38:51] <cloppyhooves> I wish you could be here too :)
[08:39:24] <Vulpixbrew> at a con with cloppy and Quinn,  woukld be nice
[08:39:27] <Vulpixbrew> would*

[08:40:03] <Quinn> even just for a minute
[08:40:07] <cloppyhooves> I really hope so :)
[08:40:17] <Katniss> I feel like this IRC helped me when I came in as the Katniss character as a girl, it helped me explore my gender identity
[08:40:30] <Vulpixbrew> I shall one day take cloppyhooves  up on the sex and tacos offer
[08:40:31] <cloppyhooves> That makes me very happy to hear :D
[08:40:38] <Quinn> this IRC helped me with everything involving my identity, sexual and otherwise

[09:10:59] <Quinn> he'd always drink less than me, and would always take care of me if I got too drunk
[09:11:02] <Vulpixbrew> 3rd shift was great nothing like the looks you would get at 7 am stanidng in line with a case of beer to check out
[09:11:40] <Quinn> I remember sometimes I'd get sleepy and he'd carry me in his arms and up the stairs
[09:11:57] <Evelina> Imma whack you Lumia
[09:12:22] <Lumia> Lol, I've got thick scales xD
[09:12:39] <Quinn> or sometimes I'd fall asleep at my desk and I'd wake up all tucked in

[09:26:53] <Evelina> AS a bacon baron, you are focusing on bacon production, 
[09:27:19] <Evelina> But, as you get upgrades, your upgrades start branching into making bacon from other animals, then artificial bacon
[09:27:25] <Evelina> Then soylent green bacon and worst
[09:27:27] <Evelina> worse*
[09:27:29] * Quinn giggles and reaches her feet back to mindle with Vulpixbrew's
