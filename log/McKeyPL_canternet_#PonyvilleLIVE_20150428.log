[00:08:49] <ArchPegasusMichael> Um?
[00:08:59] <Electron> are you sleeping?
[00:09:05] <Electron> oh right, silly question
[00:09:22] <Electron> do you read something pony related?
[00:09:43] <ArchPegasusMichael> Not right now
[00:10:19] <Electron> can you give an advice what to read?
[00:10:40] <ArchPegasusMichael> Last fanfic I've read was my friend's, a great one btw
[00:11:17] <Electron> in Polish?
[00:11:22] <ArchPegasusMichael> yup

[00:12:35] <Electron> that's sad, I can't read in Polish
[00:14:38] <Electron> how was the newest episode, ArchPegasusMichael?

[00:15:26] <ArchPegasusMichael> I liked it, reminded me of S2
[00:15:48] <Electron> that crying scene though
[00:16:05] <Electron> many emotions
[00:16:31] <Electron> what do you think about Rainbow's behaviour?
[00:17:19] <ArchPegasusMichael> For me that crying scene was too awkwardly cartoonish to be moving
[00:17:43] <Electron> that too, this is a cartoon after all
[00:18:37] <Electron> why so many tears from Rainbow?
[00:18:50] <Electron> Tank is gonna just sleep
[00:18:50] <ArchPegasusMichael> But I remember scenes from other episodes, where crying pony actually hit my feels
[00:19:39] <ArchPegasusMichael> In that one, it felt unnatural, overexpressive
[00:20:21] <Electron> you are with Twilight as I can see
[00:20:33] <Electron> she did not cry even the slightest
[00:20:34] <ArchPegasusMichael> I guess
[00:20:58] <Electron> she was just confused why they are crying for no reason
[00:21:32] <ArchPegasusMichael> I wouldn't be though
[00:22:43] <Electron> also did you get Rarity's reply "I more upset because you are not crying, Twi"?
[00:23:03] <ArchPegasusMichael> *Pinkie's
[00:23:24] <ArchPegasusMichael> That was a joke :p
[00:23:24] <Electron> why Pinkie's? that was Rarity's
[00:23:27] <Electron> :)
[00:24:33] <ArchPegasusMichael> btw, have you read that comic with too small text? ;)
[00:24:42] <Electron> yes
[00:25:09] <Electron> I ctrl+scroll up and I did see the words
[00:25:26] <Electron> and there were no blurs surprisingly
