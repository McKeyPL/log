[09:40:28] <cyborg_ar> i really dont like jackleapp's singing on any of his songs, all the covers i've heard are better to me
[09:40:53] <cyborg_ar> also i love the album art
[09:40:57] <cyborg_ar> haha
[09:41:02] <JustAberrant> yeah
[09:41:09] <cyborg_ar> super ultra low budget indie rock
[09:41:31] <JustAberrant> I like the hotel california-esq transition somewhere in there
[09:41:35] <cyborg_ar> the kind of thing you would get in a cassette back in the 80's
[09:42:04] <cyborg_ar> one that was already used to record mixtapes a couple times previously and is really noisy
[09:42:10] <JustAberrant> one you linked is a bit too slow ;p

[23:02:56] <GigaWork> does anyone know of a way to have a conventional phone, to be shut off at a set time?
[23:03:19] <JustAberrant> conventional phone, you mean like POTS ?
[23:04:12] <JustAberrant> also, the heck? ;p
[23:04:18] <GigaWork> Well its the straight talk home phone system. Using a base station to recieve wireless signal, but you plug in a telephone to the system with a standard phone cable
[23:05:17] <GigaWork> We want to put a phone in the residents part but need it so the system can be shut off at 9pm est and turned on in the morning when mu cousin gets up
[23:05:25] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Taco.eating.Anthro.Batpony)
[23:05:35] <GigaWork> Would a inline switch work or would it distort the signal?
[23:05:50] <JustAberrant> I'd think an inline switch would work
[23:06:21] <GigaWork> Basically only way to find out is to do a test cable eh?
[23:06:57] <GigaWork> But which wire pair on the telephone cable transmit what?
[23:07:44] <JustAberrant> depends on the connector
[23:07:51] <JustAberrant> if it's just a basic 1 phone system
[23:08:03] <GigaWork> ya it would be a basic corded phone
[23:08:04] <JustAberrant> green and red are probably what you want
[23:09:09] <JustAberrant> I can't remember what either does though
[23:12:28] <JustAberrant> ideally just turn them both off ;p
[23:13:33] <JustAberrant> also keep in mind there's actually some decent voltage (48v)
[23:13:48] <JustAberrant> so don't like the contacts ;p

[23:14:25] <GigaWork> http://archive.oreilly.com/users/files/47104/rj14wiring.gif
[23:14:45] <GigaWork> So black and green?
[23:14:59] <JustAberrant> huh
[23:15:02] *** Parts: Black (BlackCat@Anonlight.Starsarebeautiful) ("*Poof*")
[23:15:05] <JustAberrant> how do you get that ;p
[23:15:08] <JustAberrant> from that diagram ;p
[23:15:15] <GigaWork> Because it says tip XD
[23:15:37] <JustAberrant> you need a tip and ring
[23:15:51] <GigaWork> So any will work then as long as its a tip and ring?
[23:15:54] <JustAberrant> green and red are line 1 .. what almost every home phone system uses
[23:16:00] <JustAberrant> black and yellow are line 2, if you had a second line
[23:16:09] <GigaWork> Ah so green and red I will try with
[23:16:19] <GigaWork> ad would a roll switch work too?
[23:16:23] <GigaWork> because I have one right now
[23:16:39] <JustAberrant> black and yellow probably arn't even being used in your setup
[23:17:10] <JustAberrant> if it can handle the voltage.. sure.. I guess
[23:17:24] <JustAberrant> I honestly don't know what the effect of opening just one side would be
[23:17:46] <GigaWork> because what we will probably do is run a long ass cable and have a shut off switch mid run where only we can get to ot
[23:18:14] <JustAberrant> if you're going to be switching it physically anyway, why not just have a jack in the middle of the run
[23:18:19] <JustAberrant> and unplug it as desired?
[23:18:23] <GigaWork> Try
[23:18:29] <GigaWork> true, did not think of that

[23:18:42] <GigaWork> Is there a limit to how far a cable can be ran?
[23:19:46] <JustAberrant> sure, but normally starts at the last point for from the provider
[23:19:56] <JustAberrant> where your plugging it in to some dealie.. no idea
[23:20:14] <JustAberrant> also do you operate a prison or something?
[23:20:33] <JustAberrant> this is a very strange requirement ;p
[23:20:54] <GigaWork> No a AFC home, and we have had complaints of them using the phone past 9pm, because some of the guys are up till 4-5am and would call at those times
