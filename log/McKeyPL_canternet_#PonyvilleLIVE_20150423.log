[13:28:43] <TheFlutterGuy> Lunia has been moved to another hospital, a department that specializes with tough infections.
[13:29:43] <Electron> by Celestia's name, what is going on there?
[13:30:45] <TheFlutterGuy> well, the doctors are trying to save the life of my girlfriend. which i really appreciate.
[13:31:25] <Electron> where did those damn infections come from?
[13:31:37] <TheFlutterGuy> dunno
[13:34:45] <Electron> what they say about you?
[13:38:11] <StarStream> if MRSA spread to u 
[13:38:18] <StarStream> things will be super interesting 
[13:44:50] <Electron> super annoying
[13:49:28] <ArchPegasusMichael> :I
[13:50:04] <TheFlutterGuy> i'll get answers next week
[13:50:16] <TheFlutterGuy> whatever is happening with my bowels, while the symptoms match lunia, is not the same.
[13:50:20] <TheFlutterGuy> she has bacteria, i have a virus.
[13:50:29] <TheFlutterGuy> so, i ahve to be carefull not to give it to her
[13:50:50] <StarStream> well in any case lunia will be quarantined 
[13:50:50] <Electron> god damn Spring
[13:51:08] <Electron> all living things are getting strong
[13:51:19] <StarStream> cause MRSA would shut down the immune system 
[13:51:27] <StarStream> but in a sense body can fight back
