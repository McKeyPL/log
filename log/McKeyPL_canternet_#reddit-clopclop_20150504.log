[04:41:02] <cloppyhooves> I need some help deciding something :o
[04:41:15] <ponder> What is your conundrum?
[04:41:25] <cloppyhooves> I have an assignment due midnight
[04:41:34] <cloppyhooves> But my brother is asking if I can pick him up from the airport at 11:15
[04:41:49] <cloppyhooves> I should go get him then, but I don't know if it's the best idea given what I have to do
[04:42:28] <ponder> How long does it take to pick him up, can he take a taxi instead, how critical is it that you return the assignment on time?
[04:42:39] <Vulpixbrew> ^this
[04:43:34] <cloppyhooves> 45-60 minutes in total; yes if I'm not available; pretty important I guess I don't know
[04:43:38] <cloppyhooves> I haven't seen him in a while, though
[04:43:57] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[04:44:19] <ponder> Do you have time to see him later? Maybe do lunch or dinner or what have you?
[04:44:28] <cloppyhooves> I guess so :o
[04:44:50] <cloppyhooves> I do need to move my car at some point anyway, though
[04:46:13] <ponder> Do you think the loss of an hour will prevent you from finishing the assignment on time? Because if so, I'm sure he would understand.
[04:47:27] <cloppyhooves> I'd like to say no, but realistically I'm pretty bad so I don't know
[04:48:05] <cloppyhooves> I've also never picked anyone up form this airport before
[04:48:11] <cloppyhooves> And it doesn't look easy

[14:06:40] <Algido> I let Virion die in fire emblem and didnt restart the map. I feel bad.
[14:07:30] <Vulpixbrew> dang
[14:07:48] <Algido> it was so avoidable too. The boss was just an asshole and moved a long ways to take out my archer as his last move before I killed him -_-
[14:08:02] <Algido> dick
[14:08:03] <Algido> lol
[14:09:49] <Vulpixbrew> http://i.imgur.com/MfoQ7ZS.png
[14:10:13] <Algido> I hope he comes back... he said is is gona retreat and live though... but also said far away from this bloody battlefield. It would be nice if he came back. Was my only archer. But I am only on chapter 5 I think.
[14:11:11] <Algido> Many of my games are like that :l
[14:11:23] <Algido> unplayed after buying it
[14:11:55] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[14:12:06] <Vulpixbrew> steam sale ect
[14:12:44] <Vulpixbrew> or my issue oooo9 humble bundle I want those 3 of 8 games for 7 bucks
[14:13:02] <RubyPinch> I don't have this issue at all
[14:13:48] <Algido> I'd have so many damn steam games if I had any fait in my current computer. I hsould just get a new one.
[14:13:55] <Algido> faith*
[14:14:15] <RubyPinch> This is why I use onlive
[14:14:23] <RubyPinch> I only pay for what i use
[14:14:31] <Algido> And a proper desktop. This typing on a wireless keyboard on my lap makes me look like I can't type.
[14:15:44] <RubyPinch> and also why I use console, less sales helps the end user spend less money
[14:16:00] <Algido> Well it's like.... I am in the store and the game looks cool and I have the means to get the game and the intention to play it, so I get it, but then never play it.
[14:16:44] <Algido> I have like 6-8 xbox 360 games I need to play. Some are big titles
[14:16:59] <Vulpixbrew> also i now officially havfe a second copy of bioshock 2
[14:18:14] <Algido> I need to try that game again. I played the first one a little bit amd kinda felt bad killing big daddies
[14:18:40] <Algido> and harvesting the little girl because POINTS
[14:18:44] <Vulpixbrew> I never did beat 1, but I l;oved two and liked infinite
[14:21:56] <Algido> The thought of not having Virion is bugging me. Maybe I should play casual... A ot of people say you dont get the true FE experience but I don't want to feel bad losing a unit, especially to some BS. =/
[14:26:10] <Vulpixbrew> ye
[14:29:49] <Vulpixbrew> that moment you can't open a ksp save file cause you have a ship going .5 lightspeed and the game has no idea how tio handle it
[14:39:13] <Algido> I'm gonna drive myself crazy. Damnit, it's just a stupid video game character >>
[14:39:34] <Algido> I liked his sniping tho and his speed rose so fast T_T
[14:41:03] <Algido> Oh well. Gotta learn to keep the squishes completely safe even if the battle is essentially won. 
[14:42:07] <Algido> Time for the clopping fun!
[14:46:39] <Vulpixbrew> ooo clopping fun
[14:50:21] <Algido> It would be better with someone else ofc.
[14:53:00] <Algido> I don't generally watch porn with someone, even though it's fun, it's more down to business. I like to share clop though. Only a couple of my firneds know and have seen it and only 1 likes it and she is female. Now I need a male friend IRL who likes to show and clop.
