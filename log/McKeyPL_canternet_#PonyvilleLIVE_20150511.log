[21:08:26] <Sakura> Well, that guy was hilariously creepy. Assuming that's a guy. lol
[21:10:33] <ArchPegasusMichael> Sakura: who?
[21:12:03] <Sakura> 9589. He PMed me just to ask for a webcam. He's be pretty disappointed if I satisfied him with such request either way. :D
[21:14:11] <ArchPegasusMichael> XD
[21:14:38] <ArchPegasusMichael> I never respond to random PMs
[21:15:47] <ArchPegasusMichael> And sometimes report 'em, just in case
[21:17:58] <Sakura> I sent the logs to Dusk & he said that he wasn't breaking any rules which I can't argue with. I'm of age.
[21:18:21] <Sakura> It didn't get to the point of sexual harassment yet.
[21:18:25] <Dusk> he v.v
[21:18:32] <Sakura> she8
[21:18:39] <Dusk> Yea once it actually gets harassing I'll handle it
[21:18:39] <Sakura> I can never get used to this.
[21:18:59] <Dusk> But like...I can't do much until an actual rule is broken, it's just some random person >.<
[21:19:00] <Sakura> I almost told the perv that I was a woman with man parts.
[21:19:04] <Dusk> :o
[21:19:37] <Sakura> It's techincally true anyway.
[21:22:30] <Sakura> You know what I do miss are those random wrong number texts that I used to get all the time. I never respond to them but there was one guy who kept asking me if he could borrow an Xbox Controller or something.
[21:22:50] * Dusk goes to visit Sakura's house, much better than webcam :o
[21:23:33] <Sakura> Yep. Strictly platonic webcam party with Sakura & Dusk. :D
[21:23:46] <Dusk> I'd do it, I'm not even that far from you
[21:24:06] <Dusk> Could have a bit of some multiplayer gaming thing going too :ppp
[21:24:21] <Sakura> You could come over to my house IRL but it looks terrible from the inside.
[21:24:28] <Dusk> So?
[21:24:50] <Sakura> I would have to do a lot of cleaning first.
[21:25:16] <Dusk> why?
[21:25:24] <Sakura> It's a mess right now.
[21:25:38] <Sakura> From the last party I had. lol
[21:26:20] <Sakura> But seriously, I do need to do some cleaning first.
[21:26:24] <ArchPegasusMichael> All I'd need is some clean space to sit XD
[21:27:11] <Dusk> ^
[21:27:21] <Dusk> actually I'd just sit on Sakura
[21:27:26] <Dusk> Problem solved
[21:27:32] <ArchPegasusMichael> :D
[21:27:38] <Sakura> Nope. I have to sit on you.
[21:30:03] <Dusk> lol
[21:35:40] <Sakura> Hey, how long do you plan on staying here in the region, Dusk?
[21:35:48] <Dusk> A long while
[21:36:23] * Sakura huggles Dusk
[21:36:27] * Dusk hugs
[21:45:04] <Sakura> If I do move out to a place of my own or with a roommate at least, you could visit me all you want if you can. Bring Ditzy along if you want.
[21:46:59] <Dusk> She's not gonna be here too much longer
[21:48:02] <Sakura> Military move?
[21:48:16] <Dusk> She's getting married to hockey
[21:48:29] <Dusk> he'll be in...nevada somewhere so she'll be going out there
[21:49:13] <Sakura> Any chance Hockey will be stationed at Area 51?
[21:52:36] <Sakura> Taking it as a yes since there's silence & the forced secrecy(lack of) of Area 51.
[21:55:25] <Dusk> no
[21:55:33] <Dusk> Sakura: He doesn't even have a clearance
[21:55:44] <Dusk> He has maybe a conf at most
[22:19:24] <Sakura> I see.
