[03:07:14] <DataByteBrony> I have been on a call with a 'service tech' from microsoft for the past 4 hours
[03:07:25] <Twilightlicious> lol
[03:07:30] <Twilightlicious> on hold, or talking for 4 hours?
[03:07:59] <DataByteBrony> at one point, he navigated to the network connections page, pulled up the ipv4 configuration, then asked me to add the machine to the domain from there
[03:09:10] <DataByteBrony> and just now, he wanted me to browse to a network location to confirm that the networking is working.. WHEN THE MACHINE WAS JUST JOINED TO THE DOMAIN AN HOUR AGO
[03:09:13] <DataByteBrony> argh
[03:10:02] <DataByteBrony> the last three weeks with this guy is him trying everything i tried, over and over
[03:10:06] <DataByteBrony> nothing different
[03:10:21] <DataByteBrony> now today we're re-imaging the vm.. AGAIN
[03:10:29] <tiwake> heh
[03:10:43] <tiwake> people over rate software support
[03:11:36] <Colgate> every once in a while you get someone who knows what they're doing
[03:12:22] <DataByteBrony> i would like if i could ask for one
[03:12:35] <DataByteBrony> i knew from day one that he was only following a tutorial
[03:12:44] <DataByteBrony> the same one i did months ago
[03:14:53] <DataByteBrony> a few times he's even asked to change arbitrary things, like the machine name, because this or that.. then i show him why that's not the error, we change it anyway, and surprise! still not working!
[03:15:30] <wolfyshy> 3 weeks?
[03:15:56] <wolfyshy> after 8 days with tier 1 and tier 2 I bitched and moaned (heh.. I'm a wolfess and I bitched... woof)
[03:16:03] <wolfyshy> and they gave me "tier 4"
[03:16:10] <wolfyshy> which was a guy on the windows networking development team
[03:16:15] <wolfyshy> and he fixed it in 2 hours
[03:16:37] <wolfyshy> this was back in 2008, when win2k8 was new, so no guarantees it's still tiered like that
[03:16:50] <wolfyshy> but yes, there are ways to escalate if you are persistent
[03:17:11] <wolfyshy> just be up front... you know this is wasting their time, your time, you just want the issue fixed... you need to speak with someone with more in-depth knowledge
[03:19:58] <DataByteBrony> that's my problem, i guess..
[03:20:20] <DataByteBrony> i know this is a pretty involved problem - i've been at it for a good two months
[03:20:37] <wolfyshy> mine involved a bug in the L2TP stack
[03:20:40] <wolfyshy> in win2k8
[03:21:06] <DataByteBrony> i'm just too polite to tell this guy he shouldn't be working on something this tough when he doesn't know the difference between a network and a domain
[03:21:10] <wolfyshy> the "tier 4" guy wasted no time, he was like, throw me rdp on a VM and put netmon/wireshark on it
[03:21:46] <wolfyshy> then again, MS 'knows' me

[03:32:14] <JustAberrant> place I work is a pretty big company[tm], and we've got fairly expensive contracts with companies like presagis

[03:33:51] <JustAberrant> but yeah, any support that you didn't explicitly pay for is gonna suck :>

[03:42:59] <JustAberrant> its more of a concept that about 40% of the computer industry feels compelled to rattle on about

[03:49:19] <tiwake> I'm thinking I'm going to go home
[03:50:07] <tiwake> or I could stay and set up the next program... herm

[07:35:34] <Moonlightning> I'm trying to get my VPN clients to use a certain DNS server and certain search domains when they're on the VPN.
[07:37:13] <Moonlightning> OpenVPN provides a `dhcp-option` option which works as expected on Android, iOS, and Windows; but on Linux and OS X systems, it puts the option into the environment used for running hook scripts.
[07:37:54] <Moonlightning> So I figured I'd write such a hook script that would parse the options out of the environment and pass them off to `resolvconf`.
[07:38:33] <Moonlightning> Then I found the list of DHCP options and wondered if somepony had already written a thing that took DHCP options and gave back something formatted for `resolvconf`. :P

[23:48:49] <LordShadowWing> Does anyone have a suggestion of a secure Email service for lawyer that I have as a Client It MUST have IMAP/SMTP support
[23:49:53] <Seoson> SMTP is required by definition
[23:50:06] <DataByteBrony> google is good for me.. and if you're worried about content being read by the government uses pgp
[23:50:06] <Seoson> Otherwise you cannot send e-mails
[23:50:30] <DataByteBrony> i think he means outside of a web interface, Seoson 
[23:50:52] <Seoson> I can recommend GMail, but as a professional I would only use it with a custom domain
[23:51:19] <DataByteBrony> costs money monthly, but it's pretty nice
[23:51:45] <Seoson> Also most webhosts have a good e-mail service for their clients
[23:52:16] <Seoson> Keyword for larger groups is "Groupware"
[23:53:32] <Seoson> They almost always include IMAP(S), POP3(S), SMTP(S) and sometimes even more advanced things like Sieve(Rules for e-mail sorting)
