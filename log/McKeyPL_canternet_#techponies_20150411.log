[04:08:43] <Fallfeathers> The wholesaler IT store my company deals with has started thrusting free stuff onto me whenever I go there
[04:08:58] <Fallfeathers> So far I've gotten about six gaming mice and a dozen 8GB USB sticks
[04:09:09] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:09:20] <JustAberrant> the mice are weird.. but USB sticks are thrown around like confetti
[04:11:21] <Fallfeathers> well they're an IT supplier and they deal only direct to companies, so I imagine anything gaming related isn't selling
[04:12:06] * JustAberrant shrugs
[04:12:19] <JustAberrant> I'd wonder why they'd stock them in the first place in that case.. but whatever

[08:40:08] <Twilightlicious> Wtf is a stream tablet.
[08:40:50] <Googie> One of HP's product lines is named "Stream"
[08:41:05] <Googie> It's just a regular tablet.
[08:41:21] <Googie> (Well, x86 running Windows 8)
[08:41:30] <Twilightlicious> are you sure?
[08:41:40] <Twilightlicious> Looks like ARM
[08:41:43] <Twilightlicious> atleast for the Stream 7
[08:41:46] <Twilightlicious> not sure about the stream 8
[08:42:15] <Googie> I just opened a random page and the one on display is running an Atom processor/Windows 8
[08:42:19] <tiwake> jolla tablet++
[08:42:41] <Twilightlicious> Does that mean i can run x86 applications, or would it still be a lame Windows Store only thing.
[08:42:44] <Gigabit> But windows 8 is a desktop os!
[08:43:25] <Googie> The tablet x86 version of Windows 8 is identical to the desktop version
[08:43:52] <Googie> If it's ARM though (and make sure to check), then it's stuck to the Windows Store crap
[08:44:13] <Twilightlicious> It's an Atom processor
[08:44:16] <Twilightlicious> which makes it x86
[08:44:50] <Twilightlicious> doesnt mean it's the full Desktop version though
[08:46:24] <Twilightlicious> im watching a review that mentions it struggles to play Minecraft
[08:46:31] <Twilightlicious> Which means it has Java
[08:46:37] <Twilightlicious> which means it's full desktop? :P
[08:46:49] <Googie> It's a full desktop version because the cutdown version only exists for ARM
[08:47:15] <Googie> (Because most 3rd party Windows applications need x86 to run)
[08:47:36] <Twilightlicious> It looks like im going to be buying this xD
[08:47:42] <Twilightlicious> I need a tablet, not for gaming, but for Downloading.
[08:47:55] <Googie> For downloading ?
[08:48:08] <Twilightlicious> i have a metered connection at home
[08:48:12] <Twilightlicious> so i download in my pocket at work
[08:48:12] <tiwake> Twilightlicious: get a jolla tablet
[08:48:25] <Twilightlicious> I was using a Nexus 7 to download and torrent and such at work
[08:49:13] <Twilightlicious> But i like to play MMORPG's, and they generally require a Downloader.
[08:49:41] <Twilightlicious> up until my tablet died, i tried everything to get QEmu running on it.
[08:50:06] <Twilightlicious> i think there was some kind of virtualization thing i needed to switch in a conf file
[08:50:24] <Twilightlicious> But now that it's broken, im seriously thinking i need an x86 Windows Tablet.
[08:50:43] <Twilightlicious> is the Stream 7 also x86?
[08:51:16] <Twilightlicious> exact same storage, ram, and cpu/clock?
[08:51:17] <tiwake> jolla tablet is x86
[08:51:24] <Twilightlicious> But this is 99$
[08:51:27] <Twilightlicious> And Windows 8.1
[08:51:30] <Googie> Apparently it is running an Atom, so yeah.
[08:51:33] <Twilightlicious> which i think will get Windows 10
[08:51:38] <tiwake> screw windows
[08:51:42] <Googie> http://www.anandtech.com/show/8760/hp-stream-7-review
[08:51:42] <PinkiePieBot> [ HP Stream 7 Review: A $119 Windows Tablet ]
[08:51:52] <Twilightlicious> Windows is the entire point in me wanting x86 lol
[08:51:57] <Twilightlicious> otherwise i have no problems with ARM
[08:52:08] <tiwake> wine it up
[08:52:29] <Googie> wine is nowhere near perfect. I wish it was, but it's not :(
[08:52:49] <tiwake> actually jolla's sailfishOS is based on wayland
[08:52:56] <Twilightlicious> So i'm totally getting this tablet next payday
[08:53:13] <tiwake> so wine probably won't be too happy with wayland
[08:54:19] <Googie> The Stream 7 does look pretty good, now that I'm looking at it.
[08:54:21] <tiwake> as far as I can tell, sailfishOS is the first operating system to run completely off of wayland
[08:54:29] * Googie is almost tempted, depending on how much it costs in Aus.
[08:54:41] <Googie> Not sure what I'd use it for, but :V

[17:48:34] <Moonlightning> Sooo…I'm thinking of making a VM that I can install stuff like Flash in
[17:48:44] <Moonlightning> Y'know, something that I wouldn't really care if it got compromised
[17:49:02] <tiwake> screw flash
[17:49:49] <Moonlightning> Right?
[17:49:55] <Moonlightning> But it's kind of a necessity.
[17:50:01] <Moonlightning> So many streaming things and stuff require it.
[17:50:38] <Moonlightning> Anyway…I'm thinking of a sort of Deep Freeze-like setup.
[17:50:45] <Moonlightning> Only with a VM, and a host Ubuntu system.
[17:51:32] <Moonlightning> Or…maybe I could just have a copy-on-write sort of overlay thing on the filesystem that gets discarded on shutdown?
[17:51:46] <tiwake> you can stream without it... ffmpeg with xgrab and ffserver

[17:52:33] <tiwake> though ffserver is a ball of rotten code that should be replaced

[17:53:19] <tiwake> yeah
[17:53:41] <tiwake> vlc won't decode it?
[17:53:56] <Moonlightning> …hmm, I haven't tried that
[17:55:11] <Moonlightning> Well. Feeding it the page's URI didn't seem to work
[17:55:19] <Moonlightning> And I doubt I could get anything more out of digging through the source
[17:56:15] <tiwake> di.fm requires flash
[17:56:42] <tiwake> though I'm not sure how to find out what URL and port the stream is coming from
[17:56:52] <tiwake> maybe a packet sniffer
[17:57:19] <Moonlightning> Really, though, I'm looking for a setup that would let me do arbitrary Flash-requiring things without compromising anything important. >.>
[17:57:39] <Moonlightning> So probably better to just get an effectively read-only VM and install Flash on it

[21:29:44] <johnsey> it's very likely a module which you can recompile and modprobe

[21:33:31] <mniip> so how would I go about recompiling a single module
[21:33:45] <johnsey> a good start would be apt-get source linux-image-amd64 (if that's what you're using)
[21:33:49] <mniip> doing that
[21:33:57] <mniip> linux-image-3.2.0-4-amd64
[21:37:24] <johnsey> mniip: then you just need to copy over the config, make oldconfig and then make SUBDIRS=drivers/net/ethernet/realtek modules
[21:38:10] <mniip> /boot/config-* ?
[21:38:50] <johnsey> yeah

[21:40:52] <mniip> aha
[21:42:12] <mniip> uh

[21:47:22] <johnsey> mniip: linux-image-3.2.0-4-amd64 is actually 3.2.65-1+deb7u2, according to dpkg
[21:47:24] *** Quits: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net) (Connection closed)
[21:48:18] <johnsey> also, you'll need Module.symvers, which is in linux-headers

[21:49:58] <mniip> still builds the 3.2.64 module
[21:54:32] <mniip> johnsey, ok so what file is the define in?

[21:59:14] <mniip> yeah but it makes the uname different
[21:59:18] <mniip> and thus the modules directory
[21:59:23] <johnsey> it's a patch for the linux kernel, so it makes quite a difference
[21:59:34] <mniip> and thus probably the "module format"
[21:59:37] <johnsey> yup
[21:59:48] <johnsey> you wanna make sure you use the right sources
[22:00:04] <johnsey> (rt = realtime by the way)
[22:00:35] *** Brolf_pog is now known as Jerry
[22:04:01] * mniip blames apt
[22:11:08] <mniip> johnsey, how verbose is the debug
[22:11:42] <mniip> will it recurse infinitely as I try to view it over ssh
[22:13:23] <johnsey> mniip: I didn't check but a quick grep over the source seems to indicate that it's not particularly verbose. Which may be a downside, too
[22:14:16] <johnsey> there's only a bunch of dprintks and assertions. but on the positive side, you can add your own debugging
