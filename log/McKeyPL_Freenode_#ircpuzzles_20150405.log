[06:24:11] <walle303> fwilson, sdamashek yano Is it ok if AliceCatson plays the #ircpuzzles 
[06:24:13] <jenni> [ #ircpuzzles @ Freenode stats by Zachary_DuBois ] - https://j.mp/1DM0GOw
[06:24:13] <Zachary_DuBois> :P
[06:24:27] <walle303> AliceCatson is controlled by Twitch
[06:24:30] <walle303> twitch.tv/twitchspeaks
[06:24:42] <mooo> so is it a person or what is it doing? lol
[06:24:48] <walle303> Its many people
[06:24:54] <walle303> controlling one thing
[06:25:07] <mooo> but how do they control it? I can't see how many people would realistically control an IRC game
[06:25:16] <mooo> I mean solving it involves no input
[06:25:23] <mooo> the people typing the commands would need to do that themselves
[06:25:26] <walle303> They talk in the chat
[06:25:30] <mooo> and then somehow make the bot join the channels
[06:25:31] <walle303> lol
[06:25:35] <walle303> yea
[06:25:40] <walle303> twitchspeaks sets that up
[06:25:43] <mooo> but if making the bot join the channels is all, that's not very interesting
[06:25:45] <walle303> the person twitchspeaks not the users
[06:25:46] <walle303> lol
[06:25:51] <mooo> also they could decide to join #freenode and spam or something
[06:26:06] <walle303> twitchspeaks watches the whole thing and can make sure that they cant do that
[06:26:54] <mooo> I still doubt it will work, but if magically it does work, and they won't leak answers by making the bot do stupid things like say the channel in stead of joining it, I guess it would probably be fine
[06:26:57] <walle303> i could give him the list of channels and make his script only accept those
[06:27:11] <walle303> mooo, Everyone knows -2 through 8 anyway
[06:27:15] <walle303> been leaked already
[06:27:16] <mooo> already trying to leak the answer list again? ):
[06:27:16] <mooo> lol
[06:27:44] <walle303> i can give him those and he can stop it when they get to 8
