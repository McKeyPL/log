[05:56:02] <Phase4> their tcp stack was from one of the unixes
[05:56:28] <Phase4> why write one when it can simply be purchased, poorly intergrated, then tag along for another 8 versions
[05:56:39] *** Joins: Hickory (Iceman@Pony-fr4.tal.42.96.IP)
[05:58:06] <Seoson> Apart from having problems with to many TCP connections the windows network stack is fine for the most part. Why change something that works?
[06:00:06] <Phase4> Seoson, because windows is one of the few operating systems with a purely userspace api, the *can* fix it and keep winsock
[06:00:17] <Phase4> there's still no concept of a socket in windows
[06:00:39] <Phase4> and the whole networking stack performs like shit
[06:01:08] <Phase4> http.sys is the only reason iis can serve static files with any promptness
[06:02:06] <Seoson> It's fine for consumer grade use. I'd never use it as a server OS -  it wasn't intended to be used for that in the first place..
[06:02:08] <Phase4> ^ 2 in contrast to the filesystem stack, which performs as wonderfully as unicorn farts
[06:02:39] <Phase4> it's just *really* ugly, and i've seen enough of windows to know that's usually how things are
[06:02:53] <Phase4> not that any other os doesn't have its warts, windows is just notable for them
[06:02:54] <Seoson> Also there are bigger problems on windows for example regarding user permissions
[06:03:17] <Phase4> i don't think anyones entirely sure how windows acl's work
[06:03:46] <Phase4> not even microsoft, afaik the exact details of inheritance in particular are undocumented
[06:03:50] <Colgate> I tried to make a user which had permission to only so WMI read calls on remote servers...
[06:03:59] <Colgate> I gave up :P
[06:04:04] <Colgate> only do*
[06:04:04] <Seoson> To be honest I even have problem with ACLs on Unix
[06:04:48] <Seoson> But at least on *nix you don't need them for the most part
[06:05:37] <Phase4> posix acls' are just a little useless
[06:09:12] <Phase4> Seoson, the really scary thing is you can apply windows acl's to pretty much anything
[06:09:33] <Phase4> and i *mean* anything. any kernel handle
[06:11:47] <Phase4> and i'm stopping before i rant about non kernel handles
[06:11:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> so tryin to compile some code and it uses a static compiled driver binary with no source the libftd2xx driver
[06:11:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> its spitting out the error undefined reference to memcpy@GLIBC_2.14
[06:11:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> any idea how i solve this
[06:20:05] <Seoson> Are you sure that you meet the dependencies for the application? Check you glibc version
[06:20:49] <Seoson> your* 
[06:22:36] <Seoson> "dpkg -l libc6" on debian btw.
[06:23:15] <Seoson> Or you can just "execute" the so file itself I believe, but don't quote me on that
[06:23:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> hmmm im looking at it now
[06:23:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> its odd
[06:23:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> i thought i was right
[06:23:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> but it might not be
[06:23:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> im going to keep poking
[06:24:57] <Seoson> What ever you do don't upgrade you glibc version without updating the OS itself. It breaks things and make things very complicated - did it once and never want to do it again
[06:26:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah
[06:26:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> that why its weird
[06:27:26] <ShivalPonyWolf> hmm ok kali linux might have an old glibc
[06:28:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> stupid satticly compiled drivers

[06:36:02] <Seoson> Did it on a production server. Seemed to work in the beginning but messed up postfix etc. Had to merge a snapshot and the current state of the machine. Testing in my VM didn't showed any errors. ^^
[06:42:04] * Seoson still asks himself why so many ponies connect via Tor.
[06:42:46] <Colgate> what's wrong with tor?
[06:45:14] <Seoson> Nothing in general - just the opposite. That it exists allows journalism in restrictive countries. However connecting to an IRC server using Tor is wasting resources if you live in a county that's considered free. Why not simply SSL?
[06:46:15] <Seoson> And if you don't want people to know that you're using a specific IRC network you can always use a public BNC.
[06:46:40] <Colgate> to waste resources of those trying to deanonymize tor users, same reason why tls everywhere is a good idea
[06:47:42] <Colgate> the more mundane data that goes through tor, the harder it is to find the pieces they really want
[06:48:00] <Seoson> Sadly the Tor capacity is very limited. At least canternet uses a hidden service and therefore doesn't block the exit nodes.
[06:50:54] <Seoson> I'd donate capacity, but most hosters around here (including mine) does not allow tor exit nodes. Considering the amount of questionable content on both hidden services and public sites accessed trough tor I can understand them even if I wouldn't support that policy.

[06:53:34] <Colgate> /shrug, I use tor for nearly everything
[06:55:55] <Seoson> Do you? How do you deal with those loading times? At least a year ago when I used Tor the last time it was horrible. 
[06:58:40] <Seoson> Also intelligence agencies trying to gain more and more control over the exit nodes makes me wonder if my traffic is more secure there after all. ;-)
[06:59:10] <Colgate> loading times aren't bad
[06:59:21] <Colgate> the most annoying thing is cloudflare
[06:59:31] <Phase4> in my experience it's horrible but usable
[06:59:43] <Colgate> cloudflare makes you enter captchas constantly, really obnoxious
[07:00:47] <Colgate> it is worse on sites like derpibooru where they have all their pictures loaded through cloudflare, but since they are hotlinked, you don't get the captcha
[07:03:11] <Seoson> Depending on the site's security settings cloudflare is annoying even on the clear net. A forum I'm visiting on a regular basis has a security check (well no captcha) almost every 2nd page you load up.
[07:05:02] <Seoson> Also I've got the feeling that a majority of CF's customers host questionable content themselves. A look on Brian Kreb's blog is almost enough to proof that -.-
[07:06:38] <Colgate> I ran an i2p service for canternet for a while as well, but decided to drop that later

I don't throw information at google and still have no social media account on any plattform, but when dealing with other (reasonable) people?  I don't unless I do questionable things and I believe that revealing your identity strengthens trust.  Here for example you can easily get my real name, address and phone number from my vhost.
