[01:06:29] <Flurshy> anyone here experienced with the nitty gritty computer stuff?
[01:06:36] <Flurshy> java threads and crap
[01:06:41] <RandomNinja> ...ish
[01:06:45] <RandomNinja> oh not that
[01:07:32] <Sombra> You mean, software side
[01:07:38] <Flurshy> yes
[01:08:06] <Sombra> .No
[01:08:22] <RandomNinja> .nerd
[01:08:37] <Flurshy> I'm trying to get a shader mod to work in minecraft. I can run GLSL shaders mod with no shaderpack just fine, but if I tell it to use the shaderpack I'm trying to use and then load the game it crashes with "exception access violation"
[01:08:46] <StrykerVylon> .RandomNinjaisanerd
[01:08:53] <Flurshy> along with a huge pile of compiling errors
[01:10:12] <Flurshy> Ninja that's why I said nitty gritty
[01:10:26] <RandomNinja> :P
[01:10:38] <Flurshy> the stuff under the normal everyday code
[01:12:27] <RandomNinja> are you using Forge?
[01:13:28] <PinkieShy> !t Flurshy
[01:13:30] <DinkyBot> tapes RandomNinja to Flurshy and ToothBrush
[01:13:34] <Flurshy> been trying with and without Forge
[01:13:35] * RandomNinja flibbles
[01:14:47] <RandomNinja> you did put the shader in the right place?
[01:15:04] * Flurshy nods
[01:15:25] <Flurshy> I'm thinking it's the graphics card being incompatible, though supposedly there are fixes I can't find them
[01:15:29] <RandomNinja> correct game version for all mods?
[01:15:42] <Flurshy> mhm, all mods are set for 1.8
[01:15:49] <RandomNinja> didn't you have a new card?
[01:16:02] <Flurshy> I'm on integrated graphics. Intel HD 4600
[01:16:06] * StrykerVylon turns RandomNinja into a card
[01:16:09] <RandomNinja> that might be why
[01:16:13] <Sombra> Poor bae.
[01:16:16] <Flurshy> which... someone has a vid on youtube of it working, just at a low framerate
[01:17:33] <Flurshy> that's why I was trying to make it work
[01:17:36] <RandomNinja> HD4600 should have enough shader support
[01:17:48] <RandomNinja> memory?
[01:17:50] <Flurshy> it comes up with a ton of errors besides the exception
[01:17:54] <Flurshy> compile errors
[01:18:18] <Flurshy> "const such and such cannot have descriptor such and such"
[01:18:34] <Flurshy> which does suggest card incompatibility, but again, someone's done it
[01:18:42] <RandomNinja> tried different shaders?

[01:19:28] <Flurshy> sildur's comes up with only four compile errors but still throws the exception

[06:11:59] <MikeM> How is it that some musicians attract many followers, while others do not? It's not just a pony thing.
[06:15:10] <Snapai> Some of it is crowd randomness, some of it is certain people (not necessarily the musician) are REALLY good.
[06:15:44] <Snapai> As in, a good publicist (informal or formal) can really change the crowd dynamics.
[06:16:05] <Araxnus> MikeM: Again. I ask my self all the try. That is why I try to get their names out there as much as I can :)

[06:16:30] <Snapai> I've seen people start out here and suddenly become really popular tho' so *shrug*
[06:17:17] <Snapai> Sometimes I think it has to do with how much they dedicate themselves to making stuff or otherwise taking action. Which is a really subtle distinction that's hard to discuss
[06:17:58] <Snapai> Like, not how much they Serious Musician at it, but how often they fall into accomplishing things.
[06:18:05] <MikeM> Maybe it's two separate things: being good at craft, and being good at sales/promotion.

[16:46:34] <Trildar> Ethical issues...?
[16:46:40] <Cloud_Zephyr> exactly
[16:47:03] <RandomNinja> because it's used in salt and stuff?
[16:47:57] <Cloud_Zephyr> i just wrote some people might not like the chemicals
[16:48:04] <Cloud_Zephyr> u know like anti vaxxers
[16:48:35] <RandomNinja> a quick look on wikipedia tells me that iodine is mildly carceogenic

[16:49:33] <Trildar> My high school chemistry mentioned something about the toxicity of iodine I think :P
[16:49:35] <RandomNinja> it's kinda like asbestos

[16:53:21] <SilentHoofsteps> hey
[16:53:39] <RandomNinja> like I said, really great material, except for the health issues

[16:53:59] * Trildar attaches bells to SilentHoofsteps' hooves
[16:54:29] <RandomNinja> FN, probably because asbestos dust can cause a bunch of lung damage

[16:55:02] <FN> Welp RandomNinja in a burning building asbestos dust are the least of your worries
[16:55:39] <RandomNinja> yeah but other kinds of damage can release it
[16:56:23] <RandomNinja> I do agree blanket banning all of it might be a bit extreme though
[16:56:37] <FN> There is no reason to not have asbestos lining in firefighter uniform, with a good seal inside the layers, nopony ever breathe it in

[16:57:19] <FN> Alternatives to it, are very very expensive
[16:57:32] <FN> And often heavier
[16:57:59] <RandomNinja> I'm guessing a decent amount of material science is looking for an alternative to asbestos
[16:58:58] <FN> Just FYI glass wool is just as carcinogenic in exact same circumstances: aka as an insulation inside the house
[16:59:05] <RandomNinja> interesting
[16:59:08] <FN> But nopony bans it across the board
[16:59:39] <FN> In fact it is widely used as an industrial insulator of all kinds of apparatii, pipes and buldings

[16:59:56] <FN> No

[17:04:15] <RandomNinja> no seriously, I had harder exams than this in middle school without multiple choices
[17:04:42] <FN> Only other wool that can do the same is the the basalt fiber wool, but this mineral wool is way more expensive than glass wool
