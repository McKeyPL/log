[05:09:51] <RedHelper> How do make someone a second owner?
[05:10:34] <Colgate> /chanserv flags #channel otherperson +*F, note that this really does give them full power over the channel, including the ability to remove your owner status
[05:10:52] <RedHelper> thank you Colgate

[05:50:56] <RedHelper> How can I get user to a new channel from an old channel?
[05:51:01] <RedHelper> users*
[05:51:06] <Dusk> You can invite them
[05:51:33] <RedHelper> But what if I have a whole list of users.
[05:52:01] <AppleDash> Then you invite the whole list of users
[05:52:12] <Dusk> Yep
[05:52:27] <RedHelper> You guys are not helping at all.
