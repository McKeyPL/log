[00:03:28] <Algido> That's unfortunate she is entirely monogamous, but I imagine I would count myself lucky if I had a SO for 3 years and was still happy

[00:06:27] <Algido> My best friend takes his girlfriend for granted. She is hot as fuck, works at least 40 hours a week, is always the one paying me (not for my sexual serviceslol), so many things he like... EXPECTS or something. I try to talk to him about it
[00:07:21] <Algido> He never seems to take me seriously. He agrees with everything I say regarding the matter but it seems like it's going through 1 ear and out the other. He is far from faithful...
[00:07:32] <Algido> And she is a freakin angel.
[00:07:56] <samonuh> Well, nothing more you can really do I suppose. Hopefully one of them has a realization
[00:10:04] <Algido> I wouldn't mind having a threesome with them.
[00:10:22] <Algido> She is such a hot little Mexican chick.
[00:11:02] <samonuh> I hope one day I can convince my girlfriend to do a threesome. Maybe once she's bored of me, haha

[14:25:21] <thaostra> Normally I cook them in oil and season with salt and pepper, but that wasn't the case here
[14:26:06] <Melon_Phone> I whip in a little sour cream and a pinch of salt and pepper at the end
[14:26:34] <thaostra> For me, The sour cream goes into the eggs
[14:26:47] <thaostra> Cools them down to keep them from overcooking
[14:26:56] <Melon_Phone> yep
[14:27:08] <Melon_Phone> I do it in the pot
[14:27:58] <Melon_Phone> searing both the toast and tomatoes in a pan with some rock salt

[14:30:54] <thaostra> I also grow chives that are ready to be cut, and they go nicely in the eggs

[20:53:43] <cloppyhooves> I might have to email the professor and say I can't go, but I dunno if they'd make me do a make-up assignment D:
[20:53:49] <cloppyhooves> The last thing I need right now is more work
[20:54:03] <cloppyhooves> But i'm already gonna be pretty late if I go, perhaps enough that she'd get mad anyway
[20:57:15] <cloppyhooves> I'll just email the professor since there's no way I can get there without being late, and she already threatened absences to those who show up late
[20:57:56] <cloppyhooves> The professor last quarter forgave me, so hopefully she will too D:
[20:58:03] <cloppyhooves> On the plus side, I guess I can keep packing

[21:45:57] <Vulpixbrew> all the bits?
[21:46:09] <Vulpixbrew> in all reality just a couple of bits
[21:47:55] <thaostra> Depends if they're arm hugs, mouth hugs, or vagoo hugs
[21:49:00] <cloppyhooves> She's chill with anything
[21:49:47] <thaostra> 500 bits should make for a busy weekend
