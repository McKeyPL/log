[00:34:09] <Kiyiko> I hope the JEDEC revises their standards soon :C
[00:34:23] <Kiyiko> in their current ones, they even recognize it as technically incorrect >_<)
[00:34:27] <mniip> as already pointed out by Phase4, linux the kernel uses bytes
[00:34:42] <mniip> in rare occasions blocks of known size
[00:34:48] <Kiyiko> Mannn
[00:34:50] <Kiyiko> idkkk
[00:34:56] <Kiyiko> I'll tell you what I do know
[00:34:58] <Phase4> iirc stat() gives you file size in bytes, and disk space in a multiple of the block size
[00:34:59] <mniip> like 4096 byte pages, or 512 byte logical disk blocks
[00:35:10] <Kiyiko> SI, IEC, IEEE, ISO, NIST... they all say the same thing
[00:35:20] <Kiyiko> and windows does it wrong
[00:35:23] <mniip> what are you  trying to do even
[00:35:24] <Phase4> the latter being an annoying descision cause it buggers disk space usage reporting on btrfs
[00:35:37] <mniip> Phase4, oh?
[00:38:46] <Phase4> mniip, things like symlinks are sometimes stored in the metadata block instead of their own sector, so du will tell you it's consuming a block when in reality it's a handful of bytes
[00:40:41] <Kiyiko> My guitar amp is better than all your guitar amps :D
[00:48:29] <Starthunder> So I have my laptop booted from a livecd, and I'm trying to fix my /boot partition
[00:48:59] <Starthunder> I figured I'd chroot into the installed system, log in, and see if apt-get would notice that the linux packages are broken and offer to fix them
[00:49:42] <Starthunder> The live system is connected to the Internet over Wi-Fi, but when I chroot, it complains it can't—
[00:49:50] <Starthunder> …oh, that's odd, I can ping 8.8.8.8. Hmmm.
[00:51:07] <mniip> Starthunder, did you mount /proc /sys
[00:51:09] <mniip> /dev
[00:51:27] <Starthunder> …no, I did not. Should I have `mount --bind`ed them from the live system?
[00:51:34] <mniip> no
[00:51:35] <Starthunder> All three?
[00:51:52] <mniip> mount -t proc proc /chroot/proc
[00:52:11] <mniip> for sys you have sysfs
[00:52:37] <mniip> I mean
[00:52:44] <mniip> mount -f sysfs sys /chroot/sys
[00:52:47] <mniip> and finally
[00:52:53] <mniip> mount -f devtmpfs dev /chroot/dev
[00:53:41] <Starthunder> -f or -t in those last two? -f is --fake in this copy of `mount`.
[00:53:56] <mniip> oops
[00:53:57] <mniip> -t
[00:53:59] <Littlepip> Quick question... does there already exist a script that allows you to run an application in a chroot jail? Like, it'd make the chroot folder, then copy the application and all libraries it needs to function, plus anything like /etc/hosts and stuff that (most) everything needs. Also perhaps generate a script to enter the chroot.
[00:54:38] <Starthunder> Thanks, mniip

[01:12:18] <Starthunder> Uhhhh…
[01:12:56] <Starthunder> So, within the chroot, `mount` says that /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 are mounted on /boot and /boot/efi
[01:12:58] <Starthunder> Which seems normal
[01:13:09] <Littlepip> OK?
[01:13:18] <Starthunder> But `blkid` says that /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 are from the livedisk.
[01:13:48] <Starthunder> And `mount` and `blkid` from within the live system confirms this
[01:14:17] <Starthunder> I need to reinstall grub, but I have no idea if I should tell it sda or sdb.

[01:25:31] <Starthunder> Meh, whatever. I have an image of the livedisk on my other laptop.
[01:25:41] <Starthunder> If it overwrites the disk, I can just reimage it.
[01:25:48] <johnsey> if in doubt, fdisk -l and smartctl -i are good to figure out what device you're looking at
[01:26:11] <johnsey> or just take a look at dmesg
[01:26:14] <Starthunder> …duh.
[01:26:15] <Starthunder> Thanks, johnsey.
[01:26:46] <mniip> johnsey, stuff is confusing because chroots
[01:27:33] <Starthunder> Yeah, I am /really/ confused.
[01:27:51] *** Joins: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net)
[01:27:55] <johnsey> that may be, but /dev/sda tends to be /dev/sda inside and outside the chroot
[01:28:08] <mniip> oh right
[01:28:17] <mniip> but
[01:28:26] <mniip> the installed system has a different devtmpfs than the chroot
[01:29:00] <mniip> so what is /dev/sda1 in the system is /dev/sdb1 in the liveusb devtmpfs
[01:29:02] <johnsey> mount -o bind /dev /chroot/dev; [..etc..] chroot /chroot [etc]
[01:29:06] <mniip> and so is /dev/sdb1 in the chroot
[01:29:10] <johnsey> or rbind if you want
[01:29:24] <johnsey> not that it should make a difference i suppose
[01:29:36] <mniip> johnsey, devtmpfs is already mounted in the chroot
[01:29:51] <mniip> but the chroot's devtmpfs is different from *that of the installed system*
[01:31:21] <johnsey> that shouldn't matter much for installing grub..?
[01:31:31] <mniip> grub?
[01:31:33] <johnsey> or maybe i missed something while skimming over the discussion

[01:31:50] <mniip> ah right
