[01:45:50] <Pony_387_0> sticking your crotch in front of a space heater is a very satisfying feeling
[01:46:15] <Drago> I finally found out that my best friend for my whole life is not 100% straight. So crazy. I mean he told me o_O
[01:46:26] <Vulpixbrew> damn
[01:47:00] <Pony_387_0> sounds like a fun discovery
[01:47:32] <weisey> go fuck him :3
[01:48:08] <Drago> I started telling him stuff over the last few months and he is opening up too now.
[01:48:22] <Pony_387_0> that's awesome
[01:48:35] <Drago> I don't want to fuck him though... I don't think.
[01:49:00] <Drago> Because he is such a friend. And I don't know, but I don;t think he is prepared to be fucked,
[01:49:27] <Pony_387_0> you don't have to fuck your best friend just cause he's coming out
[01:49:37] <Drago> I would suck his cock in a heartbeat though. He has a nice cock
[01:50:10] <Pony_387_0> what about cuddles?
[01:50:36] <Drago> No...
[01:50:42] <Drago> Well maybe...
[01:50:57] <Drago> I dunno. It's so new to me, I can;t think
[01:51:11] <Pony_387_0> understandable
[01:52:19] <Drago> He has an absolutely beatiful mexican girlfriend. And to my knowledge he has never done anything with a guy besides double teaming a client.
[01:52:28] <Drago> beautiful*
[01:53:00] <Pony_387_0> well you know they do say that team work makes the dream work
[01:54:54] <Drago> Heh. That would be crazy. I mean, we have been around each other since birth and have been best friends for 26 years and counting.

[05:56:39] <Quinn> so im gonna give a footjob here in a few min
[05:56:48] <Quinn> anyone with relevant experience willing to give some advice?
[05:57:05] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> yes
[05:57:12] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> I've given some footjobs
[05:57:38] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> the most important thing to remember is that it's probably going to feel a little awkward
[05:58:05] <samonuh> I've received a footjob once for like...10 seconds
[05:58:06] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> and you probably won't be able to keep a proper rythm because feet don't have good grip
[05:58:11] <samonuh> Until she gave up
[05:58:12] <samonuh> lol
[05:58:17] <Quinn> its fine it'll probably be comical
[05:58:34] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> the point of a footjob is the feet tho so don't worry
[05:58:44] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> just like play with it
[05:58:50] <samonuh> Kick it
[05:59:09] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> no
[05:59:16] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> pls no
[05:59:20] <samonuh> Yes

[06:45:22] <plushie_pegasus> Even tho I don't like humans, I might yiff a human female wearing that
[06:46:40] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> there was a hose on on the side of my neighbor so I turned it off
[06:47:02] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> from the splish splash sound I was making when walking through it seemed like it was on for awhile
[06:47:15] <samonuh> Maybe they wanted it on
[06:47:41] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> well it was just the hose bib there was no hose attatched to it
[06:48:06] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> also there were some college kids giggling and stuff a couple drive ways away
[06:48:23] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> the inference I made was that they had turned it on and left it on
[06:48:29] <samonuh> Damn college kids
[06:48:49] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> also randomly in the middle of the street was a bag of diapers
[06:49:02] <samonuh> wat
[06:49:19] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> so I went back home got some gloves on and threw it away in the neighborhood trash that was less than a block away
[06:49:39] <samonuh> You're one good Samaritan
[06:50:12] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> then I did some shado puppetry with the lights that are always on at the elementary school that's like right at the end of my streets entrance
[06:50:49] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> then I poured some water on this worm because I was going to sit down by a fire hydrant and 
[06:50:58] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> I saw it there on the thing
[06:50:59] <samonuh> Your night walks sound fun
[06:51:39] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> well theres also some construction going on near my place so I climbed up this mountain of dirt
[06:51:44] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> that was pretty fun as well
[06:51:50] <samonuh> I love doing that stuf

[06:53:09] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> step 1 go outside at night step 2 find an area where people aren't at step 3 have fun by just going around and following wherever your instinct or curiosity takes you
[06:53:13] <samonuh> I do it a lot in the summer
[06:55:09] <plushie_pegasus> At my old job, sometimes i would walk home at night. there was a church on the way home, i would step into the parking lot and yell "SANCTUARY" LOL

[08:21:16] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> were they a guy?

[08:23:32] <Vulpixbrew> https://i.imgur.com/tjIgMGw.png
[08:23:41] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> never heard of someone pushing their nudes on people
[08:23:58] <Pony387_sleeptroubles> usually it's the opposite where people are very protective of their nudes
[08:24:04] <iamalion> i dont think you were here at the same time as them
