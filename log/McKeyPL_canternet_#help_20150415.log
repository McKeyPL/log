[21:58:22] <BOSS> op
[21:59:01] <Dusk> Ask your question

[22:06:13] <BOSS> op
[22:06:13] <Twili> Ponies say op is power and respect,
[22:06:37] <BOSS> op
[22:06:37] <BOSS> op
[22:06:43] <Unixkitty> That is spam.
[22:07:01] <wolfyshy> you are seriously hurting your chances of getting any actual op to assist you

[23:28:33] <Ashley> is !roulette broken?
[23:28:56] <AppleDash> Why would you ask that?
[23:29:08] <Ashley> it doesn't seem to be working
[23:29:15] <AppleDash> Explain?
[23:29:24] <Ashley> >.>
[23:29:33] <Ashley> exactly what it seems
[23:29:38] <Ashley> I type the command and it does not work
[23:29:40] <AppleDash> It could mean multiple things
[23:30:19] <AppleDash> Fantasy needs to be enabled in the channel, which needs to be registerd.
[23:30:23] <AppleDash> GameServ may also need to be on
[23:30:25] <AppleDash> registered*
[23:30:49] <Ashley> other gameserv commands work
[23:31:46] <AppleDash> Works fine for me.
[23:33:06] <Fluttershi> perhaps it got censored in whatever channel you're trying to do it in?
[23:33:24] <Fluttershi> people can get pretty spammy with it, it annoys some others
[23:33:35] <Ashley> that's possible, I'll check my g list
