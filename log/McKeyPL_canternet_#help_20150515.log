[17:40:24] <Shutter> Well that's ironic.
[17:45:15] <Fluttershi> invite frog into whatever chan and it might work?
[17:45:42] <Fluttershi> it said they weren't in the chan for me, rather then them not being online
[17:46:00] <Shutter> ^ Obviously they have to be on the channel you're trying to protect them on, too ...
