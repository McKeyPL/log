[00:04:44] <cyborg_ar> well my biggest gripe is flags
[00:05:03] <cyborg_ar> it would be so nice if the flags were part of the result
[00:05:11] <cyborg_ar> so you could use conditionals on them
[00:05:31] <cyborg_ar> or just use operations that eat them as a side effect
[00:05:37] <cyborg_ar> like rotate through carry

[04:18:58] <firestream> was about time it been going from SE1 xD
[04:19:00] <firestream> and died last night
[04:28:06] <Fallfeathers> fuuuucking hate microsoft. "how do I set up office365 on this ipad" "UH IDK GONNA HAVE TO ESCALATE THIS TO A SPECIALIST"
[04:29:31] <Fallfeathers> bro

[04:30:06] <cyborg_ar> :)
[04:30:22] <Fallfeathers> p much
[04:30:47] <cyborg_ar> :)
[04:45:01] <Starthunder> It's not as simple as getting the app?
[04:45:19] <Starthunder> Maybe logging into a related account within the app or within the OS settings?
[04:54:08] <Phase4> Starthunder, won't know until they ask the specialist
[04:54:50] <Starthunder> Phase4: presumably Fallfeathers actually tried to set it up before calling them.
[04:55:01] <Starthunder> If they did, they would know whether it were that simple.

[05:01:29] <Fallfeathers> Starburn: basically: i install the outlook app, go through the acct setup process, enter the correct info... and the result is "cannot verify info"
[05:01:42] <Fallfeathers> I looked it up. seems to be a fairly common issue.
[05:01:51] * Starburn blinks in confusion at Fallfeathers
[05:01:56] <Fallfeathers> but the fix is something I can't do because of our client's subscription
[05:02:02] <Fallfeathers> er, Starthunder
[05:02:03] <Fallfeathers> whoops
[05:02:04] <Fallfeathers> :B
[05:02:12] <Fallfeathers> so yeah, I needed to bug microshit
[05:02:18] <Fallfeathers> this is what I do for a livin
[05:02:24] <Starburn> :F
[05:02:36] <Starthunder> :J
[05:03:34] <Fallfeathers> the fix apparently has something to do with MS's two-factor authentication
[05:03:54] <Fallfeathers> but I can't disable it because it's only something you can configure on personal 365 accounts, but for business accounts it's always on
