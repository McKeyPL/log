[23:53:24] <RazorSharpFang> Hi everypony. I'm experiencing issues with the Windows SendInput function.
[23:53:57] <RazorSharpFang> It's working correctly for notepad, and most applications, but not this one, which is the one I want to send it to.
[23:54:15] <RazorSharpFang> The particular application it's not working on is TESIV: Oblivion.
[23:55:06] <RazorSharpFang> I am working in C++, on windows.
[23:55:17] <RazorSharpFang> And this is confounding me to no limits.
[23:55:24] <Phase4> my guess is SendInput sends window manager events
[23:55:50] <Phase4> oblivion is probably using direct input
[23:56:25] <RazorSharpFang> So, I'd have to use a different approach then, eh?
[23:56:32] <RazorSharpFang> That's very troublesome.
[23:57:09] <cyborg_ar> maybe you can intercept dinput calls
