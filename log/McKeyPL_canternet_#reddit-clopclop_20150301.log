[01:56:13] <thaostra> I presume you used 2.7 before porting to 3.4, which probably introduced some encoding issues

[01:57:03] <eytosh> could be, though most of the other issues that cropped up were odd one-off things, and surprisingly not encoding issues
[01:59:04] <thaostra> It's funny how I've had to leveraged Python's dynamic typing so that I could write code that's compatible with both 2.7 and 3.x
[01:59:17] <thaostra> * to leverage
[01:59:38] <eytosh> I despise working with encoding
[02:01:33] <thaostra> I can't say I've found it to be a problem, although I focus on 3.x whose most touted feature is improved unicode support

[02:06:21] <samonuh> :(
[02:06:35] <thaostra> 3.x has a lot of nice features. Just recently I discovered that they slipped in a statistics module for calculating some things that required numpy before

[06:17:55] <plushie_pegasus> Back when i was in the navy, i was in top physical shape, a slim 160lbs, could do 20 pushups without breaking a sweat
[06:18:06] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah?
[06:18:15] <plushie_pegasus> Now i get winded climbing stairs LOL
[06:18:19] <OmarianVolcae> Nothing wrong with softening up a little.
[06:18:32] <OmarianVolcae> I'm in pretty good physical shape.
[06:18:42] <OmarianVolcae> Have to be to stand in front of a platoon and expect them to respect you.
[06:19:09] <Melon_Guy> platoon sounds funny
[06:19:22] <OmarianVolcae> But I'm not one of those people that explicity enjoys working out all the time.
[06:19:22] <plushie_pegasus> Me too For my age, but mentaly not so much XD
[06:19:40] <OmarianVolcae> I predict that when i get out, I'll decline a bit.
[06:20:07] <Melon_Guy> back when i was a competitive swimmer i was in awesome shape
[06:20:15] <OmarianVolcae> Swimming will do that.
[06:20:28] <OmarianVolcae> I had to really shift my fitness ideology when I got in the army.
[06:20:57] <Melon_Guy> quit a year ago because bullying and softened up a little since
[06:20:59] <OmarianVolcae> I used to be a track runner.
[06:21:17] <OmarianVolcae> The army doesn't respect fast.
[06:21:25] <OmarianVolcae> It respects *GRUNT* strong.
[06:21:33] <OmarianVolcae> STRONK!~
[06:21:39] <Melon_Guy> i see
[06:21:45] <OmarianVolcae> So I had to gain a lot of weight
[06:22:11] <Melon_Guy> that's what im aiming for, stronger build, less streamlined
[06:22:30] <OmarianVolcae> I'm going for in between.
[06:22:35] <Melon_Guy> by no means a pro weightlifter kinda goal
[06:22:53] <OmarianVolcae> There are lots of guys in the army who are super strong and muscular
[06:22:55] <Melon_Guy> i wanna fill the sleeves of my tshirts
[06:22:58] <OmarianVolcae> but they dont' run very well.
[06:23:05] <OmarianVolcae> Or climb.
[06:23:16] <OmarianVolcae> Or do anything athletic beyond pick things up and put them down.
[06:23:29] <RubyPinch> how heavy is all the gear that one would need on themself?
[06:23:36] <OmarianVolcae> Hrm.
[06:23:45] <Quinn> I've read that a lot of military life is just picking stuff up and moving it somewhere else
[06:23:47] <Quinn> probably more useful
[06:23:49] <OmarianVolcae> Full combat load is around 90lbs.
[06:23:55] <OmarianVolcae> Rather
[06:23:57] <OmarianVolcae> Patrol load.
[06:24:05] <Quinn> also they probably do more lifting than climbing anyway
[06:24:08] <OmarianVolcae> Combat load is about 45lbs
[06:24:21] *** Quits: weisey (sideways@silly.little.foxy.kit) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[06:24:27] <OmarianVolcae> But keep in mind, you're running around with that, not just picking it up.
[06:24:36] <Nikashi> OmarianVolcae: Check the highlight/video?
[06:25:04] <OmarianVolcae> I watched it. :3
[06:25:12] <Nikashi> Nice random luck huh
[06:25:17] <OmarianVolcae> Cutting the tail off it nice because it takes out an annoying attack.
[06:25:27] <OmarianVolcae> You need to practice fighting without lockons.
[06:25:38] <Nikashi> for that fight it was more to make sure I was facing the bad stuff
[06:25:48] <RubyPinch> okay so that is like being strapped with 41 L of water
[06:25:49] <OmarianVolcae> Locking on is good in some cases, but is usually a bad idea for most bosses.
[06:26:02] <RubyPinch> I think I can understand this conversion I made
[06:26:48] <OmarianVolcae> Fortunately, that weight is pretty well distributed.
[06:27:12] <RubyPinch> mm
[06:27:26] <OmarianVolcae> A lot of it is on a load bearing vest.
[06:27:32] <OmarianVolcae> Which distributes it over your shoulders.
[06:28:15] <OmarianVolcae> The second half of the 90lbs is usually in a big backpack we call a Ruck Sack.
[06:28:34] <RubyPinch> mm

[07:24:37] <OmarianVolcae> Hmm, well I'd say it never hurts to stream.
[07:24:42] <Evelina> I advertise my stream and the most I've ever gotten was 2
[07:24:44] <Cantaloupe> I just turn on my stream and link it, people join if they want to join

[07:25:23] <RubyPinch> I got like 3, and one of those was a random complaining about the stream not being as advertised :3

[07:28:29] <OmarianVolcae> For some reason only the SUPER HUGE streams work.
[07:28:29] <Evelina> I do't sub to anything

[08:40:05] <OmarianVolcae> Didn't taste like much of anything to me.
[08:40:10] * OmarianVolcae shrugs.
[08:40:20] <butter> ^
[08:40:35] <OmarianVolcae> But I have an issue.
[08:40:39] <OmarianVolcae> I was sitting in my chair.
[08:40:48] <OmarianVolcae> I had decided I was going to make a mess of myself
[08:40:53] <OmarianVolcae> Because I think it's fun.
[08:41:02] <OmarianVolcae> Anyway, I was sitting there, aiming slightly back.
[08:41:10] <OmarianVolcae> Well, the first shot went right over my shoulder.
[08:41:14] <OmarianVolcae> and I can't find it...
[08:41:41] <cloppyhooves> D:
[08:41:48] <cloppyhooves> Also, that's very impressive

[20:25:37] <Giggles> How's tricks?
[20:26:01] <Trail_Blaze_up_2_RP> hi Giggles 
[20:26:06] <Frosty> I hate that all the gym leaders have a super move that just wrecks your shit in one hit.
[20:26:40] <Trail_Blaze_up_2_RP> i know
[20:27:10] <Trail_Blaze_up_2_RP> what starter you take
[20:27:26] <Frosty> Torchic
[20:27:32] <Drago> I should go buy a pokemon game
[20:27:40] <Frosty> There. Beat Flannery
[20:27:47] <Drago> I keep saying that... Havent played since like "97
[20:28:19] <Drago> What is the difference between alpha saphire and omega ruby?
[20:28:26] <Drago> I know they are remakes but...
[20:28:30] <Drago> Different pokemon?
[20:28:46] <Giggles> A few different pokemon
[20:28:58] <Drago> Because I had the original Red and Blue and they were identicle in game play
[20:29:02] <Giggles> and some of the storyline is a little different
[20:29:31] <Giggles> That's not true
[20:29:42] <Drago> anyone favor one over the other?
[20:29:43] <Giggles> Red and Blue aren't identical either
[20:29:53] <Drago> Well, the had diff pokemon
[20:30:18] <Giggles> Yeah, that's pretty much the only thing that's ever different.
[20:30:49] <Drago> Well, IMO Red and Blue were the same game but with diff pokemon. So was Yello except you started with pikachu IIRC
[20:30:49] <iam[a]lion> jesus dude
[20:30:55] <iam[a]lion> your kid is screaming LOUDLY 5 feet from the phone
[20:30:58] <iam[a]lion> tell him to shut the fuck up
[20:31:13] <Drago> uhh
[20:31:25] <Giggles> Yeah, all pokemon games are like that.
[20:31:54] <Giggles> Each generation has two/three games which are exactly the same except for catchable pokemon.
[20:32:03] <Drago> Does anyone have a preference between omega ruby and alpha saphire? I'm about to go get it right now
[20:32:36] <Giggles> I think primal Kyogre is better than Primal Groudon so there's that.
[20:32:59] <Giggles> but in Ruby you can get Mawile, the hottest pokemon
[20:33:04] <Drago> What does that mean? One has Kyogre and one has groudon?
[20:33:16] <Vulpixbrew> Herores of the swarm=Moba+Blizzard characters
[20:33:23] <Trail_Blaze_up_2_RP> yup
[20:33:34] <Giggles> Ruby has groudon
[20:33:37] <Drago> Swarm? Huh, I thought they had a diff name for that
[20:35:39] <Drago> I can't believe I am entertaining the thought of playing pokemon again after 15+ years :P I hope to get a fat nostalgia fix :)
[20:36:29] <Drago> What's it up to now? ~650 pokemons?
[20:36:31] <Trail_Blaze_up_2_RP> you should
[20:36:41] <Trail_Blaze_up_2_RP> 718 i think
[20:36:47] <Drago> gee whiz
[20:36:52] <RubyPinch> Heroes of the Storm, Heart of the Swarm
[20:36:58] <Trail_Blaze_up_2_RP> and 18 types
[20:37:11] <Drago> Storm, that's it. Thanks RubyPinch 
[20:37:18] <Drago> 18 types holy shit
[20:37:39] <Giggles> Ugh, Fairy type is so stupid
[20:37:57] <Drago> lmao.... fairy is a type? that's silly :P

[20:39:32] <cloppyhooves> Fair enough c:
[20:39:34] <Drago> I see a dark type. Is there a light type?
[20:39:42] <Giggles> Nope

[20:39:49] <Drago> evil
[20:40:09] <Drago> I wanna make a light character and be divine
[20:40:37] <Frosty> I see a steel type. Is there also an Aluminum type? A Titanium type? Maganeese? Gold?
[20:40:58] <Frosty> And what type of steel? Mild? Stainless?
[20:41:03] <Drago> Whoa steel type... huh, one would think they would just go with metal?
[20:41:30] <Drago> What is a pokemon who's clase is normal?
[20:41:38] <Drago> class*

[21:10:08] <Michael> just looking for some lovely clop
[21:10:39] <Cantaloupe> I'mma make an omelette
[21:11:05] <thaostra> Cantaloupe, What method are you using?
[21:12:56] <Cantaloupe> frying then oven? 
[21:13:24] <Cantaloupe> I'm just making an omelette, not a piece of art 
[21:14:39] <thaostra> I mean, what steps do you take to make one? I like to crack the eggs in a bowl, season with salt and pepper, whisk with a fork, then pour them into a pan that's lined with butter and a bit of oil
[21:15:11] <Cantaloupe> that's what I do too
[21:15:29] <Cantaloupe> I was gonna experiment with a little cream into the batter
[21:15:48] <Cantaloupe> I usually put a tbsp of water
[21:16:06] <thaostra> I don't recommend it because it makes the eggs too milky/watery
[21:16:30] <thaostra> I don't add anything dairy-based until after the eggs are at least partially cooked
[21:17:04] <Cantaloupe> I sea
[21:17:16] <Giggles> Nah I add milk before hand
[21:17:16] <thaostra> I'll actually use sour cream instead because it cools the eggs and doesn't make it too soupy
[21:17:29] <Michael> I cant eat eggs, too eggy
[21:17:42] <Giggles> Well they're repulsive, yes
[21:18:00] <Cantaloupe> I top it with mozzarella and a little old Amsterdam because OA rocks
[21:18:13] <thaostra> Michael, Probably because the eggs you've had are overcooked like how most people do it
[21:18:18] <Cantaloupe> anyway off to cook
[21:18:31] <Giggles> No it's actually because taste foul
[21:18:34] <Cantaloupe> Michael got rektangled

[21:18:56] <thaostra> Urge to slap, rising
[21:21:06] <thaostra> But seriously, eggs take on a completely different taste and texture when they're cooked just right, as opposed to those chunky and dry eggs that need to be drizzled with ketchup or whatever to be edible
[21:21:23] <Michael> I like egg drop soup, but eggs I have tried, the texture and taste don't suit me
[21:21:28] <Giggles> Yeah, they taste like eggs. It's pretty bad.

[21:24:14] <Cantaloupe> cocktail sauce being ketchup x mayo for the confused
[21:25:06] <Giggles> Typically cocktail sauce has some spices in, usually horseradish

[21:45:38] <RubyPinch> cause neither is going to come out anyways
[21:46:01] <Cantaloupe> ^
[21:46:48] <Cantaloupe> and maybe I'm missing something but I found HL2 alright at best
[21:47:28] <RubyPinch> more realistic, as some guessed: who would want to work on any HL project at this point? whatever is made will disappoint
[21:47:44] <RubyPinch> and Cantaloupe did you play it on release?
[21:47:53] <Cantaloupe> nop
[21:48:08] <Cantaloupe> maybe it's because of that 
[21:48:20] <Cantaloupe> 2004 was a different era in iceland
[21:48:38] <RubyPinch> it was a good experience because of how new and fresh it was compared, iirc
[21:48:47] <RubyPinch> similar to HL1
[21:49:03] * Vulpixbrew is debating on playing some ME2
[21:50:29] <Cantaloupe> I wanna play mass effect 
[21:51:27] <Cantaloupe> omelette is ready!!
[21:51:40] <RubyPinch> play omelette
[21:51:40] <Cantaloupe> this one fluffy motherfucker

[21:53:45] <iamalion> you know
[21:53:49] <iamalion> i almost dont want hl3 to come out
[21:53:58] <iamalion> the waiting has kept the community together
[21:54:01] <iamalion> and the excitement
[21:54:02] <iamalion> if it comes out
[21:54:04] <iamalion> we play it
[21:54:06] <iamalion> then its over
[21:54:06] <iamalion> D:

[21:56:04] <Cantaloupe> thaostra's, I put a little cream in the batter and it's a lot fluffier and tighter than usual. not so very spongy I mean 
[21:56:10] <Cantaloupe> -'s 
[21:59:20] <Cantaloupe> maybe a little more salt
[21:59:31] <Cantaloupe> otherwise pretty good
[22:00:02] <thaostra> Nice
[22:01:08] <Cantaloupe> Aaand its all gone

[23:19:23] <Drago> The game repair store by my house has yu gi oh tables set up. I wish I had cards and new how to play
[23:19:33] <Drago> knew*
[23:29:44] <weisey> Drago, yugioh is actually pretty simple 
[23:30:04] <weisey> You could pretty easily learn in 10-20 minutes
[23:30:18] <Vulpixbrew> ewww yugioh
[23:30:28] <Vulpixbrew> I really dont like their business model
[23:33:19] <Vulpixbrew> the whole lets drop a new set of cards and ban all the cards from the last set just to boost sales
[23:33:30] <weisey> Its better than MTG
[23:33:53] <RubyPinch> o_o
[23:34:15] <weisey> Let's drop a new set of cards, then have like 3 rare ones in there that we arbutrarially price at like 30 bajillion dollars
[23:34:37] <weisey> And then those are legal in play 
[23:35:04] <weisey> And so over powered that you win every time you use it, so go ahead rich guy, enter all the tournaments you can, and get richer
[23:35:32] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[23:35:50] <Vulpixbrew> why i used to play minis
[23:36:11] <weisey> At least with yugioh, everyone starts on the same footing every season
[23:36:40] <weisey> New MTG players just get buttfucked if they don't spend a bajillion dollars on cards
[23:36:49] <weisey> Its really actually quite discouraging 
[23:38:26] <weisey> Not that it isn't a amazing game if you have the will and more importantly money to get good
[23:39:01] <weisey> Its just that its pretty pay to win 
[23:39:24] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[23:41:02] <weisey> It's especially shitty that they don't ban the old unbalanced cards
[23:41:19] <weisey> And the new versions get balanced
[23:41:46] <weisey> So good luck beating someone who built a library from cards from the early days
[23:42:42] <Vulpixbrew> mini gaming spend 10 zillion dollars on an army that doesnt come painted or assembled
