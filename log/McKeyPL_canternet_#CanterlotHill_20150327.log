[00:00:00] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja tis good for civil service, most office jobs, teaching
[00:00:06] <Eywind> LA doesn't do much either lol
[00:00:13] <RandomNinja> math and CS is best educations jobwise
[00:00:14] <Inucroft[NLR]> ... Hamtramck i feel you do not apeciate knowllege
[00:00:22] <Eywind> Inucroft[NLR] I feel you do not appreciate having money
[00:00:36] <Eywind> You know what you can buy with money?  Books!
[00:00:39] <RandomNinja> bachelor in math and masters in CS = 200 jobs when you step out the door after graduation
[00:00:41] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind lol, Tax payers funded my tution. Go socialism
[00:00:52] <Eywind> Umm
[00:00:56] <Eywind> That isn't a good job
[00:01:01] <wobniaR> Sweet how many jobs for bachelor's in CS?
[00:01:03] <Inucroft[NLR]> Teaching?
[00:01:06] <Eywind> Lol
[00:01:09] <RandomNinja> wobniaR still a decent amount
[00:01:21] <wobniaR> Woo my time and money investment is validated
[00:01:24] <RandomNinja> yus
[00:01:26] <Eywind> Inucroft[NLR] good luck with that
[00:01:39] *** Quits: SomeFrenchBrony (Antoine@Im.Frenchy.And.I.Know.It.fr) (Connection closed)
[00:01:48] <Inucroft[NLR]> well, it's money, and alot better than the us sytem from what i hear
[00:01:49] <wobniaR> I will wow my would-be employers with my special power of googling
[00:01:56] <Inucroft[NLR]> heh
[00:02:02] <Eywind> If you can get a teaching job in some liberal arts field, maybe
[00:02:04] <wobniaR> ./computerscience
[00:02:12] <RandomNinja> wobniaR took 2 years of advanced googling?
[00:02:18] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind oddly, there is a insane demand for teachers in the UK
[00:02:19] <Eywind> Over here at least you can only teach the little grades if you just get a bachelors
[00:02:31] <wobniaR> It pays off RandomNinja
[00:03:13] <Inucroft[NLR]> Here, you have to do either a 4yr teaching degree, a degree and a 1year teaching short course (specialist teachers) or career advancement fromteaching assistants
[00:03:31] <Eywind> Yeah but does that let you teach actually relevant teaching spots?
[00:03:34] <wobniaR> Teachers do a lot of work and get paid poop
[00:03:37] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind yes
[00:03:38] <Eywind> Can you teach high school/college/etc?
[00:03:39] <wobniaR> In comparison
[00:03:44] <Hamtramck> idk that year I spent doing gradschool stuff gave me a very poor view of academia :S
[00:03:47] <RandomNinja> there's a high demand for teachers because noone wants to become one
[00:03:52] <RandomNinja> finland is doing it right
[00:03:57] <Eywind> I certainly wouldn't want someone that's only gone for 4 years of college to teach me in college
[00:03:58] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind not at university. You require a master's and at least two published articles
[00:04:01] <Eywind> Exactly
[00:04:09] <Eywind> in HS or below you're not going to get paid very well
[00:04:21] <Hamtramck> Colleges don't really pay well either now
[00:04:26] <Eywind> As RandomNinja said, no one really wants to be a teacher
[00:04:28] <Hamtramck> They make you an adjunct professor
[00:04:28] <RandomNinja> college in UK = high school in US Eywind 
[00:04:30] <Inucroft[NLR]> Actualy, High school teachers are paid the best in manditory edu here
[00:04:36] <Hamtramck> and you like, do the same work but it's basically just not paid much
[00:04:42] <Eywind> Lol RandomNinja that's even worse
[00:04:46] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja no, UK college is senior High School
[00:04:52] <Inucroft[NLR]> ;)
[00:04:55] <Eywind> 'senior high' doesn't exist
[00:04:58] <RandomNinja> stop having confusing systems!
[00:05:12] <RandomNinja> darn brits
[00:05:35] <Hamtramck> Grad school killed my interest in linguistics. Yeeey.
[00:05:40] <Inucroft[NLR]> Primary school (5-11yrs), Secondary/High school (11-16yrs), College/6th Form (16yrs-18yrs), University (18yrs+)
[00:06:33] <Eywind> that is stupid
[00:06:48] <One-Trick> schooooooooooooool
[00:06:49] <Hamtramck> also fwiw I did graduate from college magna cum laude so my distaste for it isn't the result of me being a slacker who got upset over having to do work or anything :V
[00:06:49] <Inucroft[NLR]> nar, first two are manditory, second two are academic routws
[00:06:57] <SkyHigh> Inucroft[NLR]: that whats there is right. But explain: [23:03] (Inucroft[NLR]) RandomNinja no, UK college is senior High School
[00:06:57] <Eywind> Inucroft[NLR] the names are stupid
[00:07:05] <SkyHigh> Hey!
[00:07:07] <Eywind> "Senior High" doesn't exist lol
[00:07:12] <RandomNinja> Elementary grade 1-9, gymnasieskola grade 10-12, university
[00:07:22] <RandomNinja> simple 3 tier system
[00:07:29] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind cause the way the education system was devekoped in the UK
[00:07:36] <RandomNinja> hai One-Trick 
[00:07:41] <Hamtramck> Man I hope those games I ordered get here soon so I can stop worrying about them getting lost in the mail
[00:07:42] <Eywind> Inucroft[NLR] yes your UK systems are stupid
[00:07:47] <Inucroft[NLR]> Primary schools were manditoy, then you went oto secondary school if you were rich or got a grant
[00:07:47] <Hamtramck> This is why I hateimporting stuff :(((
[00:07:51] <RandomNinja> >ordering games
[00:07:55] <RandomNinja> do you even steam
[00:07:59] <SkyHigh> Bro
[00:08:03] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hamtramck you hate CH? *cries*
[00:08:09] <Hamtramck> ... CH?
[00:08:16] <Inucroft[NLR]> Canterlot Hill...
[00:08:19] <Eywind> ?
[00:08:30] <Hamtramck> When did I say that?
[00:08:38] <Hamtramck> RN: this stuff isn't on steam ;)
[00:08:46] <RandomNinja> madness
[00:08:47] <Eywind> You all are weird.  Anyways Inucroft[NLR] if you want to teach, have fun with that.  I just know I want money and don't want to work that hard.
[00:08:47] <Inucroft[NLR]> oh importing stuff, thought u said Important stuff XD
[00:08:56] <SkyHigh> RandomNinja: where are you from?
[00:09:02] <RandomNinja> vikingland
[00:09:09] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind didn't say you were into teaching
[00:09:14] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja aka Denmark
[00:09:15] <RandomNinja> the land of mead and IKEA
[00:09:15] <SkyHigh> Norway.
[00:09:18] <RandomNinja> Inucroft[NLR] pls
[00:09:20] <SkyHigh> Nope
[00:09:21] <Eywind> Just saying I want the things I can get from better jobs
[00:09:23] <Inucroft[NLR]> sush he is a Dane
[00:09:27] <SkyHigh> Sweden
[00:09:31] <Eywind> Plus if I did teach people I'd want to teach them useful things
[00:09:32] <SkyHigh> He's a swede
[00:09:36] <RandomNinja> indeed
[00:09:43] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind you'd be amazed what a History degree can give you, let alone teaching ontop.
[00:09:44] <SkyHigh> (Svêde)
[00:10:02] <Eywind> Of course I would -- History is pretty useless in comparison
[00:10:02] <Hamtramck> Normal history degrees are useful.
[00:10:10] <RandomNinja> no idea what language that is but it's not swedish SkyHigh  :P
[00:10:14] <Hamtramck> Art history is like, museum useful
[00:10:14] <Eywind> If you're just history it's useless
[00:10:27] <Eywind> if you double major or get a masters or something that's fine
[00:10:30] <Hamtramck> But you'd also want something more practical
[00:10:35] <SkyHigh> RandomNinja: it's the direct oral pronunciation

[03:23:34] <EM-C> DePatie-Freling made cartoons for Warner Brothers when that studio closed its animation department.
[03:24:16] <EM-C> That's Jay North (Dennis the Menace) as Terry and the original Daphne Blake as Princess Dawn.

[16:02:52] <Flurshy> it has a middle part that's huge, great for carrying cosmetics

[16:16:34] <Unixkitty> I can never, ever ever carry anything properly in my pockets, so I suppose
[16:16:50] <Flurshy> since, you know... most women use a bag of some sort
[16:17:13] <Flurshy> when you think of it as a fashion accessory it becomes a little bit less of a hassle

[16:22:05] <RandomNinja> I use tresemme + conditioner
[16:22:05] <Cloud_Zephyr> i have a 2 week break but in that 2 weeks i has to revise stuff
[16:22:12] <Flurshy> I'm impressed
[16:22:12] <Cloud_Zephyr> otherwise i fail life
[16:22:14] <RandomNinja> because my hair gets super dry
[16:22:28] <RandomNinja> It's actually surprisingly affordable
[16:22:44] <Flurshy> so you have a total of three soaps and maybe deodorant if you're hygienic
[16:22:47] <RandomNinja> it's about the same as most non-generic products per volume
[16:22:47] <Unixkitty> On a side note, wiping a harddrive clean block by block is apparently a lengthy process.
[16:23:29] <RandomNinja> shampoo, shower gel, conditioner, regular soap

[16:30:11] <Unixkitty> I wouldn't say mine is particularly long, but I wish to grow it back one day heh. Thankfully with it's natural fallback wavy style it doesn't require that much of anything

[16:55:26] <Flurshy> who cares if a phone that's going into a plastic case is made of metal or plastic or even unobtanium
[16:55:28] <Cheese_Sandwich> Unixkitty: we almost escaped the hairs clutches, and then you brought it up again. why? WHY??

[17:05:08] <Flurshy> yesssss
[17:05:30] <Flurshy> would you believe I found it at walmart?
[17:05:35] <Shrike> no
[17:05:35] <Unixkitty> I've been actually looking to get a new one myself, haven't been able to find the one that I like so far though
[17:05:37] <Shrike> no i would not
[17:05:45] <Cloud_Zephyr> lel unix is just liek evolution which we were learning about today
[17:05:58] <Shrike> i still find it hilarious that there is a shop called Walmart
[17:06:07] <Unixkitty> At... walmart? I'm not sure how exquisite that sounds...
[17:06:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> it started of as a simple cell and now we have loads of rubbish on it
[17:06:21] <Flurshy> walmart is cheap store
[17:06:32] <Flurshy> purse was still nearly twenty dollars though
[17:06:50] <Unixkitty> So you do see my point then. Is it of alright quality at least?
[17:06:57] <Flurshy> it is
[17:07:04] <Flurshy> and I can wear it however I like

[17:08:19] <Flurshy> well what is a purse in the uk?
[17:08:37] <Shrike> like a wallet
[17:08:38] <Mike_Coltfield> My goldfish claims to have replaced Flurshy's primary hard drive with a 100 kg gold brick to fit with its definition of "bricking" a device.

[17:09:24] <Flurshy> hm.
[17:09:32] <Flurshy> with a dolly of course
[17:09:34] <Shrike> Flurshy: this makes more sense
[17:09:37] <Mike_Coltfield> No, don't take it to a pawn shop. Take it to an assayer's office to get its true value, minus ~12%
[17:09:43] <Shrike> but what fun is there in making sense?
[17:09:53] <RandomNinja> but how do you get it on the dolly?

[17:25:16] <Mike_Coltfield> There are going to be some interesting casting choices
[17:25:31] <Mike_Coltfield> For example, Old Sketchy_Sounds is going to be played by Patrick Stewart.
[17:25:38] <RandomNinja> Mad Max 1 is mediocre imo. Road Warrior is fantastic. Beyond Thunderdome is great as well, but not quite as good as road warrior
[17:25:54] <Mike_Coltfield> and Old Colgate is going to be played by Matt Damon
[17:26:18] <Shrike> im liking this all
