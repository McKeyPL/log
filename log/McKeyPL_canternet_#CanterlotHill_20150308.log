[02:07:27] <Cloud_Zephyr> consume my latest werk of art https://mega.co.nz/#!JgNSQDrY!JD5euI-eWXGmeNQCR2lvNR9d6NtUSjFBjnPLpal0ZcI
[02:07:35] <Cloud_Zephyr> this is my experiment with arpeggios ^
[02:08:15] <Araxnus> Moved things a bit http://canterlothill.com/music/
[02:08:37] <One-Trick> no offense, but i really hate the music site -.-
[02:09:23] <Araxnus> One-Trick: What do you mean. Like how? I need feed back. However I can't change much.
[02:09:46] <One-Trick> i have always hated waiting for all those youtube videos to load their interfaces
[02:09:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> needs more butts
[02:09:49] <Eywind> Order is at least better
[02:10:47] <Araxnus> One-Trick: Ah that. Well that can not be helped. Was the same at EFN and it is ho EqD does it. So yeah. Can't really change that.
[02:10:49] <Flashy> Chaos is supreme
[02:11:02] <Araxnus> *how
[02:11:12] <One-Trick> sure you can change that :p
[02:11:16] <One-Trick> maybe not you
[02:11:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> Didn't EFN have the click to expend thing?
[02:11:19] <One-Trick> but someone should
[02:11:31] <Cloud_Zephyr> expand*
[02:11:32] <Araxnus> It is 10 to a page.
[02:11:34] <One-Trick> efn loaded a single thumbnail, not the actual video, until you clicked it
[02:12:07] <Araxnus> One-Trick: https://desustorage.org/dl/httrack/EverfreeNetwork/music.everfree.net/page/2/index.html
[02:12:07] <One-Trick> plus the clh pages, when you choose a genre, doesnt show how many pages are returned, or even how many songs
[02:12:15] <One-Trick> yes
[02:12:20] <One-Trick> those are thumbnils of the video
[02:12:25] <One-Trick> not the youtube interface
[02:12:47] <Araxnus> Yeah. It is a plug in. Will need to take a look
[02:12:48] <One-Trick> CLH is literally spawning 10 instances of youtubes api each time you load a page
[02:13:17] <One-Trick> plus it was smaller and earier to read
[02:13:29] <Araxnus> Right um.
[02:13:59] <One-Trick> id prefer even a lightbox-like interface with a small thumbnail, description, title, etc.. and when you click you get a video in a seperate layer
[02:14:06] <One-Trick> jquery, man, do it!
[02:14:25] <Cloud_Zephyr> ahhh an excellent website. remember the days
[02:14:45] <One-Trick> id honestly just like a list interface more than anything. i dont really WATCH videos on youtube. most of them are just static pictures anyway
[02:14:52] <One-Trick> or whatever eq graphic
[02:15:18] <Copper-Cap> mhm
[02:16:46] <One-Trick> list interface with a static "play" bar at the top or bottom. each time you click a song it pops the player into the bar and plays the video there- if theres an actual video to watch, you could click the video to make it center-screen in a seperate layer
[02:16:54] <One-Trick> then you could have play controls all in one static place
[02:16:59] <One-Trick> just sayin
[02:17:08] <One-Trick> im a terrible designer :)

[03:56:18] <Eywind> Kinda
[03:56:22] <Eywind> It involves Bowser
[03:56:26] <Eywind> So we were playing 5 person smash today
[03:56:35] <Eywind> well, okay, it was 4 person that game cuz one of the guys had to talk on the phone
[03:57:12] <Eywind> I was playing some char I sucked with, another was playing zero suit, I forget what Hennet was playing, and the last dude was playing Bowser

[03:57:35] <Eywind> so like 15 seconds into the game, I see Bowser with Hennet in his claw, command grabbing him off the edge
[03:57:49] <Eywind> which I've done to people too, just yolo gotten a troll kill
[03:57:54] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh yay suddenly my statistics decide to werk

[03:57:56] <Eywind> so we're playing 3 stock, so whatever I'm pumped that I'm ahead a life
[03:58:43] <Eywind> so... I'm fighting zero suit, and like another 30 seconds I see Hennet and Bowser fighting towards the other side of the map and, then Bowser pops up in the air with Hennet again and BOOM dead again
[03:58:53] <Eywind> so two troll kills, two troll deaths by Bowser
[03:59:09] <wobniaR> rekt 
[03:59:15] <Eywind> Now Hennet's getting a bit mad, but he's still got a life left, and so does Bowser

[04:00:14] *** Joins: NightmareFluttershy (StrykerVylo@Pony-kf3b2n.ip.windstream.net)
[04:00:18] <Eywind> so ZSS and I start fighting again, and I look over, and see Bowser pop up and PLAYER 3 DEFEATED, PLAYER 4 DEFEATED
[04:00:25] <Eywind> and we all died IRL
[04:00:58] <wobniaR> That'd be me in smash right now too
[04:01:04] <Eywind> yea lol it was pretty amazing
[04:01:17] <wobniaR> I wanna get it so bad once I get some more free time
[04:01:18] <Eywind> Hennet took it like a champ though, I'd probably have left
[04:01:26] <Eywind> even if it was my house
[04:01:30] <Eywind> well even though it was my house*
[04:02:23] <Eywind> I mean, sure I troll sucked up someone with Kirby, shot them in the middle of the bottom of the stage, and flew back and recovered when they died
[04:02:44] <Eywind> and I did command grab once with Bowser to finish Hennet off, but man, that was so salty haha
[04:02:48] <Eywind> Id' have flipped so much
[04:03:14] <wobniaR> Better than getting spiked by a Luigi taunt kick as you're recovering from off stage

[15:33:45] <therealllynewmop12100_> Cloud_Zephyr: Beats are better 
[15:33:51] <Cloud_Zephyr> lies
[15:34:27] <Cloud_Zephyr> They are better for design and as a status symbol. But thats about it. They cost $15 to make

[15:38:33] <Cloud_Zephyr> hmm tbh m50s can be used as a status symbol as well. People around you will think "oh he looks like a professional sound person"
[15:38:38] <wobniaR> A lot of people wear headphones because they're fashionable, they aren't actually listening to any music

[15:40:48] <MishaDash> As a regular of the streets of Manhattan (downtown and midtown), I've come to find that several people wear Beats headphones on the streets.  I'm still not convinced all of them are actually listening to anything.

[15:41:59] <Flurshy> on the subject of beats
[15:42:08] <MishaDash> are yours funky fresh?
[15:42:21] <Flurshy> there are people who legitimately believe that beats are the highest quality headphones available
[15:42:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> Why would u want the same headphones as everyone else anyway? Be unique :P
[15:42:34] <MishaDash> Well it's not about that.
[15:42:45] <Flurshy> in high school someone said that to me in full seriousness. "Beats are the best headphones in the world"
[15:42:58] <MishaDash> It's about the fact that beats headphones intentionally distorts music to make it all sound like big room bass.
[15:42:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> haha
[15:43:05] <Flurshy> I laughed at them, to their face
[15:43:07] <wobniaR> Let them believe whatever they want

[15:44:16] <MishaDash> I won a pair of beats Solo HD's for getting employee of the month.  I ended up taking them to Walmart and exchanged them for store credit, which I then used to acquire nearly $400 worth of stuff for $13 out of pocket.

[15:45:00] *** SnowFeather3 is now known as Mongoosie
[15:45:00] <Flurshy> I would have probably sold them online and then gone and bought some Sennheiser
[15:45:28] <MishaDash> I had also gotten a $100 Visa gift card and had an old Walmart gift card with about $80 on it, plus the $180 I got for the headphones (plus a store discount thanks to a friend) netted me all kinds of goodness.
[15:46:06] <Flurshy> ah, hehe
[15:46:13] <MishaDash> As for headphones, I did a comparison of several different high-end brands in the $150+ range before settling on the Senn HD 380 Pros, because I got pretty much Pioneer quality for about half the price.

[19:36:13] <StrykerVylon> The first one was meh.
[19:36:16] <TheTechnoVampire> I prefer Age of Extinction 
[19:36:28] <Octavius_Scratch> I prefer the one where it didn't suck
[19:36:29] <StrykerVylon> Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction are pretty good imo.
[19:36:45] <RandomNinja> was AoE the one with robot dinosaurs?
[19:36:56] <StrykerVylon> Yes.
[19:37:00] <TheTechnoVampire> Is anyone going to see the new movie CHAPPiE?
[19:37:25] <RandomNinja> that's pretty much the pinnacle of Michael Bay-ness
[19:37:26] <Araxnus> Dark of the Moon killed everything the first and 2nd holded dear. I disagree.

[19:37:54] <StrykerVylon> But RotF was so bad...
[19:37:56] <TheTechnoVampire> It's by the same guy who did D9 and Elysium.
[19:38:02] <Araxnus> I have not seen Age of Extinction yet. Heard it was better and had Rainbow Dash in it.
[19:38:08] <RandomNinja> what are movies?
[19:38:22] <TheTechnoVampire> It had Dinobots which are just as awesome
[19:38:34] <Araxnus> Elysium. I loved that movies concept.
[19:38:48] <RandomNinja> but the actual movie sucked?

[19:39:12] <RandomNinja> oh yeah exo suits have never been done before in anyway

[19:39:35] <StrykerVylon> Hmm...
[19:39:46] <StrykerVylon> Probably something from Goony or Slyphstorm.
[19:40:02] <TheTechnoVampire> Party with Pinkie is my personal fave.

[19:42:39] <Araxnus> Yup!
[19:42:39] <MishaDash> I think the first pony song I ever heard was Party with Pinkie, then Fluttershy's Lament by All Levels at Once.  I was soon hooked.

[19:46:42] <TheTechnoVampire> What is everypony's take on The Wooden Toaster (aka Glaze)?
[19:47:07] <MishaDash> As a kid of the 80's (born in '81), the fact that this is "owed to your 80s" maaay have had the most influence.
[19:47:18] <MishaDash> Because then I'm like "wait, there's bronies in their 30's?"
[19:47:18] <Araxnus> Glaze. Pioneer in fandom music. For sure!

[19:49:16] <Araxnus> Haha. Yes!
[19:49:46] <MishaDash> TheTechnoVampire, Glaze looks like a guy.  I've never asked him how he feels about that and he's never told anyone not to call him a guy, so it's pretty fair to assume that he's a guy.  Even if his OC is a mare.  He's not the only one.
[19:49:51] <RandomNinja> I'm fairly confident WoodenToaster is a dude
[19:50:08] <RandomNinja> also isn't Glaze the OC?

[19:57:07] <MishaDash> Then my cousin posts on facebook "the worst thing about watching a bunch of my little pony: frienship is magic is having the theme song stuck in your head all day at work."
[19:57:12] <Octavius_Scratch> Also, Pony Swag
[19:57:13] <Araxnus> RandomNinja: Compare Fandom Music to Top 40. I would agree. Compare it to Trance or any EDM. No. lol.
[19:57:25] <RandomNinja> Compare it to any non-top 40
[19:57:28] <Octavius_Scratch> Top 40 of what?
[19:57:33] <RandomNinja> top 40 lists
[19:57:33] <Octavius_Scratch> Pop songs?
[19:57:37] <Araxnus> Yes xD
[19:57:42] <RandomNinja> mostly pop and poprock
[19:57:45] <Octavius_Scratch> Just about most Pop is garbage
[19:57:59] <TheTechnoVampire> I think likewise
[19:58:05] <MishaDash> So I watched the first two episodes but my cynicism was pretty thick at that point so I didn't continue on.  I told him it didn't really grab me and he said the same thing happened for him, but after episode 3 or 4 he was hooked.
[19:58:22] <Araxnus> Most yes. But Katy Perry and Ariana Grande <3
[19:58:27] <MishaDash> So I watched episode 3, then episode 4, then the next thing I knew it was 3am, I had 2 hours to sleep before work and I had just finished episode 12.
[19:58:28] <Octavius_Scratch> I was hooked on the first one. I had to know what happened next
[19:58:33] <RandomNinja> pop is designed to appeal to the broadest possible demographic, as such most of it lacks any substance
[19:58:42] <Octavius_Scratch> Exactly
[19:58:54] <Araxnus> MishaDash: Pinkie singing about ghosts got me ;)

[19:59:24] <Octavius_Scratch> Still, Pony Swag. Greatest rap in the fandom
[19:59:29] <Araxnus> Ah
[19:59:29] <MishaDash> lawl
[19:59:37] <StrykerVylon> I watched the first two episodes back in 2011. Never caught on. Watched the episode with Bulk Biceps in 2012 at some point. It was okay. Then watched EqG on Dec 24th 2013 and decided to give the series another try and got hooked.

[20:02:20] <RandomNinja> Araxnus, I like a comparison some guy made on Nightwish singers: "Tarja was a solemn siren, Anette was a perky nymph. Floor is damn valkyrie"
[20:02:39] <Araxnus> RandomNinja: Aww yeah! I agree :)

[22:50:51] <LocDogX86X> The_Iron_Pony[RzR]:  what do you mean?
[22:50:58] <RandomNinja> near death metal?
[22:51:00] <Eywind> Honestly you're just like my mom (yeah, I know, not helping, but meh) -- you keep company with people who are younger and don't get caught up in what a lot of the 'older' generation does (getting stuck in the same situation, etc.) so you're always going to be feel and act younger, which isn't a bad thing at all.
[22:51:16] <Eywind> The_Iron_Pony[RzR] I think eventually you'll have to scale down the amount of pony music because of the low amount 
[22:51:20] <RandomNinja> ^
[22:51:27] <One-Trick> i definitely dont feel like im my age

[22:52:59] <Eywind> Yeah One-Trick I noticed that when you had your EoH interview
[22:53:24] <Eywind> You said the # of songs you had in your mixology collection and I was kinda afraid that wouldn't be sustainable, especially with music slowing down and the hiatus
[22:53:32] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> yeah and pony metal that's woth playing is pretty hard :/
[22:53:32] <Eywind> I'm glad you made the switch to 50/50 or so :)
[22:53:49] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> *finding
[22:54:00] <One-Trick> i do about 15~20 minutes of regular music and the middle part pony, and the rest is a mix of both
[22:54:06] <Eywind> Yep
[22:54:11] <Eywind> Which keeps it fresh
[22:54:23] <Eywind> You get the fresh stuff, the fan favorite/mixology anthems, and then whatever else sounds good at the end

[22:54:31] <Eywind> Nawwww
[22:54:43] <Eywind> If you wanna broaden people's horizons, just have them listen to Midli's sets :P
[22:54:53] <Araxnus> I prefer it to be Rock/Metal. There is a fine line to what is pure Metal. So I kept it as such. I say play both. Still headbanging ;)
