[07:18:03] <init3> At least you don't (I will assume) have the problem my poor friend has. He has several computers and is not in an area where broadband is available. 
[07:18:40] <init3> So he has to come over to my house, download the updates and stick them on a home WSUS server or else they go over their bandwidth limit.
[07:18:48] <init3> of 4G/month
[07:19:09] <init3> I mean, good thinking on his part but holy shit the horror.
[07:19:46] <init3> Oh, and he has a local copy of a debian repo too I think.
[07:24:27] <init3> aand now you've got me to thinking to update my OS. 337 packages. Why is updating 300 packages generally less of a pain than 12 updates for Windows? This has always boggled my mind.
[07:24:41] <Moonlightning> Because the system is superior. :P
[07:25:15] <init3> Truf
[07:25:28] <init3> pacman -Syu and done
[07:26:14] <init3> Hmm... been a minute on my server too. apt-get upgrade. So hard.
[07:29:00] <init3> So... rolling release or whatever the other thing is called with distro versions. Opinions? 
[07:47:48] <Googie> Great for a main computer that you work with often, and are willing to maintain, not so great if not
[07:49:05] <init3> I am of the opinion rolling is great for workstations but obviously a no-no for servers. Though I guess there are some who do that...somehow.
[07:50:06] <init3> I just love how responsive the Arch repos are. I remember a new version of GIMP got released with some awesome new features and I was super excited about it. 
[07:50:35] <init3> I saw it on twitter so it was /just/ released.
[07:50:58] <init3> and apparently in the time it took me to compile it from source it was in the repo.
[07:51:38] <Googie> That's basically my opinion too.
[07:52:27] <Googie> I run Debian sid locally, and stable on my servers
[07:53:07] <init3> I'm kind of distro curious I guess. 
[07:53:22] <init3> I have been running Arch on my laptop for years.
[07:53:23] <Googie> Sid is basically Debian: Rolling release edition
[07:53:28] <init3> Yeah.
[07:54:03] <init3> I run Debian stable on Derpy, my home server.
[07:54:33] <init3> CentOS on my personal webserver at work. 
[07:54:55] <init3> and Xubuntu on my workstation at work.
[07:55:29] <init3> While I'm no fan of Ubuntu really, I don't want to have to mess around with my workstation at work at all.
[07:57:04] <init3> Since everyone at work besides me runs Win 8 and I absolutley refused I really didn't want to have to tell my boss at any point that I had an issue with a kernel upgrade and have no working computer.
[07:57:41] <init3> I have heard sid is less prone to it, but Arch does have upgrades that completely break the OS. 
[07:58:13] <init3> I really don't mind that on my personal computer but... ya know.
[07:59:51] <Googie> Yeah. Ubuntu is in that great spot where it's still nice and up to date, but also stable and well supported
[08:00:55] <Googie> It's based off of sid, rather than Debian stable
[08:02:22] <init3> Oh, I didn't know that.
[08:03:01] <init3> I like the distro itself really for the most part, I just really don't like Canonical.
[08:03:25] <init3> They seem to miss the point of OSS sometimes in my opinion.

[08:10:53] <init3> Though I don't know if it's fair to call it Ubuntu sans Canonical. There are quite a few mint-only features.
