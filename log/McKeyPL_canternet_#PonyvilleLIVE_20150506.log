[10:08:23] *** Joins: Electron (quassel@Pony-ma9.9dh.9.5.IP)
[10:09:15] <Videocrazy> So this is a neat site.  Actually stumbled upon it looking for a chatroom, but now it seems I no longer need a chatroom.
[10:10:24] <Videocrazy> MMmmmight have spoken too soon there.

[10:13:13] <Videocrazy> Ah, there we go.  I've desperately been searching for the most recent version of Pony Fantasy 6.  Specifically, 1.0b.
[10:13:40] <Videocrazy> I don't know if that's the version I got, but I'm sure it's more recent than the version I had before (.95).
[10:14:46] <JockeTF> Oh, I  see the domain for that got canceled.
[10:14:52] <Videocrazy> Yyyyup.
[10:14:57] <JockeTF> I have a pretty recent version I think.
[10:15:02] <Videocrazy> Hence why I've been having such a bugbear of a time finding it.
[10:15:29] <JockeTF> Videocrazy: I have v1.0.
[10:15:44] <Videocrazy> Oooh!  That's almost as good!
[10:15:51] <Videocrazy> Everything except the Doomgaze bug fixed.
[10:16:02] <Videocrazy> Any chance you could share a download link?
[10:16:51] <Videocrazy> If nothing else, I can figure out if the version I found just now is more or less recent.

[10:19:39] <Videocrazy> Thank you so much!
[10:20:01] <JockeTF> No problem!
[10:20:09] <Videocrazy> The most recent version I could find from googling was .99, and the download didn't even work, so so much for that.  XD
[10:20:42] <Videocrazy> Also, I think I have a favorite radio station.

[10:21:36] <Videocrazy> I've been listening it for the last half hour or so, and it's playing all of my favorite songs.
[10:22:01] <JockeTF> Nice. :)
[10:22:44] <Videocrazy> I like just about all music, though rap and dubstep are extremely iffy, and I can't stand guttural vocals.
[10:22:57] <Videocrazy> I love rock, though, so this is perfect for me.
[10:25:23] <JockeTF> I like alpacas.
