[03:46:33] <AppleDash> For /whatever reason/ I can't authenticate to my desktop from my laptop with my SSH key.
[03:47:19] <AppleDash> ~/.ssh and all files therein are 700 and 600 respectively on both machines, my desktop has SSH key auth in the sshd config, and my SSH public key is in my desktop
[03:47:29] <AppleDash> 's /home/appledash/.ssh/authorized_keys
[03:47:38] <AppleDash> Yet it still asks me for a password when I try to SSH. Why?
[03:47:44] <AppleDash> (Not a key password)
[04:01:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> aanyoen familliar with krb5.conf and AD intergration
[04:01:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> is the kpasswd_server required if the passwords arnt being changed in AD on that system

[23:22:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> Colgate: for the last 6 motnhs lenovo has been bundling the adware with their new laptops
[23:22:56] <ShivalPonyWolf> its generic adware so other people are use it in they installed somethign with it
[23:23:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> but the big issue is that lenovo knowingly included it with their laptops builds
[23:24:58] <Colgate> I don't see how extracting this cert lets him mitm?
[23:25:20] <ShivalPonyWolf> the adware installs a fully trusted root cert into the system
[23:25:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> that can be used to sign any domain
[23:25:44] <Colgate> sure, but you still need the private key of the CA cert
[23:25:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> Colgate: which we have
[23:25:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> it was ripped out of the application
[23:26:04] <Colgate> oh, I must ahve misread that part
[23:26:23] <Colgate> wait, why did they bundle the private key in the program? o.O
[23:26:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> the key and cert are both sitting as rsa files in memory
[23:26:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> with the proper headers
[23:26:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> and the password was cracked very easily
[23:26:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> becuase it has to sign new domains on the fly
[23:26:46] <Colgate> ah
[23:26:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> when you go to a https site it intercepts, and gens a matching cert
[23:26:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> its so the adware can inject into https sites
[23:27:02] <Colgate> yeah, I fully understand now
[23:27:11] <Colgate> I just didn't know what the program actually did
[23:27:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> ahh
[23:27:33] <ShivalPonyWolf> sad thing is avast does the same thing
[23:27:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> in order to 'protect' you
[23:28:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> not sure if the key is local though
[23:28:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> i dont think its been publicly looked at
[23:28:21] <Colgate> that's a hard thing though
[23:29:09] <Colgate> I mean
[23:29:52] <Colgate> AV is made to protect from malicious downloads too
[23:30:04] <Colgate> but if it can't can tls connections, it is a huge blindspot for it
[23:30:08] <Colgate> can't scan*
[23:30:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> it can scan the file as its written to disk
[23:30:30] <Colgate> that... is a fair point
[23:30:41] <Colgate> there really isn't a reason then
[23:30:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> the web scanner is designed not to protect you from downloads
[23:30:53] <ShivalPonyWolf> its for in browser exploitation
[23:31:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> and i think stuff like hidden click interception and dodgy iframes
[23:31:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> its useful if you want it
[23:31:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> but its a feature thats on by default
[23:31:34] <Colgate> protect against last measure and such?
[23:31:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> and it doesnt mention that it it does it in a very dodgy way
[23:31:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> sort of
[23:32:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> its suppsoed to protect you before the malware is downloaded/hits your sytem
[23:32:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> i just cant trust anything that tampers with root CAs and can sign everything
[23:33:01] <Colgate> I wouldn't trust that either
[23:34:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> only browsers and the OS shoudl really be able to touch the root cert store. everythign manual should require emplicit authorisation from the user and go into the trusted 3rd party store
[23:34:37] <Phase4> i'm not sure how avast handles browsers, but for email it just asked you to turn off ssl
[23:35:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase4: thats a whole nother issue
[23:35:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase4: but i know how avast handles browser
[23:35:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> go into your systems certificate truste root store
[23:35:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> find the cert for avast! Web/Mail Sheild Root
[23:35:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> it signs everything if you have secure web scanning on

[23:40:43] <Colgate> ick
[23:40:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> sadly its still better then most AV vendors
[23:40:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> just need to remove certain parts of it
[23:41:56] *** McKey is now known as [A]McKey
[23:42:54] * ShivalPonyWolf is seriously pondering an app that audits your certificate stores and activly monitors them for tampering
[23:45:22] <Colgate> I don't think that they can really use the cracked password as evidence for anything though
[23:45:31] <Colgate> anyone can make that password
