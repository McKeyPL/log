[04:57:21] <Ashley> there's a vacation mode
[04:57:58] <Ashley> it doubles the time before your registration expires
[04:58:11] <Ashley> but it disables on your next log in
[04:58:26] <FlutterTree> Hmm I was hoping for a perma registration
[04:59:03] <FlutterTree> but I'll just have to get into the habit of going into vacation mode every logout
[05:30:55] <Fluttershi> fluttertree? you the one i knew before, or someone new picking up the nick?
[05:31:13] <FlutterTree> yep
[05:31:30] <FlutterTree> the same from those rp rooms
[05:37:11] <Fluttershi> i believe vacation mode actually triples the time, from one month to three
[05:37:54] <Dusk> it goes from 1 month to two
[05:38:03] <Dusk> or at least that's how it worked last time I had to use it
[05:41:04] <Colgate> it triples
