[11:44:43] <ArchPegasusMichael> Electron: run away to the north, where summer won't get ya
[11:45:11] <Electron> that's great idea actually
[11:45:21] <Electron> if only I had resources
[11:45:55] <ArchPegasusMichael> I'd gladly spend the hot season in Norway
[11:47:22] <Electron> I'd like to just visit some foreign country
[11:47:42] <Electron> I mean alone without friends and any distractions
[11:50:34] <ArchPegasusMichael> I need friends with me if I'd travel somewhere
[11:52:15] <ArchPegasusMichael> otherwise, the only places I'd see would be hotel, shop, and railway/bus station
[11:53:05] <Electron> why is that?
[11:53:43] <ArchPegasusMichael> A bit of social anxiety, I think
[11:54:42] <ArchPegasusMichael> When I do something away from home, I'm stressed and can't enjoy anything
[11:55:01] <Electron> people are mostly selfish
[11:55:39] <ArchPegasusMichael> I'm starting to think like a robot, who only sees his task :p

[11:57:09] <Electron> well, it's not that bad, you know

[11:59:34] <Electron> I talking about that "like a part robot" part
[12:00:01] <ArchPegasusMichael> Arrival, unpacking, just a glance at everything, and back to the hotel room to hide in - I need some time to get used and start visiting panels, etc
[12:00:28] <Electron> I have no idea how to behave at convention too
[12:00:44] <ArchPegasusMichael> But anyway it's not the same without companions~
[12:01:23] <Electron> imagine you share a room with an anonymous
[12:01:53] <ArchPegasusMichael> That green guy with a question mark on his face?
[12:02:23] <Electron> that could be a guy or a girl
