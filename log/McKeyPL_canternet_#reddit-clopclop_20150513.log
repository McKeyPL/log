[05:11:12] <thaostra> Vulpixbrew, My friends have been saying that for a long time, every time I link to the latest price drop. Frankly I think most people aren't ever going to switch to SSDs until they're only just a little more expensive than HDDs

[05:14:05] <IceFlurries> D: I will soon
[05:14:09] <IceFlurries> need a wifi card too
[05:15:30] <thaostra> They also don't seem to realize just how slow HDDs are since they've been used to them all their lives. When you're used to reboots that take less than 15s, applications loading instantly, and updates taking a fraction of the time as before, going back to hearing rotational drives spinning up feels like going back to the stone age
[05:16:03] <Princesssluttershy> can confirm SSds are awesome

[08:03:53] <iamalion> or at least every other day
[08:04:02] <iamalion> but my hair gets VERY poofy and light after washing
[08:08:21] <cloppyhooves> I don't wash my hair suuuuuper often

[08:08:36] <y007ghg7> ~2-3 days for me
[08:08:37] <cloppyhooves> I should probably condition it more >.>
[08:08:44] <cloppyhooves> But I've heard you're not supposed to shampoo it that often
[08:08:55] <cloppyhooves> But yeah, the way I do my hair is that when I shower I leave in the shampoo for a little bit
[08:08:57] <y007ghg7> I had long hair and would HAVE to every 2 days
[08:09:02] <y007ghg7> how it is shorter :U

[08:09:07] <y007ghg7> now*
[08:09:13] <cloppyhooves> And leave it there while I wash the rest of my body and/or do some shaving
[08:09:22] <iamalion> yeah
[08:09:30] <cloppyhooves> So like for 5-30 minutes
[08:09:33] <iamalion> i shampoo but dont leave it because if i leave it my hair gets very dry
[08:09:37] <cloppyhooves> Oh D:
[08:09:48] <cloppyhooves> But yeah, then I wash it out at the very end
[08:09:54] <iamalion> then put coditioner in, leavei t in while i do uhhh other things,then wash it out
[08:10:04] <cloppyhooves> And after it dries a little, comb it and put in some professional thing my grandma gave me
[08:10:10] <iamalion> my hair is nice while its wet, but as it dries it gets really fucking frizzy
[08:10:10] <cloppyhooves> And it turns out well c:
