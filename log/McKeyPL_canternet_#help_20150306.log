[08:01:52] <OmarianVolcae> Hello?
[08:02:48] <AppleDash> Heello.
[08:02:50] <AppleDash> Hello*
[08:04:00] <OmarianVolcae> I've got a question about the network rules.
[08:04:08] <AppleDash> Ask away.
[08:04:40] <OmarianVolcae> I'm an artist, and a channel admin is using one of my images in their server without my permission.
[08:04:50] <OmarianVolcae> I asked them to remove it, but they refuse.
[08:04:53] <AppleDash> In their server?
[08:05:05] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah, they've got some sort of image fetching thing.
[08:05:39] <AppleDash> I'm fairly certain that an issue like this isn't something the network staff can help with
[08:05:54] <Colgate> we don't host images here, you have to contact the owner of that server
[08:05:59] <AppleDash> But don't believe me, wait until someone like Colgate answers
[08:06:04] <AppleDash> See?
[08:06:15] *** Joins: Pony_0 (Pony_0@Pony-8qusma.res.bhn.net)
[08:06:38] <OmarianVolcae> Right, I contacted the owner.
[08:07:08] <OmarianVolcae> I understand that canternet doesn't host images.
[08:07:27] <OmarianVolcae> But they're using my image without authorization in your network.
[08:07:28] <Colgate> we can't remove the image, I'm not sure what you think we can do
[08:07:50] <OmarianVolcae> Hrm, maybe I misunderstand it, but the channel is part of canternet?
[08:07:56] <OmarianVolcae> Yes?
[08:08:12] <OmarianVolcae> Not necessarily the location that the image is being hosted, but the channel in question is.
[08:08:38] <AppleDash> The channel is part of Canternet, but the channel is created by a user, not by Canternet staff.
[08:09:36] <OmarianVolcae> But if the channel is doing something which is effectively unlawful and the owner refuses to do anything about it, do you have the ability to kill the channel?
[08:09:51] <OmarianVolcae> Basically, I'm resorting to canternet staff becasue the person using my image IS the owner.
[08:09:59] <Colgate> if you think they are breaking your copyright, sue them directly
[08:10:02] <OmarianVolcae> It's not like there's anybody else in the chain of authority.
[08:10:04] <AppleDash> Sure, the staff do, but will they? Probably not.
[08:10:10] <OmarianVolcae> Okay.
[08:10:48] <OmarianVolcae> That answers my question, i guess.
[08:10:55] <OmarianVolcae> Thanks.
