[01:10:25] <Flashy> it really is
[01:10:37] <Flashy> the new 747-8 is amazing
[01:15:28] <keekle> 787 is pretty cool too
[01:15:57] <Flashy> 747-8 takes alot of the features of the 787
[01:16:00] <keekle> but i have been partial to the 747 since i first flew one in the mid 70s
[01:16:03] <Flashy> hence the -8 :P
[01:16:12] <Flashy> wait, you flew one?

[01:17:13] <MikeM> That's where the bar and the pole go.
[01:17:13] <Flashy> i was about to ask :P
[01:18:56] <Flashy> 787 is a difficult aircraft to work with
[01:20:06] <Flashy> being made of compisite materials, they damage real easy, and you cant see the damage either'
[01:21:58] <MikeM> Are the areas around the cargo doors reinforced?
[01:23:11] <Flashy> they are
[01:23:25] *** Badger is now known as Mongoosie|Away

[01:30:04] <RandomNinja> what's the problem? too stiff?
[01:30:11] <MikeM> And aluminum is easy to fix.
[01:30:19] <RandomNinja> true
[01:30:56] <Flashy> the main issue is 905 of damage on carbon fiber is underneath, so it is hidden
[01:31:19] <Flashy> one that happens, you have a grounded plane
[01:31:32] <MikeM> And then it gets ultrasound inspections.
[01:33:26] <Flashy> the cost of a ground 787 is huge

[05:06:08] <Eywind> oh so my mom was in town this weekend and she decided to come over today after we had brunch
[05:06:42] <MikeM> Omelets and mimosas brunch?
[05:06:49] <Eywind> Nah I've had that before though
[05:06:55] <Eywind> this was a brunch buffet
[05:07:01] <MikeM> yum
[05:07:04] <Eywind> yeah it was really good
[05:07:18] <Eywind> anyways she comes back to my house cuz she wants to see the changes I've done since she helped me move in
[05:07:49] <Eywind> and I didn't know she was coming over, so I didn't get to hide my pony stuff (She knows, but meh don't feel like dealing with it much) and she gets to my room where I have my 4de twi and pinkie and my knockoff woona on top of my bookshelf
[05:08:19] <MikeM> Ok
[05:08:26] <Eywind> and we were talking and she goes over and looks at it and like pulls on pinkie's mane and she falls over and I'm like "don't worry about it, it's just a plushie.." and she's like "No it's very important... that it stands up" or something annoying patronizingly about it
[05:08:37] <Eywind> idk bad story but it was annoying
[05:08:49] <Eywind> "Did you buy these for yourself, or...?"

[05:10:04] <MikeM> A little awkward. It's interesting how parental relationships change as we get older.
[05:10:25] <Eywind> Yeah I mean I only told her cuz she was afraid that I was gonna get super depressed again
[05:10:37] <Eywind> and I was like "Nah I have something keeping me above that now" "really, what?" -story

[15:56:28] <Trildar> So, electricity bill has gone up RM30 from last month. Parents blame a significant amount of that on my computer being on. By my calculations though, that increase in price would be for 55kWh of usage. Can't really be my computer can it?
[15:57:31] * Trildar rants
[15:57:39] * Trildar pokes a RandomNinja
[16:00:26] <RandomNinja> unless you're doing 3d stuff on a dedicated graphics card power consumption shouldn't be higher than a lightbulb or two
[16:00:30] <RandomNinja> even less for laptops
[16:01:36] <RandomNinja> they didn't just up the fee?
[16:02:15] <RandomNinja> also how much is that in reference currency?
[16:03:29] *** Toothpaste is now known as Toothie|Skoolz
[16:04:02] <Trildar> Less than $10, but do you want me to account for undervaluing of Malaysian Ringgit? :P
[16:04:14] <RandomNinja> :P
[16:06:05] <Trildar> Well, it's 24 hour idle vs 5-6 hours a day with FAH running pretty much. Should not be 55kWh though...
[16:06:16] <RandomNinja> that's about 75W assuming 24/7 use
[16:06:26] <RandomNinja> which honestly isn't unreasonable
[16:07:02] <Trildar> Well, if I get a Pi, that would be a lot less. :P I don't know if I can convince my parents to buy one tho
[16:07:17] <RandomNinja> what CPU?
[16:07:40] <Trildar> This computer? i5-2400
[16:08:42] <RandomNinja> http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/cpus/2011/01/03/intel-sandy-bridge-review/11
[16:09:17] <RandomNinja> probably less idle power, but as say 50W idle...
[16:11:12] <Trildar> Huh, GPU driver just randomly crashed.
[16:11:47] <RandomNinja> assuming 75W idle, 142W during F@H for 6 hours daily = about 65k Wh in a month
[16:11:54] <Trildar> I wonder if there's something wrong with my GPU. I had BSoDs at one point apparently related to it until I updated my driver.
[16:12:15] <RandomNinja> it happens
[16:12:19] <Trildar> Last Saturday's crashes may have been related to that as well, though the crash dumps give no indication of it.
[16:12:21] <RandomNinja> check error code next BSOD
[16:12:39] <RandomNinja> and disable automatic reboot on crash
[16:13:05] <Trildar> Well, this one was just the driver restarting, else I would have dced.
[16:13:30] <RandomNinja> yeah restarting driver happens occasionally
[16:13:36] <RandomNinja> reinstall it if it keeps happening
[16:14:15] <Trildar> All the crashes are driver/hardware ones, but the only drivers indicated in the stack are Windows system ones.

[21:16:37] <dj> sweet dreams
[21:16:52] <EM-C> Tomorrow's my mother's 85th birthday.
[21:17:11] <dj> do you wanna build a snowman?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCFwghVCvps
[21:17:18] <StrawberryDitz> May she make it to 185.
[21:17:19] <EM-C> My sister has to work tomorrow, so she came down today.  Right now the two of them are at the local Sonic getting a cream cone.
[21:17:34] <EM-C> Thank you, StrawberryDitz.  I hope so as well.
[21:18:09] <EM-C> I think she's actually healthier than I am.  I stopped at a medical supply place this morning to get a knee brace.
[21:18:13] <StrawberryDitz> Fellow across the street is 97 I think, and still saner than the day he was born.
[21:18:22] <EM-C> It was way too small and too hard to put on and take off.  I'd have never worn it.
[21:18:27] <StrawberryDitz> Runs his own small crops and stuff.
[21:18:46] <EM-C> There's a fellow who lives not too far from us who will be 102 this August.
[21:18:57] <EM-C> And he's still a senior bowling champion.
[21:19:09] <StrawberryDitz> The other day he pushed a tree in his yard over with the tractor and convinced his wife he couldn't see where he was going.
[21:19:46] <EM-C> I'm only 57 but my mobility is worse than my mother's.  I'm going to try one other place to get a knee brace that I can actually wear comfortably.
[21:20:18] <EM-C> And I'm not sure such a brace would actually prevent my knee from buckling, which is what it keeps threatening to do.
[21:20:50] <dj> Eywind: is it possible  to set the timezone on the website in european timezone , like you could do in everfree network?
[21:20:55] <EM-C> I just hope I make it till May.  That's when the locusts come out and this will probably be my last time to see them.
[21:21:06] <Eywind> no dj

[21:21:20] <dj> to bad thanks anyway Eywind 
[21:21:48] <Eywind> yeah just remember how much you have to add I guess
[21:22:07] <EM-C> I know that nobody but me is interested in exotic languages, but I have a link to a live broadcast in Irish if anyone would like to hear it.

[21:22:21] *** Eywind is now known as Eywind|Away
[21:22:27] <StrawberryDitz> Have faith, EM-C.
[21:22:58] <EM-C> I miss being able to go out and watch the "bumblebees" (carpenter bee drones) this time of year.
[21:23:21] <EM-C> They've fascinated me since I was a little boy.  I even gave names to them.
[21:23:22] * Cloud_Zephyr turns RandomNinja into an art student
[21:23:54] <dj> what link EM-C 
[21:23:55] <EM-C> But this is a new house so we don't have any here.  I could drive back to the old house but I couldn't stand for very long and I certainly couldn't chase them down and catch them.
[21:24:01] <EM-C> Hold on.
[21:24:05] <dj> yes
[21:24:13] <dj> not to long pls

[21:24:43] <EM-C> Right now they're playing music, but they've been speaking Irish for the longest time.  This is their Irish language service.
[21:24:48] <dj> thanks EM-C 
[21:25:05] <EM-C> It's supposed to bring up a player.  If it doesn't I can give you another url.
[21:25:14] <dj> bye i really like irish music thank u so much
[21:25:36] <EM-C> One of the absolutely greatest things about the Internet...getting to see and **hear** really exotic languages your ancestors never got to hear once in their lives.

[21:26:06] <dj> k bye now i'll be away now
[21:26:17] <EM-C> It's really hard to find a station that broadcasts in Breton.  Most Breton language stations are bilingual.

[21:29:19] <EM-C> It's really amazing what a blessing the Internet has been.
[21:29:46] <EM-C> I used to just dream of getting to hear these languages.
[21:29:46] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t Bless The Internet!
[21:29:49] <DinkyBot> Oh the question is "Why did Rainbow Dash say "Bless you" in dinosaur.
[21:30:13] <EM-C> Yehi haNet mevorakh.
[21:30:34] <EM-C> Because she didn't speak dinichthys???
[21:31:04] <StrawberryDitz> I've an old Oxford Pocket Latin dictionary.
[21:31:21] <EM-C> Latin is for summoning the devil in movies.

[21:31:47] *** Unikitty|Away is now known as Unixkitty
[21:32:34] <RandomNinja> I return
[21:32:46] <StrawberryDitz> I use it for cussing.
[21:32:50] <EM-C> I forgot about this evening's Pony episodes.  
[21:33:06] <EM-C> I didn't get to go online till I got back from Jackson and just wasn't thinking.
[21:34:56] <EM-C> They say the healthiest Celtic language is actually Welsh.
[21:35:21] <RandomNinja> Inucroft agrees
[21:35:24] <EM-C> I tried to learn it once with a book and casette tapes.  For a little while I actually thought I might succeed.
[21:35:42] <EM-C> But the consonant mutations did me in.
[21:36:23] <EM-C> It's easier to learn textual languages than spoken languages.  The only language I've ever succeeded in learning is a textual language.
[21:36:41] <StrawberryDitz> You could just learn Celt.
[21:36:45] <EM-C> I sometimes wonder if I could learn to read Old English, but I doubt it.
[21:36:50] <EM-C> Which one?
[21:36:51] <StrawberryDitz> It's about the same as learning the branches.
[21:37:10] <RandomNinja> ye aulde englishe?
[21:37:10] <StrawberryDitz> That's like asking which Latin branch you should learn.
[21:37:19] <RandomNinja> the roman one
[21:37:22] <EM-C> This Celt...this is a reconstructed language?
[21:37:54] <StrawberryDitz> I feel like I heard that Celtic was a language...
[21:38:02] <EM-C> I'm not really interested in reconstructed or artificial languages.  Revived languages, yes.
[21:38:13] <Cloud_Zephyr> :O the ninja of randomness is here
[21:38:22] <RandomNinja> nu
[21:38:32] <EM-C> Celtic is a whole family of languages: Irish, Scots Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, Breton.
[21:39:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> RandomNinja is just an illusion
[21:39:15] <Unixkitty> Says a Cloud
[21:39:21] <EM-C> I'm really bummed that I never learned Biblical Aramaic.  I should have.  I feel as if I've been cheated out of it.
[21:39:50] <EM-C> I took **one** Aramaic in grad school.  For **one semester**.
[21:40:01] <EM-C> And it was a disaster.
[21:40:14] <EM-C> We didn't get the BA textbooks until we got out of reading BA.
[21:40:28] <Unixkitty> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhjk5x54bsE For some reason I thought of Cloud_Zephyr when listening to this one
[21:40:31] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about The Turntable Turnabout (Mystery Skulls - Money)
[21:40:40] <StrawberryDitz> Watching the video about Jibo...
[21:40:42] <EM-C> Then we started reading Targumic Aramaic and the textbooks arrived.  So we read the Targums and finally studied Biblial Aramaic.
[21:40:46] <StrawberryDitz> What happens when Jibo wants to be in the picture?
[21:41:10] <EM-C> Then we read Syriac, which I wasn't even remotely interested in.  Plus the alphabet looks like chicken scratching.
[21:41:44] <EM-C> That's really lousy; trying to be a scholar in Biblical languages and getting screwed out of Aramaic like that.
[21:41:51] * StrawberryDitz feels that if she gets a robot she'll be one of those weird people who is extremely close to it.
[21:42:12] <EM-C> And the language is so clumsy and hard to pronounce.
[21:42:17] * RandomNinja turns StrawberryDitz into a robot
[21:42:27] * StrawberryDitz dances.
[21:42:46] <EM-C> It just doesn't flow...not for me anyway.  I'm sure there are people who can read Targum and even Talmudic Aramaic at ninety miles an hour.
[21:43:17] <EM-C> Sorry.  These are my interests, and I can'f find anyone online who cares anymore than anyone in RL does.
[21:43:33] <EM-C> I can't talk about computer games.  I know nothing whatever about them.
[21:43:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> i need some of the highest quality flac
[21:43:47] <EM-C> So I'm very lonesome.  Even among "misfits" on the Internet I'm a misfit.
[21:44:09] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr apply HDTracks.com
[21:44:21] <StrawberryDitz> It's okay.
[21:44:29] * DerpyBot sits down with DinkyBot to go through her homework with her
[21:44:30] <DinkyBot> Momma, this is hard stuff! Can I have a muffin, pwease?
[21:44:32] <StrawberryDitz> I can blabber on about old folklore and stuff for hours.
[21:44:39] <EM-C> It's not okay when you're lonesome and no one is interested in the things you are.
[21:44:41] <StrawberryDitz> It's nice seeing someone interested in stuff.
[21:44:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> yay
[21:44:54] <StrawberryDitz> You're interested aren't you?
[21:44:57] <StrawberryDitz> So obviously someone is.
[21:45:08] <EM-C> But it comes along with the Asperger's.  Which, btw, I just found out about a month and a half ago.
[21:45:19] <EM-C> I'm the only one who is interested.
[21:45:27] <EM-C> Nobody to talk with.
[21:45:30] <Cloud_Zephyr> they only have old music :P
[21:45:46] * thereallynewmop12100_ remasters Cloud_Zephyr 's youtube rips 
[21:45:46] <RandomNinja> no just mostly :P
[21:45:51] <StrawberryDitz> Finding out about diseases is the worst thing, because the signs of most of them are a simple part of life.
[21:45:53] <EM-C> When I try to talk about it here...well, discussing Biblical languages probably violates the "no religious discussion" rule.
[21:45:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> and you have to give them money
[21:46:20] <RandomNinja> biblical discussion from a purely academic standpoint is fine with me
[21:46:21] <EM-C> Plus the subject is just so esoteric.  The number of people (at least that I have access to) who are interested are just...microscopic.
[21:47:06] <EM-C> I really resent not learning Biblical Aramaic.  I wonder if my old college teacher (who has a PhD from Hebrew Union College) would be willing to teach me?
[21:47:32] <EM-C> He wrote his disseration on the Tosefta'.  That tells you something right there.
[21:47:59] <EM-C> Never mind me, folks.  Go back to discussing video games.  I wish I could join you.
[21:49:18] <EM-C> Besides, there's some stuff I need to be looking up.  I'll probably be back on later today.  Later.

[22:59:57] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Inucroft[NLR]: I enjoy ginger ale. I've also been told it's necessary for hackathons. :P
[23:00:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> heh
[23:00:18] <Inucroft[NLR]> Shadow_Soul[NLR] ginger ale is the beast. But Ginger Wine is the farrarie
[23:00:19] <RandomNinja> Lunatic, but were they pints?
[23:00:19] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> RandomNinja: So I happen to have some everclear
[23:00:23] <RandomNinja> ok
[23:00:39] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> It's surprisingly good stuff
[23:00:45] <Inucroft[NLR]> Lunatic pls, Churchill and Cheifton is
[23:00:47] <Inucroft[NLR]> :P
[23:01:01] <RandomNinja> isn't is exclusively ethanol and water?
[23:01:10] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Pretty much. \o/
[23:01:15] <Inucroft[NLR]> Shadow_Soul[NLR] not a surpise to us ;) I'd recomend Ginger Wine, tis brilliant
[23:01:38] <RandomNinja> Shadow_Soul[NLR], chug! :P
[23:01:49] <RandomNinja> you totally won't die
[23:01:57] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Ofc, my friend did a half shot. Couldn't handle it and he chugged like a litre of Dr. Pepper. 
[23:02:06] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> I did a full shot. I think it's great.
[23:02:09] <RandomNinja> what a skrub
[23:02:16] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> ^
[23:02:56] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Ofc, I also heard from his ex-gf that he got drunk off of like 4 wine coolers....
[23:03:11] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> I didn't think that was physically possible
[23:03:13] <RandomNinja> wine cooler?
[23:03:36] <RandomNinja> I'm pretty sure you're not referring to wine fridges which usually hold several gallons :P
[23:04:05] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Pouches of like, fake daiquiris and stuff made from wine. Usually only 10 proof or so and only hold about 1 drink's worth of alcohol
[23:04:31] <RandomNinja> one drink is? a pint? 22 oz?
[23:04:44] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Depends. One shot= 1 drink, etc.
[23:04:54] <RandomNinja> yeah but in this case
[23:05:10] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> 1.5oz of pure alcohol? I can't remember numbers
[23:05:16] <RandomNinja> no in total
[23:05:20] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t oz
[23:05:22] <DinkyBot> Scrubs 200 was A GIANT REFFERENCE to the wizard of oz, it doesnt make sense i meen just buy some dvd of cartoons set you kids down and put them into nice sorted lists so you can hang out with that's not my problem!
[23:05:31] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> What
[23:05:38] <RandomNinja> what's the volume of the pouch, regardless of content :P
[23:05:57] <RandomNinja> this is highly revelant :P
[23:06:07] *** FN is now known as FN_afk
[23:07:30] <RandomNinja> anyway, so pretty much like a regular beer's worth of alcohol then?
[23:08:32] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Yup. As far as I can tell, it's about an average beer in volume too
[23:09:02] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Still terrible.
[23:09:14] <RandomNinja> if he's not like 100 pounds then yeah he needs to up his game
[23:09:14] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Also, usually served partially frozen and slushified
[23:09:17] <Inucroft[NLR]> Heh, i don;t drink alcohol
[23:09:31] <Inucroft[NLR]> And oddly enough, a fair few of my re-enactment cell don't either
[23:09:39] <Lunatic> booty
[23:09:51] <Inucroft[NLR]> Lunatic shaking eveywhere?
[23:10:21] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> He's like... 200 or so pounds?
[23:10:28] <RandomNinja> lel
[23:10:47] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> even Everclear doesn't touch me much, but I'm a 300lb German. :P
[23:10:49] <RandomNinja> I'm like 150 and drink 3-4 10% beers usually without getting too drunk
[23:11:15] <RandomNinja> need to up that number
[23:11:36] <Inucroft[NLR]> i'm a.... 11st brit
[23:11:51] <Inucroft[NLR]> no idea what that is in your false and incorrect measuring system
[23:11:54] <RandomNinja> halp weird measurements
[23:12:00] <RandomNinja> 65-70 kg
[23:12:03] <RandomNinja> in real numbers
[23:12:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> pfffff
[23:12:24] <Inucroft[NLR]> and yet our numbers apply to ~50% of the globe~

[23:12:43] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Randomninja: You would need to chug down like 5 winecoolers in an hour to get drunk at all
[23:12:47] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Not even joking
[23:13:21] <RandomNinja> I often have a 8-10% beer to dinner and it barely touches me
[23:13:23] <RandomNinja> so probably
[23:13:24] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> I'm American and use fake numbers. Because murica or something stupid
