[00:27:56] <LZ> Stuff is shady, and I don't know why you keep refering hardcover Fo:E books, wobniaR
[00:28:20] <wobniaR> I thought that was a thing, guess I'm wrong
[00:28:39] <LZ> Harcover FoE books were never for profit of author IIRC
[00:28:46] <Eywind> none of them are

[21:18:07] <Unixkitty> How would I do that?
[21:18:11] <Trildar> That's ironic. Terraria doesn't even run on Linux natively.
[21:18:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh and i only have 0.4GB left on mai phone
[21:18:23] <Unixkitty> Exactly, Trildar.
[21:18:32] <Unixkitty> And it runs oh so much better there.
[21:18:36] <Cloud_Zephyr> maybe i should delete some jailbreak rubbish
[21:18:59] <Trildar> Seems Microsoft can't even run their own things well.
[21:19:00] <Unixkitty> That's why I said last time how surprised I am that they are still yet to port it officially somehow
[21:19:12] <RandomNinja> fraps, shadowplay, any overclocking client
[21:19:26] <Trildar> Would have to be rewritten probably. It's written in C#.
[21:19:32] <Unixkitty> Ooh Shadowplay, I completely forgot about that
[21:19:38] <RandomNinja> it's great
[21:19:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> hmm reminds me of fruity loops

[21:20:07] <RandomNinja> you know, when geforce experience decides to work properly -.-
[21:20:10] <Cloud_Zephyr> the fl studio programmers used a crazy hipster programming language only working on windows
[21:20:21] <RandomNinja> C#?
[21:20:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> so they've had to completely rewrite the program to run on mac
[21:20:33] <Trildar> Yeah, sounds like C#.
[21:21:11] * Trildar should figure out how to type the actual sharp sign. :P
