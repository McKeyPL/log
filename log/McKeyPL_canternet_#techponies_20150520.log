[17:33:04] <Kinsley> I think it's important to talk about in the context of some proposed laws around the world, but most especially in countries like the US and UK, where they are wanting to add backdoors to encryption methods for "law enforcement" reasons.
[17:36:38] <Seoson> Which is what one paragraph in the article I was reading is about. Don't ask politicians to be reasonable. 
[17:38:14] <Shutter> It's not fair to blame politicians only. With attitudes like "I don't have anything to hide" and "If it saves only one child it will be worth it" prevailing in the public, this is how it's going to be.
[17:42:26] <Seoson> true. I'm just angry because of my own government(Germany here). Actual quote "You don't spy on friends". Oh wait our biggest telecom provider is selling data of our allies to our own intelligence agency, who is than forwarding to the NSA. The other way around the same thing. Also they circumvent the "Don't spy on your own people" policy this way.
[17:43:26] <Shutter> From the bright side, at least the DRD was never implemented. It's something.

[17:48:07] <Seoson> Guess what: Our higest court declared a similar policy invalid some time ago(unrelated to the EU). Now they are trying to bring it back plus the added bonus of stored locations. And it's not only meant to be used for terrorism anymore. Even "crimes involving the internet primarily" are affected now as well.

[22:07:34] <Colgate> they generally have decent technical details
[22:08:36] <Colgate> oh, DHE_EXPORT
[22:08:45] <Colgate> yeah, that should be disabled anyways
[22:09:20] <Seoson> Yeah since several years. This whole thing is old news.
[22:10:06] <Seoson> Exports ciphers meant to be weak are weak - surprise
[22:11:40] <Colgate> random thought: why did ssl get renamed tls anyways?
[22:12:12] <Seoson> If I recall correctly I don't even have any DHE cipher left in my config. Everything should be ECDHE
[22:12:24] <Seoson> SSL != tls ?!
[22:12:35] <Colgate> ssl3 to tls1
[22:12:41] <Colgate> is what I'm getting at, why not ssl4 :P
[22:14:13] <Seoson> Well SSLv3 is not TLS 1.0. They used it a basis I believe.
[22:14:35] <Colgate> yeah, just like SSLv2 isn't SSLv3
[22:14:56] <Colgate> did tls change a whole lot more than SSLv3?
[22:16:00] <Seoson> If I recall correctly they work a bit different and SSL implies a dedicated port which TLS does not (StartTLS)
[22:17:29] <Colgate> starttls might be the thing that did it, /shrug
[22:18:15] <Colgate> I'm not too familiar with ssl2, not sure how and ssl3/2 client could connect to an ssl2 only server
[22:18:45] <Colgate> or how that works with downgrading and what not
[22:19:41] <Colgate> and of course, that information will be damn near impossible to find now with just page after page of "don't use ssl" results >.>
[22:20:29] <Seoson> Well SSLv3 is dead
[22:20:58] <Seoson> So there is only SSLv2 plus TLS 1.0 and later
[22:22:02] <Colgate> SSLv2 is longer dead :P
[22:22:08] <Colgate> SSLv2 is completely broken now
[22:22:29] <Colgate> but I'm still interested in the history of it, would never actually use it though
[22:22:44] <Seoson> Oh confused ...
[22:22:53] <Colgate> debian wheezy's openssl package doesn't even have ssl2 compiled in, loll
[22:23:30] <Colgate> https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10493/why-is-tls-susceptible-to-protocol-downgrade-attacks
[22:23:30] <PinkiePieBot> [ ssl - Why is TLS susceptible to protocol downgrade attacks? - Cryptography Stack Exchange ]
[22:23:33] <Colgate> that might be useful
[22:25:32] <Seoson> Something made me think we're still using SSLv2. I dunno. Can't find the thing in my head I had in mind
[22:25:53] <tiwake> things in head are scary
[22:26:34] <Seoson> Also Firefox changed the settings menu and now I can't find a thing -,-
[22:27:03] <Colgate> I don't know of anything that uses ssl2 anymore
[22:27:11] <Colgate> and anything does, it should be shot >.>
[22:27:56] <Seoson> They really want me to swtich to Chrome. Had to do that already on my phone because firefox messed up zoom. *Still looking for that ssl 2 thing*
[22:28:33] <Colgate> ...woah
[22:28:41] <Colgate> the options menu in firefox is... a tab now? o.O
[22:28:46] <Colgate> when did this happen
[22:28:47] <Seoson> Yep
[22:29:22] * Seoson is still pressing the ALT key, because he refuses to use the menu on the right.
[22:30:07] <Seoson> Probably in one of the last 10 updates. Thank you rapid release none sense.
[22:30:49] <Seoson> I don't even know what bloody FF version I'm on. 
[22:31:03] <Colgate> I only noticed it because my work version of FF is way newer than my home version

[22:37:46] <Seoson> O.K. I gave up. Maybe what I had in mind is the SSLv2 compatible handshake thing ....
[22:38:14] <Colgate> inContent? what does that setting do?
[22:39:13] <Seoson> Give me my old settings window back ^^
[22:39:58] <Seoson> I'd imagine it won't last forever, but I'll need some time to adjust ;-)
[22:40:08] <Colgate> ah ok
[22:41:00] <Seoson> They should make Chat!Zilla work in a tab instead. It's a buggy mess when you open it in a tab.
[22:42:51] <Colgate> I don't mind the new tab options, /shrug
[22:44:25] <Seoson> It's probably a good idea in the long term.
[22:46:54] <Seoson> But instead of doing every dialog after each other they should do the whole thing. Download dialog is still a window. Used download statusbar (addon) until it broke.
[22:48:36] <Seoson> Just like AppTabs - good idea, but executed horribly. 
[22:53:33] <Colgate> I use apptabs as if they were bookmarks for sites I open up all the time
[22:53:37] <Colgate> and just want to use less space
[22:55:49] <Seoson> Yeah, but if I recall correctly (at least for me) they didn't open up on start (firefox is setup to wipe history when closed, which shouldn't apply to apptabs) and I still have both the adressbar and other toolbars which I wouldn't need in an apptab. At least make an option to hide them.
[22:57:34] <Seoson> That makes them exactly like normal tabs for me apart from taking less space in the tab bar.
