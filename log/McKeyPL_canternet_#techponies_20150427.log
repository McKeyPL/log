[00:36:33] <JustAberrant> hehe, yeah
[00:36:46] <JustAberrant> a lot of people are very proud of being self taught, but it sometimes does have downsides :>
[00:38:57] <tiwake> depends
[00:39:30] <worthless> anyone else have issues with windows 8.1 and phone hotspots?
[00:39:37] <worthless> Like it comes up as limited or no connectivity
[00:39:52] <worthless> but another computer running windows 8.1 connects just fine
[00:39:52] * JustAberrant feels self taught but with university degree is the best 
[00:40:17] <JustAberrant> like, most decent coders I know where into coding well before university, or at the very least got into it and did outside projects during university
[00:41:00] <JustAberrant> but university does fill in the holes, and does smooth out the tendency to just do whatever
[00:43:54] <JustAberrant> like if I had a pick, I'd take someone self taught with no degree but lots of good work to show over someone with a degree who's entire example set is from university projects
[00:44:02] <JustAberrant> but I think someone with both is the best ;p
[00:44:16] <JustAberrant> very least I don't think a university degree makes someone stupider for the most part
[00:44:32] <JustAberrant> unless they go down the functional programming road :D

[08:32:30] <Twilightlicious> i found 40 inch USB cables for a Dollar today.
[08:32:37] <Twilightlicious> so i bought like 3 of them >3>
[08:32:54] <Twilightlicious> part of me wanted to buy them out lol
[08:35:50] <Twilightlicious> but decided to see if they were even worth a dollar first
[08:39:36] <JustAberrant> hmm, that sounds dubious
[08:40:04] <JustAberrant> oh.. inches
[08:40:08] <JustAberrant> yeah that's fine
[08:40:38] <JustAberrant> was about to say.. 40 feet is like 3 times the max length 
[08:56:54] * Phase4 makes a 50 foot cable
[08:57:23] <Phase4> wonder if it's a timing or just signal quality
[09:00:24] <JustAberrant> dunno, but the run between my keyboard/mouse to my kvm then back to my main pc is quite long
[09:00:42] <JustAberrant> and occasionally it just drops and I have to unplug/replug it
[09:03:10] <Twilightlicious> My Xbox One won't form a Data connection to the controller with these cheap USB cables
[09:03:30] <Twilightlicious> charging but functioning over wireless still

[09:45:32] <mniip> wireless fidelity
[09:45:38] <mniip> of course
[09:45:44] <JockeTF> Magic?!
[09:46:20] <mniip> the ethernet cable is there because the windows driver for my wifi card is a piece of shit
[09:46:31] <mniip> I only use it when on windows
[09:46:48] <AppleDash> mniip: So I'm not the only one who has randomly thought of it as "wireless fidelity"
[09:46:48] <AppleDash> lol
[09:47:00] <JockeTF> Oh, I prefer to use them when available.
[09:47:21] <mniip> JockeTF, I use a desktop PC from '98 as a router
[09:47:45] <mniip> it connects to the wifi and then NAT's the packets to this ethernet cable
[09:47:51] <mniip> so that I can have internet in windows!

[09:48:21] <JustAberrant> is there at least rum in that @ pic

[09:49:12] <JustAberrant> actually nm, I dunno if you could set the wifi to be the wan side :>
[09:49:30] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: the term is bridge
[09:49:32] <JockeTF> mniip: Probably faster than most modern routers. :D
[09:49:34] <JustAberrant> ok, really going to bed, it's like 5am :S

[09:52:28] <AppleDash> No
[09:52:31] <mniip> your router gets the internet from an internet cable and converts it into wifi
[09:52:35] <AppleDash> That's just called a wireless access point
[09:52:54] <AppleDash> A wireless bridge connects two wired networks together over Wi-Fi. The wireless bridge acts as a client, logging in to the primary router and getting an Internet connection, which it passes on to the devices connected to its LAN Jacks.

[20:47:49] <DataByte> says it thinks it's a dropped network connection
[20:47:58] <Starthunder> That's odd…I can't play anything from the Monstercat Bandcamp.
[20:48:11] <DataByte> tried from 2 browsers, 2 machines, OS, ISP
[20:48:18] <Starthunder> play button changes to the loading thing for a second, then back to a play button
[20:48:38] <DataByte> heh.. just tried again, now they say it's maintenance
[20:48:50] <Starthunder> Maintenance, huh
[20:49:07] <DataByte> i would have appreciated warning before i wasted the past half hour troubleshooting my entire network
[21:03:37] <worthless> Hmm.. so downloading ponies from the torrent links in Yay ponies is a lot faster and stable then the site itself
[21:11:31] <Datalink> DataByte, it's likely there's some tech going "how long was that server BSODed... why won't it come up..." etc as well

[22:42:01] <init3> If I lose connection to one AP it will switch but my problem is the signal from my front AP is still there, just weak. I suppose I could reduce the transmit power of it but that seems stupid. 
[22:43:05] <init3> I have an app on my iPad that lets you tell it to switch if the signal is less than X percent. Dunno if there is something similar.

[22:53:44] <init3> I'd throw a fit.

[22:54:19] <init3> Haha
