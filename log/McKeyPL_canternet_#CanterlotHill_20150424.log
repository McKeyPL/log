[04:22:29] <Angel_Bunny> oh so what are you asking about that you can't find in guides?
[04:22:58] <Snapai> me?
[04:23:13] <Snapai> I'm just looking for improvement suggestions
[04:23:19] <Angel_Bunny> oh I meant
[04:23:22] <Angel_Bunny> Sorry first line was for you
[04:23:24] <Angel_Bunny> second line was for PowerPlay
[04:23:28] <Angel_Bunny> Mine is "needs more fur" lol
[04:23:51] <Snapai> Yeah well, the fur simulation comes later. I'm just looking at the underlying model right now.
[04:24:03] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah I know, that was pretty much the extent of my art
[04:24:09] <One-Trick> writing a more accurate !song, as the api is trash and lags behind
[04:24:12] <PowerPlay> The wall is that my level is far lower than what I need to be, and I need Araxnus to tell me where the best grinding spots are for a level 21 Fragtrap.
[04:24:18] <One-Trick> should be done in a few
[04:24:24] <Angel_Bunny> grinding in that game?
[04:24:28] <Angel_Bunny> just do all the quests
[04:24:32] <Angel_Bunny> I was only 26 when I beat the last boss
[04:25:01] <Angel_Bunny> If your weapons suck just use shift keys
[04:25:20] <Angel_Bunny> Nice One-Trick :)
[04:26:01] <PowerPlay> I have no Shift Keys. And my gear isn't that bad for my level.
[04:26:07] <Angel_Bunny> get shift keys online
[04:26:08] <Angel_Bunny> >.>
[04:26:23] <Angel_Bunny> http://orcz.com/Borderlands_Pre-Sequel:_Shift_Codes <-- shift codes
[04:27:28] <PowerPlay> I can't do that on the profile I'm using. I have one for offline, excepting patches, and one for online. The one I'm on is the offline one, where I have save data from both Borderlands games.
[04:27:35] <Angel_Bunny> oh
[04:27:38] <Angel_Bunny> so if you have good weapons
[04:27:43] <Angel_Bunny> and you're 21
[04:27:49] <Angel_Bunny> what is your wall?
[04:27:51] <Angel_Bunny> the last boss?
[04:28:22] <One-Trick> i really really hate shoutcasts admin page
[04:28:23] * Angel_Bunny shotguns
[04:28:25] <PowerPlay> Not there yet. The area you go to after the boss battle with Zarpedon. The one with the laser thing.
[04:28:36] <Angel_Bunny> so the last area
[04:29:01] <Angel_Bunny> I think?
[04:29:02] <Angel_Bunny> Maybe not
[04:29:11] <PowerPlay> The quest in quest-ion is The Beginning of the End, and the quest level says 26.
[04:29:17] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah that's the last mission
[04:29:30] <Angel_Bunny> You're fine; if you end up at 26 you're okay
[04:29:41] <PowerPlay> How the bucking hell I made it to there at level 20-21 is anypony's guess.
[04:30:01] <Angel_Bunny> I woulda been around that level; Araxnus too
[04:30:35] <One-Trick> i wish i could keep my attention focused- id finish BL, bioshock, etc, etc, etc..
[04:31:01] <MikeM> But instead you're programming stuff
[04:31:01] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah I have 8 or so games I could finish up

[04:31:37] <Angel_Bunny> Also guys
[04:31:41] <Angel_Bunny> the radio is currently fixed
[04:31:46] <Angel_Bunny> like.. it's not dead
[04:31:48] <MikeM> Yay?
[04:32:08] <One-Trick> how long was it dead?
[04:32:11] <MikeM> I wanted to request Drunk Again, but it's not there.
[04:32:15] <PowerPlay> So yeah, my wall is level-based.
[04:32:16] <Angel_Bunny> on Chrome, like aweek
[04:32:26] <Angel_Bunny> PowerPlay can't you just do the quest?
[04:32:33] <Angel_Bunny> Just grind the last area you were in or the first part of the next area
[04:32:40] <Angel_Bunny> (or more on Chrome idk)
[04:32:55] <MikeM> On the hoofsounds app thing?
[04:33:08] <Angel_Bunny> idk the phone app was fixed earlier
[04:33:09] *** Mongoosie|Away is now known as Mongooosie
[04:34:08] <PowerPlay> The level 26 one? Dude, I may be able to survive in Opportunity at level 17 in Borderlands 2 with corrosive weapons, but this game? With 15-17% fewer bonus statsthan what I have in BL2? Ain't happening. My Fragtrap woild be deader than disco.
[04:34:24] <Angel_Bunny> Do I need to reiterate
[04:34:30] <Angel_Bunny> that Araxnus and I were 26 when we BEAT THE GAME
[04:34:35] <Angel_Bunny> Like.. end of last boss
[04:35:19] <Angel_Bunny> Either train where you were at or move on
[04:36:40] <PowerPlay> And I'm only 21, with my only weapon of decent murdering ability being a Miss Moxxi's Vibra-Pulse, which, mind you, is level 16? I killed Zarpedon with that laser. But for where I need to go? Barely dents opponents.
[04:37:05] <Angel_Bunny> you said your weapons were fine
[04:37:07] <Angel_Bunny> obviously they're not
[04:37:47] <PowerPlay> I said "not bad for my level". I didn't say "fine for the quest I have".
[04:37:48] <wobniaR> Fragtrap is the tankiest class
[04:38:04] <wobniaR> Full heal and passive 20% damage reduction in the green tree
[04:41:58] <PowerPlay> Well... I do have 4 weapons that might helpget me through that level 24-26 area... but 3 of them I can't use until either 22 or 23. And the one I can use now is a Hyperion SMG.
[04:42:51] <PowerPlay> And a level 23 Adaptive Shield, my favorute type.

[22:36:05] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[22:36:05] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about ilan Bluestone - 43 (Original Mix)
[22:37:55] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> <Eywind> She wanted to know if people had heard on the radio, and no one that was listening was in chat active so yeah <- That's why when people go silent, NMM's question becomes ignored and she goes livid
[22:38:43] <Eywind> You make it seem like 3-4 answers of "Yeah we weren't listening one hour before your show started and after another one ended, sorry" wasn't an adequate response
[22:38:47] <Eywind> when there were 5 people active in chat.
[22:39:11] <Eywind> Look, Heat was fine to respond to that; I'd be frustrated too.
[22:39:13] <LocDogX86X> i was only around for the 1st 45 min of LRT last friday i must off missed all that
[22:39:53] <Kim_Kimera_Kimes> that was today
[22:40:09] <LocDogX86X> really
[22:40:17] <Kim_Kimera_Kimes> yup
[22:40:31] <Eywind> Yeah it was literally 5 min before you showed up

[23:07:12] <Cloud_Zephyr> it annoys me when armin tries to appeal to everyone. too much big room trance

[23:07:25] <Cloud_Zephyr> yo Inucroft[NLR] 
[23:07:29] <Inucroft[NLR]> Cloud_Zephyr trance appeals to a tiny minority ;)
[23:07:36] <Inucroft[NLR]> also http://derpy.me/2sGKW
[23:07:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> better than big room doe
[23:07:46] <Scootaloose> big room trance is meh
[23:08:00] <Scootaloose> mainly because big room is meh 
[23:08:08] <Scootaloose> trying to get trance to make it good didn't work

[23:10:04] <Inucroft[NLR]> Scootaloose well trance was born of pop which was born unto rock
