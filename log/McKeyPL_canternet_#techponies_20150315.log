[04:42:36] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: yes :(
[04:43:18] <JustAberrant> Colgate: when you sleep (I assume you sleep), how do you fight the darkness, and the evil concealed within it :(
[04:43:42] <wolfyshy> I used to just go to sleep when it was light out
[04:43:46] <wolfyshy> it's a lot more comfortable
[04:43:52] * JustAberrant nods
[04:43:55] <wolfyshy> but between work and family life I can't do that any more :/
[04:44:06] <JustAberrant> interestingly, I used to sleep a lot with the lights on
[04:44:08] <JustAberrant> not on purpose
[04:44:08] <wolfyshy> it's sad, sometimes I get so bothered by the dark I wake up.
[04:44:21] <Brolf_pog> hmm?
[04:44:24] <JustAberrant> I'd just work crazy hours and basically pass out on my bed with my cloths on and the lights still on
[04:44:25] <Brolf_pog> intereting
[04:44:48] <JustAberrant> the weird thing is, I switched to LED bulbs.. and I can't sleep with them on
[04:44:55] <JustAberrant> something about the light is just.. blinding.. when trying to sleep
[04:45:09] <JustAberrant> and also, weird @ wolfyshy ;p
[04:45:42] <wolfyshy> it's one of the worst feelings in the world tbh
[04:45:51] <wolfyshy> waking up with your heart pounding in a cold sweat because you know it's dark.
[04:45:59] <wolfyshy> and yeah... it is really weird/bizarre
[04:48:47] <Brolf_pog> i'm not really bothered by the dark
[04:48:49] <Brolf_pog> but...
[04:49:00] <Brolf_pog> i know it's not always comfortable
[04:49:18] <Brolf_pog> and if you start panicking for any reason, it becomes suffocating in the dark,
