[07:29:28] <Eywind> The problem is that Dash spent too much time in the sky this ep
[07:29:30] <Eywind> which means no Scootaloo
[07:29:30] <wobniaR> *Distant autotuned rainbow daashhh*
[07:29:35] <DJMidli> lool
[07:29:36] <DJMidli> seriously
[07:29:42] <DJMidli> it was a bit too dash centric for me
[07:29:44] <DJMidli> and that song
[07:29:46] <DJMidli> waaaaaay to long
[07:29:47] <Eywind> it was a Dash episode :/
[07:29:48] <DJMidli> its like
[07:29:49] <DJMidli> okay
[07:29:51] <DJMidli> you can stop now
[07:29:56] <Twilight> How is everypony
[07:30:00] <DJMidli> nope? gonna make it a full broadway musical
[07:30:00] <DJMidli> okay
[07:30:05] <Eywind> I was fine since Dash doesn't ever really get lead singing parts
[07:30:12] <Eywind> like she was half of find a pet and had some eqg songs
[07:30:20] <DJMidli> i am wishing i could sleep Twilight
[07:30:21] <Eywind> but the former was more talking than singing
[07:30:52] <Kelazi5> I liked the song, and besides, it was only 2 and half minutes not that long
[07:30:53] <Hamtramck> eywind it's called hiphop

[17:30:29] <RandomNinja> I can haz?
[17:32:47] <WildSoft> nah, only the prescription kind is really any good
[17:32:57] <RandomNinja> true but it's morphine based
[17:33:11] <WildSoft> are you a recovering addict?
[17:33:33] <WildSoft> don't think the amount is that much
[17:33:53] <RandomNinja> nope but last time I used it for a while I had really unpleasant withdrawal for a day or so
[17:34:02] <WildSoft> really o0
[17:34:11] <WildSoft> Never noticed, but we're all different
[17:34:39] <WildSoft> Your better off with honey, lemon and hot water =)
[17:34:51] <RandomNinja> yeah honey is amazing

[17:36:54] * DerpyBot beeps her muffin on the nose and laughs

[17:37:00] <RandomNinja> because they actually work
[17:37:11] <WildSoft> Everything can be abused

[17:37:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> yay edward snowden
[17:37:59] <RandomNinja> does anyone not abuse caffeine? :P
[17:38:30] <WildSoft> Me :(
[17:38:35] <RandomNinja> madness
[17:38:59] <WildSoft> I get palpitations if I get too much in me
[17:39:25] <RandomNinja> that's why you only drink enough to get past withdrawal and wake up :P
[17:40:56] <WildSoft> saw a BBC series called "The Truth About" in particular "The Truth About Your Medicine"
[17:41:23] <WildSoft> a doctor there test a lot of things, cough medicine amongst others
[17:41:44] <RandomNinja> "most medicine that actually does anything has a good chance of side effects"?
[17:42:27] <WildSoft> they came to the conclusion that a home made one is just as good if not better and chemical and side effect free
[17:42:51] <RandomNinja> that doesn't sound right
[17:42:51] <WildSoft> Hot water, some honey and lemon
[17:43:05] <WildSoft> over the counter ones
[17:43:12] <WildSoft> they don't test the prescription ones
[17:43:15] <Cloud_Zephyr> wait wut, theres more to the interview than the 9 min interview about wut datas the nsa can steal
[17:43:23] * RandomNinja steals Cloud_Zephyr's data
[17:43:27] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuu
[17:43:56] <RandomNinja> I'm willing to bet morphine will help more than anything you can put together from household ingredients though
[17:44:13] <RandomNinja> for when you actually need it, that is
[17:44:21] <WildSoft> [Sun-17:43:03]	<WildSoft>	over the counter ones
[17:44:22] <WildSoft> [Sun-17:43:10]	<WildSoft>	they don't test the prescription ones
[17:44:28] <RandomNinja> yeah
[17:44:50] <RandomNinja> http://i.imgur.com/eCpGJBU.jpg
[17:45:28] <WildSoft> the morphine based one is also to expand the airways and dissolve mucus 
[17:46:17] <WildSoft> and suppress the cough reflex
[17:46:47] <RandomNinja> sounds reasonable
[17:47:19] <WildSoft> the home made is is just to "coat" the back of the throat and prevent irritation which leads to coughing
[17:47:32] * Cloud_Zephyr monitors RandomNinja 
[17:47:42] <RandomNinja> obviously both is the superior solution
[17:47:59] <RandomNinja> since honey is side effect free unless you have diabetes
[17:48:18] <WildSoft> you can still have sugar even if your a diabetic o0
[17:48:34] <RandomNinja> yeah but it's like 80% sugar so you might want to keep it in mind
[17:48:40] <RandomNinja> can't have too much
[17:49:04] <WildSoft> no, sugar is everywhere today
[17:49:08] <WildSoft> not good
[17:49:51] <WildSoft> BBC The Truth About Sugar was also very informative ^^
[17:50:08] <WildSoft> (yes I watch a lot of documentaries and stuff :P)

[19:30:12] <wobniaR> 12/10 too much water keekle
[19:30:13] <Eywind> keekle this season is weird
[19:30:17] <keekle> it seemed good?
[19:30:21] <keekle> but.. also.. hmm
[19:30:28] <RandomNinja> keekle next episode: RD facing domestic terrorism charges
[19:30:41] <wobniaR> pls no spoilers
[19:30:51] <keekle> its like they are trying to push the boundaries.. 
[19:30:52] <Eywind> The season feels different already
[19:31:11] <wobniaR> Like season 4 pushing boundaries? Dat season opener and ending
[19:31:26] <keekle> well they are not going small
[19:31:37] <keekle> everything seems.. momentous somehow
[19:32:00] <keekle> that crying scene though haha

[19:33:19] <RandomNinja> also, references: the episode
[19:33:24] <keekle> hahah
[19:33:26] <Eywind> yeah Larson took credit for that
[19:33:26] <RandomNinja> dash confirmed Cave Johnson
[19:33:40] <keekle> i saw he was listed as story edito
[19:33:43] <keekle> editor
[19:33:56] <wobniaR> It was of a moral imperative for Hasbro to let that reference go
[19:33:57] <keekle> even though cindy morrow wrote it
[19:34:02] <Eywind> wow wobniaR
[19:34:12] <RandomNinja> also winter is coming

[19:35:37] <RandomNinja> still applies
[19:36:13] <Eywind> I think the whole season the faces have been huge
[19:36:13] <wobniaR> I see people taking MLP episodes wayyy too seriously as the issue
[19:36:29] <Eywind> wobniaR that's the community
[19:36:33] <RandomNinja> horses are serious business

[19:38:07] <keekle> but now i even doubt that
[19:38:11] <Eywind> Wat why?
[19:38:46] <Eywind> I thought the song sounded really good
[19:38:49] <keekle> maybe because i have become cynical.  i keep thinking they want me to like it so then i cant
[19:38:50] <keekle> haha
[19:38:56] <keekle> but i think i did

[23:02:03] <EM-C> I'm happy to announce that smitty and I have recorded our very first podcast.
[23:02:14] <Eywind> I thought that was 'going nowhere fast'
[23:02:30] <EM-C> It doesn't sound very professional, as it was all recorded live and spur-of-the-moment.  No music...not even a title yet.
[23:02:40] <Eywind> no clue LocDogX86X don't see anything on twitter
[23:02:44] <EM-C> But I'd like to think we'll settle down into a groove eventually.

[23:02:58] <EM-C> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHP-WMHON0Y&feature=youtu.be
[23:03:20] <EM-C> Be forewarned...my voice is NOT pretty.  And I sound like I'm plugged up with snot.  I always have.
[23:03:31] <EM-C> I hate my voice, actually.  But it's the only one I have.
[23:03:44] <thereallynewmop12100_> Oh
[23:03:52] <thereallynewmop12100_> still playin' GTA
[23:04:03] <Eywind> then go play GTA
[23:04:06] <Eywind> lol
[23:04:10] <EM-C> Maybe...maybe being ashamed of one's voice is like being ashamed of one's cutie mark.  Maybe we should embrace our voices, no matter how weird or upleasant they sound.
