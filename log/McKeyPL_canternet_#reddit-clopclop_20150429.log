[14:56:26] <Setzertrancer> But I come here so rarely.

[16:15:16] <bad_rooster> so, once we were on some school trip
[16:15:48] <bad_rooster> back in the days when we were like 16 y.o. and some guy brings booze, right. Of course they found out. And so they start checking our bags and what not
[16:15:58] <Squirrelly> Dildos?
[16:16:09] <Squirrelly> Please tell me somebody's backpack was entirely filled with dildos
[16:16:14] <Squirrelly> Preferably dog dildos

[16:16:32] <Vulpixbrew> Squirrelly wants to be filled with dildos
[16:16:38] <bad_rooster> and I came here not horny to tell a story
[16:16:40] <bad_rooster> and here we go
[16:16:52] <bad_rooster> and there is this guy, packing some weed, right
[16:17:01] <bad_rooster> so he is like OH SNAP OH SNAP, we gotta hide this!
[16:17:10] <bad_rooster> So I lend him my enegry drink can and he stuffs it in
[16:17:29] <Squirrelly> lol
[16:17:39] <bad_rooster> Well, the thing is it was only half empty. And the weed bag wasn't really tight, so it got wet.
[16:17:46] <Squirrelly> ewwwwwwwwwwwwww

[16:42:40] <bad_rooster> well I guess the point is that suddenly, the hut was full of weed smoke. We couldn't think straight and somepony was like: DAYUMN, we gotta find another weed
[16:42:53] <bad_rooster> and he started picking up the flowers from behind the cottage that we pissed on
[16:42:58] <bad_rooster> before

[16:49:03] <bad_rooster> and they had to disassemble it
[16:49:06] <bad_rooster> that was golden
[16:50:59] <bad_rooster> and once I had to wear all that skiing gear and I kept forgetting what I should wear, so I got my skiing shoes on, then realised I need the suit thingy, so I put it off and stuff
[16:52:03] <bad_rooster> and it took me like 30 mins and everypony was getting impatient so when I finally got the shoes on
[16:52:28] <bad_rooster> and realized the stairs down are extra slippery and I am wearing plastic shoes, I was like "whatever"
[16:52:48] <bad_rooster> I slipped on the first stair and took a dive head first :D that was fun stuff

[17:06:36] <bad_rooster> which league? O-o
[17:06:39] <bad_rooster> I am confused
[17:06:57] <Pony387> I quit league because I had a bad game recently where I was doing everything right and I still lost because my team mates were oblivious. Like one person farming bot and another person getting red while 3 of us were trying to prep to steal baron.
[17:06:58] <Squirrelly> League of Legends
[17:07:03] <bad_rooster> ooh
[17:07:05] <Pony387> things like that
[17:07:08] <bad_rooster> I was thinking baseball league
[17:07:09] <bad_rooster> lol
[17:07:16] <Squirrelly> Sooooo you quit league because people were people
[17:07:17] <Squirrelly> K
[17:07:23] <bad_rooster> that was america-rasist
[17:07:23] <Katiepony> hehe
[17:07:24] <bad_rooster> I guess
[17:07:47] <Pony387> and I just decided that enough was enough. I've been grinding it out game after game after game like this for months and I just can't stand the volatility of the game anymore
[17:07:58] <Pony387> especially when each game is 40 minutes on average
[17:08:23] <Pony387> I just don't have the time or the patience to dedicate to league anymore.
[17:08:31] <Squirrelly> Eh
[17:08:36] <Squirrelly> I just play a game or two a day
[17:08:38] <Squirrelly> Works for me

[17:10:05] <bad_rooster> Pony387: that's a good thing!
[17:10:10] <Squirrelly> And started being part of your self-worth
[17:10:15] <bad_rooster> Happy for you :3
[17:10:25] <Squirrelly> Once it wasn't fun and you weren't winning, it wasn't worth it
[17:10:54] <Pony387> It's not about self-worth to me it's about not wanting to waste time. Like I just can't sit there and retreat for 40 minutes waiting for something to happen. It's boring and it's frustrating because it's just a waste of time.
[17:11:25] <sparklesbright> beep
[17:11:28] <Pony387> Even if it doesn't happen every game it happens often enough that I just couldn't do it.
[17:12:04] <Squirrelly> Just play arams
[17:12:09] <Pony387> no
[17:12:16] <Pony387> I don't want to play league
[17:12:35] <Katiepony> Try hearthstone
[17:12:41] <Katiepony> Everyone knows that's the only real esport.
[17:12:59] <Pony387> hearthstone is even more random tho
[17:13:06] <Pony387> it's a card game
[17:13:56] <Katiepony> 100% skill
[17:14:05] <Katiepony> You think you can get good RNG without skill? pff
[17:14:07] <bad_rooster> agreed^
[17:14:31] <Squirrelly> Hearthstone is actually VERY skill-based
[17:14:42] <Squirrelly> Same with Magic
[17:14:57] <bad_rooster> yea, my bf plays it a lot and it seems to be skill based
[17:15:12] <bad_rooster> it depends on what the oponent has tho
[17:15:31] <Squirrelly> Well yeah
[17:15:37] <Squirrelly> That's where part of the skill comes in
[17:15:50] <Pony387> I disagree whole heartedly. All it takes is for you to put in time to build a decent deck then draw cards and see what you can do. Any strategy in it is going to be extremely basic and easy.
[17:16:15] <Squirrelly> You have to do a thousand micro-calculations and figure out what your opponent has based on what they do, how they do it, and what they DON'T do
[17:16:28] <Pony387> Plus hearthstone is computerized and the match making system forces you to go against your counters over and over if you win too much
[17:16:30] <Squirrelly> You have to figure out what you could draw that could possibly help you, and how it could help you
[17:16:44] <Squirrelly> It actually doesn't, lol
[17:16:50] <Katiepony> wat
[17:17:00] <Squirrelly> It's not like it says "OH! You're good. We're gonna make you face mech mage over and over."
[17:17:08] <Squirrelly> Do you know anything about programming???
[17:17:15] <bad_rooster> Squirrelly: I do
[17:17:16] <bad_rooster> why? :3
[17:17:24] <Squirrelly> Because that's not how it works
[17:17:27] <bad_rooster> oh.
[17:17:30] <Squirrelly> lol
[17:17:33] <bad_rooster> xD
[17:17:49] <Pony387> The match making system in that game much like the league match making has algorithms built in to keep your win rate near 50%
[17:17:58] <Squirrelly> Magic is an extremely skill-based game as well. Even more-so than HS
[17:18:16] <Pony387> well yeah because you can't be rng countered by the match making system
[17:18:23] <Pony387> but it's still the same
[17:18:24] <Squirrelly> Right....
[17:18:27] <Squirrelly> Ummmm
[17:18:32] * Evelina takes up a donations fund.
[17:18:37] <Katiepony> O.o
[17:18:42] <Katiepony> The match making is based on rank.
[17:18:45] <Squirrelly> If that's the case, how come there are "better players" who, through skill, have a higher win percentage
[17:18:46] <Katiepony> Rank is based on win percentage.
[17:19:40] <Pony387> whatever
[17:20:27] <Pony387> anyways I don't want to play league and I don't want to play hearth stone because they aren't fun to me. The biggest issue I have with both games is the time it takes to do anything.

[17:20:30] <FineLine> [ 95 Percent of Hearthstone Games Are Won Through Complete Chance ... ]
[17:20:39] <Squirrelly> That's some good satire
[17:20:41] <bad_rooster> lol
[17:20:52] <bad_rooster> Squirrelly: It's like
[17:20:59] <bad_rooster> a made up statistic by definition
[17:21:06] <Squirrelly> what is?
[17:21:12] <Evelina> Nice
[17:21:20] <bad_rooster> give me 2 hours and I'd give you a mathematical proof you cannot say stuff like that
[17:21:24] <bad_rooster> that is
[17:21:32] <bad_rooster> I would give it to you
[17:21:33] <Squirrelly> Oh the article lol
[17:21:37] <bad_rooster> if I wasn't busy fappin
[17:21:37] <bad_rooster> yea
[17:21:39] <Squirrelly> Yeah it's hilarious
[17:22:04] <bad_rooster> I mean, there is no possible way you can say that
[17:22:08] <Squirrelly> I mean sure, maybe if everybody only played Facehunter, then there'd be a little less skill involved overall
[17:22:28] <Squirrelly> But even then, choosing when to trade vs go face in itself is a huge decision, and highly skill-based
[17:22:36] <Evelina> Unstable Portal best card
[17:22:40] <Squirrelly> ROFL
[17:22:45] <Squirrelly> Okay yeah, I fucking love that card
[17:23:16] <Squirrelly> I think my favorite thing in the game is the single player class challenge where your entire deck is unstable portals
[17:23:29] <bad_rooster> Squirrelly: I am not even sure what that says
[17:23:38] <Squirrelly> lol
[17:23:42] <Pony387> I think my favorite strategy game is chess because time in chess passes way faster
[17:23:44] <Squirrelly> Have you played HS?
[17:23:51] <bad_rooster> Squirrelly: if it says that by choosing a card by random you can win 95% of the games, that can be easily debunked
[17:24:03] <Squirrelly> Sweetie, it was a joke
[17:24:07] <Squirrelly> It's satire
[17:24:12] <Squirrelly> Like south park
[17:24:30] <bad_rooster> Squirrelly: you mean me?
[17:24:42] <Squirrelly> yep
[17:24:50] <bad_rooster> ooh
[17:24:53] <Squirrelly> That article was satre
[17:24:54] <bad_rooster> sorry :X I haven't opened it
[17:24:55] <Squirrelly> *satire
[17:24:57] <Squirrelly> It's fine
[17:25:01] <bad_rooster> now I look even more like a fool
[17:25:01] <bad_rooster> sigh
[17:25:18] <Squirrelly> It's like some of the old articles by "churches" that said how evil pokemon were
[17:25:27] <Squirrelly> God I loved those
[17:25:36] <Pony387> squirrly do you play chess at all?
[17:25:40] <Squirrelly> I used to
[17:25:50] <bad_rooster> me too :3
[17:25:53] <Evelina> Squirrelly is a bishop
[17:25:57] <Squirrelly> I prefer my chess to have guns or swords or magic in it
[17:26:00] <bad_rooster> Evelina: ?
[17:26:05] <Squirrelly> OOooohhhh I love bishops
[17:26:07] <Squirrelly> :3
[17:26:21] <Squirrelly> not the real ones
[17:26:25] <bad_rooster> aw-
[17:26:38] <Pony387> I like knights cause they're decieving
[17:26:43] <Squirrelly> Though as a catholic school girl, whenever I met a bishop he was always this cute, nice old man
[17:26:46] <Katiepony> Also they're horses.
[17:26:50] <Katiepony> And horses are cute.
[17:26:55] <Squirrelly> You're cute
[17:26:56] <Squirrelly> :P
[17:26:57] <bad_rooster> mhm :3 I like queen
[17:26:59] <Evelina> I'm trying the hutner challenge
[17:27:00] <bad_rooster> cuz she is powerful :3
[17:27:07] <Squirrelly> hutner challenge?
[17:27:14] <Squirrelly> I also like Queen
[17:27:29] <Pony387> some people just need queen to step on their king if you know what I mean
[17:27:32] <Pony387> wink wink wink
[17:27:34] <Pony387> nudge
[17:27:35] <Pony387> fuc
[17:27:45] <Squirrelly> Seven Seas of Rhye, Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy, you know, that stuff
[17:27:48] <Evelina> Hunter challenge from hearthstone
[17:27:54] <Squirrelly> Oooohhhh
[17:27:57] <Evelina> entire deck is webspinners
[17:28:00] <Squirrelly> Yeah rofl
[17:28:05] <Squirrelly> That one's silly too
[17:28:48] <Pony387> I like shooters more because there's more action in them
[17:28:57] <Pony387> time passes more fluidly for me

[17:29:22] <Pony387> Plus in something like counterstrike if you're good enough you can get 5 head shots in a row and win single handedly
[17:29:34] <Pony387> which makes things a bit less team reliant sometimes
[17:29:43] <Pony387> and I like that
[17:29:45] <Squirrelly> And that's....good?
[17:29:56] <Squirrelly> I prefer my team-based games to actually USE a team
[17:29:59] <Squirrelly> Like Battlefield
[17:30:06] <sparklesbright> cloppyhooves!!! :3
[17:30:18] <cloppyhooves> Hi sparklesbright c:
[17:30:27] <Pony387> Well I don't like team based games because I rarely get team mates that understand how to play a team based game
[17:30:44] <Pony387> for instance in league I can't tell you how many times I've had tanks split pushing
[17:31:03] <Pony387> at least 200 or more games that has happened to me
[17:31:16] <Squirrelly> Welllll have you tried talking to them nicely instead of telling them how much of a f***** they are and insulting their mom?
[17:31:33] <Evelina> This should go to PMs
[17:31:40] <Squirrelly> Yeah I'm gonna stop, sorry
[17:34:26] <sparklesbright> Hiya cloppy. How's things?
[17:34:51] <cloppyhooves> Tired D:
[17:34:56] * cloppyhooves falls over
[17:35:00] * Squirrelly snuggles up to cloppy
[17:35:08] * Squirrelly is flattened by the falling fox
[17:35:10] <Katiepony> Hey cloppy
[17:35:48] * cloppyhooves yelps and sleepily gets back up to snuggle with squirrel without crushing
[17:35:52] <cloppyhooves> Hi Katiepony c:
[17:36:38] * Squirrelly nuzzles her cheek against cloppy
[17:37:21] <sparklesbright> I'd pester about making sure to get enough sleep, but that would mmake me a hypocrite right now...
[17:37:52] <sparklesbright> Also, hiya Katiepony , Squirrelly
[17:37:55] <cloppyhooves> It's hard to keep my eyes open but I can't drink coffee yet :C
[17:38:01] <sparklesbright> :3
[17:39:18] <sparklesbright> I never did get the hang of coffee...
[17:39:34] <Pony387> I love coffee it tastes so good

[18:14:23] <Squirrelly> consider her mostly afk
[18:14:27] <Pony387> she's in space
[18:14:28] <bad_rooster> ooooh I see.
[18:14:30] <bad_rooster> lol
[18:14:32] <bad_rooster> Kerbal?
[18:14:34] <bad_rooster> Pony387: I couldn't
[18:14:43] <bad_rooster> clop
[18:15:04] <bad_rooster> once I say horny stuff to someponeh, I can't :C
[18:15:09] <bad_rooster> cuz that would be rong
[18:15:10] <bad_rooster> I think
[18:15:12] <Melon_Phone> she's funding her trip to Mars, $5 at a time
[18:15:22] <bad_rooster> hey I honestly wanna get to mars
[18:15:23] <bad_rooster> crap
[18:15:33] <bad_rooster> now I realised that not everypony will get to Mars
[18:15:42] <bad_rooster> which makes it easy to trace me back in future :X
[18:15:48] <bad_rooster> now that I've said that
[18:16:01] <bad_rooster> well, once I get here, I don't clop that day
[18:16:09] <bad_rooster> which Is why I act silly once here
[18:16:14] <Pony387> It's okay you can just use one of those fancy dream machine to implant memories of going to mars in your brain
[18:16:25] <bad_rooster> nah
[18:16:27] <Pony387> that way you can be to mars and not actually be to mars at the same time
[18:16:30] <bad_rooster> I am studyin robotics
[18:16:37] <bad_rooster> so :3 I'll make it
[18:16:41] <bad_rooster> in all srsness tho
[18:17:18] <bad_rooster> it kinda makes me insecure when I am in a chat and I say something odd
[18:17:23] <Pony387> I dream of a day where they can make a self sustaining machine with an endless ammount of perfect coffee
[18:17:26] <bad_rooster> and then don't get reply for like next 3 hours
[18:17:38] <bad_rooster> Pony387: bad news is it'd need to recycle crap
[18:17:48] <bad_rooster> good news is that there IS already a coffee made out of crap
[18:17:54] <bad_rooster> (no, srsly, look it up)
[18:18:02] <bad_rooster> it's super expensive
[18:18:14] * bad_rooster boops Evelina 
[18:18:20] <Pony387> well I was thinking like in the machine there would be rapidly growing cocao trees
[18:18:32] <bad_rooster> well
[18:18:42] <bad_rooster> I would like to research self sustainable environments
[18:18:42] <bad_rooster> :3
[18:19:14] <bad_rooster> aaaand I killed the chat
[18:19:19] <bad_rooster> also, I have a pretty huge dick
[18:19:35] <Melon_Phone> the volunteer Mars trip was fake
[18:19:42] <bad_rooster> yea irk
[18:20:09] <Pony387> And they would grow fast for each cup and the trees would have their beans taken out and then refined into coffee grounds then water would be boiled and run through the coffee beans and it would come down with 3 table spoons of creamer and 3 table spoons of sugar but before it would let you grab the cup it would cool it down just enough to where it isn't goin
[18:20:19] <Pony387> g to burn your tongue but it will still be warm
[18:20:32] <Pony387> if only ;-;
[18:20:37] <bad_rooster> and the steam would come off it
[18:20:41] <bad_rooster> and power a fuck machine
[18:20:41] <bad_rooster> :3
[18:20:52] <Pony387> I dunno about that
[18:20:58] <bad_rooster> I'd buy that
[18:21:14] <Pony387> can you send me a picture of your penis? you said it was big
[18:21:16] <bad_rooster> and it could also sew mlp plushies
