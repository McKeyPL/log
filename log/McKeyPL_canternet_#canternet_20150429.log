[09:00:02] <DrelvanianGuard> I know it is internet. but apparently some people on internet don't like people talking about wanting to meet famous people that are on the internet.
[09:00:21] <Electron> probably
[09:00:31] <Electron> some mods just like to show their power
[09:00:41] <Electron> and push the button
[09:01:09] <DrelvanianGuard> I've actually done worse before on the chat.. and even actually trolled admins but I've never been banned from it before.
[09:01:35] <DrelvanianGuard> i didnt recognise his name.. he must have been a new guy thats never met me before.
[09:01:49] <DrelvanianGuard> I could become horse famous by being weird... :D

[10:00:03] <DrelvanianGuard> I have no idea what they are protesting.
[10:00:57] <DrelvanianGuard> it started out supposedly being blacks rioting because of racism.. but even Black people are calling them idiots. And a guy even said Martin Luthur King Jr would be dissapointed in them.
