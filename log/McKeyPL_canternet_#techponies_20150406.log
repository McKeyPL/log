[09:10:08] <Moonlightning> So how does mlockall() work with shared libraries?
[09:11:08] <Gigabit> It politely asks the shared library for help :p

[09:12:24] <Moonlightning> <Gigabit> Holy some bitch.. That's hot
[09:12:26] <Moonlightning> I'm quoting this
[09:12:38] <AppleDash> lol
[09:12:44] <Phase4> Moonlightning, i'd assume it's a kernel side toggle
[09:12:57] <Gigabit> Do I get royalties?
[09:13:23] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: depends. Do you accept sexual favors as payment?
[09:13:56] <Moonlightning> Phase4: I mean more for counting memory allocations. There's a limit to how much a process can have mlocked
[09:14:34] <Phase4> Moonlightning, RLIMIT_MEMLOCK (ignored if the process has CAP_IPC_LOCK)
[09:14:54] <Gigabit> Maybe
[09:15:43] <AppleDash> he does
[09:17:03] <Moonlightning> Phase4: right, but are shared libraries counted completely toward a process's limit? What if that process isn't the only one using the library? What if that process isn't the only one that has the library mlocked?
[09:17:48] <Gigabit>  AppleDash I need monies more though!
[09:18:12] <Phase4> Moonlightning, from the kernels perspective, shared libraries are no different to normal program code
[09:18:22] <Phase4> and mlock is about preventing pages from being swapped
[09:18:33] <Phase4> not a lock, despite the name
[09:18:38] <Moonlightning> I know.
[09:18:43] <AppleDash> :P
[09:19:08] <Phase4> i'm not sure entirely how mapped files are treated, if they're loaded to ram i'd assume it's shared between processes
[09:19:26] <Moonlightning> yes, that's my understanding of how shared libraries work
[09:19:43] <Moonlightning> Let's say shared library L is being used by exactly two running processes, A and B
[09:20:17] <Phase4> there's a depricated syscall for loading shared libraries, but these days it's done in /lib/ld.so.* via mmap()
[09:20:40] <Moonlightning> If A and B are both idle or not using code from the library, the library might be swapped out to disk, yes?
[09:21:27] <Phase4> Moonlightning, map page says ALL mapped pages are kept in ram
[09:21:34] <Phase4> including memory mapped files
[09:22:06] <Phase4> so shared libraries will remain loaded and it should share that memory among mappings in different processes
[09:22:32] <Moonlightning> Hmmmm.
[09:23:56] <Moonlightning> Okay. Even so.
[09:24:23] <Moonlightning> The library is kept in RAM because of both A /and/ B.
[09:24:34] <Moonlightning> How should it count toward each process's RAM usage limit?
[09:24:48] <Phase4> if either mlocks() the library, it will remain in memory
[09:25:14] <Phase4> iirc shared memory is accounted to each process
[09:25:22] <Phase4> that's a terrible way to say it
[09:25:33] <Moonlightning> Thought it'd remain in memory, anyway, by virtue of the fact that there were running processes that used it
[09:25:39] <Phase4> it doesn't consider shared memory 'less expensive' because it's shared
[09:26:40] <Phase4> though i think there's patches to do 'fair' shared memory accounting
[09:26:52] *** Quits: Nick (nobody@Pony-rgmjhl.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[09:27:19] <Moonlightning> Well, no, but you could either add the entire size of the library to each process that uses it, or you could split it up, in this case adding half the size to each A and B
[09:27:32] <Phase4> the entire size is added to each process
[09:27:54] <Phase4> the 'fair' patches split amongst processes hlding that memory
[09:27:59] <Phase4> holding'
[09:28:48] *** Quits: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning) (Quit: *poof*)
[09:29:36] <Moonlightning> That raises another issue, though.
[09:30:15] <Moonlightning> What happens on a system with the “fair” patch if a process exits, and that would make another process go over the limit because of a common shared library?
[09:30:34] <Phase4> i'd assume so
[09:31:06] <Phase4> only vaguely aware of the fair patchset, forgotten what it's actually called
[09:31:58] <Moonlightning> I asked what happens though
[09:32:02] *** Joins: Nick (nobody@Pony-rgmjhl.res.rr.com)
[09:32:57] <Phase4> Moonlightning, i'd assume it'd increase the memory usage of other processes holding that memory
[09:32:59] *** Gigabit is now known as GigaZzz
[09:33:09] <Phase4> potentially going over its limit, not sure how that would be handled
[09:33:19] <Phase4> but that sort of nonsense is why upstream doesn't do that :P
[09:34:29] <Moonlightning> well, the obvious thing to do is just let that be and deny further allocations
[09:34:55] <Moonlightning> alternately, you could completely separate shared libraries from other memory accounting
[09:37:55] <Phase4> Moonlightning, well i don't think file backed mappings are normally accounted because they can be swapped out whenever the kernel pleases
[09:38:31] <Phase4> well they're accounted as virutal memory but not to the resident size
[09:39:10] <Moonlightning> …that makes sense. Also, I've heard it before.
[09:39:24] <Moonlightning> and library loadings would be by definition file-backed, yeah?
[09:39:39] <Moonlightning> …wait a sec. What if the library file gets deleted?
[09:43:49] <Phase4> Moonlightning, 'unlinked', the inode remains until there's no open descriptors

[09:53:14] <Phase4> inodes are cool
[09:53:55] <Phase4> in fat the filename is bound to the actual allocation
[09:54:30] <Phase4> which is why you can't delete open files on windows, despite ntfs having inode-like indirection and hardlinks, dos compatibility
[09:54:54] <Phase4> program has to explicitly allow concurrent deletion
[09:55:14] <Phase4> which blocks the file from also being opened by anything that doesn't allow concurrent deletion
