[05:18:59] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, they want windows installed in your refrigerator

[05:19:52] <Twilightlicious> Oh, i get it now. :P
[05:20:35] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, in practice android is dominating any market embedded windows would go in, and if its not android it's some custom crap
[05:20:54] <Sol> Basically skynet
[05:21:00] <Phase4> television makers in particular are really fond of making their own operating systems
[05:21:32] <Twilightlicious> So that tablet im looking into buying, it's x86 with Windows 8.1
[05:21:41] <Phase4> seems a bit costly imo, but meh, as long as it lets frames through unmodified
[05:21:53] <Twilightlicious> but it's got 32GB of Internal storage, how does storage work on such a device?
[05:22:10] <Twilightlicious> Isn't Windows like 40GB? lol
[05:22:21] <Phase4> ~20GB iirc
[05:22:29] <Twilightlicious> yeah, Mine is 24.8GB
[05:22:34] <Twilightlicious> But still
[05:22:40] <Twilightlicious> You understand my question, i think :P
[05:22:45] <Phase4> + pagefile.sys and hiberfile.sys
[05:22:51] <Twilightlicious> Will i only have like 10GB of usable storage?
[05:22:53] <Phase4> + reserved space
[05:22:57] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, Probably less
[05:23:01] <Twilightlicious> or is there another drive/partition that spec sheets arent showing
[05:23:37] <Sol> The 32gb surfaces claimed to have 18gb available still
[05:24:00] <Twilightlicious> Then again, it DOES have a MicroSD slot, so perhaps it's correct that i'll only have like 8GB of space from as soon as i get it lol
[05:24:10] <Phase4> and microsoft claims their opperating system is secure, point being?
[05:24:26] <Sol> :)
[05:25:17] <Twilightlicious> Q~Q
[05:25:25] <Twilightlicious> i don't wanna have to deal with my system drive being 32GB lol
[05:25:27] <Twilightlicious> that can't be true
[05:25:52] <Phase4> how much ram does it have?
[05:26:01] <Twilightlicious> hardly enough to run windows =D
[05:26:02] <Twilightlicious> Lol
[05:26:04] <Twilightlicious> 1GB
[05:26:22] <Phase4> that's not hardly enough, it's quite simply not enough
[05:26:36] <Twilightlicious> hey, i've seen people run Minecraft on it
[05:26:37] <Twilightlicious> :P
[05:26:50] <Phase4> and it lagged like mad didn't it
[05:26:57] <Sol> You can make it work...but at that point, why Windows?
[05:28:18] <Twilightlicious> no it ran at a playable framerate
[05:28:31] <Twilightlicious> Sol, I need support for Windows Applications
[05:28:36] <Twilightlicious> Better support than i could get from Wine
[05:28:40] <Phase4> i'm a bit skeptical of that
[05:28:58] <Twilightlicious> Phase4, it has an impressive CPU for the price
[05:28:59] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, anything in particular wine couldn't run? or just games
[05:29:12] <Twilightlicious> Wine could probably run it, but i just want Windows
[05:29:19] <Phase4> fair enough

[05:29:28] <Sol> I figured it was safe to assume games weren't a consideration, considering the specs
[05:29:39] <Twilightlicious> yeah i'm not really looking to play games on it.
[05:30:13] <Sol> But am curious to what Windows-specific applications you could possibly need on a tablet
[05:30:13] <Twilightlicious> I'm looking to do all the other things i do on my Desktop PC at home, Such as IRC, my Media Players, Web Browser, Etc. Without having to compromise with a terrible "mobile version" of everything.
[05:31:01] * Phase4 would recommend against windows 8
[05:31:03] <Twilightlicious> My connection at home is terrible, so i need a device i can take out to download things, For example, MMORPGs, which, both their downloaders and updaters are windows binaries.

[05:33:31] <JustAberrant> sure, orange star blue tooth
[05:33:33] <JustAberrant> what about it?
[05:33:35] <Phase4> it's orthagonal to the 'desktop' and a huge interuption to have to jump between metro and non-metro just to get anything done
[05:34:01] <Phase4> and then when you try mix metro and desktop apps it gets even more confusing
[05:34:02] <JustAberrant> Twilightlicious: I would assume so
[05:34:17] <Phase4> which is hard to avoid with all the metro apps being default

[05:35:22] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, i think its a poor choice but if it works for you go nuts
[05:35:40] <JustAberrant> I wouldn't even give someone that
[05:35:47] <JustAberrant> like, just about everything is subjective..
[05:35:52] <JustAberrant> except metro is objecively terrible

[05:36:17] <JustAberrant> praising it without being paid to do so would seem a symptom of some kind of disorder

[06:03:29] <AppleDash> Hey guys, quick question
[06:03:34] *** Joins: init3 (jason@init3.Is.Not.A.Clever.Poni)
[06:03:40] <AppleDash> Is there any way to access the console of an ESXi VM over like, SSH?
[06:03:44] <AppleDash> Or some way in a terminal?
[06:04:38] <init3> Not sure I am understanding you. Is there a reason you can't do a normal SSH directly to the VM?
[06:04:50] <AppleDash> Yes
[06:04:55] <AppleDash> Because I'm installing the VM's OS.
[06:04:59] <init3> Ooh
[06:05:15] <init3> I think ESX lets you do a console VNC connection iirc. 
[06:05:39] <init3> I mean, do you have the vsphere thingy? 
[06:06:11] <AppleDash> Yeah, I do
[06:06:27] <AppleDash> It's just really horrible and laggy for doing something like editing the network interfaces file to get a network connection initially
[06:06:55] <init3> Herm. It was always a little slow for me. 
[06:07:15] <init3> Shouldn't be so horrible you can't stand it though. 
[06:07:41] <init3> Most of the hypervisors I've used as of late are OSS ones. 
[06:07:54] <init3> Many of them do allow a direct VNC console connection. 
[06:07:56] <AppleDash> It's even worse when performing a Windows install
[06:08:04] <init3> Yeah
[06:08:07] <AppleDash> You need to wait like 10 seconds between mouse movements and seeing it update on the screen
[06:08:13] <init3> Oh wow
[06:08:38] <AppleDash> It took me a good hour to install Windows Server and enable RDP, not including the actual unattended install time
[06:08:48] <init3> I mean, it shouldn't be that way. 
[06:09:08] <AppleDash> But it was
[06:09:17] <init3> Do you have a vsphere client on your workstation or are you RDPing a server with vsphere?
[06:09:17] <AppleDash> Keep in mind, I'm in Canada and server is in France
[06:09:29] <AppleDash> ping is only like 150ms though
[06:09:31] <init3> Still though. 
[06:09:32] <init3> Right
[06:09:37] <AppleDash> I have vsphere client running in a VM on my workstation
[06:10:06] <init3> Once you get a VM up, is it nice and responsive? 
[06:10:22] <init3> Via SSH or RSP.
[06:10:25] <init3> *RDP
[06:10:35] <AppleDash> Yeah
[06:10:36] <AppleDash> Just fine
[06:12:15] <init3> Well I can't  remember how the licencing works for the vsphere client itself but maybe a stupid ass workaround might be to try to set up a vsphere client on a VM out there? I've heard anecdotes of doing it directly being faster and of using a local server to have the vsphere client. 
[06:13:01] <init3> It was always faster for me to use the client directly but some of my co workers said that it was quicker to rdp a server there with the client. 
[06:13:14] <init3> I lived less that three miles from our DC though.
[06:13:19] <init3> *than
[06:13:45] <init3> Is there any sort of VPN nonsense going about?
[06:17:37] <AppleDash> No such nonsense

[08:48:46] <init3> I rather like using certfp though. Easier to ghost and whatnot because I never remember my nickserv password. 
[08:49:52] <init3> Aww yeah Phase4. certfp buddies.
[08:50:04] * Phase4 just wanted to try it
[08:50:11] <init3> Hehe it's coo.
[08:50:21] <init3> I just get it from /whois 
[08:50:24] <Phase4> i have hexchat remember passwords either way
[08:50:43] <init3> I don't think that causes an alert like ctcp does
[08:50:57] <Phase4> it doesn't, server side
[08:51:15] <Phase4> i was just wondering what client you used that didn't store passwords for you :P
[08:51:26] <init3> Well it does
[08:51:29] <Phase4> "* Received a CTCP  from init3"
[08:51:34] <init3> Yar
[08:51:43] <init3> I don't think I did it right
[08:52:06] <Phase4> you sent a blank ctcp, hexchat has a /version command for it, imagine most other clients do
[08:52:24] <init3> Yeah
[08:52:36] <Phase4> init3, if you're inserting the \x01's by hand, they surround the whole message, not just the CTCP
[08:52:55] <init3> But Konversation does store the password of course. 
[08:53:12] <init3> But it doesn't auto-ghost. 
[08:53:30] <Phase4> certfp doesn't either though
[08:53:48] <init3> Well I mean instead of /ns ghost init3 password I can just do /ns ghost init3 
[08:54:05] <Phase4> sasl lets you do that without needing a certificate
[08:55:31] <init3> sasl is just a type of password auth isn't it?
[08:55:46] <Phase4> neat either way, only complaint is needing a whole x509 cert to store one key
[08:56:33] <Phase4> init3, sasl supports (can support) multiple types of authentication, certfp should be via sasl actually
[08:57:23] <Phase4> strange
[08:57:27] <Phase4> i seem to be using plain auth
[08:57:47] <init3> I dunno, generating certs is kind of second nature to me so I didn't see a big deal with it. 
[08:57:53] <Phase4> i seem to be using both
[08:57:54] <Phase4> how odd
[08:58:13] <init3> [X-files music]
[08:58:29] <Phase4> init3, i just hate the "ender your location, enter your OU, enter your date of birth and social security number"
[08:58:46] <init3> Insert your first born into drive A:?
[08:58:53] <Phase4> and none of it for any security benefit, it's just to please the x509 parser in your chosen ssl implementation
[08:59:00] <init3> But I get ya. 
[08:59:12] <Phase4> because people get scared if they see a bare public key i guess
[08:59:22] <init3> Is a cert really less secure than a password though?
[08:59:38] <init3> I mean, there is still that password component.
[08:59:59] <Phase4> it's public key, not a password
[08:59:59] <init3> Perhaps not stronger crypto 
[09:00:28] <init3> I mean as opposed to the standard ns pw.
[09:00:44] <init3> Unless I am misunderstanding you. 
[09:01:09] <Phase4> is sasl plain more secure than ns password? not really, there's some attacks based on kicking nickserv off and taking its name, but that's solved server side
[09:01:15] <init3> I haven't slept and took some prescriptions that dull the brain so I might be missing something. 
[09:01:22] <Phase4> it's still just sending a raw password over the wire though
[09:01:37] <Phase4> (hopefully inside ssl)
[09:01:58] <init3> Well honestly the reason I use the cert isn't for security, rather simply for convenience. 
[09:02:27] <init3> I mean, yeah, I would be annoyed if someone jacked my name on here but it isn't like someone taking over my gmail account.
[09:02:51] <init3> And encryption on IRC is a moot point imo.
[09:03:05] <init3> Unless the network requires it. 
[09:03:06] <Phase4> the reason to use sasl over /ns ident is it's synchronous, so you can do things like autojoin channels that require you to be logged in
[09:03:57] <Phase4> init3, sasl protects your nickserv password, and prevents session hijacking

[09:05:02] <Phase4> init3, i need it for some bronystate channels, side rooms are set invite only with exempts so the mods can join ahead of time
[09:05:18] <init3> i?
[09:05:28] <Phase4> plus it's nicer overall to not have the fakequit for hostname changes
[09:05:29] <Phase4> init3, yeah
[09:05:43] <Phase4> so the client on the website doesn't autojoin them when closed
[09:06:16] <init3> Ahh, looks like the one I thought isn't invite only. Guess it is just moderated so only the cool kids get voice. 
[09:07:21] <Phase4> also a standard way to log in without having a particular nick
[09:07:34] <init3> I got ya. 
[09:07:50] <Phase4> ponychat (atheme?) has a /ns ident [nick] [password] syntax that nothing else seems to support
[09:08:55] <init3> Does sasl do anything that a cert doesn't though? Seems a cert handles all of that as well. Not even sure what circumstance would arise when a hostname change would occur without a part to go with it. 
[09:09:54] <init3> And did you say sasl passwords are sent plaintext?
[09:10:39] <Phase4> init3, certfp is an sasl mechanism (specifically SASL EXTERNAL), the standard one (SASL PLAIN) is more or less http basic auth
[09:10:43] <Phase4> http://ircv3.atheme.org/extensions/sasl-3.1 documentation ftw

[09:29:50] <AppleDash> One issue with website archiving - It's hard to determine how much you should archive

[10:24:59] <Phase4> cert'
