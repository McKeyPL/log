[00:08:50] <Melon_Phone> hmm 50 shades only gets a 3.4 on IMDb 
[00:09:02] <expatriate> that's 3.4 too much

[00:09:54] <Vulpixbrew> the two good things about the book, Gilbert Godfrey and the Geroge Takai readings
[00:10:21] <expatriate> I'm not going to comment on the quality of the book because I haven't read it, but it's very problematic
[00:10:51] <Melon_Phone> the Gilbert one was awesome
[00:10:51] <Melon_Phone> and hay I didn't pay shit for the book
[00:10:54] *** Dusk is now known as Dusk|Food
[00:10:56] <weisey> I want to listen to Gilbert Gottfried reading it so bad
[00:10:59] <expatriate> I honestly think that if a lot of people see it we'll see a spike in rape

[00:12:25] <cloppyhooves> I wouldn't say a spike in rape

[00:13:09] <Melon_Phone> the book is very consensual 
[00:13:28] <Melon_Phone> haven't read the other two so maybe shit goes south
[00:13:31] <expatriate> ignoring safewords is literally the opposite of consent
[00:13:49] *** RubyPinch is now known as RubyPinch|DCed
[00:14:01] <expatriate> if that doesn't actually happen in the book, then I retract that. I'm basing this off what I've heard
[00:14:03] <weisey> "Oh yeah, tie me up with no knowledge of nerve locations, it will be hot"
[00:14:35] <weisey> Yeah the book isn't really any more consensual than the movie 
[00:15:08] * Vulpixbrew thinks that if you want to do BDSM one should at least take A&P 1
[00:15:29] <Melon_Phone> haa

[01:25:21] <cloppyhooves> He said that you do still hit yourself sometimes
[01:25:26] <cloppyhooves> But you just practice until muscle memory
[01:25:38] <cloppyhooves> They're crazy skilled with it, though
[01:25:46] <cloppyhooves> Like, they throw it so it cracks right before it reaches you

[23:17:37] <cloppyhooves> Okay, I've clearly been playing too much Pokemon X
[23:17:44] <cloppyhooves> I was in a crepe shop, sitting and eating my crepe
[23:17:56] <cloppyhooves> There were some french-like decorations on the walls
[23:17:59] <cloppyhooves> And some upbeat music play
[23:18:13] <cloppyhooves> And my first thought wasn't "This feels like Paris"
[23:18:14] <cloppyhooves> It was
[23:18:22] <cloppyhooves> "This feels like Lumoise City!"
[23:18:39] <ponder> Lumiose City is better than Paris
[23:18:42] <ponder> Paris doesn't have pokemon
[23:18:49] <cloppyhooves> Very true :3
[23:19:18] <Katiepony> But they have a pokémon centre in paris o:
[23:19:44] <ponder> not real pokemon
[23:23:28] <cloppyhooves> I would totally go to Kalos if it meant sitting in Lumiose City, petting a Fennekin, and eating a Nutella crepe with milk coffee
[23:24:02] <ponder> I'd love to live in the pokemon world.
[23:24:18] <ponder> I wouldn't even be a competitive trainer, I'd just capture a sneasel and just... chill
[23:25:09] <Katiepony> I would hang out at the daycare aaaall daaay ¦3
[23:25:39] <cloppyhooves> Katiepony confirmed for Pokemon breeder
[23:25:56] <Katiepony> Just like... a dozen vulpixes and eevees o:
[23:26:01] <Katiepony> I'd watch them all day :3
[23:26:14] <ponder> That sounds adorable
[23:26:43] <cloppyhooves> Katiepony confirmed for Pokemon voyeur
[23:26:49] <cloppyhooves> :3
[23:26:55] <Katiepony> Maybe I'd join in too o:
[23:27:02] <cloppyhooves> Katiepony confirmed for cool person c:
[23:27:11] <ponder> I'd get like a sneasel and a trapinch and then just become a sylph co office drone and just live there.
[23:33:47] * Vulpixbrew yips
[23:36:40] <Vulpixbrew> I walked out to the den set down on the couch and just woke up
