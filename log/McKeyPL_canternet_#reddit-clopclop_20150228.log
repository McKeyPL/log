[00:22:59] <expatriate> it was an incredibly awkward experience
[00:23:33] <Vulpixbrew> was it at home or did you go to a showing?
[00:26:02] <Melon_Guy> I watched with a friend, was super fun

[02:21:42] <expatriate> when they pushed it from january to march, it was like a week before the release
[02:22:02] <princesssluttershy> Valve releases shit late all the time
[02:22:09] <princesssluttershy> Just look at Portal 2
[02:22:09] <expatriate> it's possible they're just shitty with announcements, but more likely they thought it was going fine
[02:22:23] <expatriate> that's a totally different thing, valve literally doesn't have producers or managers
[02:22:32] <expatriate> no one keeps them in check
[02:22:47] <Vulpixbrew> Im just hoping when they finally do let it out that its not a steaming pile of crap

[23:23:06] <OmarianVolcae> They're way nicer than the old ones.
[23:23:13] <Frosty> Why? Were they too complicated for you guys?
[23:23:18] <Frosty> One leg at a time. ONE.
[23:23:28] <OmarianVolcae> No, they really just changed colors and materials.
[23:23:42] <OmarianVolcae> Instead of the thick nasty cotton, they're now some sort of soft quick-dry material.
[23:23:43] <Frosty> What are they made of now?
[23:23:44] <Cantaloupe> from satin to satan
[23:23:50] <Frosty> Oh, nice
[23:23:58] <OmarianVolcae> They also fit better
[23:24:01] <Frosty> I wonder if ours will change soon.
[23:24:04] <OmarianVolcae> the old ones were like cloth bags.
[23:24:14] <OmarianVolcae> especially the cold-weather jacket.
