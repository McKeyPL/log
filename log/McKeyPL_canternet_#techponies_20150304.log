[10:15:21] <Compu> what is the best desktop GPU i could get for $400 or less
[10:16:31] <JustAberrant> :(
[10:17:45] <JustAberrant> GTX 970 maybe.. I dunno
[10:18:46] <Kinsley> It's between a 970 GTX and a R9 290X.
[10:19:48] <JustAberrant> vid cards are easy for me.. I always buy nvidia, so I just get whatever one is in my price range :>
[10:20:11] <Kinsley> I've gone AMD in the past, and at the time, the 7870 GHz was a sweet, sweet card.
[10:21:01] <Kinsley> As much as nVidia has a problem with the 970 and its memory controller (the infamous 3.5 GB issue), at least they keep their architecture consistent.
[10:21:29] <JustAberrant> I still don't trust ATI on linux
[10:21:32] <JustAberrant> err.. AMD
[10:21:35] <Kinsley> AMD's current lineup has GPU chips from the 7xxx series in them. And based on current rumors, that might continue to the be case.
[10:21:51] <JustAberrant> nvidia has always worked well for me on linux, so I've stuck with them
[10:22:13] <Kinsley> JA: neither do I, but my Linux machine runs on an i5 with integrated graphics. My tower runs Windows because it's for gaming and virtual machines. And sometimes video editing now.
[10:22:43] <Compu> ok
[10:23:05] <JustAberrant> yeah, if I was gonna build a gaming rig it would run windows.. though I'd probably still stick with nvidia cause it's what I know
[10:23:39] * JustAberrant might build a shitty windows box soon actually
[10:23:56] <Compu> im planning to build a gaming pc once i start getting ssi checks and since i most likely wont be able to spare more than $400 a month im gonna buy parts in batches of $400 and then start building once i have everything i need
[10:24:02] <JustAberrant> been using photoshop and a few other things in a VM, but it's fairly shitty :>
[10:24:29] *** Q0 is now known as Q0|Away

[10:24:58] <Compu> JustAberrant: cant
[10:25:02] <JustAberrant> Compu: no point having hardware sitting in boxes for months
[10:25:35] <Compu> JustAberrant: ssi doesnt like u to save up money, most u can save up before they kill ur ssi checks is $1000, saving up without their knowledge can get u put in jail
[10:25:36] <Kinsley> nVidia may have a price premium in terms of dollar-per-performance, but AMD still can't match 'em for top-tier.
[10:25:47] <JustAberrant> Colgate: fair enough
[10:25:49] <JustAberrant> * Compu 
[10:25:56] <Compu> so yeah
[10:26:04] <Compu> gonna work in batches of $400
[10:26:17] <JustAberrant> though in that vain, I'd think spending $400 on things like computer parts individually would still raise eyebrows?
[10:26:20] <Compu> hopefully can have everything within 3 months, what do u think?
[10:26:24] <Compu> nah
[10:26:41] <locodash11[server]> the 290x still beats the 980 in half the tests I've seen
[10:26:51] <Compu> we spend $200 on our verizon bill from my mom's ssi and they dont complain
[10:27:22] <Compu> they dont care so much what u spend the money on as how much u keep at once
[10:27:23] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: hehe, so same as their processors then :>
[10:27:45] <Compu> im definetely getting the newest, best i7 possible
[10:28:04] <Compu> wondering if i should go for 64 GB of RAM, or even 128 GB :D
[10:28:10] <JustAberrant> heh
[10:28:30] <Kinsley> Compu: No, unless you're getting into serious content production, beyond 16GB is a waste.
[10:28:50] <Compu> Kinsley: well i could start using my youtube channel
[10:29:04] <JustAberrant> hate to burst your bubble.. but not for $400 your not ;p
[10:29:15] <JustAberrant> an i7-4960X will run you ~$1500
[10:29:23] <Compu> oh
[10:29:31] <JustAberrant> even mid range, an i7-4930K is like $700
[10:29:31] <Compu> well whats the best processor i can get then?
[10:29:47] <JustAberrant> honestly, even as an intel fanboy, I'd recommend AMD
[10:29:47] <Kinsley> I have a Youtube channel. I render video on an old i7-930 overclocked to 3.3 GHz. I have 16 GB of RAM.
[10:29:55] <JustAberrant> they are better in the low/mid economy range
[10:30:02] <JustAberrant> more processor for the dollar.. 
[10:30:06] <Compu> JustAberrant: would prefer intel, most likely will be dual booting linux
[10:30:21] <JustAberrant> far as I know, amd processors are fine with linux..
[10:30:29] <Compu> Kinsley: how is it at recording gameplay?
[10:30:42] <Compu> JustAberrant: still prefer intel
[10:30:54] <JustAberrant> might be better to go with an i5 then?
[10:31:06] <JustAberrant> I don't know if you can get an i7 in the ~$400 range.. 
[10:31:06] <Kinsley> Since I don't record, say, Watch_Dogs which just sucks at outputting a consistent 60 FPS anyway... damn good.
[10:31:22] <Kinsley> I almost always have nVidia Shadowplay running and saving to my SSD.
[10:31:26] <Kinsley> No issues there.
[10:31:51] * JustAberrant looks.. apparently you can
[10:31:53] <Kinsley> JA: where do you live? A i7-4770k is about $350
[10:31:56] <Compu> Kinsley: most intensive game i'll be playing most likely will be GTA V for pc when it comes out
[10:31:59] <JustAberrant> an i7-4770 is around $400
[10:32:09] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: bah ;p
[10:32:25] <JustAberrant> and Canada.. so yeah.. there's like a +50 on everything ;p
[10:32:31] <Kinsley> Actually, Newegg has the 4790k for $340.
[10:32:42] <JustAberrant> change .com to .ca? ;p
[10:32:50] <Kinsley> Since Compu's talking about SSI, we can safely assume he's in the states. :P
[10:33:02] <JustAberrant> good point :(
[10:33:08] <Compu> Kinsley: she*
[10:33:10] <JustAberrant> it's like 5:30am.. don't judge me ;p
[10:33:18] <Kinsley> Ah, my bad.
[10:34:11] <Compu> the most powerful thing i've ever gamed on was a friend's $1400 dell inpiron 15
[10:34:42] <Compu> had some nvidia card with 2 GB vram, 16 GB ram, and some form of quad core i7
[10:34:57] <Compu> and a 1 TB HDD
[10:35:17] <Compu> if i can get a machine to beat that then i will be happy
[10:35:48] <JustAberrant> :)
[10:35:55] <Compu> might have been octo core i7 but i think it was quad core
[10:36:11] <Kinsley> Building out a desktop? Yeah, pretty easy, since laptops will thermal throttle like no one's business OR you can overclock.
[10:36:45] <JustAberrant> newer generation i5 desktop would probably beat that *shrugs*
[10:36:59] <Kinsley> Uh, the only true octocore i7 is the top end 5860X Haswell-E chip.
[10:37:25] <Kinsley> All i7s have hyperthreading, which effectively reports twice the number of logical processors to the operating system.
[10:38:05] <Googie> Yeah, no way to get an 8-core intel CPU on a laptop.
[10:38:35] <JustAberrant> hehe
[10:38:36] <Kinsley> But yeah, an i5 with an aftermarket cooler, either air or water, could easily overclock to 4+ GHz and get great game performance.
[10:38:37] <Googie> Also, starting to get random graphical glitches on my system :( Looks like I might be needing to get a new card soon.
[10:38:58] <JustAberrant> interestingly enough, I was literally just recently using a dual processor laptop with 12 cores ;p
[10:39:48] <Googie> I didn't know they had dual processor laptops. That's actually quite impressive.
[10:39:52] <JustAberrant> craziest laptop I've ever seen.. 
[10:40:13] <JustAberrant> it was specced for a kind of portable lab project
[10:40:16] <Googie> Heat management on it must be quite amazing.
[10:40:31] <JustAberrant> yeah.. it has 4 high speed fans on the bottom
[10:40:42] <Kinsley> "laptop" might be a bit of stretch then.
[10:40:43] <Compu> oh one more thing
[10:40:46] <JustAberrant> it's also like 3 times the thickness of a normal laptop.. and has a power brick the size of a, well, brick
[10:40:52] <Kinsley> Portable computer is more descriptive.
[10:41:05] <Compu> would like the mobo to have integrated graphics as a temporary backup if my card ever fails
[10:41:16] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: hehe, yeah
[10:41:27] <Googie> Motherboards don't do integrated graphics these days, that's on the CPU
[10:41:43] <Kinsley> Compu, then forget anything but an AMD APU or an Intel chip.
[10:41:53] <Compu> well the mobo needs to have a dvi or vga
[10:42:06] <Kinsley> And past the first gen i7s, all Core i* series chips have integrated graphics on the CPU.
[10:42:06] <Compu> Kinsley: i want intel
[10:42:33] <Compu> Kinsley: k so covered for integrated graphics, what about vga/dvi port on the mobo?
[10:42:43] <Kinsley> They'll have 'em.
[10:42:48] <Compu> ok
[10:42:53] <Compu> good
[10:42:59] <Compu> always good to have a backup
[10:43:10] <Kinsley> Just sayin'. For video rendering performance and good game performance, getting an FX-9xxx series chip wouldn't hurt.
[10:43:26] <JustAberrant> I can't find the exact model...
[10:43:37] <Kinsley> Though their TDP makes them *require* liquid cooling.
[10:43:45] <JustAberrant> it was eurocom.. looked something like this http://www.eurocom.com/ec/configure%281,234,0%29ec  
[10:43:47] <PinkiePieBot> [ Eurocom Configure Model ]
[10:43:49] <Kinsley> A couple of SKUs even ship with an AMD cooler.
[10:44:03] <Kinsley> Er, AMD liquid* cooler
[10:44:40] <Googie> Ah, a Clevo chassis then.
[10:45:23] <Googie> I like how the laptop battery is branded as a UPS :P
[10:45:29] <JustAberrant> hehehe
[10:45:54] <JustAberrant> but yeah.. I wouldn't want to set that on my lap
[10:46:02] <JustAberrant> plus would probably block those fans
[10:48:29] <JustAberrant> hehe... "mobile server" .. that pretty much is what it is
[10:48:56] <Googie> Server chipset. Choice of operating systems: Vmware ESX, RHEL, or Windows Server :P
[10:49:13] <Urioxis> Windows, duh :3
[10:49:21] <JustAberrant> myeahh.. no ;p
[10:49:25] <Urioxis> :P
[10:49:31] <JustAberrant> running windows on a machien that good is a crime ;p
[10:49:36] <JustAberrant> * machine
[10:49:42] <Urioxis> A crime... of AWESOME!
[10:49:46] <JustAberrant> :(
[10:49:46] <Urioxis> Ok, I'll stop now
[10:50:23] <Googie> Still only single socket though I think ?
[10:50:29] <Googie> Just high end Xeons.
[10:50:29] <JustAberrant> yeah
[10:50:36] <JustAberrant> I can't find a dual socket model.. so maybe I was wrong
[10:51:01] <Compu> Kinsley: im not so sure i wanna mess around with liquid cooling
[10:51:18] <JustAberrant> had 12 (real) cores.. but yeah.. I guess there are high end xeons that have 12 cores.. so possible
[10:51:29] <Kinsley> The current crop of closed-loop coolers are sealed and require no maintenance.
[10:51:31] <Googie> Yeah, they go up to 18 cores now
[10:51:45] <JustAberrant> still an insane piece of hardware ;p
[10:51:50] <Googie> Yeah
[10:52:14] <JustAberrant> it was funny because it had the shittiest video card (cause it won't even have x on it when done)
[10:52:36] <Kinsley> They're as easy to install as any other cooler. And they deliver huge gains in performance.
[10:53:00] * JustAberrant never tried a closed loop cooler.. I assumed they were junk, but people say they are good :)
[10:53:30] * JustAberrant has done ol` fashion water cooling and oil submersion cooling.. my desktop is just air cooled now though :>
[10:53:45] <Googie> The earlier ones were, strictly speaking, worse performers than good air cooling, but it might have improved since I last checked
[10:53:56] <Googie> They were also significantly smaller
[10:54:16] <Googie> (If you don't include the radiator, which can be moved out of the way)
[10:54:34] <Compu> Kinsley: yeah well maybe i will do it but isnt that water in there? that would destroy everything if there was even the tiniest leak
[10:54:36] <JustAberrant> custom water cooling is a lot of fun, but it basically doubles the cost of your rig and is a nightmare maintenance wise :>
[10:55:20] <Kinsley> There is *a* potential for a leak, yes.
[10:55:29] <Googie> I've had plenty of friends brag about theirs... and also complain a couple of years down the line that they can't play X with me because their rig is broken/is in the process of breaking
[10:56:16] <Urioxis> Sure but I have that issue because of hard disks
[10:56:20] <Kinsley> It's rare since they're sealed at the factory, and as long as you buy trusted gear.
[10:56:21] <Urioxis> Computer kit breaks
[10:56:35] * JustAberrant has a water cooled rack mount system at one point :D
[10:56:45] <Kinsley> I've had the same motherboard and CPU for over 4 years.
[10:56:47] <JustAberrant> it was actually the stupidest idea I've ever had
[10:56:50] <Googie> Sure, but generally if your HDD dies it isn't anywhere near as big of a hassle :P
[10:57:01] <JustAberrant> like.. it ended up so badly
[10:57:17] <JustAberrant> it wasn't even a full sized case.. so there was basically no room
[10:57:18] <Googie> I mean... it's still a big hassle, but not a rig killing disaster
[10:58:14] <Googie> I did actually use a closed loop for a while, but honestly... I've actually been running stock cooling until just recently.
[10:58:16] <Urioxis> I dunno... a couple of 1tb drives probably costs about the same as a new water cooling kit
[10:58:19] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/watercooling/100_0719.JPG  :D
[10:58:47] <Urioxis> and the water ought to be deionised so won't cause damage if leaking
[10:59:04] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/watercooling/100_0720.JPG  <-- ended up switching to an external pump/radiator to free up some space.. but even then...
[10:59:14] <Urioxis> But like you Googie I've never actually found stock to be a problem without overclocking
[10:59:16] <Googie> Urioxis: Talking about custom loops, not a closed loop system
[10:59:31] <Urioxis> Still isn't supposed to leak :PO
[10:59:32] <Googie> The closed loop ones are cheap. Custom... not so much :P
[10:59:56] <Urioxis> And you can make them a lot cheaper
[11:00:04] <Kinsley> Plus, deionized or not, that water will come into contact with metal parts and become ionized over time.
[11:00:07] <JustAberrant> and yeah... by the time you pay for the blocks.. you've already paid more than the complete closed system ;p
[11:00:34] <JustAberrant> hell, by the time you pay for the various bits of connectors and clips you're probably there ;p
[11:01:08] <JustAberrant> those compression nozzels and quick releases add up
[11:01:22] <JustAberrant> also.. no split quick disconnects are bullshit :D
[11:01:46] <JustAberrant> sure maybe they work for a few weeks after you install them.. but try disconnecting them several months later.. have a bucket ready ;p

[11:11:08] <Googie> Some pretty big reveals at GDC this year also
[11:11:46] <Googie> glNext looks like it will actually materialize. Unity/Unreal both decreasing their entry costs. Valve announcing Source 2 to also be free whenever that comes out
[11:12:00] <Googie> Not to mention Valve making their own VR headset to compete with Oculus.
[11:12:14] <Phase4> glnext == vulkan or are they also extending gl
[11:12:31] <Googie> glNext was the WIP name for Vulkan
[11:12:52] <JustAberrant> :(
[11:12:54] <Phase4> it's pretty much exactly what i hoped we'd eventually get as a cross platform api
[11:12:59] <Phase4> is nice
[11:13:01] <Googie> Yeah.
[11:13:12] <Phase4> wip documentation for SPIR-V is public too
[11:14:02] <Googie> Although it'll probably be more complex to use than OpenGL I imagine, pushing all that complexity onto the application as opposed to the driver is probably a good thing
[11:14:15] * Googie has been hearing a lot about how untested some of the openGL codepaths are for certain things.
[11:14:28] <Googie> At least at the engine level you can fix that sort of stuff.
[11:16:03] <Phase4> engine knows how to order its draws, plus pretty much everything is running through glsl in modern opengl which vulkan should support from day 1
