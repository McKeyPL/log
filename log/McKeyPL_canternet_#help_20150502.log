[01:43:33] <Dusk> Again, you might've been on the wrong side of the split
[01:43:35] <CompuDesktop> mmk
[01:43:45] <CompuDesktop> never been on the wrong side of a split before then
[01:43:48] <wolfyshy> just weird for nickserv to be present but saslserv to be missing :P
[01:43:53] *** [A]McKey is now known as McKey
[01:44:13] <CompuDesktop> wolfyshy: for me saslserv was there but nickserv wasnt
[01:44:21] <wolfyshy> o.o
[01:44:25] <Dusk> See
[01:44:30] <Dusk> two sides of the split :o
[01:44:48] <wolfyshy> saslserv and nickserv should both be running on the same atheme instance lol
[01:44:56] <CompuDesktop> i know because my laptop identifies via nickserv and my desktop does it via sasl
[01:45:10] <One-Trick> services could be decentralized
[01:45:14] <Dusk> ^

[01:45:23] <CompuDesktop> my laptop couldnt identify but my desktop could
[01:45:39] <CompuDesktop> and they were both connecting to daring.canternet.org
[01:45:58] <wolfyshy> I ended up on daring as well
[01:46:00] <wolfyshy> o.o
[01:46:06] <CompuDesktop> odd
[01:46:21] <One-Trick> in relation to /map, i am very far removed from standard services.*
[01:46:38] <CompuDesktop> then we couldnt have been on opposite sides of the split, we were both on the same server
[01:46:44] <wolfyshy> we were indeed
[01:46:46] <wolfyshy> lol
[01:47:06] <Dusk> Hm
[01:47:07] <Twili> Somepony said it was something happening? why the mass +P?. It might have been Pinkie though.
[01:47:22] <Dusk> Well then I can't say why that would be
[01:47:28] <Dusk> Timing issues
[01:47:33] <CompuDesktop> possibly
[01:47:44] <CompuDesktop> my clients auto reconnect
[01:48:29] <CompuDesktop> anyways gotta take a shower

[03:13:04] <Colgate> wolfyshy: it is possible that you connected to daring before it unsplit, thus sasl failed, but after registration, it had netjoined again, and so /nickserv ID worked
[03:13:44] *** Joins: LightningCrash (lightning@Pony-lvs.lv2.99.68.IP)
[03:14:20] <Colgate> since you are on daring, that is a possiblity, and is more than likely what happened
