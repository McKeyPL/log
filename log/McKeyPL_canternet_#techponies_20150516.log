[03:59:10] <Moonlightning> ugh
[03:59:19] <Moonlightning> Trying to get Atheme to fit my filesystem hierarchy
[03:59:43] <Moonlightning> Insp did it fine, what's Atheme's problem :|
[04:00:40] <Moonlightning> I can't just pass it --prefix=/usr/local and have it create /usr/local/{etc,include,lib}/atheme directories
[04:04:13] <Moonlightning> The configurescript doesn't say anything about making `help` or `modules` dirs… :|
[04:04:17] * Moonlightning groans.
[04:09:11] <Moonlightning> Augh!
[04:09:37] <Moonlightning> It doesn't uninstall properly, either!
[04:10:46] <Moonlightning> What am I supposed to do with this? :|
[04:11:54] <Moonlightning> Am I just doing the hierarchy wrong?
[04:12:12] <Moonlightning> I mean, the way /usr/local was organized when I got here was similar to /usr and /
[04:12:38] <Moonlightning> i.e. there were /usr/local/{bin,etc,lib,sbin,share}
[04:21:18] <Moonlightning> …AHA!
[04:21:26] <Moonlightning> The configurescript has an --enable-fhs-paths flag.
[04:21:28] <Moonlightning> Bingo.
[04:26:30] <Moonlightning> Perfect. ^^
[04:28:40] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: The point of "PID file at the init level" is to specify the PID file that the program you're running writes.
[04:28:56] <Moonlightning> Oh?

[06:10:26] <Lapsus> so cerberus ftp server is now apparently $80
[06:10:44] <Lapsus> Can anyone suggest a free ftp server that can run in windows that doesn't suck?
[06:11:34] <Lapsus> Filezilla is a bit crap, and sourceforge downloads even moreso
[06:13:10] <AppleDash> Lapsus: Install linux
[06:13:25] <Lapsus> AppleDash: I play games on this computer, no
[06:13:28] <Googie> What're you using the FTP server for ? Why's Filezilla not meet the requirements ?
[06:13:44] <Googie> I mean, there's IIS, but...
[06:14:15] <Googie> Aside from that, cygwin
[06:14:41] <Googie> (Just don't download the sourceforge wrapper around Filezilla)
[06:15:43] <Lapsus> mainly filezilla is a bit weird and doesn't like to work for me because I don't use it much and can't troubleshoot it for shit because I've been using cerberus for like 4 years
[06:15:44] <Lapsus> lol

[06:32:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> Lapsus: what you doing that needs ftp when alternatives are available that are well secure
[06:36:23] <Lapsus> simple "move a file or a shitload of files with resume functionality" on the lan with trusted people
[06:36:52] <Lapsus> or in this case "get something up that I can connect to to test something"
[06:47:22] <ShivalPonyWolf> seems like something smb or scp could do better then an FTP server. or one of the light weight http file share servers
[06:47:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> like HFS
[06:50:26] <Gigabit> Good news everyone! Windows 10 will come preloaded with Candy Crush!

[06:51:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[06:51:31] <AppleDash> I thought it was dead
[06:51:54] <Gigabit> what candy crush or W10?
[06:53:00] <AppleDash> CC
[06:56:06] <Gigabit> Dunno, but it is being bundled. Would have made more sense to bundle Minecraft with W10

[07:24:21] <Twilightlicious> lol
[07:24:34] <Twilightlicious> Plus Minecraft is profitable, they can't just give it away
[07:25:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> minecraft itself is probably not as profitable as it used to be

[07:28:25] *** Joins: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-0k8geu.bigpond.net.au)
[07:28:28] <Twilightlicious> Minecraft: Windows 10 edition
[07:28:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> that would be the probably course of action if they did
[07:28:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> a shitty xbox port
[07:29:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> pc to console then back to pc again porting
[07:29:14] <Twilightlicious> then if it sold well, they catch it up to the PC Version, and disband Mojang.
[07:29:14] <Sol> That still rakes in $$$
[07:30:07] <Twilightlicious> Then they could drop support for Minecraft PE
[07:30:37] <Twilightlicious> And instead have Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Available on Desktops, Laptops, and Tablets.
[07:31:11] <Twilightlicious> *Windows 10 Required. Xbox Live required for multiplayer. Active internet connection required. some restrictions apply
[07:31:28] <Twilightlicious> =D
[07:31:29] * Twilightlicious hides
[07:31:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> Twilightlicious: microtransactions included. per block you mine
[07:32:20] <Twilightlicious> Well of course microtransactions. The Xbox One version requires you to Purchase Skins, etc.
[07:32:56] <Twilightlicious> Unlock Skeleton Horse, 1.99. Horse dies, requires repurchase.
[07:33:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[07:33:13] <Twilightlicious> Make diamonds even more rare. sell diamond packs
[07:33:21] <Sol> I don't touch any but the PC. Mostly because even the fully featured vanilla game bores me without lots of mods now lol.
[07:33:39] <Twilightlicious> it bores me without Company.
[07:33:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> minecraft only survived due to the modding community
[07:33:47] <Twilightlicious> If i don't have anyone to play with, i don't play.
[07:33:51] <Twilightlicious> but with a friend, it's crazy fun.
[07:34:19] <Twilightlicious> I'm waiting on Witcher 3, i'm doing the cardinal sin of buying it on a Console.
[07:34:51] <Twilightlicious> even though it's cheaper on PC, and DRM free.
[07:34:56] <Twilightlicious> and i meet requirements.
[07:35:38] <Sol> ShivalPonyWolf, a shame that that side of the community can't make money from what they do without breaking eula and whatnot
[07:36:04] <Twilightlicious> it would be the Skyrim fiasco all over again.
[07:36:21] <Sol> I didn't think that was a bad idea...just a bad implementation
[07:36:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> you cant introduce a pay for system into an estabilished comunity without causing issues
[07:36:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats what steam learnt
[07:37:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> it would be even worse for minecraft
[07:37:13] <Twilightlicious> ^
[07:37:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> as its basicly mods built on a hack to the native system
[07:37:28] <Sol> For MC, it just annoys me a bit that people who make video content can rake in $$$, but the people who make a lot of the things they do possible can't
[07:37:49] <Twilightlicious> Moral of the story, make Videos.
[07:38:22] <Twilightlicious> Owner of a Company makes $$$, Does nothing. People who make him rich, earn little.
[07:38:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> moral is get a real job and keep doing things for fun as fun
[07:38:29] <Twilightlicious> Welcome to Capitolism.
[07:38:30] <Sol> A person with a following who reviews a mod makes more off of that one video than the mod creators ever get total through donations or whatever
[07:38:55] <Twilightlicious> ShivalPonyWolf, remember back in our day, when people made Mods because they Wanted to, and not for money?
[07:39:00] <Twilightlicious> :P
[07:39:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> Twilightlicious: not just mods
[07:39:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> but vidieos to
[07:39:17] <Twilightlicious> And people made YouTube videos to entertain, not to make bank
[07:39:22] <ShivalPonyWolf> yep
[07:39:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> those days are gone
[07:39:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> and will never come back

[22:03:07] <LordShadowWing> I am curious. Are there any Brony Mumble Servers?
[22:05:08] <Colgate> dunno, I don't voice chat often though
[22:05:49] * Colgate idly wonders if the one they set up forever ago is still running
[22:08:13] <AppleDash> lol
[22:08:45] <Colgate> I don't even remember what server it was on
[22:08:49] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/hoose/no_murders.png   :>
[22:08:51] <JustAberrant> (random)
[22:09:01] <LordShadowWing> I have found a few references online to long dead servers
[22:09:32] <Colgate> hey it is!
[22:09:41] <AppleDash> Is it?
[22:09:52] * Colgate also documents that this server is running mumble.
