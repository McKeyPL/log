[00:02:28] <Hamtramck> I'm glad I don't drive.
[00:02:33] <RandomNinja> why?
[00:02:36] <Pikachu> o
[00:02:42] <Hamtramck> Cars is expensive yo
[00:02:52] <Pikachu> Wait sorry I am still too sleepy to get context right
[00:02:53] <RandomNinja> ye but driving is super useful
[00:02:58] <RandomNinja> apply coffee
[00:03:13] <Hamtramck> Yeah but there's no point in driving anywhere if you don't have any money left to spend when you get there
[00:03:17] <Hamtramck> also I live in a city so there isn't any parking.
[00:03:29] <Hamtramck> So it's like, 40 minute bus ride, or ten minute car ride and thirty minute circle the parking lots
[00:04:08] <RandomNinja> or 10 minute car ride, 5 minute looking for parking and 2 minute walk to location
[00:04:51] <Hamtramck> I don't think you understand the dearth of parking in this city.
[00:05:18] <RandomNinja> I live in a bike city with functional bus traffic, so no
[00:05:18] <Hamtramck> I mean we're not as bad as Chicago where it's like

[00:05:43] <Inucroft[NLR]> 1 Bus = 60 cars
[00:05:56] <Hamtramck> ... Man we have like two park and rides. They really, really need to get more of those going.
[00:06:17] <Inucroft[NLR]> only 2? Damn, York (UK) has ~4.
[00:06:28] <Inucroft[NLR]> mind it's alot smaller than most US cities
[00:06:46] <Hamtramck> We might have more than two. They're probably more out in the suburbs
[00:07:32] <Hamtramck> Also I think the parking garage fees are like, twice as much as you'd pay for bus fare per day.
[00:07:45] <Inucroft[NLR]> all of them are on the shopping centers on the outter-ring road
[00:07:50] <Hamtramck> Unless you get your employer to eat the cost.

[00:08:26] <Eywind> Yo guys
[00:08:32] <Eywind> I heard [thing you like is cancelled/person you like died/thing you don't like is popular/your shoes are untied]
[00:08:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> hoi
[00:08:38] <RandomNinja> yea buses are awesome, but you're missing the point
[00:08:50] <RandomNinja> sometimes you really really need a car
[00:09:00] <MikeM> It all happened, Eywind. One crazy day.
[00:09:05] <Eywind> Yea man I bet
[00:09:16] <MikeM> And my shoes don't even have laces...
[00:09:17] <RandomNinja> Eywind, jokes on you my shoes don't have strings
[00:09:20] <Inucroft[NLR]> yes, and that is because people don't use the bus, as such they cut back on services
[00:09:24] <Hamtramck> random, you live in Scandinavia. THat's an inavigable latticework or mountains and ponds.
[00:09:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> buses have a limited amount of places you can go
[00:09:30] <Inucroft[NLR]> as such, less bus ervices ar run
[00:09:38] <Inucroft[NLR]> Cloud_Zephyr you can get a connection
[00:09:45] <RandomNinja> actually I live in a city and don't own a car
[00:09:47] <Hamtramck> There's not really anywhere worth going here that doesn't have bus access.
[00:10:09] <Cloud_Zephyr> you have to "walk" to the bus stop :P

[00:11:23] <RandomNinja> but I have to transport a good 50+ kg of... beverages on a near-weekly basis
[00:11:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> now windows 10 is being a butt
[00:11:26] <Hamtramck> Columbus' big problem is that we have like, three roads that everyone uses for everything.
[00:11:28] <Hamtramck> So traffic
[00:11:30] <RandomNinja> there's no way I can do that by bus
[00:11:44] <Hamtramck> random maybe you could get swole and just carry it >:C
[00:11:49] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja eh, train?
[00:11:53] <Inucroft[NLR]> ^
[00:11:53] <Cloud_Zephyr> ah yus the other problem. buses have limited storage
[00:12:05] <Inucroft[NLR]> not an issue if ur working or doing a small shop
[00:12:08] <Hamtramck> also why are yuo hauling 50kg of beverages everywhere
[00:12:14] <Inucroft[NLR]> he's swedish

[00:13:49] <RandomNinja> kind of
[00:13:51] <Eywind> there it's legal
