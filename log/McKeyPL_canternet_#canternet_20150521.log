[12:46:17] <Joshua> How is everyone?
[12:47:15] <Lunia> hey
[12:47:43] <Lunia> im recovering slowly
[12:48:04] <Joshua> Listen, I didn't want to tell you guys this, since it seems so nice a day, but... You guys have heard of Cinema Questria, right?
[12:48:34] <Lunia> they got shut down or something
[12:48:40] <Lunia> who they are?
[12:48:43] <Lunia> were*
[12:48:51] <Joshua> They were a livestream channel.
[12:49:01] <Joshua> And yes, Hasbro slapped a C&D on them.
[12:49:09] <Lunia> cool
[12:49:20] <Joshua> Thankfully, The Brony Network is still alive.
[12:49:46] <Joshua> And by the way, thank you for such a calm response.
[12:50:05] <Lunia> im not moved 
[12:50:10] <Joshua> No, really, I saw the news, and there were others who were flipping out like it's the end of the world.
[12:50:31] <Lunia> i dont watch LS so it doesnt affect me
[12:50:54] <Lunia> it sucks though
[12:51:04] <Joshua> I watch MLP episode streams on Livestream or Ustream.
[12:51:09] <Lunia> i thought Hasbro calmed down a notch
[12:51:30] <Lunia> i usually wait for better release
[12:51:37] <Joshua> I thought so too, but this seems low.
[12:52:02] <Lunia> yep
[12:52:18] <Joshua> First time I've seen Hasbro get angry at streaming sites just because they stream their MLP episodes.
[12:52:48] <Lunia> they gone cray cray
[12:53:03] <Lunia> ok goin smokin
[12:53:06] <Lunia> brb
[12:53:08] <Joshua> Let's just hope we can still watch MLP episodes online.
[12:53:10] <McKey> Go with me crazy go with me crazy :p
[12:53:25] <Lunia> heuheu
[12:53:37] * Lunia wobbles away
[12:54:15] <Joshua> As long as BN King's livestream is untouched, we're good.
[12:55:25] <Joshua> I wonder who's NEXT to fall?
