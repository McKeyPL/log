[08:28:03] <Flame> prob not gonna immediately get the bluray drive xD nor something else idk
[08:28:07] <Nikashi> was about $900 and that wasn't including the video card
[08:28:10] <Nikashi> no optical either
[08:28:17] <Flame> maybe not gonna go for a Core i5 4690k
[08:28:25] <princesssluttershy> Mine was about $700 I think after I added the ssd and extra fans and cpu cooler
[08:28:35] <weisey> princesssluttershy, yeah but remember, the ps4 only uses 27% of its power to run the games, gotta keep up with that
[08:28:44] <princesssluttershy> Hmm you're right
[08:28:59] <Flame> ....
[08:29:03] <princesssluttershy> you'd better make that 6 xeons and 50 Titan Blacks

[19:37:33] <OmarianVolcae> Or it will brutally eviscerate you with it's razor sharp claws.
[19:37:35] <OmarianVolcae> :D
[19:37:42] <Drago> Aww, why are their tails broken at the bottom D:
[19:38:07] <Drago> Poor lil things
[19:38:13] <OmarianVolcae> The folk story goes that a hunter finds the tailypo and cuts it's tail off.
[19:38:35] <Drago> Ahh ok
[19:38:46] <OmarianVolcae> As he sleeps, the tailypo comes seeking it's tail. When he refuses, the tailypo kills the hunter and destroys his home.
[19:38:57] <OmarianVolcae> I guess in the drawings, the Tailypo reattached it's tail.

[20:23:59] * OmarianVolcae pets princesssluttershy.
[20:24:10] <Drago> I should amke a tumblr or something. I donlt have anything
[20:24:42] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah!
[20:24:50] <OmarianVolcae> It's easy and doesn't cost anything.
[20:25:00] <Drago> But I also dont have much clop related drawings. But I should draw more. I enjoy it. Dunno why I don't draw more often.
[20:25:45] <Drago> I'll make a tumblr today :P
[20:25:49] <OmarianVolcae> We can't really do trades, but I think it would be fun to collaborate on some drawings.
[20:26:17] <Drago> I don;lt even know what you mean by trades

[21:27:39] <princesssluttershy> Because in Canada you can either wait for one that's covered by healthcare or you can go to a private company
