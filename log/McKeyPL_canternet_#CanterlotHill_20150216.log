[01:58:48] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> I've learned that you are taught this math stuff so you can solve problems
[01:58:51] <OctaveMobile> It was fun to learn, but eh
[01:58:56] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> doesnt mean that they're all math problems
[01:59:16] <Hamtramck> Quite.
[01:59:37] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> I was in a math class
[01:59:41] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> and I just realized
[01:59:59] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> That if I was a kid and saw that, I'd have no idea what any of it meant
[02:00:05] <RandomNinja> nope
[02:00:09] <OctaveMobile> Most advanced maths I use at work is calculating tolerances on blueprints
[02:00:14] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> And that made me feel good to know that I learned a lot.
[02:00:40] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> also you gotta know math so you can do taxes
[02:00:45] <RandomNinja> the problem with math is that's it's often teached is a very boring way
[02:00:52] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> which is important
[02:00:56] <Hamtramck> Kawaii: Not really yo just put everything in turbotax and it gets did for you :V
[02:00:59] <RandomNinja> so people hate it because it sucked as a school sublect
[02:01:03] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> pls
[02:01:11] <Hamtramck> Math textbooks are p. awful

[02:01:23] <RandomNinja> have you tried non american ones? :P
[02:01:35] <RandomNinja> all my textbooks post elementary have been good
[02:01:42] <Hamtramck> Most of my CS classes in college were also pretty awful.
[02:01:53] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> try one of those japanese manga school textbooks
[02:01:53] <SpellLight> gooooood morning, everypony
[02:01:56] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> yo
[02:01:58] <RandomNinja> my precalc/basic calculus book was great
[02:02:01] <OctaveMobile> Who needs maths for taxes? Sign the paper they send and it's done
[02:02:05] <SpellLight> and a happy Princessversary to you.
[02:02:55] <Hamtramck> I legits learned more about how computers work at a lower level by spending a day screwing around with Genesis romhacking than I did in two whole semesters of CS courses that were supposed to cover that topic :(
[02:03:21] <RandomNinja> yeah mostly because of approach
[02:03:44] <RandomNinja> you were digging into it because you were interested in learning how to do something instead of just trying to pass class
[02:03:57] <Hamtramck> Random, also the material they gave us kind of blew.
[02:04:02] <RandomNinja> that helps
[02:04:04] <RandomNinja> but still
[02:04:20] <Hamtramck> Like they used an imaginary assembly language that was like loosely based on MIPS but without any of the stuff that makes MIPS neat.
[02:04:33] <RandomNinja> I don't know what MIPS is though :P
[02:04:36] <Hamtramck> Also that prof was retiring that next year so his senioritis was about on par with the students'.
[02:04:45] <RandomNinja> :/
[02:04:47] <Hamtramck> MIPS is the sort of assembly you encounter with playstation games
[02:04:51] <Hamtramck> Also the prof I had that was like
[02:04:52] <Hamtramck> ok
[02:04:52] <RandomNinja> ah
[02:04:56] <Hamtramck> imma read this powerpoint slides
[02:05:13] <Hamtramck> I never even bothered showing up for that class on time, oh my goddddddddd.
[02:05:20] <Hamtramck> College is expensive bro, respect our time :(
[02:05:26] <RandomNinja> mine isn't :3

[02:09:01] <Hamtramck> Anyway though, I think the issue with a lot of CS programs is that they're... mmm... focused more on pumping out web programmers than people that know how computers work.
[02:09:05] <WildSoft> he famously made a speech that began with praising the town. Problem was, wrong town :P
[02:09:45] <WildSoft> but he has a sense of humour, several years later he came back and did the same thing again
[02:09:47] <RandomNinja> learning how to do things instead of learning why they work=
[02:09:49] <RandomNinja> ?*
[02:09:52] <Hamtramck> So you get people that can do .NET programming in a limited and structured environment but can't figure it out why their codes doesn't work /well/

[18:24:29] <Eywind> :P
[18:24:29] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> My only interactions with people from the UK are scottish
[18:24:33] <Eywind> SkyHigh I mean
[18:24:42] <Eywind> do you live by yourself? with people? with family? etc
[18:24:48] <SkyHigh> Last year I spent £8314
[18:24:54] <SkyHigh> I said
[18:24:56] <SkyHigh> Well
[18:25:01] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> so how are those chavs?
[18:25:17] <Eywind> 300 is not a lot of expenses if you're actually paying for rent
[18:25:25] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> so yeh goin around thinkin you richie rich or sa'nk?
[18:25:57] <SkyHigh> I live with 3 friends (even though I pay all the finances because they're stupid) and my girlfriend comes round a lot.

[18:26:16] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[18:26:16] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about NEDS Kru ft. The Wee Man
[18:26:18] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> Fet
[18:26:18] <SkyHigh> Eywind: excluding rent, which is generally shared
[18:26:20] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> How no?
[18:26:33] <SkyHigh> Rent is £650/m
[18:26:40] <Eywind> ah oka
[18:26:45] <SkyHigh> But there's 4 of us
[18:26:55] <Eywind> yeah I guess that would decrease your expenses a bit
[18:27:00] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> I'd love to visit scotland, but I just don't want to get beat up because I was laughing at how silly they talk
[18:27:07] <SkyHigh> So that's £162.50 each
[18:27:30] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> dealing with skagboys is no joke
[18:27:44] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> I watched Trainspotting, which is an accurate repesentation of scotland
[18:28:09] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> Had less bangin' donks though
[18:28:59] <SkyHigh> Eywind: I earn the most so sometimes ill end up paying £200
[18:29:11] <Eywind> yeah that's fair
[18:29:34] <SkyHigh> £2100 a month is very good for a twenty year old.
[18:29:41] <Eywind> oh definitely
[18:29:49] <SkyHigh> -£500
[18:29:51] <Eywind> I was making about that much then lol
[18:30:00] <Eywind> but I had an adult job
[18:30:07] <Eywind> and not fast food :P
[18:30:14] <SkyHigh> Around £1600 each month to spend on myself.
[18:30:17] <Eywind> (which means it's a lot)
[18:30:25] <Eywind> yeah hopefully a lot is going into savings haha
[18:30:45] <SkyHigh> Eywind: we call that full time.
[18:31:08] <Eywind> I just call it 'adult jobs'
[18:31:14] <Eywind> because some of my friends still work kids jobs lol
[18:31:16] <Eywind> and I'm 26 haha
[18:31:17] <SkyHigh> xD
[18:31:22] <SkyHigh> I'm 20
[18:31:29] <Eywind> well yeah
[18:31:32] <Eywind> I got an adult job at 19
[18:31:39] <SkyHigh> To be fair I earn a lot because I'm really smart
[18:31:41] <Eywind> lol

[18:32:22] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> But I know the grading in the UK is much more lenient than in america
[18:32:24] <SkyHigh> xD
[18:32:53] <SkyHigh> I got grades in GCSE better than most people can when they're 25.
[18:33:00] <SkyHigh> ...when I was 17...
[18:33:00] <EuphemiaDolomite> What's a GCSE?
[18:33:05] <SkyHigh> Exam
[18:33:15] <SkyHigh> Before you do a degree
[18:33:21] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> General Chav Sesonal Exam
[18:33:30] <SkyHigh> :/
[18:33:31] <EuphemiaDolomite> Oh highschool exam scores don't really matter once you get out of highschool
[18:33:40] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> He was taking his Chav exam so he can get his burbury and bling

[20:34:52] <NightmareMoon> Just as easily as Twilight or 50 Shades.
[20:35:03] * NightmareMoon isn't nibbling, she's eating whole.
[20:35:10] <WildSoft> But, but it was sooo good :(
[20:35:41] <WildSoft> sure it had some small issues, but over all it was very good
[20:35:44] <wobniaR> RIP in pepperoni WildSoft
[20:35:49] <Eywind> there's a difference between you liking something and something being good lol
[20:35:59] <WildSoft> that's true
[20:36:07] <WildSoft> I loved it for what it was
[20:36:14] <Eywind> a fic about an alicorn oc? :P
[20:36:18] <wobniaR> I like Flash Sentry
[20:36:35] <wobniaR> He's the best character they added to MLP ever
[20:36:40] <Eywind> dem abs
[20:36:40] <WildSoft> It kind of reminded me of Harry Potter, but with the ponies I love
[20:36:49] <wobniaR> He's got almost Ash Ketchum abs
[20:37:00] <NightmareMoon> The main character was a Mary Sue, the editing and writing was so horrendous it took a million edits AFTER it was released to turn it into some semblance of a story. The characters were constantly OOC, and he constantly edited them to be even more so at times. His editors were the ones who made the story what it was, not him. I saw what it looked like before editing. Holy hell was it terrible. And
[20:37:16] * WildSoft googles Mary Sue
[20:37:19] <NightmareMoon> And that's the tip of the iceberg.
[20:37:29] <wobniaR> Generic, stereotypical
[20:38:11] <wobniaR> I think Fallout equestria is terrible but many people disagree with me
[20:38:23] * WildSoft passes a banana to NightmareMoon
[20:38:33] <NightmareMoon> FOE started out terrible, but it became far better. PS was terrible the entire way through.
[20:38:49] <WildSoft> I got into Past Sins after all the editing
[20:39:06] <NightmareMoon> It's still a bad story, even after that.
[20:39:33] <WildSoft> sure, I also saw a lot of unpolished things and other stuff I didn't agree with. But it had potential

[20:41:18] *** Pony_38043 is now known as Seaward_Skies
[20:41:36] <WildSoft> NightmareMoon I agree. It had much more potential, like the (failure) of Frozen
[20:42:28] <NightmareMoon> PS, however, never even reached close to its potential. Hell, if one paid attention to it, it was one of those stories that was a huge hit. At first. But then the author's actions, as well as people waking up made it a hugely reviled fanfic to the point it had more haters than fans.
[20:42:35] <WildSoft> But if you can see past what could have been, it was still a good story. Not sure why I feel it was, but perhaps it appealed to something from my past
[20:42:45] <NightmareMoon> Lots of Nyx hate to go around.
[20:42:55] <NightmareMoon> No, it's not a good story even looking past that.

[23:00:31] <Cloud_Zephyr> and internet radio is tedious unless ur on a computer
[23:00:34] <Zuthal> why that, Eywind?
[23:00:54] <Eywind> Zuthal because radio waves don't really travel -that- far
[23:00:59] <Zuthal> AM does
[23:01:15] <Zuthal> AM can go from Germany to northern Africa
[23:01:23] <Zuthal> if you have a sufficiently powerful transmitter
