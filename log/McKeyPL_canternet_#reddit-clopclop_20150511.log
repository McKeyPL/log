[01:01:42] <Melon_Phone> as someone with no taste of earbuds, they're quite nice 
[01:01:47] <Luvbi> 13I don't like these, because they're oddly shaped. My right ear isn't shaped right (or something, I don't know) so the speaker is pressing like, against the wall of my ear, and I don't hear the music as well in that ear

[01:02:49] <Luvbi> 13I like being able to hear my music, and very clearly. When I can't, I'm sad. So a nice pair of headphones will be nice

[02:20:27] <thaostra> Vulpixbrew, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that maybe there was a discrepancy between the owners of the restaurant and the webmaster whom they hired to maintain the online menu
[02:21:43] <Luvbi> 13Yeah, that
[02:21:48] <Luvbi> 13I was totally thinking the same thing
[02:23:55] <thaostra> Stuff like this happens all the time in the service industry. Customers come in, see the price tag, only to get angry that the employees who work minimum wage didn't update the price in time. Believe me, rarely are these things done out of malice
[02:24:46] * Vulpixbrew shrugs
[02:26:30] <Luvbi> 13My thoughts exactly, thao. It's like you took the words right out of my mouth
[02:30:19] <Vulpixbrew> more annoying that tjhe money was meant for other things
[02:30:37] <thaostra> I dealt with a situation like this before, where I bought an item off of Amazon that didn't ever show up. Feeling cheated, I decided to leave a bad review, but instead I was redirected to their customer service. Turns out the third party who handled electronic payments for the company didn't make the transaction complete on their end. So had I not learned of this, the company would've had a bad review on their amazon page without 
[02:30:37] <thaostra> deserving it
[02:33:49] <thaostra> So yeah, I understand it's frustrating that you were misled, but stuff like this isn't usually their fault

[20:38:09] <Melon_Phone> an average 10 minute shower in pedigree horse semen is $922M
[20:39:44] <Melon_Phone> an average dose of usable semen is 4mL (of the 70mL the stallion ejaculates). Each dose is about $5k at a reasonable breeder
[20:40:14] <Melon_Phone> fuck
[20:40:17] <Melon_Phone> LOL
[20:40:49] <Melon_Phone> $922M if you want to water your garden in pedigree horse semen for 10 mins
