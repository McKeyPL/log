[06:25:03] <cyborg_ar> Fallfeathers: have you tried turning it off and on again?
[06:25:19] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: :(
[06:25:26] <Fallfeathers> cyborg_ar: yes, I've also tried installing new firmware and also hitting it solidly with a book
[06:25:34] <JustAberrant> get in there with wireshark and see what's going on
[06:26:10] <Fallfeathers> it's matching incoming requests to the forwarding rule
[06:26:10] <JustAberrant> or tcpdump if your lazy ;p
[06:26:14] <Fallfeathers> it's just not forwarding them
[06:26:33] <JustAberrant> :(
[06:26:46] <Fallfeathers> tbh at this point I'm willing to say that its a shitty router
[06:27:07] <JustAberrant> :(

[07:09:48] * Colgate removes all of JustAberrant sheets, they were not Stallman/FSF approved materials.
[07:11:52] <JustAberrant> :(
[07:12:19] * JustAberrant gives Colgate something resembling a fishing net called LibreBlanket
[07:12:37] <JustAberrant> it doesn't actually meet the use cases of blanket, but it does respect your freedom :(
[07:13:01] <JustAberrant> and on that note, really bed
[07:13:02] * Colgate files a bug report, holes too big to be useful.

[07:21:57] <Phase4> depends on what ssh client you use
[07:22:07] <Colgate> get an ssh client
[07:22:09] <Colgate> connect int

[07:22:13] <Colgate> profit!
[07:22:15] <Phase4> i recommend the one that comes with git
[07:22:46] <Phase4> can also set HOME=%USERPROFILE% (or %APPDATA% if you prefer) and it'll look there for ssh keys
