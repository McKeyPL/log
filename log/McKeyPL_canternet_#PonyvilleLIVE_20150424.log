[14:15:30] <MangoBloom> yup
[14:16:36] <MangoBloom> Electron: you may have noticed the radio's been a bit glitchy today
[14:16:55] <MangoBloom> it's because i have restarted it often, trying new code
[14:17:30] <MangoBloom> for some reason, Liquidsoap crashes when i try to play some M4A/AAC files :(

[14:29:48] <Electron> well take bricks, take cement and build
[14:30:39] <MangoBloom> i compiled liquidsoap and all it's dependencies, so something it relied on got updated and broke
