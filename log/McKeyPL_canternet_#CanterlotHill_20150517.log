[20:06:12] <thereallynewmop12100_> miss: Yeah
[20:07:15] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, finally saw latest episode.
[20:07:31] <miss> Muffin_Spectacles: what did you think of it?
[20:07:56] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, it's probably the one episode that actually seemed pretty solid so far this season.
[20:09:19] <Muffin_Spectacles> At the most, it felt like a more solid Discord episode than the last time we saw him.
[20:11:31] <miss> Muffin_Spectacles: i didn't look at all the episode. but it was a nice episode for now
[20:14:17] <Eywind> From a casual watcher, I've liked most of the season so far
[20:14:38] <Twilightlicious> Needs more lasers and explosions
[20:14:59] <Eywind> The last episode I was expecting a lot more given the amount of spoilers I had heard, but it turned out pleasantly nice

[20:16:31] <Eywind> wat
[20:17:27] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: I think people need to temper their expectations with Discord episodes. It seems like people go 20 times crazier hearing he's showing up, just like those when Trixie shows up.
[20:17:47] <Muffin_Spectacles> Though is it me, or are the showrunners 'regressing' the CMC? They seem more like their Season 1 versions.

[20:19:28] <Muffin_Spectacles> And, by the looks of that ep, Trollestia fans have more fuel to add to their fire.
[20:19:31] <wobniaR> Kids do that
[20:20:58] <Muffin_Spectacles> This season also seems to be throwing continuity out of whack. We just came off a fall/winter ep a little while ago, and now it's time for the gala.

[22:03:24] <EM-C> They're doing a lot of brony fan service, though.  I don't object in principal, but they're now aiming for the bronies as much as the original target audience.
[22:03:32] <sunsetwubs> Lycan: <3
[22:03:33] <Lycan> I actually liked the character of Tree Hugger
[22:03:42] <EM-C> She was hilarious.
[22:03:46] <Playstation> Yeah maaan
[22:03:50] <Playstation> Totally
[22:03:58] <Lycan> A lot of people didn't appreciate the stereotype
[22:04:01] <sunsetwubs> Lycan: <3
[22:04:09] <EM-C> Best lines in history (third to Pinkie Pie and Derpy's original voice).
[22:04:09] <Lycan> Hiya sunsetwubs :)
[22:04:38] <EM-C> You mean actual, real-life hippies were offended?  That makes it even more hilarious!
[22:04:47] <Eywind> I did not like tree hugger
[22:05:00] <Playstation> How dare you
[22:05:04] * Lycan thinks Eywind needs to chill out a bit more
[22:05:04] <RandomNinja> actual, real-life hippes watch ponies or follow entertainment whatsoever?
[22:05:12] <Lycan> And go with the flow!
[22:05:15] <EM-C> She was funny, and is a master (mistress) of sonic bliss vibrations.
[22:05:19] <Eywind> I mean I just didn't like that persona
[22:05:34] <Eywind> I mean they kinda had to play it that way if they wanted Discord's reactions to her
[22:06:16] <EM-C> Her "ohm" whinny was the best!
[22:06:26] <Eywind> It was umm a wat moment
[22:06:27] <Playstation> Yes
[22:06:29] <Lycan> I think she was pretty believable, actually
[22:06:42] <Eywind> She was a walking stereotype
[22:06:43] * RandomNinja applies fps counters to Unixkitty http://i.imgur.com/udGMAXv.png
[22:06:58] <Unixkitty> Cinematic?
[22:07:04] <Lycan> And that's a problem Eywind??
[22:07:17] <EM-C> I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a bad influence on Fluttershy.  Ordinarily, being a kids' cartoon, I wouldn't have to worry about that sort of thing.
[22:07:24] <Eywind> No, but that's not really wha tI want
[22:07:27] <Eywind> EM-C we probably won't see her again
[22:07:36] <Lycan> ^
[22:07:36] <EM-C> But if they're fan-servicing the bronies now, no telling what she'll wind up doing.
[22:07:43] <Eywind> Or we'll see her in a throw-away cameo
[22:07:47] <Playstation> ^
[22:07:47] <Lycan> hugging trees??
[22:07:53] <EM-C> We're seeing more of Maud.
[22:07:55] <RandomNinja> I'd watch that
[22:08:00] <Eywind> Maud is different than a random friend
[22:08:01] <RandomNinja> Maud is great though
[22:08:11] <RandomNinja> also burn master 2015
[22:08:15] <EM-C> Listen Lycan: I remember the 60s.  I never associated actual hippies with a love of trees or of nature or anything like that.
[22:08:22] <EM-C> I think that's a "retcon" of hippies.
[22:08:44] <EM-C> I was the one who loved trees and nature, and I was as far from being a hippie as anyone can get.
[22:09:24] <EM-C> But we do need lots of Tree Hugger fics and art now.
[22:09:32] <RandomNinja> for science
[22:09:42] <Eywind> well I'm sure we'll see a few
