[02:10:37] <RandomNinja> I'll be honest, I wouldn't mind a giant monument as a tomb
[02:10:46] <Eywind> Yeah I want one built on the back of the lives of slaves
[02:10:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> darn, the keyboard i want is ¬£80
[02:10:58] <Eywind> what kind Cloud_Zephyr?
[02:11:04] <RandomNinja> actually most of the pyramid workers were apparently free men
[02:11:17] <Eywind> your point?

[02:11:39] <Cloud_Zephyr> darn
[02:11:43] <Chrysalis> Silly filly
[02:11:49] <Eywind> meh
[02:11:52] <Eywind> no numpad
[02:11:57] <Eywind> I woudln't pay 80 pounds for that
[02:12:00] *** Quits: TheAndyMac[NLR] (IceChat77@Pony-qfh114.range81-159.btcentralplus.com) (Quit: Man who run behind car get exhausted)
[02:12:00] <Cloud_Zephyr> thats the point (for me)
[02:12:06] <Eywind> the point is that you don't want a numpad?
[02:12:17] <Eywind> or arrow keys or anything?
[02:12:23] <Eywind> do you intend on playing 0 video gamesa?
[02:12:34] <MikeM> Why get a separate keyboard without those things?
[02:12:42] <Chrysalis> Eywind: Raxy has a Corsair K95. They have never used the numberpad.
[02:12:48] <Eywind> I use mine a lot cuz I work
[02:12:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh wait thats a point. why aren't their arrow keys
[02:12:58] <Eywind> and use the numpad at work
[02:13:04] <Eywind> exactly Cloud_Zephyr, those mini keyboards are not good
[02:13:10] <Eywind> you can get ones without numpads, but the arrow keys are wow
[02:13:16] <Regulus> I <3 number pad
[02:13:18] <Chrysalis> Eywind: Eww Math. Yes. I hog Raxy's PC and game!
[02:13:23] <Eywind> math?
[02:13:27] <Eywind> numpad is just for typing numbers really fast
[02:13:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> yeah i want one without numpads but with arrow keys
[02:13:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> numpad i never use and takes up space
[02:13:53] <Chrysalis> #BoycotNumPad2015 :p
[02:14:04] <Eywind> just look at the corsair series
[02:14:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> kk
[02:14:08] <Chrysalis> Give me more gaming keys
[02:14:10] <Eywind> they're probably cheaper than that anyways
[02:14:17] <Eywind> Chrysalis you can just bind numpad to gaming keys...
[02:14:41] <Cloud_Zephyr> :O solution! http://www.amazon.co.uk/Corsair-CH-9000040-UK-Vengeance-Performance-Mechanical/dp/B00DOTQ15M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1431735262&sr=8-3&keywords=corsair+series+keyboard

[02:15:27] <RandomNinja> unlike u
[02:15:41] <Twilightlicious> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaPgK073xEg
[02:15:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> pls
[02:17:36] <Cloud_Zephyr> numpads are awkward. for optimum ergonomics the letter part of the keyboard should be in the centre of the monitor. leaving not as much mouse space
[02:18:23] <Regulus> Bruh
[02:18:35] <Regulus> Do you even work?
[02:18:39] <Cloud_Zephyr> nope
[02:18:43] <RandomNinja> he does not
[02:18:47] <Regulus> Number pads are a time saver
[02:18:52] <RandomNinja> also, he doesn't even lift
[02:18:55] <Cloud_Zephyr> :P
[02:19:16] <Regulus> I refuse to use keyboards without number pads
[02:19:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> even with a numpad i usually just use the numbers on the top
[02:19:57] <RandomNinja> because you're a skrub
[02:20:00] <Chrysalis> Never used a number pad. Can I cut it off ans ship you it?
[02:20:17] <Chrysalis> I would enjoy the extra space on my desk
[02:20:31] <Cloud_Zephyr> i guess im used to not having a numpad from my macbook
[02:20:47] <Chrysalis> Oh. Wait Raxy's media keys are on that side. Darn then

[03:42:35] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[03:42:36] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about [Electronic Rock] Tarby - The Other Side + The Final Trees
[03:42:44] <Seventh_Element> Tarby kicks butt
[03:42:49] <Chrysalis> Yes :)
[03:42:58] <Seventh_Element> I actually did a remix for that album
[03:42:59] *** Chrysalis is now known as Araxnus

[03:46:28] <Seventh_Element> man I need to make some more videos
[03:46:35] <Araxnus> stuff is nice
[03:46:40] <Seventh_Element> I really need to get a video editing program that doesn't suck
[03:46:54] <wobniaR> I used windows movie maker lol
[03:47:06] <Seventh_Element> Apparently that renders audio with the wrong sample rate
[03:47:14] <Seventh_Element> so I'm no longer inclined to do that
[03:47:15] <wobniaR> It's weird
[03:47:25] <Seventh_Element> I wish I could use After Effects
[03:47:29] <Seventh_Element> I have a suuuuper old version
[03:47:32] <Seventh_Element> but it sucks really bad
[03:47:40] <wobniaR> The video I exported from it came out in like 360p when I uploaded it to youtube
[03:48:04] <Seventh_Element> I've basically been making stuff with it, then sending it to a friend to render it for me
[03:48:10] <Seventh_Element> but I can't depend on him being there all the time
[03:48:22] <wobniaR> I used SFM for a bit which was okay but it took a while to export the video

[04:54:48] <Hamtramck> Or even talk to her really
[04:55:02] <Hamtramck> Basically my ideal wife would be like, getting married for some tax purposes and then we /never see eachother ever/
[04:55:16] <MikeM> I've seen opportunities like that on Craigslist.
[04:57:43] <Sombra> I'm fairly certain most adult girls don't like mlp anyway.
[04:58:00] <MikeM> To be fair, most adult men don't like it, either.
[04:58:28] <Sombra> Even fewer girls though.
[04:58:43] <FN> That would be tax evasion though Hamtramck 
[04:59:39] <MikeM> Good tax stuff doesn't come until you have kids, anyway.
[04:59:42] <Sombra> Only if you get caught
[05:00:28] <FN> Welp documented self-admission right there ^ logged forever
[05:00:43] <Sombra> Ha, I don't think anyone would ever marry me, not even for tax purposes.
[05:00:50] <MikeM> Where is that NSA pony, anyway?
[05:01:15] <Hamtramck> Yeah does marriage even get you a tax break
[05:01:19] <Hamtramck> I heard it didn't.
[05:01:31] <Hamtramck> Like joint filing is all LOL NO REFUNDS FOR YOU
[05:02:16] <FN> Why even get married then at all?
[05:02:17] <Sombra> I dunno.
[05:02:29] <Sombra> Symbolism.
[05:02:32] <MikeM> For the non-tax benefits?

[06:00:00] <DrelvanianGuard> watching an interesting conversation between MA Larson and Claire Corlette
[06:00:12] <DrelvanianGuard> apparently there will be a Season where Sweetie Belle kills everyone.
[06:00:31] <DrelvanianGuard> All because Claire is going to buy Larson's book
[06:01:16] <MikeM> Sweetie Belle unleashes the unicorn equivalent of Skynet in Season 8.
[06:02:15] <DrelvanianGuard> I want some of MA Larson's burnt Encheladas..
[06:02:33] <MikeM> Don't those look horrible?
[06:02:43] <Hickory> And that's how we come to fallout equestria
[06:03:28] <DrelvanianGuard> oh wow MA Larson replied to my reply to one of his tweets
[06:03:41] <DrelvanianGuard> I asked if I buy his book do I get free enchiladas
[06:04:48] <DrelvanianGuard> That awkwrad moment when MA Larson's reply to me seems more humanlike than Gabe's reply.
[06:05:46] <MikeM> Larson seems like a really cool dude.

[16:38:22] <FruitNibbler> Tricky topic, I certainly would not want to be the official judge on this one
[16:38:36] <RandomNinja> we should make parallel leagues
[16:38:57] <RandomNinja> allow athletes to do whatever they want with their bodies, but ban them from regular competitions
[16:39:03] <RandomNinja> imagine contact sports
[16:39:08] <FruitNibbler> That can lead to "safe spaces"
[16:39:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> lel brb i must restart

[16:39:45] * DerpyBot sways from side to side, quietly humming "shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo"
[16:39:45] <DinkyBot> What a silly song, momma!
[16:39:49] <RandomNinja> what do you mean
[16:40:16] *** Cloud_Zephyr is now known as Cloud_Zephyr|Away
[16:40:45] <wobniaR> Woo new Denny's commercial
[16:40:47] <FruitNibbler> Like the unbeatable russian wrestler had an inborn advantage: he had ginormous heart and lung capacity for his size, so he could last much longer than any other wrestler

[16:41:25] <FruitNibbler> And by that I mean the real olympic wrestling, not the ballerina wrastlin of WWE
[16:41:54] <RandomNinja> well that's just occasionally fun to watch, it's not a competition
[16:42:14] <wobniaR> It's entertainment
[16:42:18] <RandomNinja> yeah
[16:42:28] <FruitNibbler> Weird entertainment
[16:42:35] * Trildar flops
[16:42:42] <wobniaR> We like a show about cartoon ponies
[16:42:42] <RandomNinja> it's basically movie fights, except live and cheesier
[16:42:48] <wobniaR> To many that's considered weird entertainment
[16:42:54] <FruitNibbler> I'd rather watch movie stuntman do the job, it is less cheesy and mui professionao
[16:43:48] <FruitNibbler> I treat MLP no different than anime or movies personally
[16:44:11] <wobniaR> Many people consider anime weird entertainment
[16:44:13] <FruitNibbler> It's just brony thing is also very interesting, so I hopped on the hype train as well
[16:44:15] <RandomNinja> well cartoon horses are best horses
[16:44:26] <RandomNinja> to be fair lots of anime is really weird :P
[16:44:31] <wobniaR> pls
[16:44:36] <FruitNibbler> Indeed
[16:44:54] <wobniaR> Japanese culture is weird for us
[16:44:56] <FruitNibbler> But then again, what is not weird coming from Japan?
[16:45:28] <FruitNibbler> It is so alien to us, that it just bound to be labelled as such in the West
[16:46:32] <FruitNibbler> 44min remaining

[20:24:08] <Eywind> There's one song I can stomach his lead singing on
[20:24:12] <FritzyBeat[LDB]live> His vocals still have a charm to them ^_^
[20:24:18] <StandingLeaf> ^
[20:24:20] <Eywind> No, RDP songs have a charm to their vocals
[20:24:26] <Eywind> His is just bhasdkflj;asdlfkjas;dlf

[20:24:37] <FritzyBeat[LDB]live> I like his vocals~ They used to be iffy, but they have gotten a lot better, esspecially live.
[20:24:41] <FritzyBeat[LDB]live> so really
[20:24:42] <wobniaR> Don't bet on sinking ships
[20:24:45] <Scooblee> I think he's gotten a little better, at least
[20:24:58] <wobniaR> Oh hey didn't a certain person sing a cover of that?
[20:25:08] <FritzyBeat[LDB]live> if you don't like his vocals now, then the only reason would have to be you just aren't a fan of the heavy accent~ Cause he's still singing decently =P
[20:25:11] <Eywind> SlyphStorm?  Yeah he did
[20:25:11] <Eywind> :P

[20:26:47] <Eywind> I can't say I"m a huge fan of Tombstone in general though >.>
[20:26:49] <Scooblee> I'd love to see musicians get on stage at a Con try to sing a song with glitch vocals. That'd make my day.
