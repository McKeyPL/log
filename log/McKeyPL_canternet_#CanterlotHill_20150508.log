[03:48:50] <Starlight_Glimmer> They have one right near LAX. Raxy used to stay there a lot. 
[03:49:09] <Hamtramck> Nope.
[03:49:09] <Starlight_Glimmer> They also have a club floor and club ;)

[03:56:10] <EM-C> After my Delta trip last year I was toying with going back to Columbus this spring.  But spring came late and I've been having car trouble.

[03:57:14] <MikeM> True dat.

[03:57:21] <Araxnus> We used to have a con. It was so bad the hotel shut down a year later :p

[04:02:10] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about BOBBY GOLDSBORO - I'M A DRIFTER
[04:02:22] <Hamtramck> Also I think Euphemia Dolomite would be a really good name for a pony OC or possibly a human.
[04:02:49] <EM-C> Hmm.  I've never really tried making up a pony OC.  I prefer the canon cast.

[04:03:39] <Hamtramck> But a Pony... Not So Much is a good band name
[04:03:53] <Angel_Bunny> 'cut of the profits' for band names
[04:03:59] <EM-C> Of course, with my luck any rock band that took a name I'd made up would probably be one of those satanic bands.  Then I'd be implicated in everything they ever did!

[04:08:13] <MikeM> But became a famous Egyptologist.
[04:08:39] <EM-C> We're sort of a non-descript state stuck between the Deep South one one side and Kentucky on the other.
[04:09:02] <EM-C> The Deep South is colorful; Kentucky is colorful.  We're just...there to keep them from bumping together.
[04:09:48] <EM-C> I could make a joke but...I won't.  'Nuff said.
[04:10:09] <MikeM> I always thought Tennessee was really pretty.
[04:10:28] <EM-C> It is.  It's just not as colorful as the Deep South or Kentucky.
[04:10:41] <EM-C> Or Arkansas.  Or North Carolina.  Or maybe Virginia.
[04:10:47] <MikeM> There is a Ducktown, TN. If that was in Japan it would be a town populated by ducks.
[04:10:49] <EM-C> Now, Missouri we're more colorful than!
[04:11:21] <EM-C> Yes, there's a Ducktown.  And a Skullbone, and a Nameless, and a Golddust, and a Gilt Edge.
[04:11:36] <MikeM> Gilt Edge. There's another famous pony.
[04:11:44] <EM-C> There's also a Wartrace.  Is that War Trace or Wart Race???  I could never figure it out.

[08:29:24] <Twilightlicious> OctaveSymphony, my coolant thingy has a hole in the bottom
[08:29:34] <Twilightlicious> by coolant thingy. i mean that yellow jug that says "Coolant Only"
[08:29:50] <Twilightlicious> i'll actually need to get a closer look at it tomorrow before anyone can help me
[08:30:22] <Eywind> So pretty much it's all over your floor instead of in your car now?
[08:30:33] <OctaveSymphony> Well, sadly pretty much the only way I know of fixing this = replace the coolant container
[08:30:50] <Twilightlicious> mhm
[08:30:54] <OctaveSymphony> While trying not to empty out the water in the rest of the system to avoid getting aair in there
[08:31:02] <Twilightlicious> or, duct tape
[08:31:05] <Twilightlicious> :3
[08:31:07] <Eywind> Umm
[08:31:10] <Eywind> It's a car
[08:31:31] <OctaveSymphony> Duct tape may help a little for a while ^^
[08:31:31] <Eywind> Duct tape is not a proper or safe way to fix things in a car
[08:31:41] <OctaveSymphony> But once that water gets warm :P
[08:31:45] <OctaveSymphony> And it does.
[08:31:51] <Eywind> It'd be a good stopgap, as in you put it on there to drive your car to a repair shop
[08:32:37] <OctaveSymphony> But yeah, your car needs a new coolant container, is it an older or newer car?
[08:33:47] <Twilightlicious> Then i will use that weird black stuff in a can
[08:33:50] <Twilightlicious> whatever its called
[08:33:54] <Eywind> ...
[08:33:57] <Eywind> Go get it fixed
[08:34:15] <Twilightlicious> Flex Seal
[08:34:16] <Eywind> Guess what?  You drive a thousand pound piece of metal at high speeds
[08:34:29] <Eywind> Being cheap with your repairs is stupid
[08:34:30] <OctaveSymphony> Kinda why I asked how old it is, those parts can be very very cheap if you don't buy it new 
[08:34:46] <Eywind> Yeah you can just go to a junkyard and get a quite fine one
[08:34:53] <Twilightlicious> Eywind, my gas leaks out every time i put some in my tank. My coolant is the least of my concerns :P
[08:34:54] <OctaveSymphony> And flex seal can be a bad idea, if it gets into the coolant container, it can get into the engine
[08:35:48] <Eywind> Yes, and I'm sure your argument is that you can't fix it with your current budget, but you do need to

[08:38:26] <OctaveSymphony> As said though, it's a pretty cheapish part
[08:38:37] <Eywind> Yeah the gas leak is a lot more problematic
[08:38:52] <OctaveSymphony> Will lose some water and coolant when taking the old container off but that should be it if the person doing it isn't unclever
