[19:42:26] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:42:36] <SilveR^SurfeR> and where to set cahnnel name
[19:42:58] <Colgate> it is a channel mode
[19:43:30] <SilveR^SurfeR> no i want auto invite to room when some one who have access to channel and not present at room through chanserv
[19:44:58] <Colgate> +I is an invite exemption
[19:45:18] <Colgate> it gets rid of the need for an invite to anyone who matches
[19:45:36] <SilveR^SurfeR> some one in room sets a command
[19:46:03] <SilveR^SurfeR> when ever he kicked chanserver invite him to room
[19:46:12] <Colgate> you can't kick chanserv
[19:46:46] <SilveR^SurfeR> no boss
[19:46:53] <SilveR^SurfeR> when i got kicked
[19:46:59] <SilveR^SurfeR> changserv invite me automatically
[19:47:04] <SilveR^SurfeR> like that how to set this flag
[19:47:10] <SilveR^SurfeR> over a userid
[19:47:11] <Colgate> it doesn't exist
[19:47:29] <Colgate> just use a +I exemption
[19:47:37] <Colgate> or tell your ops to not kick your other ops
[19:47:53] <SilveR^SurfeR> how to set +I
[19:48:13] <SilveR^SurfeR> +i means invite only
[19:49:33] <Colgate> /mode #channel +I n!u@h
