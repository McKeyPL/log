[00:51:48] * JustAberrant doesn't know
[00:52:29] <Compu> well its back, im the new owner and the guy who was kickbanning everyone is gone
[00:52:55] <SpikeDragon> What's that? 
[00:53:22] <SpikeDragon> Nvm
[00:53:57] <SpikeDragon> Oh guys. PSA. Don't ever restart a server. Ever. 
[00:54:40] <init3> Oh man. That feel. I know it all too well.
[00:54:40] <SpikeDragon> I logged into mine and I restarted it to install a kernel update. Well, it didn't come back up. 
[00:54:49] <Colgate> that's always fun
[00:55:06] <SpikeDragon> I drove 30 mins to the physical location and was greeted by a grub rescue prompt... 
[00:55:30] <init3> I worked at a Datacenter that lost power while we were still waiting on the permits to install our generator. 300+ servers all rebooting at once.
[00:55:42] <init3> Complete disaster.
[00:55:50] <SpikeDragon> Oh gawd... 
[00:56:03] <init3> Yeah...
[00:56:12] <SpikeDragon> I was lucky... Only had 13 hours downtime... :/
[00:56:28] <init3> We had been waiting over a year for the permit to pour the concrete to set our generator on.
[00:56:42] <SpikeDragon> The update apparently nuked the /boot folder and removed the kernel... 
[00:56:50] <init3> Who needs that?
[00:57:02] <Colgate> I run the systemd kernel
[00:57:03] <SpikeDragon> And what state is that? And exactly. It's optional right? 
[00:57:37] <SpikeDragon> Let me rephrase my first question. What government were you waiting on to approve your permit? 
[00:57:43] <Compu> SpikeDragon: at least it got rid of that system32 virus o3o
[00:57:51] <init3> Flint, Michigan.
[00:57:57] <SpikeDragon> Fun. 
[00:57:58] <init3> If you know about flint
[00:58:04] <init3> You probably know why
[00:58:04] <SpikeDragon> No idea

[00:58:37] <init3> Well... It is (was?) the most violent cities in the US. 
[00:58:45] <init3> Also completely broke.
[00:58:49] <SpikeDragon> Oh... 
[00:59:21] <init3> We just decided to just say to hell with the permit and just did it anyway and pay a fine if they ever bitched. 
[01:00:28] <SpikeDragon> They location I keep my stuff at is one of my friends houses and he has business class Internet :P 
[01:00:39] <init3> Ahh
[01:01:08] <SpikeDragon> *The... You never realize how horrible someone's electric and ethernet wiring are until you try to run infrastructure there

[01:01:55] <init3> Not sure. Got laid off shortly after :(
[01:02:01] <init3> but I highly doubt it.
[01:02:10] <SpikeDragon> Oh :/ sorry to hear that.

[01:02:42] <init3> Heh. Really didn't need to.
[01:02:54] <init3> A year on and they still haven't asked for the keys back.
[01:02:59] <SpikeDragon> Haha 
[01:03:02] <SpikeDragon> Nice 
[01:03:02] <init3> I keep asking them if they want them
[01:03:57] <init3> I know the bossman says he wants to bring me back as soon as he can but the web hosting industry is so saturated nowadays. 
[01:04:21] <SpikeDragon> Sure is... 
[01:04:47] <SpikeDragon> Target node.js people. You can't do websockets on godaddy :P
[01:05:20] <init3> Well I think our biggest competition was more like AWS
[01:05:24] <AppleDash> I don't use shared hosting for anything
[01:05:38] <JustAberrant> ALL HOSTING IS SHARED!
[01:05:42] <JustAberrant> *ahem*
[01:05:55] <AppleDash> You know what I mean :P
[01:06:02] <JustAberrant> :>
[01:06:05] <init3> Shared hosting is a great money maker though
[01:06:30] <JustAberrant> I dunno, I got a friend who, in his words, "is getting outa that shit"
[01:06:56] <init3> Well support is where you go to die really,
[01:07:07] <SpikeDragon> Aws... *vomit*

[01:07:29] <AppleDash> AWS isn't that bad
[01:07:30] <init3> Lol abuse complaints
[01:07:34] * init3 pukes
[01:08:14] <JustAberrant> he mainly does design/consulting/management stuff, hosting things on his own colocated servers
[01:08:17] <SpikeDragon> Google app engine
[01:08:20] * SpikeDragon dies
[01:08:24] <JustAberrant> but he also offered straight hosting
[01:08:24] <Colgate> microsoft azure
[01:08:31] <SpikeDragon> Lol
[01:08:36] <init3> The margins are decent if you have a lot of smaller sites and use good hardware. 
[01:08:38] <JustAberrant> so part of it is probably that he isn't really a hosting company ;p
[01:08:55] <init3> but the support overhead is the killer
[01:09:19] <Colgate> like, what kind of support are you looking for?
[01:09:26] <JustAberrant> and also he's a local guy, and yeah, the kind of people who pay those kind of prices for shitty shared hosting also tend to need a lot of support I guess
[01:09:39] <init3> Yeah
[01:09:42] <Colgate> most of the places I host are just like, we will reformat and hard reboot your machine, beyond that, screw you
[01:09:47] <Colgate> I host at*
[01:10:12] <JustAberrant> Colgate: well yeah, but we're talking people who arn't primarily targetting geeks
[01:10:16] <Colgate> if you want more, get managed hosting
[01:10:20] <init3> I've worked at a number of DCs and they are all different support wise for dedis
[01:10:20] <Colgate> and pay the $$$
[01:10:29] <init3> Yeah.
[01:10:32] <JustAberrant> Colgate: we specifically are (I thought) talking about managed hosting ;p
[01:10:43] *** Joins: Datalink (Datalink@Datalink)
[01:10:58] <JustAberrant> trying to undercut prices from guys like dreamhost with unmanaged hosting sounds.. well.. painful
[01:11:01] <Colgate> oh, /shrug
[01:11:22] <init3> Depends
[01:11:27] <JustAberrant> also random: just me or is prgmr basically stalled
[01:11:56] <init3> i mean, if you just throw cpanel on a box and most of the time your users can help themselves if they are somewhat competent. 
[01:12:00] <JustAberrant> they used to be the shit, feels like they just said "fuck it, we'll keep running with what we've got"
[01:12:49] <init3> Thogh the last place I worked used Plesk on Linux. Talk about stupid. 
[01:13:08] <init3> I hate that CP so much
[01:13:23] <JustAberrant> hehe
[01:13:35] <init3> As an example of it's bullshit.
[01:13:36] * JustAberrant hasn't used either enough to really have an opinion
[01:13:56] <JustAberrant> dreamhost is the only shared hosting I've used for any length of time, and they've got their own (pretty good) panel
[01:14:24] <JustAberrant> (got my stuff on a linode VPS now)
[01:14:26] <init3> It uses MySQL to hold all the variables so if MySQL crashes the box has an aneurysm. 
[01:14:26] <Kinsley> I just roll a VPS. Having a full shell and root access for $60 a year is pretty decent.
[01:14:57] <JustAberrant> yeah, these days, there's no reason for a respectable computer geek to use shared hosting
[01:15:01] <init3> I thought dreamhost used cpanel.
[01:15:18] <JustAberrant> cheap VPSes are plentiful and yeah, so much nicer
[01:15:31] <JustAberrant> init3: they might have switched, but back when I used them, their custom panel was their big selling point
[01:17:16] <init3> Dunno. I know that a lot of companies with "custom" control panels are just slapping a skin or making API calls to a cpanel box.
[01:17:44] <Colgate> I should setup a panel for my dedis
[01:17:52] <Colgate> instead of using virt-manager over ssh
[01:17:59] <init3> I used to work for Host Gator though. Damn that was a shit company.
[01:18:30] <JustAberrant> init3: it's possible, though if that is what they did, they did a damn good job imo
[01:18:54] <init3> Yeah, nothing wrong with that at all.
[01:19:20] <init3> Well actually, I'd probably perfer that in a way. Cpanel is a great piece of software.
[01:19:38] <JustAberrant> quick google, everything says it's specifically not cpanel ;p
[01:19:55] <johnsey> i used cPanel once. fuck panels, rather set everything up myself
[01:20:09] <init3> Yeah. If you know what you are doing for sure.
[01:20:22] <johnsey> only 1 way to learn :) 
[01:20:29] <init3> I'd never use on on my own servers, but for shared hosts it's decent.
[01:20:30] <JustAberrant> depends on what you want
[01:20:32] <Colgate> it just want people to be able to restart their own VMs and get serial access to them, but nothing else >.>
[01:20:40] <Colgate> I just*
[01:20:50] <init3> And cpanel does have some of the best support I've ever worked with.
[01:21:08] * JustAberrant same way though, I find myself thinking "what is it actually putting in the config files" anyway, so may as well just write the damn config files myself
[01:21:25] <johnsey> (granted, it's about 10 years since i used cPanel last time)
[01:21:48] <init3> Yeah, I mean we were making a custom panel where I was last at.
[01:22:01] <init3> Was actually pretty cool how we had it set up.
[01:23:07] <init3> A cpanel-esque setup but not set up like those boxes in that the DB, Mail, DNS, and web servers weren't all on the same box.

[22:19:16] <Twilightlicious> I disabled hangouts on chrome, how do i undisable it lol
[22:20:15] <Twilightlicious> nvm found it
[22:20:59] <Twilightlicious> doesn't work on my high latency connection, yay
[22:24:15] <SqueakyNote> Woo. :P
[22:24:39] <SqueakyNote> What's your general uptick?
[22:25:53] * Twilightlicious doesn't know what that means~
[22:26:06] <Twilightlicious> never heard the term "uptick" before >3>
[22:26:45] <Twilightlicious> but my ping on an idle connection is around 750ms
[22:26:48] <SqueakyNote> I use that term in place of the longer actual term.
[22:27:08] <SqueakyNote> What's your ISP's upload rate?
[22:27:35] <Twilightlicious> uhhhh... like... 150Kilabytes per second
[22:27:36] <Twilightlicious> D;
[22:27:36] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[22:27:45] <Twilightlicious> i spell it out because i dunno the difference between Kb and KB.
[22:27:51] * Twilightlicious is noob =3
[22:28:22] <SqueakyNote> I know it like this.
[22:28:26] <Twilightlicious> oh! did you guys hear the DX12 news that leaked todat?
[22:28:31] <SqueakyNote> A 'bit' is smaller than a 'Byte'
[22:29:05] <Twilightlicious> DX12 will be able to combine all the GPU's in your PC, no matter what model
[22:29:13] <SqueakyNote> That's how I tell between a 'Kbit' and a 'KByte'
[22:29:16] <Twilightlicious> AMD + Nvidia, or any combination.
[22:29:58] <SqueakyNote> Doesn't much help me. My machine would probably be kicked in the nuts if I tried to run anything with DX12.
[22:30:15] <Twilightlicious> DX12 is also supposed to use like 80% Less power, or something.
[22:30:17] <Twilightlicious> i dunno.
[22:30:22] <SqueakyNote> Phenomenal net speeds. Crap PC.
[22:30:40] <Twilightlicious> Mostly in an effort to get DX12 functioning on Tablets n devices running on Battery.
[22:31:11] <SqueakyNote> Power isn't the problem with me, though.
[22:31:26] <SqueakyNote> It's a general combination of a multitude of factors.
[22:31:27] <Twilightlicious> now we sit back and wait for them to say "DX12: Only on Windows 10"
[22:31:34] <SqueakyNote> lol
[22:31:39] <Twilightlicious> then again, Windows 10 is a free upgrade, so that would make sense too.
[22:31:59] <SqueakyNote> Yeah, I'm curious about that. When they say it's a free upgrade... what would it be upgrading from?
[22:32:07] <Twilightlicious> 7+
[22:32:07] <SqueakyNote> Windows 8? Windows 7? Vista? XP?
[22:32:12] <Twilightlicious> Requires Windows 7 or higher.
[22:32:15] <SqueakyNote> Ah
[22:32:26] <SqueakyNote> Does it require a valid Windows 7 key?
[22:32:36] <Twilightlicious> The verification method isnt known yet :P
[22:33:06] <Twilightlicious> But i'd be willing to bet you can just use an OEM Verification trick on Windows 7 to pass the upgrade test
[22:33:13] <SqueakyNote> If it reuses the key you used when installing your Windows 7, that's a genius way as well.
[22:33:24] <Twilightlicious> i say "oem verification trick" to avoid advertising piracy ;P
[22:33:35] <SqueakyNote> lol
[22:34:00] <Twilightlicious> It's how i got Windows 8 cheap
[22:34:13] <Twilightlicious> i went to walmart and bought a Windows 8 upgrade disk
[22:34:21] <Twilightlicious> and installed it on my not-so-legit Windows 7 copy.
[22:34:50] <SqueakyNote> Well, when I say it's a genius way, most people have tossed out their Windows 7 boxes after verifying their codes. At least, the not-so-smart people.
[22:35:08] <Twilightlicious> Don't talk about me like that Q~Q Lol
[22:35:11] <Twilightlicious> I lost my Windows 8 key.
[22:35:18] <Twilightlicious> i didn't "Toss it out" though
[22:35:34] <SqueakyNote> Then there are some like you, who lose their keys.
[22:35:37] <Twilightlicious> i genuinely misplaced it.
[22:35:50] <Twilightlicious> i think someone in my family probably mistook it for garbage
[22:36:40] <SqueakyNote> If Microsoft required you to re-input a key that you had with your current install, then check your Registry for verification of said key... that'd be a very smart way to allow Windows 10 to work free.
[22:36:52] <Twilightlicious> i doubt it will do that
[22:37:07] <Twilightlicious> it will probably do something similar to WGa
[22:37:12] <Twilightlicious> And then just accept it
[22:37:16] <SqueakyNote> And then, Microsoft would STILL be the dumbest smart people alive.
[22:37:22] <Twilightlicious> Microsoft isn't as concerned with Piracy as you'd think.
[22:37:30] <SqueakyNote> Heh
[22:37:50] <Twilightlicious> they're giving away their OS for free, for example.
[22:38:07] <Twilightlicious> And if you've ever called Microsoft about product activiation, they'll pretty much activate it for you under any excuse
[22:38:38] <Twilightlicious> i had one Support guy, i told him "I lost my key" and he just said okay and activated my Windows 8 for me
[22:38:39] <SqueakyNote> Yeah, but they say you would need to have Windows 7 or higher to upgrade...
[22:38:58] <SqueakyNote> they would probably have some way to check that.
[22:39:03] <Twilightlicious> and i was thinking "I didn't even need to buy windows 8 Q~Q"
[22:40:04] *** Phase5 is now known as Phase4
[22:40:06] <Twilightlicious> then they have their activation bot
[22:40:28] <Twilightlicious> that if it sees your using the Key multiple times, will ask "How many PCs have you activated using this key?"
[22:40:35] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, their money os from oem preinstalls and corporates, they don't much care about the retail market
[22:40:41] <Twilightlicious> ^ Exactly
[22:40:47] <Twilightlicious> thats what im explaining to SqueakyNote :P
[22:40:57] <Twilightlicious> theyre not as worried about Piracy as you'd think
[22:44:34] <Colgate> we had an MS audit a few years back at my work
[22:44:38] <Colgate> that was fun
[22:45:58] <Phase4> in the corporate market though they do care
[22:46:05] <Phase4> since they have money
[23:00:51] <Twilightlicious> i can't figure out how to delete people on my Android Phone Q~Q
[23:01:01] <Twilightlicious> going to contacts.google.com on my PC hoping that'll be easier.
[23:02:05] <Twilightlicious> There, now i sync my phone somehow.
[23:02:22] <Twilightlicious> oh, it was instantaneous.
