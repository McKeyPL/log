[01:33:37] *** Joins: SkyHigh (Tom@Pony-3s50ab.threembb.co.uk)
[01:33:41] <Sleepypony> or based of something else
[01:33:57] <One-Trick> both are from scratch
[01:34:04] <Sleepypony> i have to write a bot, and i'm sort of hashing it from willie
[01:34:06] *** SkyHigh is now known as Pony_74572
[01:34:08] <Sleepypony> which is a python bot
[01:34:21] <One-Trick> i used twistedmatrix for dinky, though she started as base python socket classes
[01:34:32] <keekle> my friend from highschool in the early 90s was a big perl fan. he was all about the o'reilly "camel" book
[01:34:36] <Sleepypony> i have one issue with the python bots
[01:34:47] <Sleepypony> and it's getting them to see @ % +
[01:35:15] <One-Trick> twistedmatrix handles basic op modes, chanserv/services modes are a bit more tricky
[01:35:22] <One-Trick> i used regex to get those, though
[01:36:10] <One-Trick> the basic foundation i made from twistedmatrix is hosted on hyenaspots.com under boringbot
[01:36:11] <Sleepypony> i may need to poke you for some assistance on that
[01:36:20] <Sleepypony> my regex is rusty as hell
[01:36:22] <One-Trick> thats the skeleton of dinkybot
[01:36:45] <Sleepypony> the willie python bot has a lot of cool features
[01:36:54] <Sleepypony> but i've found i've rewritten about 40% of it 
[01:37:01] <Sleepypony> cos it's derped in one way or another
[01:37:15] <Sleepypony> but it talks to the back end fine

[01:39:58] *** Joins: Pi (pi@Pony-3iq.ak5.208.112.IP)
[01:40:14] <One-Trick> i just liked twisted a lot because it has a kinda fake threading built in
[01:40:49] <Sleepypony> yea, willie has module adaptability
[01:41:02] <Sleepypony> and i can run bash stuff (my better language) from willie
[01:41:07] <Sleepypony> and get values and returns etc
[01:41:14] <One-Trick> i mean parallel tasking
[01:41:36] <One-Trick> python is not multithreaded by nature- it has to spawn another copy of itself for that to work
[01:41:40] <Sleepypony> i don't think i need it tbh, but it's always handy
[01:42:16] <One-Trick> dinyk needs it because she has things she does that will block a socket, like getting all the data from chanserv, which doesnt happen in sequence
[01:42:27] <One-Trick> so while shes waiting for data from services, she can do other things
[01:42:34] <Sleepypony> yea
[01:42:36] <Sleepypony> nice
[01:42:42] <Sleepypony> i wrote a bash bot
[01:42:48] <Sleepypony> but, it's insecure as hell
[01:43:17] <One-Trick> blocking on sockets is what will cripple a lot fo python projects unless you learn to pipe, queue, or get crazy with the threading libraries
[01:43:25] <One-Trick> thats a lot of locking and unlocking
[01:44:07] <Sleepypony> i didn't know python blocked like that
[01:44:23] <Sleepypony> i know basic python, but i'm not a whiz at it sadly
[01:44:47] <wobniaR> I know how to add and subtract with python
[01:44:51] <StrykerVylon> !t Lunatic
[01:44:52] <One-Trick> eeyup, why i scrapped my first version of dinky, which was all from-scratch, when i needed to do more than one thing at once. that began when i wanted her on two channels
[01:44:53] <DinkyBot> simple solution then Lunatic, don;t mix
[01:45:16] <wobniaR> I didn't look up how to catch an exception if a user inputs a letter though
[01:45:31] <wobniaR> So it'd just crash lol
[01:46:17] <One-Trick> depends if you want an exception or just respond to an alpha
[01:46:18] <wobniaR> I want to learn more python but most of the online tutorials are too boring for me
[01:46:36] <pinkpearlapple> i'm drowning in spoilers....i want more now
[01:46:47] <wobniaR> Yeah I tried something like if raw_input.isAlpha() or whatever

[12:31:14] <Unixkitty> Vaguely I suppose
[12:31:37] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Well, mojang had aparently hired one of the bukkit devs.
[12:31:46] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> He got payed while the rest of the devs didn't.
[12:32:00] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> They got mad and threw copyrights on their code in the bukkit rep.
[12:32:06] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Thus making it useless.

[13:03:05] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Yea.
[13:03:11] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> That's the best way to play ^^
[13:03:25] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I thought it was an open server and such.
[13:03:33] <Unixkitty> I know right? That was one of the goals I had in mind when deciding to create a server those years ago...
[13:03:39] <Unixkitty> I simply couldn't stand public servers
[13:03:54] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> It's just that, some people use the mod "Computer Craft" to write malicious code to break servers.
[13:04:07] <Unixkitty> I used to have a slightly bigger community mind you, when I'd been more into it all
[13:04:17] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Yea.
[13:04:45] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So many servers are blocking computers :/ Which is the part of the modded server I enjoy playing with ^^
[13:04:45] <Unixkitty> Still, everything was semi-private, and mostly only decent people were around. We never had griefers. Not even once.
[13:04:55] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> That is good.
[13:05:03] <Unixkitty> Sounds quite unlikely, but I sometimes couldn't believe it either...
[13:05:31] <Unixkitty> But as everything does, eventually it all fell apart obviously.
[13:05:42] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I dislike public servers myself. Because many people just don't know how to play with other people, and it's so game breaking >.<
[13:06:24] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Well, the new EULA also made some complications for server owners ^^
[13:06:43] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> At least the ones who took donations.
[13:06:44] <Unixkitty> So I heard I think. Especially concerning profits
[13:06:57] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Aye.

[22:36:54] <EM-C> 3/21 is usually given as the birthday of Johann Sebastian Bach, but that's actually according to the Julian Calendar.  On the Gregorian is birthday is actually ten days later, the same as Haydn's birthday.

[23:43:08] <RandomNinja> what about grey goo?
[23:43:17] <wobniaR> Is it gak?
[23:43:21] <EM-C> It's not so much the neighborhood and just our walkway and yard.  It's like trying to walk through a minefield.
[23:43:27] <RandomNinja> it's slightly worse!
[23:43:36] <EM-C> And with my arthritis I have trouble walking anyway.
[23:43:37] <wobniaR> Gak or nothing
[23:43:48] <StrykerVylon> !t Gak
[23:43:50] <DinkyBot> points at the US Gak reserve
[23:43:55] <RandomNinja> oh god
[23:43:57] <StrykerVylon> We have a Gak reserve?
[23:44:01] <wobniaR> We do now
[23:44:02] <EM-C> But I didn't want Mama trying to get out there.
[23:44:18] <EM-C> It was still a lot harder than I thought it would be.  That stuff just hasn't melted any.
[23:44:22] <wobniaR> We also have a overseas swiss gak acount
[23:44:25] <wobniaR> account*

[23:44:45] <EM-C> Tomorrow...sand or kitty litter, or salt, or something.  I gotta get out of here.
[23:45:12] <EM-C> Need to go to the store.
[23:45:34] <EM-C> But if those parking lots are as bad as our yard is...I wouldn't be able to drive on them, much less get out.

[23:46:33] <EM-C> Crazy weather for Feb.  It's mild all winter long, then at the tail end, it's Antarctica.
[23:46:55] <EM-C> But maybe this way it won't still be doing this next month...at least when spring officially gets here.

[23:55:44] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Meh. Snow never exists for me anyway
[23:55:55] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> I get nothing but heat and rain. Total FML
[23:56:23] <wobniaR> And mosquitos everywhere
[23:56:34] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> No kidding. That's what sucks even more, wobniaR
[23:56:46] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> You guys may hate snow, but I hate the heat >.>"
[23:57:13] <wobniaR> That's why I don't wanna go back to PR lol
[23:57:28] <wobniaR> The only sorta nice time of day is at night
[23:57:31] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> And me, going for Finland in the coming years :P
[23:57:33] <wobniaR> Even then it's mad humid
[23:57:56] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> AND the fact that PR is an hour ahead than the East Coast
[23:59:11] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> But yeah... living in a place where snow is clearly non-existent sucks greatly
