[08:49:34] <Electron> there is a pony with dolphin cutie mark
[08:49:54] <Electron> I wonder how did she earn it?
[09:00:07] <MirSar> That was a unnormal subject for you Electron :P
[09:00:24] * MirSar just arrived in time for work
[09:01:21] <Electron> I've just read a comic about Fluttershy
[09:01:52] <Electron> she talks about dolphins
[09:02:42] * Electron MirSar has earned an achievement: "Just in time"
[09:04:38] * MirSar feel's his boss glaring daggers at him
[09:04:51] <Electron> why is that?
[09:05:11] <MirSar>  /just in time/ :P
[09:05:33] <Electron> so? :)
[09:05:50] <Electron> still not late though
[09:06:05] <MirSar> exactly, but he wish I was so he could yell :P
[09:06:32] <Electron> oh right, sorry boss, not this time
[09:08:55] <Electron> do not tell him about the pony thing
[09:09:29] <MirSar> If /anyone/ where to looka at any parts of my logg, they'd probbobly find out, I'm not that worried :P

[09:15:15] <MirSar> yell - I highly doubt that, would have to be loud as shit :P
[09:15:15] <MirSar> Punch - Absolutely!
[09:15:26] <Electron> I heard some crazy Norway parental control system 
[09:16:25] <Electron> really? slap your baby and then say goodbye to your parental rights? ( º_º)
[09:17:09] <MirSar> pretty much, it's abuse on someone with no means of defending him/herself

[09:31:49] <JockeTF> Electron: That's completely unacceptable here.
[09:31:53] <JockeTF> Also, very illegal.

[09:33:53] <MirSar> I've been punched, yeah. School fight, but it's not the same :P
[09:34:21] <Electron> yeah, probably services who tracks parents' activity
[09:34:28] <JockeTF> I was never punched.
[09:34:29] <Electron> right?
[09:34:54] <Electron> this is different thing, indeed, MirSar
[09:35:36] <JockeTF> I was pushed up to a wall once though when I flooded a bully's e-mail account because he wouldn't wouldn't leave me alone. :P
[09:35:39] <JockeTF> But that's about that.
[09:36:15] <Electron> and what happened then?
[09:37:05] <JockeTF> Nothing. I laughed at him while he did that, then he angrily walked away an talked to my teacher.
[09:37:46] <JockeTF> I didn't get in trouble since "JockeTF wouldn't do something like that for no reason". :P
[09:37:59] <MirSar> hehe, I just think about how much funn I could have if I knew what I know now then ^^
[09:38:09] <MirSar> So many pranks to do! :D

[09:44:07] <Electron> are you kidding, MirSar? they were everywhere

[09:45:06] <JockeTF> Either way, I told him exactly what would happen if he didn't leave me alone. He didn't, so I followed up on that.
[09:45:36] <Electron> he deserved it completely
[09:45:51] <JockeTF> It's funny how everyone left me alone after that though.
[09:45:53] <MirSar> "Respect" is something new for most teenagers, and the less respect they get from home, the more they value respect in school. If they can gain Respect by bullying weak tarkets, they do so
[09:46:02] <JockeTF> Yeah.
[09:46:06] <Electron> take that, you bully! :D
[09:47:50] <MirSar> Though I beleave those who get bullied in school come out as stronger people because they have to live with beeing on the bottom constantly, when they grow upp, they have respect for the respect and don't abuse it. Often they don't even want attention that much, so thei're easier to be friends with :3
[09:47:59] <MirSar> yes, I've given it a lot of thought :P
[09:47:59] <Electron> and then "weak targets" become bosses and bullies work for them

[09:56:32] * JockeTF is the little brother.
[09:56:57] <Electron> he can call to social service and say about your bulliness, MirSar
[09:57:10] <Electron> :P
[09:57:25] <Electron> am I right?
[09:57:27] * JockeTF was at once point stood on so his bigger brother could reach the table. :P
[09:57:42] * JockeTF doesn't remember that though since he was so young.
[09:58:25] <MirSar> not really, unless I actually intend to hurt him. It's not really the act of punching/slapping you get repported for, it's the intent of hurting
[09:58:58] <MirSar> There are gray-zones too OFC

[10:10:47] <MirSar>  The Norwegian Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that a light "careful slap" applied immediately after the "offence" was still allowed.[10] Legislature abolished this in 2010, and the current law is that any violence against children, including careful slaps, is prohibited.
