[00:25:48] <Eywind> pls
[00:25:59] <Sombra> Its gonna happen... I know it.
[00:26:03] <Eywind> It could, sure
[00:26:12] <Inucroft[NLR]> Araxnus yea, if u saw the movie that was set after the show, she's actualy in an insanse asylum

[00:27:01] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind it is...
[00:27:07] <Eywind> Hmm
[00:27:09] <Eywind> it was an episode

[00:27:17] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind well extened finalie episode
[00:27:18] <Eywind> In the season 6 episode 'Normal Again' Buffy is stabbed by a skewer from a demon summoned by the Geek Trio. The injected venom gives her recurring visions of being a patient in a mental hospital with her being the Slayer just a delusion.

[00:28:19] <Inucroft[NLR]> yes
[00:28:20] <Eywind> Well given that description I'd assume no
[00:28:25] <Sombra> SOMEONE is gonna form babby.  I dunno, it would make sense if its cadence and shining armor.  Could be... Twilight and waffle stealer guy though? Probably not.
[00:28:29] <Sombra> That makes less sense.
[00:28:37] <Eywind> it stated that she was injected with a venom
[00:28:40] <Araxnus> Yay. So buffy really did hunt demons
[00:28:53] <Eywind> Also you can't dream sequence another show
[00:28:55] <Eywind> in the first show
[00:29:00] <Eywind> (Angel was a thing too, ya know)
[00:29:08] <Araxnus> Ah okay.
[00:29:24] <Eywind> I think Inucroft[NLR] I was more comparing it to the last season of Roseanne
[00:29:27] <Eywind> however that was a bit more grim
[00:29:34] <Araxnus> 6 seasons was not a lie ;)
