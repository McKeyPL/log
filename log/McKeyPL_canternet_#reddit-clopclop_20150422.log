[07:35:11] <RubyPinch> SSDs delayed web-focused operating systems like ChromeOS and FirefoxOS by multiple years #trufacts
[07:36:09] <cloppyhooves> REally? :o
[07:37:18] <RubyPinch> web-focused OSes started in 2k7/8, motivated by horrible start-up times, which were the norm
[07:38:18] <RubyPinch> what also happened in 2k7, was the start of demonstrations of SSDs
[07:39:05] <RubyPinch> so the browser-on-a-chip motherboards very quickly lost steam in terms of backing
[07:40:04] <RubyPinch> ~5second boot times then happened, and there was literally zero need for fast loading browsers for that situation
[07:41:01] <RubyPinch> the resurgance came from a desire for lower powered / cheaper devices
[07:41:36] <RubyPinch> (firefoxOS phones being some of the cheapest phones around, and likewise for chromeOS and laptops)

[08:53:22] <Frosty> That's a shame. I hide those from women.
[08:53:36] <Giggles> That makes sense.

[20:33:38] <iamalion> so aparently

[20:33:51] <iamalion> just my luck
[20:33:58] <iamalion> amazingly i only got a 77% on it somehow
[20:34:01] <iamalion> i figured it would be worse
[20:34:12] <ponder> 77% what?
[20:34:20] <iamalion> on the score for that call
[20:34:39] <ponder> is it better if the score is lower? 77% seems pretty good...

[20:35:16] <iamalion> no higher the better

[20:35:32] <iamalion> i had 2 in a row
[20:36:03] <ponder> awesome
[20:36:27] <ponder> Is 77 considered a bad score?
[20:36:38] <iamalion> im a perfectionist, so yeah
[20:36:44] <ponder> Ah, ok.
[20:36:56] <iamalion> but basically it is scored on how well you meet the guidelines for each call
