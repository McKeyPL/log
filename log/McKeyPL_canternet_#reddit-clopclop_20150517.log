[01:35:53] <RubyPinch> probably a reason for the purple considering how garish the rest looks compared :o
[01:42:35] <iamalion> i think it looks fantastic

[06:11:15] <princesssluttershy> Skiing is hard for unathletic people XD
[06:11:45] <samonuh> It's more of a mental sport than a physical one. If you have good legs and abs, you're good. 
[06:11:53] <samonuh> But if you have fear, you won't succeed
