[00:08:52] <cloppyhooves> I have a cooking question with a follow-up one
[00:09:12] <Vulpixbrew> ok whatare you cooking
[00:09:48] <cloppyhooves> So, how long does it take to cook a cup of rice?
[00:10:15] <cloppyhooves> I do it the whole "Add water to rice, let it come to a boil, simmer for X minutes"
[00:10:25] <cloppyhooves> *simmer covered
[00:12:03] <Frosty> If I femember correctly from before I left, I used to put rice in a bowl with some water and cook it for about 15 minutes.
[00:12:19] <Frosty> Granted, that was also a microwave.
[00:12:35] <Vulpixbrew> 15 to 18 minutes
[00:12:41] <Vulpixbrew> for white rice
[00:13:07] <Vulpixbrew> also I think im having an alleric reaction to something
[00:14:21] <cloppyhooves> D:
[00:16:40] <Frosty> Relax Cloppy. It's not THAT long. Listen to some music, time will fly
[00:18:05] <cloppyhooves> No, I meant
[00:18:08] <cloppyhooves> I usually overdo it
[00:18:11] <Vulpixbrew> whatever it is is mild and my anti anxiwety drug is an antihistamine
[00:18:13] <cloppyhooves> So I end up with burnt rice at the bottom

[00:30:45] <cloppyhooves> Yeah, I just have a metal pot
[00:30:53] <cloppyhooves> And when I cook rice I have to deal with the burnt rice on the bottom
[00:31:04] <cloppyhooves> So I was wondering if I was just overcooking it or if there was a fix for that
[00:31:41] <iamalion> is it non stick?
[00:31:47] <iamalion> gotta be teflon
[00:31:56] <Frosty> Just after you eat it all or pack it away or whatever, just soak it for like, 30 minutes.
[00:31:58] <iamalion> our rice cooker is and it has some scractches in the bottom
[00:32:07] <iamalion> so some rice gets tuck and b urns
[00:33:33] <iamalion> why are all dryer vent brushes 10 feet
[00:33:39] <iamalion> who the hell has a <10 foot dryer vent
[00:34:04] <iamalion> wouldnt be so annoying if you could buy two and attach them together

[04:06:09] <princesssluttershy> How are you?
[04:07:11] <Drago> Doin' well. I sweat so freakin much today. Lots of fabricating cabinets outside. I didn't wear my work boots and ofc got a blister on my big toe. It's gonna really suck when the skin breaks.
[04:07:35] <Drago> I wrapped painters tape around it like 6 hours through the day or it would have lol
[04:09:39] <Drago> This one guy was just insanely racist, and homophobic.
[04:10:01] <Drago> Said I looked like a Nazi youth and that he agreed with Hitler's whole... thing
[04:10:18] <Drago> and just went off on everything

[04:10:52] <princesssluttershy> Sounds like an unpleasant fellow D:
[04:10:53] <Drago> It was really disgusting having him on the job site.
[04:12:00] <Vulpixbrew> damn
[04:13:10] <Drago> He had a superiority complex over Mexican day laborers saying how he is so much better and how "chico" couldn't pull this off. I said to him, man you aren't even that good and you are using backhanded ways to cover up your shody work
[04:13:31] <Drago> It passed code though, and I have no say over what he says =/
[04:13:47] <Drago> I can only get him in trouble for not being up to code.
[04:14:27] <Drago> I let my boss know though. I doubt I will see him at the site again.
[04:16:29] <Drago> Chances are he works with Burke General Contracting and his name and story will most likely be heard by someone.
[04:18:01] <Drago> Wow, sorry, that was a lot of typing... and about something not so pleasant.

[20:08:38] <Melon_Guy> feels super dated
[20:08:44] <Vulpixbrew> yes
[20:09:08] <Vulpixbrew> espically since I had a lot of massive graphic over hauls for skyrim

[20:10:52] <Vulpixbrew> I wonder how Eldar Scrolls VI will look
[20:14:40] <Melon_Guy>  I'm gonna guess it'll be closer to skyrim in terms of content and pacing
[20:16:27] <weisey> https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/35a3nv/is_my_boyfriend_lying/?sort=confidence
[20:16:29] <RubyPinch> they'd have to bump up the engine version, they've done... like, 4 games on the one engine or something?
[20:16:30] <weisey> Imdying
[20:16:35] <weisey> Expected wrong sub
[20:16:47] <weisey> Was not disappointed 
[20:18:05] <Melon_Guy>  skyrim, fallout 3 (NV too?) and oblivion iirc
[20:18:45] <Melon_Guy> heavily modified though but containing the same stuff essentially
[20:19:10] <weisey> Yeah same engine
[20:19:47] <RubyPinch> actually huh, skyrim was the bump itself
[20:20:30] <Melon_Guy> ah makes sense
[20:20:59] <Melon_Guy> fallout 4 rumored to be shown behind closed doors at e3 guise
[20:21:10] <RubyPinch> (fallout 3/nv + obliv are gamebryo, skyrim is creation engine)
[20:21:17] <Melon_Guy> reskinned morrowind
[20:22:31] <weisey> I thought they were all frostbyte
[20:23:27] <RubyPinch> battlefield oblivion
[20:23:29] <Melon_Guy> no, it was IW engine
[20:23:34] <weisey> Lol
[20:23:38] <weisey> Sorry
[20:23:43] <weisey> Not frostbyte
[20:23:50] <weisey> But it had frost in ot
[20:23:52] <weisey> It*
[20:24:40] <Melon_Guy> imagine levolution events in a ES game or fallout
[20:28:04] <RubyPinch> I wish TES moved genre more
[20:28:18] <RubyPinch> instead of morrowind 1, 2 and 3
[20:29:04] <Melon_Guy>   how so?
[20:32:15] <Melon_Guy>   
[20:35:35] <RubyPinch> dunno, but they've made the same game 3 times and downgraded the story and upgraded the graphics each time and its just, gah
