[00:14:23] <princesssluttershy> Hello ^-^ /
[00:15:21] <Luvbi> 13Hiya pss ^^
[00:15:42] <thaostra> I hope within the next few years SSD prices will drop down to the point they're as cheap as HDDs or even cheaper. Right now a new 1TB SSD can go for $349

[00:21:05] <Luvbi> 13Knowing what I do about computers, I don't know why SSD's aren't the go-to at this point. Like, shouldn't normal hard drives have been phased out ages ago?
[00:21:14] <Luvbi> 13Or am I just dumb?
[00:21:40] <Vulpixbrew> still a bit to expensive 
[00:21:57] <thaostra> The two main issues consumer SSDs have is the cost per gigabyte and the storage capacity
[00:22:44] <thaostra> But if you can afford it, they're probably the best upgrade you can make in a long time
[00:22:58] <Luvbi> 13Fair enough, but still. If you're saying that soon you hope SSDs are as cheap as HDDs, shouldn't they become the norm?
[00:23:34] <princesssluttershy> Don't SSDs kinda die after a certain number of reads/writes?
[00:23:37] <thaostra> They'll become the norm when OEMs are shipping low or midrange computers with them
[00:23:58] <thaostra> princesssluttershy, Only in early generations. Now SSDs handle wear much better than HDDs
[00:24:41] <princesssluttershy> oh ok ^-^
[00:25:15] <thaostra> The 850 Pro has a ten year warranty, which should give you an idea of how confident Samsung is about the merits of their new SSDs
[00:25:38] <Luvbi> 13Oh, but ask iamalion about Samsung right now XD

[00:30:58] <thaostra> Things will get really interesting once Samsung starts focusing on PCIe as the basis of their flagship SSDs, as they can deliver easily 4x the speed of SATA III drives and could go even further
[00:31:28] <princesssluttershy> I want a PCIe SSD in my next build
[00:31:40] <RubyPinch> it'll get more interesting if they could build a single decent bit of code /unrelatedrant

[04:27:15] <Luvbi> 13It was all wonky and confusing

[04:30:27] <RubyPinch> indeed

[04:30:35] <Luvbi> 13Thao. Speak
[04:30:36] <thaostra> Honestly pretty much all clients I've tried suck in some way, but Hexchat has been the least awful

[04:32:29] <thaostra> Hexchat may be a mess internally, but it was a necessary fork because xchat just stopped seeing development

[22:31:37] <cloppyhooves> Which part of me? :o
[22:31:56] <Melon_Phone> arugula has a smooth entry taste followed by a sharp pang that maintains for a while 
[22:32:28] <Melon_Phone> probably mouth, I hesitate to think what others taste like 
[22:33:00] <RubyPinch> aieeee
[22:34:02] <Melon_Phone> you guys will never guess what I taste like
