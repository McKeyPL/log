[09:47:30] <AppleDash> Hey, could any awake opers potentially give my home IP a ban exemption for like, a week? I've been Z-Lined for connecting too much, but I am testing an IRC client so that is kinda needed.
[09:48:16] * AppleDash pokes Shutter because he seems potentially awake
[09:50:21] * Shutter yawns
[09:50:27] <AppleDash> Hey
[09:50:45] <AppleDash> Wait, it's not gonna be my home IP
[09:50:49] <AppleDash> it's some arbitrary server IP
[10:14:24] <Hck> Hmmm, for IRC testing I set up own server on LAN. You can try too... ;)
[10:15:21] <Shutter> He knows. Handled this in PM.
[10:24:58] <Hck> k
[10:24:59] <Twili> I read in a book once that said k might be worth bookmarking, then, so you don't end up having to search for it later
[10:26:54] <AppleDash> Hck, impossible in my case.
[10:32:03] <Hck> Why ?
[10:32:03] <Twili> Ponies say Why can't I set channel mode +a by itself without services?
[10:33:02] <AppleDash> Because the machine I am developing on has no LAN, among other reasons.
[10:33:53] *** Sleepykitty is now known as Unixkitty
[10:34:15] <Hck> localhost ? maybe you can use something like virtualbox ?
[10:34:31] <Shutter> I don't see how that would be a problem, AppleDash :P
[10:35:01] <AppleDash> the "other reasons" are that I want an actual ircd with actual people in actual channels without having to set up my own simulation :P
[10:37:23] <Hck> OK, If you really need so much other clients...
[10:37:39] <Hck> Good luck with client then...
