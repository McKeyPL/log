[08:40:01] <Twilightlicious> by yesterday i mean last tuesday lol
[08:44:01] <Twilightlicious> nobody ever answered my bluetooth question
[08:44:15] <Twilightlicious> can a bluetooth adapter (in a phone, tablet, or even laptop) Connect to multiple devices?
[08:44:30] <Twilightlicious> can it connect to a bluetooth Keyboard AND mouse? or only one at a time
[08:44:41] <Phase4> iirc it should handle both
[08:45:19] <Twilightlicious> cuz i found a tablet i want but it will be hard to use without a keyboard and mouse, and while i could use OTG, that seems unsophisticated.
[08:46:23] <JustAberrant> why not just get a laptop ;p
[08:46:42] <JustAberrant> it's kinda like a tablet except it doesn't suck :D
