[00:01:26] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: also probably too late now, but when going into any kind of tense-ish meeting situation, I've always found it far better to have thought through what I actually want to get across than to have a bunch of pre-canned answers ready to spew forth
[00:02:12] <JustAberrant> i.e. don't have your "where I want to be in 35 years" speech pre-written, but know the answer and be ready to talk about it

[07:10:59] <JustAberrant> my grandparents just went that route
[07:11:14] <JustAberrant> they are still stupidly overpriced, especially if you go through the cable company like they did
[07:11:25] <JustAberrant> but yeah.. they do work I guess
[07:11:45] <tiwake> from what I'm reading you have to build your own if you want DRM free
[07:11:54] <JustAberrant> well duh
[07:13:01] <tiwake> I don't really feel like building such a thing for them... heh
[07:13:17] <JustAberrant> yeah, that's kinda what happens ;p
[07:13:27] <tiwake> and I won't ever have cable/satellite
[07:13:29] <Kinsley> What I've seen in doing the build your own is that you really have to technically savvy to do it on both fronts, in the part selection and assembly and in the set up.
[07:13:47] <JustAberrant> it's like.. yeah you can build one and it'll be better
[07:13:56] <JustAberrant> but then you have to support it/etc
[07:14:20] <Kinsley> And for *most* people, the DVR that "comes with" the TV service is just fine.
[07:14:28] <JustAberrant> yeah
[07:14:50] <JustAberrant> like the one my grandparents got (through eastlink) would drive me insane... but it does what it says on the tin
[07:14:58] <JustAberrant> you can record shows and play them back, and it's usable enough
[07:15:02] <JustAberrant> which is all they care about
[07:15:45] <Kinsley> Yeah. I remember the old DVR we had from a smaller cable company. Not brilliant. The UI was total garbage because I think it (the UI) was made in 2000 and not updated ever.
[07:15:58] <JustAberrant> they've seriously been using a VCR up until now.. nothing like pumping that HD signal through the component in of a shitty walmart VCR :>
[07:16:02] <Kinsley> But the DVR we had with DirecTV was pretty solid.
