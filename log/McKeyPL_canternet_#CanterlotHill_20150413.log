[00:40:45] <One-Trick> dual-boot?
[00:40:51] <Muffin_Spectacles> The problem is it seems noone takes a chance with design if someone does it a popular way. Almost every other computer or phone attempts to emulate Apple. 
[00:41:13] <Araxnus> One-Trick: I guess their are lots of ways to by pass it now. Was not 3 years ago all that much
