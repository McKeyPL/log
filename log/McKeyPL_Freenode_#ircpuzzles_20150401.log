[00:05:14] <yano> i deleted the hello world thing and it wasn't changing anything on the site
[00:05:39] <ser_berry> hehe caching is always a fun time

[00:19:43] <yano> time to deploy is soooo long on dotcloud

[00:25:56] <yano> aaah
[00:26:40] <ser_berry> you have to deploy for every change or what?
[00:27:50] <yano> only if i want to see the changes on the remote server rather than locally
[00:28:33] <yano> and i take the Bill O'Reilly method: FUCK IT, WE'RE DOING IT LIVE
[00:28:50] <yano> i hate dev environment
[00:28:50] <ser_berry> nice I used to have a boss like that
[00:28:52] <yano> *envs
[00:29:16] <yano> mostly because, in my experience, i have *never* *ever* been able to get shit that works in dev to work on production and visa versa
[00:29:20] <yano> fucking shit
[00:29:38] <ser_berry> yeah it's not always easy
[00:29:46] <yano> "Container did not come up within 120 seconds."
[00:29:48] <yano> ಠ_ಠ
[00:29:55] <ser_berry> hehehe
[00:31:56] <yano> i don't see the point of why that example thing has a create_app wrapped around the routes
[00:32:57] <yano> and it makes me annoyed that git says my local repo is ahead by 2 commits, even though i keep pushing >_>
[00:33:47] <ser_berry> that does sound annoying
[00:34:55] <yano> oh and it seems i have to wait until these stupid 120 second timeouts happen before deploying again or that deploy move overwrite a newer deploy that i'm doing to attempt to fix the first
[00:35:15] <ser_berry> haha holy shit
[00:35:23] <ser_berry> reminds me of my old dev env at work
[00:35:24] <yano> at least dotcloud is free
[00:35:28] <yano> heroku isn't free anymore
[00:35:40] <ser_berry> they expected me to compile the java app, sftp it over, and restart the service for every single change I made
[00:35:47] <yano> haha, wow
[00:35:47] <ser_berry> this took ~1:30
[00:36:13] <ser_berry> so instead I just made a directory on the server and I make changes right on the dev machine
[00:36:19] <ser_berry> I can't believe nobody tried that before
[00:36:37] <ser_berry> it blows my mind that they just accepted that workflow
[00:37:10] <yano> hah
[00:37:27] <yano> i volunteer to update a local non-profits website  when they send me changes
[00:37:30] <yano> i find it so annoying
[00:37:39] <yano> because their box is linux, but is only accessible via ftp
[00:37:44] <yano> so i can't just ssh and make the changes remotely
[00:37:47] <yano> it is so annoying
[00:37:53] * FireFly wonders if the non-profit is freenode :p
[00:37:55] <yano> who even does that anymore
[00:37:57] <yano> no
[00:37:58] <FireFly> oh wait, local
[00:38:00] <yano> i said *local*
[00:38:01] <ser_berry> ftp in 2015 :[
[00:38:02] <yano> yea
[00:38:06] <yano> ikr?
[00:38:09] <yano> not even sftp
[00:38:11] <yano> just ftp
[00:38:18] <ser_berry> wtf
[00:38:23] <FireFly> That sucks
[00:38:26] <yano> so i downloaded there entire massive site and put it into a local git repo
[00:38:30] <ser_berry> they insist on a less secure solution?
[00:38:35] <yano> they don't know what they are doing
[00:38:42] <ser_berry> haha obv
[00:38:43] <yano> they had some other tech guy do it before me
[00:38:57] <yano> and they keep asking me every few months what "framework" the site uses because they want to update the layout
[00:39:09] <ser_berry> haha
[00:39:15] <yano> and i'm like... "your piece of shit website is a really hacked up PHP-custom-made template. there is no framework."
[00:39:25] <ser_berry> job security right there
[00:39:29] <yano> ikr?
[00:39:40] <ser_berry> a few years got I did the same thing and the same company paid me for years afterwards to update it
[00:39:43] <yano> it is volunteer
[00:39:48] <yano> i don't get paid
[00:40:03] <yano> are you kidding me:
[00:40:05] <yano> NameError: global name 'flash' is not defined
[00:40:07] <yano> ಠ_ಠ
[00:40:25] <ser_berry> ruh roh
[00:40:39] <xnr> yano: from dcuniverse import flash 
[00:41:07] <ser_berry> fantastic tv show
[00:41:09] <yano> my commit messages are basically garbage at this point
[00:41:36] <ser_berry> ugh. that same job with the php framework, when I first got there they could commit every change to see updates
[00:41:44] <ser_berry> the entire svn commit history was USELESS
[00:41:48] <yano> haha
[00:41:48] <xnr> "commit messages are garbage" is the second-to-last stage of VCS madness
[00:41:51] <yano> that's what this is like
[00:41:54] <xnr> last stage being rewriting history
[00:42:33] <yano> indeed
[00:42:49] <yano> at least i have a record of me losing my mind
[00:43:20] <yano> "Why did yano go crazy and jump off that bridge?" "you can see this timestamp in the git log where they lost their mind."
[00:43:33] <yano> omg
[00:43:34] <yano> UndefinedError: 'fixes' is undefined
[00:44:33] <yano> it'll be a miracle if i can even get back to a Hello World with bootstrap on flask before this starts
[00:45:53] <ser_berry> maybe just do hello world with flask
[00:46:00] <ser_berry> bootstrap is very easy to add by itself
[00:46:25] <yano> lol
[00:46:27] <yano> ahahaha
[00:46:29] <yano> i wish
[00:46:51] <yano> i spent the last 2 days trying to use fancy django packages to streamline bootstrap on heroku
[00:46:54] <yano> didn't get anywhere
[00:47:00] <yano> even just tried doing static files
[00:47:02] <yano> and building a custom layout
[00:47:04] <yano> nope
[00:47:07] <yano> heroku didn't want any of that
[00:47:14] <ser_berry> dang
[00:47:22] <xnr> yano thou shalt use DICSS
[00:47:29] <yano> trying to configure the the static paths on django on heroku is different than on any other fucking django thing i've done
[00:47:44] <xnr> yano: when building websites, https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS is all you need
[00:47:46] <jenni> [ letsgetrandy/DICSS · GitHub ] - https://j.mp/19zT3P7
[00:47:47] <yano> i think they do something funky with their system paths
[00:48:05] <ser_berry> with django you gotta put it in that static folder
[00:48:10] <ser_berry> and you have to define that folder in the middleware
[00:48:13] <ser_berry> iirc
[00:48:19] <yano> what is this DICSS?
[00:48:26] <yano> ser_berry: yea i did that
[00:48:28] <xnr> yano: read its readme.md xD
[00:48:48] <xnr> (it's really worth reading)

[00:49:03] <ser_berry> tl;dr it's the longest dick joke you'll ever read
[00:49:09] <yano> ser_berry: that's what i'm thinking
[00:49:24] <yano> i don't see why you would want/need: Sass, LESS, nor DICSS
[00:49:41] <yano> is this just a way to avoid writing js?

[01:48:27] <SmoothPorcupine> yano: What's the race condition?
[01:50:10] <yano> SmoothPorcupine: if one has deployed something that won't work, dotcloud keeps trying for up to 120 seconds, if you try to deploy between then and your second deployment works, dotcloud goes with the thing before your first attempt at deployment to display on the site, *and* if it gets the first deployment to work it will override the second deployment

[02:42:04] <bcode> https everywhere, iirc
[02:42:06] <yano> Looks like someone isn't using HTTPS Everywhere. :-)
[02:42:10] <jacob1> I thought that was chrome only :P
[02:42:18] <xnr> TLS with mozilla or google or etc CA databases is broken by design
[02:42:18] <yano> i added the ruleset to HTTPS Everywhere for freenode
[02:42:32] <crashdemons> it's like christelmas in april

[02:43:18] <Territoriojoven> yano: how do you add metadata to your nick's info
[02:43:31] <yano> Territoriojoven: /msg NickServ help set property
[02:43:57] <SmoothPorcupine> jacob1: "Chrome only" isn't valid.
[02:44:50] <SmoothPorcupine> Aside from "crashing when the server doesn't send a Content-Type response header," I can't think of anything Chrome does or did that was ever even slightly innovative of different from any other software.
[02:45:00] <SmoothPorcupine> or*
[02:45:32] <yano> they made js fast
[02:45:33] <xnr> SmoothPorcupine: sandboxing and tabs having their own processes
[02:45:34] <yano> ooh shiny
[02:45:40] <crashdemons> sounds like time for me to make a page that doesn't send the Content-Type
[02:45:49] <crashdemons> lol
[02:45:51] <SmoothPorcupine> xnr: Okay so I notice that's redundant.
[02:45:51] <yano> 15 minutes!
[02:45:59] -yano- 15 minutes!
[02:46:19] <SmoothPorcupine> crashdemons: I think that was probably fixed awhile ago, but tab title updating is probably still broken.
[02:46:33] <yano> i only use chrome for google sites
[02:46:38] <yano> i use firefox for mostly everything
[02:46:38] <crashdemons> 2015 and most major browsers still can't handle an infinite JS do-while loop or frame bomb, it's sad
[02:46:50] <SmoothPorcupine> I only complain about Google when it wants me to install Chrome. :V
[02:47:03] <xnr> but dont use chrome, use chromium
[02:47:08] <crashdemons> firefox at least does the busy prompt for other busy scripts, except that case ... :-/
[02:47:18] <SmoothPorcupine> crashdemons: No, it's normal.
[02:47:28] <SmoothPorcupine> Strictly economically standard.
[02:47:38] <yano> i use Chrome when i want things to "just work"
[02:47:41] <crashdemons> I mean, 15 years we should have found a way to avoid that being program-breaking
[02:47:47] <crashdemons> :P
[02:47:48] <yano> i've noticed, that over the years i've gotten tired of doing things the hard way
[02:48:00] <ser_berry> hehe
[02:48:02] <SmoothPorcupine> crashdemons: Finding a solution isn't the issue. Bothering to implement it is.
[02:48:03] <ser_berry> I know that feeling
[02:48:05] <xnr> simple js setTimeout forkbomb makes your whole firefox browser unusable (and stop script dialog either doesnt show or doesnt work)
[02:48:09] <crashdemons> true
[02:48:11] <yano> i might buy a Macbook :-P
[02:48:30] <SmoothPorcupine> Bothering to implement is a function of free time, ie., market pressure/economics.
[02:48:46] <SmoothPorcupine> yano: Same. :/
[02:48:54] <SmoothPorcupine> I wish I could afford to do things the hard way.
[02:49:06] <SmoothPorcupine> Best years of my life.
[02:49:10] <crashdemons> I still wish JS had some support for synchronous delays also, there's no sense in freezing everything for one script thread   vs.  forcing async timers for everything
[02:50:11] <yano> i really hate web-dev when it deals with making things preetty
[02:50:19] <SmoothPorcupine> It's contrathetical to the design; JS was never meant for this.
[02:50:47] <xnr> yano: plain text! all html you'll need is <pre></pre>

[02:51:06] <yano> you should see my /contact page on my personal site

[02:56:18] <Territoriojoven> why can't we choose whatever vhost we want ?
[02:56:24] <yano> but the nice thing about the @ircpuzzles cloaks will be they won't be magically taken away by staff
[02:56:31] <yano> because this is freenode
[02:56:33] <SmoothPorcupine> Territoriojoven: Because this isn't <that other network>.

[02:56:55] <yano> ooh man 3 minutes
[02:57:06] <yano> i better find that first clue

[02:57:13] <SmoothPorcupine> I bet those other networks don't even understand what identd was designed for...
[02:57:25] <yano> kitten: sure, dual cloaks are allowed

[02:57:48] <jacob1> I like my cloak :P, last year I opted out of the cloak lottery
[02:57:49] <Territoriojoven> what is a defocus cloak and how do i get it
[02:57:53] <yano> Buizel: leaving the network and not signing into your nickserv account
[02:57:55] <SmoothPorcupine> I like how freenode calls 'em cloaks rather than vhosts.
[02:57:56] <kitten> Buizel: log out?
[02:58:08] <Buizel> logging out once you've logged in doesn't change it
[02:58:08] <jacob1> logging out doesn't remove your cloak
[02:58:16] <Buizel> i assumed freenode had a graceful way of removing it
[02:58:20] <Territoriojoven> you need to log in to log out
[02:58:20] <yano> that's why you disconnect from the network and then reconnect without logging in
[02:58:30] <Buizel> but that's stupid :<
[02:58:34] <kitten> that would be so much effort
[02:58:39] <crashdemons> SmoothPorcupine,  for the cybernetic template organism, I imagine it would evolve from virus utilizing XMLRequest/Websocket -> scan and use SQL Injection -> Produce self with XSS  (on specific website packages)

[05:31:14] <ser_berry> yeah
[05:31:31] <walle303> are channel names case-sensitive
[05:31:35] <walle303> cant remember
[05:31:37] <walle303> i think not
[05:31:38] <Territoriojoven> no
[05:32:08] <yano> the IRCD freenode is case-insensitive for channel names
[05:32:57] <walle303> why dont you want people working together?
[05:33:12] <yano> because it spoils the fun
[05:33:17] <yano> and makes it less competitive
[05:33:22] <walle303> very well
[05:33:27] <ser_berry> it's much less satisfying if you don't solve it yourself too
[05:33:46] <ser_berry> why deprive yourself of the wonderful feeling of epiphany?
[05:33:59] <ChasedSpade> yano: What's the farthest puzzle solved so far?
[05:34:14] <Klaghills> 5 has been solved by only 3 people
[05:34:25] <walle303> how many puzzels
[05:34:26] <yano> 3 people are stuck on level 6
[05:35:04] <Territoriojoven> so the other 2 didnt leave yet?
[05:35:42] <yano> heh
[05:36:04] <Tamini> i hate life okay
[05:36:05] <Tamini> :(
[05:36:09] <Tamini> also technically 3.5 right
[05:36:13] <Tamini> does the betatester count as a player
[05:36:30] <yano> yes
[05:36:46] <yano> because, even though the beta-tester is on IRCPuzzles staff, i haven't shared any of the answers with anybody
[05:37:57] <Territoriojoven> is it furry
[05:38:27] <yano> no comment
[05:38:41] <Territoriojoven> what happens if you win 2 years
[05:39:15] <yano> huh
[05:39:19] <yano> 2 years in a row?
[05:39:23] <Territoriojoven> like
[05:39:27] <yano> you could get a dual-cloak when GMS is done
[05:39:47] <Territoriojoven> does it look like aprilfools/2014-2015/
[05:40:09] <yano> er
[05:40:42] <yano> it'll probably look like this: @ircpuzzles/april-fools/2015/place_in_2015/afp.2014.place_in_2014.irc_nick

[05:41:30] <larina> what about 5 years in a row
[05:41:35] <yano> lol, what i could do for the time being is put this in the @jenni/ namespace
[05:41:46] <yano> larina: fn staff only allow dual cloaks
[05:42:00] <walle303> yano, hmm does that confirm that the first level is an abrivation or is that just there to potentiall troll or both
[05:42:01] <walle303> lol
[05:42:02] <yano> within the @ircpuzzles namespace, i'll have to consult the counsel of IRCPuzzles

[05:42:18] <walle303> i take that as both

[05:43:37] <mniip> this is harder than the aaron swartz shit

[05:55:25] <walle303> lol
[05:56:14] * jes just joins every channel starting with ####
[05:56:36] <walle303> jes wont work
[05:56:40] <walle303> the channels are +s
[05:56:41] <walle303> lol
[05:56:50] <jwoglom> just break freenode into telling you!
[05:56:53] <jwoglom> simple!
[05:57:43] <jes> walle303: That's prevents you from searching for it, you can still just happen to join it if you join every single channel (which isn't going to happen for different reasons)
[05:57:57] <ser_berry> jes: also the rules state that in order to be eligible for the prize you must join the channels in order
[05:58:00] <walle303> jes, but if you join them in the wrong order
[05:58:08] <Territoriojoven> bruteforce all the chans
[05:58:09] <walle303> then you get disqualified from the cloak
[05:58:23] <cracker64> it is definitely possible to skip a channel, from what I saw
[05:58:44] <jacob1> someone did accidentally, yes
[05:58:46] <jes> hmmm, true
[05:58:46] <Territoriojoven> :o
[05:58:51] <Territoriojoven> how does that happen
[05:58:59] <cracker64> you would know if you got there
[05:59:14] <cracker64> possibly two skips, but unlikely
[05:59:18] <Territoriojoven> you are not even on my level mate
[05:59:24] <cracker64> I left it all
[05:59:36] <Klaghills> what
[05:59:41] <Klaghills> how could you skip it
[06:00:05] <jacob1> I suggest figuring out this level first and not caring about possible skips due to things people accidentally say :P
[06:00:21] <Klaghills> can you say in level 5 how skips would be possible
[06:00:24] <sdamashek> last year we had a bot that enforced the join-channels-in-order rule
[06:00:41] <jacob1> how? by the time they joined they could already have the topic
[06:00:52] <jacob1> unless it just immediately disqualified them then
[06:01:14] <yano> Happy April Fool's Day to the east coast of the US
[06:01:16] <sdamashek> it keeps track of joins, and only increments their level to the furthest joined in order
[06:01:29] <sdamashek> and it did the official scoreboard
[06:01:52] <sdamashek> but yeah I think it also logged joins, so we could see if somebody joined out of order anyways :P
[06:02:40] <BigBobbyTable> So what if I joined in reverse order
[06:02:53] <yano> then you don't get a fancy cloak
[06:03:10] <mniip> [06:50:34] <walle303> jacob1, i know you as the one of the developers of the powder toy

[06:41:08] <slidercrank> the phrase of the day: no comment :)
[06:42:08] <yano> indeed :-)
[06:43:18] <slidercrank> how far have the players progresses? how many channels ahead?

[06:43:37] <slidercrank> wow
[06:44:55] <slidercrank> to solve a quiz I should think like a quiz. What would I do if I were a quiz? I would probably look in the mirror and read myself backwards! That's the answer!

[06:47:52] <mniip> yes
[06:48:01] <slidercrank> mniip, terve.
[06:48:10] <slidercrank> for some reason if feels like you're a Finn

[06:54:45] <slidercrank> there are so many directions in which to go to solve this quiz.
[06:55:02] <slidercrank> but I can't link all the clues at. 
[06:56:31] <slidercrank> yano, what will happen if you accidentally go to the right channel (not in is sequential order)? Are you automatically disqualified?
[06:56:34] <knivey> i miss the crypto
[06:56:48] <knivey> you're banned from irc for life
[06:56:53] *** Joins: SmoothPorcupine (~smooth@207.224.112.149)
[06:57:03] <slidercrank> knivey, maybe there will be crypto puzzles in the future channels
[06:57:05] <yano> slidercrank: you aren't eligible for the cloak prizes (which won't even be awarded until GMS is up)
[06:57:20] <yano> there is crypto
[06:57:20] <Eureka7> GMS?
[06:57:31] <ser_berry> Group Management System
[06:57:34] <Cassini> yano so... never? xD
[06:57:48] <yano> it'll be up, eventually
[06:57:49] <slidercrank> yano, aren't you supposed to ask "how did you get to this channel?" 
[06:57:59] <yano> slidercrank: i ain't got time for that

[06:58:19] *** Joins: Bijan-E (~beejan@unaffiliated/bijan-e)
[06:58:32] <jacob1> I guess you should just be careful if you accidentally discover a channel and don't know how the clue leads to it :P
[06:58:36] <slidercrank> for example, I'm trying numerous answers (which are wrong). But taking into account how many of them I try. I may accidentally get to the channel I'm not supposed to get
[06:58:58] <knivey> lol
[06:58:58] <jacob1> slidercrank: you won't accidentally find the wrong channel through the clues here lol
[06:59:04] <slidercrank> okay
[06:59:07] <Eureka7> maybe...
[06:59:10] <ser_berry> slidercrank: as noted in the tips doc, you can use /mode ##channel to see if a channel exists without joining
[06:59:14] <jacob1> if you see anything that looks right, immediately join it :P
[06:59:17] <jacob1> for now
[06:59:24] <yano> brute-forcing the lower level channels (lower than level 4) is not advisable
[06:59:32] <ser_berry> if you want to be eligible for the cloak I wouldn't join unless you're sure it's the right order
[06:59:53] <jacob1> ^ you also need to learn how to solve the lower level channels because higher level ones use some of the same strategies
[07:00:03] <jacob1> if it's anything like last year at least
[07:00:15] <homerj> well, also generally, you know of know who's who on the higher levels
[07:00:43] <homerj> if you see someone in a level 5 you didn't see in level 3, something's fishy
[07:01:11] <yano> plus i'll be double checking the order of joins for cloaks
[07:01:49] <homerj> I need to refresh mine, after last year's meridian debacle
[07:01:54] * jacob1 randomly joins and parts the channels in different order to confuse yano 
[07:02:13] <yano> you can see if the channel exists without joining it by doing, /mode ##channel_name
[07:02:21] <Klaghills> but brute-forcing the higher channels is advisable?
[07:02:27] <Eureka7> /mode ####channel_name :P
[07:02:31] <jacob1> Klaghills: ... no
[07:02:35] <yano> Klaghills: no, you'll be here until the end of time
[07:02:36] <jacob1> solve the puzzles for real all the time
[07:02:40] <jacob1> and yeah that :P
[07:02:41] <Klaghills> :>
[07:02:49] <jacob1> i mean last year, the final level channel was like 40 characters long
[07:03:12] <knivey> stupid connection timedout
[07:03:12] <Cassini> yano the cloak is ircpuzzles/ and not april-fools?
[07:03:33] <yano> correct
[07:03:47] <yano> it'll be @ircpuzzles/2015/april-fools/rank_place/nick
[07:03:51] <yano> only the top-10 get cloaks
[07:03:58] <Eureka7> no lottery?
[07:04:03] <knivey> yano, how many people have finished already?
[07:04:07] <Eureka7> none
[07:04:13] <knivey> wat?!
[07:04:17] <Eureka7> :P
[07:04:20] <yano> nobdy has made it to the end yet
[07:04:21] <Eureka7> it's harder than you think
[07:04:25] <yano> i expect the competition to take days
[07:04:32] <Cassini> lol

[07:04:47] <Eureka7> yano: would you be suspicious if someone solved it in less than a day?
[07:05:04] <knivey> someone last year finished pretty quickly

[07:05:56] <Eureka7> yano: :P
[07:06:20] <crashdemons> the only bad thing is the special cloak actually reduces the number of chars you can post because of the command limit :p
[07:06:34] <yano> huh
[07:06:43] <yano> i'm pretty sure irc doesn't work that
[07:06:45] <yano> way
[07:06:45] <Eureka7> yano: what's the diff between yur 2 nicks?
[07:06:47] <crashdemons> yes
[07:06:52] <yano> Eureka7: which 2 nicks?
[07:07:01] <Eureka7> yurs & yurs+me
[07:07:04] <jacob1> actually it does work how crashdemons said
[07:07:13] <jenni> oh baby
[07:07:19] <crashdemons> your posts are limited by the full server-side PRIVMSG:   nick!user@host PRIVMSG dest :text
[07:07:21] <crashdemons> 512 max
[07:07:26] <slidercrank> jenni, hi
[07:07:27] <jacob1> ^ :P
[07:07:40] <yano> crashdemons: no they aren't, it is 512 chars after the : part
[07:07:42] <yano> the last :
[07:07:44] <jacob1> i've had bots that calculate that out to figure out how much they can post before
[07:07:54] <yano> you get 510 usable chars because the last part is always \r\n
[07:08:09] <crashdemons> yano, no.  the IRC command itself cannot be over 512, including newline
[07:08:19] <crashdemons> try to send one, it will be dropped
[07:08:26] <yano> that is false
[07:08:28] <jacob1> i'm pretty sure it works that way, but idk. Would have to read the specification / do testing :P
[07:08:48] <yano> EpicOne: ^
[07:08:53] <yano> EpicOne would know
[07:08:59] <crashdemons> after messing with a bot and trying to send posts that are only 490 chars and having them fail, I'm 100% sure.
[07:09:09] <knivey> [01 01:07:40] <+yano> crashdemons: no they aren't, it is 512 chars after the : part
[07:09:12] <crashdemons> also, read the RFC
[07:09:13] <knivey> ow
[07:09:24] <knivey> yano making me cry
[07:09:28] <jacob1> if I keep putting :'s in my messages i'll have unlimited length!
[07:09:33] <yano> jacob1: lol
[07:09:36] <Eureka7> :P
[07:09:53] <yano> EpicOne: is the limit limited to the paylod or the entire nick+user+host?
[07:10:04] <Eureka7> yolo
[07:10:21] <Eureka7> doesn't matter
[07:10:27] <knivey> its limited to the entire command
[07:10:31] <EpicOne> nick limit is 12, identd is 10, host is 63
[07:10:41] <Eureka7> why would you even need to post a single line of 500?
[07:10:41] <knivey> at least in real implementations
[07:10:42] <yano> wat

[07:11:06] <jacob1> hmm, and that's also why when you have the identify-msg CAP loaded, it cuts off a character of every message
[07:11:10] <crashdemons> now how many did it post?
[07:11:13] <yano> count those 0's
[07:11:17] <knivey> strlen it
[07:11:26] <crashdemons> 456
[07:11:29] <EpicOne> 457
[07:11:34] <crashdemons> the server cut it off
[07:11:34] <jacob1> 457 :P
[07:11:43] <crashdemons> your command was too long
[07:11:43] <jacob1> crashdemons has identify-msg on then :P

[07:12:09] <yano> .py print len("jenni@jenni/cell-8675309")
[07:12:09] <jenni> 24
[07:12:13] <crashdemons> point is, you don't get 510 for the text
[07:12:14] <knivey> can't even count
[07:12:15] <yano> .py 24 + 457
[07:12:16] <jenni> 481
[07:12:22] <yano> .py 510 - 481
[07:12:22] <jenni> 29
[07:12:32] <EpicOne> now the len of this channel name... 
[07:12:36] <yano> .py print len("PRIVMSG :")
[07:12:37] <jenni> 9
[07:12:42] <jacob1> also be sure to count the nick itself, the PRIVMSG, the spaces, and the newlines. Oh right and the length of the channel :P
[07:12:44] <yano> .py print len("#ircpuzzles")
[07:12:44] <jenni> 11
[07:12:51] <yano> still missing 9 chars
[07:13:13] <yano> not counting the newlines

[07:13:31] <yano> .py print len("jenni@jenni/cell-8675309 PRIVMSG #ircpuzzles :")
[07:13:31] <jenni> 46
[07:13:33] <crashdemons> I usually just end up building a simulated server-side command without text to count how many chars I have left
[07:13:35] <yano> .py 46 + 457
[07:13:35] <jenni> 503
[07:13:55] <crashdemons> but anyway, your cloak (especially long ones) detract from how much you can post in a single line
[07:13:59] <jacob1> hmm ...
[07:14:08] <Eureka7> crashdemons: again, why would you need that many chars?
[07:14:15] <jacob1> i'm not sure where the other missing characters are from then
[07:14:27] <jacob1> but at least it does show that the limit isn't always 512 :P
[07:14:49] <crashdemons> Eureka7, really you don't but it sucks when you randomly do and it gets cut off on the far side unexpectedly
[07:14:55] <EpicOne> ... i get 510
[07:15:12] <ChasedSpade> Isn't nick also prefixed with a colon
