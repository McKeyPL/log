[00:20:16] <Sombra> You know how in all those cheesy fanfics (the clean ones) where applejack is shipped with rainbowdash? There's like a million of them out there, but basically in all of them blah blah stuff happends they fall in love and everypony is happy for them.

[00:20:50] <Sombra> WELL I had an idea for doing something like that, except for making gay ponies taboo (which would be wierd in equestria) and having them just sort of play it out like that so it would be more of a struggle.
[00:21:07] <DiamondHeart> So, like real life?
[00:21:12] <DiamondHeart> Because it's still a struggle

[00:21:58] <DinkyBot> Yay! Momma, that was fun!!
[00:22:10] <Sombra> Except more so.  Like... making it so a gay pony would sort of be a complete unknown so no one else would know what to do, and would like, think there's something wrong with RD
[00:22:30] <RandomNinja> why RD? :P
[00:22:59] <Sombra> Because everyone already assumes she's gay so we might as well go with that.
