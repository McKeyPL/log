[20:10:39] <Colgate> so, I've got a problem that probably has a stupid simple answer, I've got a python program that uses print("blah") to print to stdout, if I just run the program, it works as expected and prints out all the lines as they come, but if I redirect stdout to a file, it no longer does so. It only writes 1 huge chunk when it closes hours later. I'm thinking it is being write buffered somewhere,
[20:10:40] <Colgate> but I don't know where.

[20:48:36] <AppleDash> Do you think it might be possible that a crappy USB hub is dirtying my USB power?
[20:48:55] <Colgate> yes
[20:48:59] <AppleDash> Because when I use my headset through this hub, I get a high pitched tone in the headset over everything
[20:49:04] <AppleDash> Directly connected it's fine
[20:49:42] <AppleDash> Also, my new mouse just REFUSES to work through this hub
[20:49:43] <Colgate> DataByte: that worked, strange that python would buffer it when it is being redirected to file, but not when going to a console
[20:50:05] <Colgate> I didn't even know it was possible to detect that
