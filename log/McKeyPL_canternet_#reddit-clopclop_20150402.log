[00:36:56] <Melon_Phone> significant lack of nudity
[00:38:15] <thaostra> I'd like to see a solid-state successor to Blu-ray. I want small drives I can plug into an equally small player, not flimsy rotational media
[00:39:05] <Melon_Phone> sd cards
[00:40:31] <thaostra> Melon_Phone, It needs to be standardized to fit the use case of home media, i.e., which filesystem to use, file organization, copy protection
[00:41:11] <Melon_Phone> welp
[00:44:21] <thaostra> I imagine services like Red Box would benefit from solid state media, as they'd just rewrite the drives as new releases come in or even write to drives on demand. They'd just need to have a way to restrict third-parties from overwriting their media
[00:45:04] <Melon_Phone> does anyone actually use red box in 2015? 
[00:45:13] <thaostra> Yes
[00:45:31] <thaostra> It's a modern Blockbuster
[00:45:32] <Melon_Phone> me and my bud got one like back in 2008
[00:45:57] <Melon_Phone> isn't red box like a stand with films in thin packaging? 
[00:46:13] <thaostra> Basically
[00:46:21] <Melon_Phone> with like a 48 hour viewing lock
[00:46:37] <thaostra> No
[00:47:15] <Melon_Phone> something had kindof a timer on if
[00:47:19] <Melon_Phone> it*
[00:47:22] <thaostra> You'll just get late fees, but even then you could keep the movie. They're just dispensers for disks of various home media

[00:48:15] <Melon_Phone> I feel like physical media is about to go extinct in the next couple decades 
[00:48:16] <thaostra> They're pretty convenient to use, as they're typically placed inside a grocery store
[00:48:40] <Melon_Phone> with Netflix and other digital media stores rising so rapidly 
[00:50:38] <thaostra> Define physical media
[00:51:34] <Melon_Phone> disks? 
[00:52:02] <thaostra> I can imagine DVDs and Blu-ray falling out of use in favor of solid state media for storing home movies, but it'll be a long time before that happens
[00:52:53] <Melon_Phone> oki
[00:53:28] <Flame> Katiepony: wb :D
[00:54:08] <thaostra> It's only going to fall out of favor once economy of scale falls in favor of solid state, as DVDs and Blu-ray have the advantage of being much cheaper to manufacturer
[00:54:09] <Katiepony> hello
[00:54:28] <Melon_Phone> totally
[00:54:41] <thaostra> * manufacture
[00:56:40] <weisey> why i so tired ;~;
[00:57:13] <thaostra> But yeah, I can imagine a microSD-like storage media with copy/write protection so that certain users have specific privileges, and the form factor will remain the same to maintain compatibility with all devices while the storage capacity increases over time to hold higher definition video
[00:57:43] <Melon_Phone> definitely

[04:49:34] <Quinn> I mean I can, but I'm just worried he wont like me as much or something :/
[04:52:22] <Quinn> and worried I might not be able to handle his dick, as weird as it sounds ;-;
[04:59:32] <Quinn> or just worried I'm gonna do something stupid and embarrass myself 
[04:59:42] <Quinn> my stomach is already hurting just from anxiety :x
[05:00:43] <RNGsus> Ah its an interesting feeling aint it
[05:00:56] <Quinn> what do you mean
[05:01:12] <RNGsus> stomach hurting from anxiety
[05:01:22] <Quinn> I know that feeling well, and it sucks :c
[05:01:24] <RNGsus> nothing is physically wrong, yet you still feel pain
[05:01:48] <Quinn> it's like, sucking, frotting, kissing, cuddling, that's one thing
[05:02:08] <Quinn> but sex is kinda making me nervous :x
[05:03:18] <RNGsus> I havent had sex so i have no advice to give :P
[05:03:31] <Quinn> :x
[05:04:26] <Quinn> I think mainly I don't want to disappoint him :c
[05:06:01] <RNGsus> well you wont so stop worrying about it
[05:06:44] <Quinn> idk I feel like I'm pretty good at being sexually disappointing 
[05:11:01] <RNGsus> sex is for your enjoyment and you cant enjoy it if you worry about it
[05:11:24] <Quinn> :/
[05:12:45] <Quinn> I want him to enjoy it more than I care about myself honestly
[05:13:34] <RNGsus> thats not good

[05:16:48] <FineLine> plushie_pegasus: Hi
[05:17:21] <Quinn> dunno, feels really good to know that I can make someone else feel good
[05:17:29] <Quinn> my own physical enjoyment is secondary
[05:18:35] <weisey> ^ I'm the same
[05:19:11] <weisey> I get more of a rush out of "oooh I made you orgasm!~ heeheee"
[05:19:21] <weisey> Than of my own sexual pleasure 
[05:19:28] <Quinn> I've been taken advantage of before for it though, so idunno :/
[05:19:29] <RNGsus> the way you worded it makes you seem like you dont care about yourself
[05:19:52] <plushie_pegasus> Me too , I always make sure my plushies cum first
[05:19:53] <Quinn> I really don't, but that's a whole different issue
[05:20:57] <RNGsus> alright 
[05:22:54] <Quinn> if somehow this turns into a long term relationship it'll be different, but for now it feels good to have a purpose again
[05:26:21] <Quinn> I just hope I don't mess it up
[05:27:49] <Quinn> it seems like he's okay with mostly sexual stuff right now, and as weird as it might be I think that'll be easier for me to handle right now ;-;

[22:38:29] <Vulpixbrew> that expert cgi
[22:39:38] <OmarianVolcae> Only 10 minutes until CS:GO lock expires.
[22:39:50] <OmarianVolcae> And then I only have to win 1 match for it to be gone for good.
[22:39:55] * OmarianVolcae is excited.
[22:39:57] <Araiya> So... CS:Stop becomes CS:GO again?
[22:40:05] <OmarianVolcae> xD
[22:40:06] <OmarianVolcae> yep
[22:40:27] <Vulpixbrew> sweet
[22:40:33] <Araiya> Never played it, but it seems silly that there's some arbitrary lockdown that keeps you from playing the game.
[22:40:46] <OmarianVolcae> Well, it's meant to stop people from abusing the system.
[22:40:53] <weisey> Yeah
[22:40:58] <OmarianVolcae> I hate it, but understand the necessity.
[22:41:08] <weisey> Its meant to stop people from being carried up to a rank they shouldn't be in 
[22:41:20] <weisey> By a team of high level boosters
[22:41:21] <weisey> Like
[22:41:39] <Araiya> Oh, kind of like our KITe teams in Anarchy Online.
[22:41:43] <weisey> If I could get carried by 4 global elites

[22:41:51] <weisey> 10 times in a row
[22:41:55] <weisey> Even if I did nothing
[22:42:10] <weisey> I would get placed as Global Elite or supreme, or at worst LEM

[22:44:59] <Araiya> I guess that's a good thing?
[22:45:08] <weisey> No
[22:45:10] <weisey> Its not
[22:45:33] <OmarianVolcae> It only exists for 10 wins, Araiya, so it's not a big deal.
[22:45:33] <weisey> Rank boosting != good

[22:45:45] <weisey> Yeah
[22:45:47] <OmarianVolcae> She's talking about the lock, Weisey.
[22:45:49] <Squirrelly> Huh?
[22:45:52] <RNGsus> Hi Squirrelly :3
[22:45:52] <OmarianVolcae> The lock is a good thing.
[22:45:59] * OmarianVolcae licks Squirrelly.
[22:46:01] <weisey> Oh
[22:46:02] <Squirrelly> What lock?
[22:46:06] <OmarianVolcae> CS:GO
[22:46:09] <Squirrelly> Ohai!
[22:46:11] * Araiya is used to levels, be it Planetside's Battle Rank system, Anarchy Online's multiple level system, Defiance's EGO system. Has no clue what LEM, etc are.
[22:46:13] <OmarianVolcae> The competetive win lock for newbs.
[22:46:16] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[22:46:18] <iamalion> yus OmarianVolcae
[22:46:33] <OmarianVolcae> 2 minutes until lock expires for good, iamalion!
[22:46:34] <Araiya> So I don't quite get the implications of those ranking titles.
[22:46:43] <OmarianVolcae> They're matchmaking ranks.
[22:46:58] <weisey> The top 3 
[22:47:24] <weisey> Of 18

[22:47:47] <RNGsus> OI
[22:47:56] <RNGsus> WTF is that
[22:48:11] <OmarianVolcae> The ranks.
[22:48:18] <OmarianVolcae> of CS:GO
[22:48:23] <RNGsus> its making me download something
[22:48:24] <Araiya> That's trying to hand off a zip file that isn't a zip file.
[22:48:27] <OmarianVolcae> Oh derp
[22:48:29] <OmarianVolcae> My bad
[22:48:38] <Araiya> Possibly the CDN is being dumbtastic.
[22:48:57] <OmarianVolcae> http://csgolikeapro.com/images/b/b3/Ranks.jpg
[22:49:05] <OmarianVolcae> There's an actual image link.
[22:49:14] <Araiya> Yeah, CDN was being dumb. Renamed the file locally.
[22:49:31] <RNGsus> Awww yiss silver 1
[22:49:33] <RNGsus> best rank
[22:49:37] <OmarianVolcae> xD
