[02:54:45] <wobniaR> My first real exposure was probably tiesto's adagio for strings

[02:55:15] <Eywind> ah
[02:55:19] <wobniaR> Then I was like ":o"
[02:55:20] <Eywind> adagio dazzle for springs

[19:07:21] <Eywind> and there was this kinda barrier thing around it, so him and I walked out 
[19:07:26] <wobniaR> #1 rule of internet comments, don't
[19:07:37] <Eywind> and we looked across the road down into the wooded area on the other side
[19:07:42] <Eywind> and there were a lot of like realistic-looking Pokemon
[19:07:43] <Shattered_Skies> its like a train wreck XD I can't not look
[19:08:14] <Eywind> and he pointed to a cave and was like "Man I bet there's some cool ones there, like a Legendary or something!" and I was like "Yeah man I don't think I have the balls to catch one of those.  :P let's go"
[19:08:28] <Shattered_Skies> like I wrote a story and I got some hate in the comments and in PM
[19:09:14] <Eywind> so we ran over and he kinda got attacked by a few so he was fighting and I go over to near the cave and there's a little pink cat fetus chilling out, teleporting to a few of the pokemon and playing, and I was like oh man it's Mew that's awesome.  so I sat there watching a bit before it saw me.  I said something to it and it kinda teleported up this path like I should go after.  Then I 
[19:09:15] <Eywind> woke up :/
[19:09:24] <Eywind> the pokemon looked -beautiful- though

[19:20:03] <Gaming_Sounds> What I found bothersome was when I was talking to a fanfic writer earlier today, and told him flat out everything that was wrong with his work (3edgy5me main character, awful spelling and grammar, wooden dialogue) and he treated it as a case of "well, that's just like, your opinion, man" sort of thing.
[19:20:16] <Shattered_Skies> but not even on the net. I get it IRL
[19:20:39] <Gaming_Sounds> It's like... it's not an opinion when your work is quite obviously not obeying the rules of the language it is written in. That is stone cold fact, not opinion.
[19:20:49] <duskchaser> hey all
