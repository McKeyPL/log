[00:12:48] <thaostra> Luvbi, Ninite can save you some time installing programs
[00:18:33] <Luvbi> 13It's not the time I'm worried about. It's just getting everything done CORRECTLY XD
[00:18:43] <Luvbi> 13Thanks though =P
[00:20:10] <thaostra> Well Ninite also helps get things correctly as it automates the install process of applications and tweaks them for the user's benefit. For instance, it'll automatically disable Ask in the Java installer
[00:22:01] <Luvbi> 13Ahh, that's useful
[00:25:22] <thaostra> What's also great is it'll produce a custom installer that you can save somewhere for when you want to reinstall again
[00:26:30] <Luvbi> 13I'm not sure I follow you with that. For the program you installed, or for Ninite itself?
[00:26:58] <weisey> Ninite  is a service that bundles a bunch of installers (which you can select out of a list)
[00:27:17] <weisey> And gives you one big installer that installs them all at once
[00:27:58] <Luvbi> 13Oh
[00:28:03] <Luvbi> 13That makes much more sense XD
[00:28:03] <weisey> And you can keep that big installer somewhere 
[00:28:03] <princesssluttershy> iam[a]lion, You are pretty :3
[00:28:03] * iam[a]lion is currently away: csgo (Since 3:08:52p, 19mins 59secs ago)
[00:28:11] <thaostra> The installer itself is just a bunch of scripts telling it to fetch installers and run them, so you're guaranteed to get the latest versions
[00:28:12] <weisey> So you don't have to go redownload it 
[00:28:53] <Luvbi> 13See, thao has all these convoluted ways of describing things. Thanks for (kinda) simplifing it XD

[06:14:58] <Algido> Doing well. Eatin some In N Out and opening some MLP cards. Just got an AJ lenticular in the first one. Pretty sweet :3
[06:15:11] <samonuh> Don't creep them out with online stalking :P

[06:15:33] <plushie_pegasus> just going by the hostmask
[06:15:38] <samonuh> I haven't had In N Out since...2009?
[06:15:43] <Algido> Doing bad at acting feral lol
[06:15:59] <samonuh> I mean, that's my only experience on the West Coast
[06:16:28] * plushie_pegasus does not like in and out, plain burgers and bad tasting fries
[06:16:49] <samonuh> I eat Five Guys usually when I want to hate mysel
[06:16:50] <samonuh> f
[06:16:54] <Algido> To each their own...
[06:17:14] <samonuh> I can't go to the one near me anymore though because the cashier awkwardly asked for my number.
[06:17:21] <samonuh> Now I don't feel comfortable
[06:17:41] <Algido> Fice guys is good. I dunno where you got the bland burgers from when thinking of in n out. mustard fried patties. So much better than mcdonalds or burger king
[06:17:42] <plushie_pegasus> lol I like 5 guys, but if you have peanut allergy, don't go there
[06:18:32] <samonuh> Would you guys agree it's unprofessional to try to get a number from a customer?
[06:18:47] <Algido> This is funny, yesterday or the day before in n out was being talked fondly of :P
[06:19:13] <Algido> Not really... 
[06:19:28] <samonuh> It just makes the customer feel awkward
[06:19:34] <samonuh> Not fair to them
[06:19:44] <Algido> If it were somewhere else... I don;t really expect profesionalism from a burger joint, lol
[06:20:07] <samonuh> You should always act professional regardless of the job
[06:20:45] <Algido> Better than them being an asshole. I dunno. However you want to take it. The person thinks you are attractive. I would think the cashier feels more awkward. I dunno
[06:20:50] <RubyPinch> it'd be a bit unprofessional, but imo not unacceptable
[06:21:20] <samonuh> Well thanks to them I don't feel comfortable eating at my favorite burger joint near me
[06:21:21] <Algido> What about a person in line with you asking for your number?
[06:21:46] <samonuh> That's fine because I know the odds of me seeing them again are slim
[06:22:00] <cloppyhoofs> You should see if you could tell a manager about what happened :o
[06:22:05] <Algido> Is it offensive to some to be admired and have a person attempt to be your friend and ask for your number?
[06:22:14] <samonuh> Nah, that'd be a dick move sloppyhoofs
[06:22:15] <RubyPinch> that'd probably cause a lost job x-x
[06:22:18] <samonuh> cloppyhoofs*
[06:22:33] <cloppyhoofs> I've been called floppy and I've been called sloppy x3
[06:22:36] <samonuh> It's not offensive. It's awkward.
[06:22:49] <Algido> I fail to grasp the issue. My word, and getting someone fired over it =/
[06:23:09] <RubyPinch> no one wants the person fired x-x
[06:23:18] <Algido> So you don't want anyone to ask for your phone number, regardless of the situation?
[06:23:32] <samonuh> If it's because they're attracted to me, no.
[06:23:43] <samonuh> If it's for other reasons, that's fine
[06:23:44] <Algido> lol wut?
[06:23:54] <Algido> You dislike people liking you?
[06:24:13] <samonuh> I don't dislike it, but I'm never going to accept their number
[06:24:22] <samonuh> So it's awkward since I rejected them
[06:24:41] <RubyPinch> burblefurble, regardless, you probably don't have much option other than to either go back or not go back
[06:24:56] <Algido> Obviously their is a key piece of information I am missing. 
[06:24:57] <samonuh> I'll give it a year
[06:24:59] <RubyPinch> realistically, I think it would be more awkward if you didn't go back, in a round about way
[06:24:59] <Algido> I am very confused.
[06:25:03] <Algido> Sorry if I offended.
[06:25:07] <samonuh> It's fine
[06:25:37] <Algido> Give it a year? give whaa?
[06:25:43] <Algido> nvm
[06:25:43] <RubyPinch> the person at the store is going to feel weirder if she/he scared you away, vs if you still got food
[06:25:45] <Algido> I....
[06:26:01] <samonuh> I've been in a committed relationship for over 3 years, so I'm never going to accept the number of a person hitting on me. I'm always going to reject them by default, so I'd prefer the situation not to happen.
[06:26:15] <RubyPinch> and It'd only be weird for like the first 2 or so times
[06:26:58] <samonuh> It's okay since it was in my hometown, and not where I live most of the time
[06:27:47] <samonuh> But I'm back home for the weekend, and talking about burgers made me want Five Guys. Then I remembered I refuse to return to this one.
[06:27:57] <samonuh> Sorry for bringing it up though

[06:42:53] <Algido> I love my plushies
[06:43:12] <plushie_pegasus> Me too
[06:43:42] <Algido> Especially my fluttershy. She is so nice and likes to communicate the most.
[06:44:24] * Algido hugs Fluttershy
[06:45:03] <plushie_pegasus> My tenderheart bear is the one that communicates most with me
[06:48:03] <Algido> There has been a Pinkie and AJ at a store for a long time. I need to save them. Both of them managed to get rhough to me even though they still had their tags on.
[06:48:07] <Vulpixbrew> If you were to die, would whoever goes through your personal belongings be shocked by what they find?
[06:48:16] <Vulpixbrew> I just got asked that question
[06:48:31] <Algido> Na.
[06:48:32] <Squirrelly> Uhhhhh yes
[06:48:34] <Squirrelly> YES
[06:48:38] <Squirrelly> Yes they would
[06:48:46] <Algido> I am an open person.
[06:48:59] <Squirrelly> Because that would be my parents, and I know they know I'm into kinky stuff, but they would be surprised at just HOW kinky their little girl is
[06:49:39] <Vulpixbrew> between all the yiff/clop/regular porn
[06:49:55] <Squirrelly> OHHHH YEAHHHH
[06:49:58] <Squirrelly> That's the other thing
[06:50:09] <Squirrelly> They don't know I'm bisexual, leaning towards lesbian
[06:50:14] <Squirrelly> So that might shock them a bit
[06:50:27] <Vulpixbrew> of course my porn folder is labeled its porn
[06:50:45] <Squirrelly> lol
[06:50:49] <Vulpixbrew> ets not forget my books marks (half a dozen to bad dragon alone)
[06:50:58] <Squirrelly> if they went through all my phone stuff, oooohhhhh boy
[06:51:20] <Algido> My answer of "Na" implies that my deep clop/yiff/etc. folders would be left alone out of respect, especially since they are named stuff like "Please respect privacy"
[06:52:08] <Algido> If whoever goes against that, whatever. Their fault for finding out some stuff whoever might look through my shit.
[06:52:36] <plushie_pegasus> all my plushies with SPH's, and i got a box hidden in my closet full of enema stuff 
[06:53:32] <Algido> I don't wanna think of me being dead >< damnit

[21:39:39] <princesssluttershy> Hello Melon_Phone and OmarianVolcae 
[21:40:55] <Melon_Phone> hi princesssluttershy and OmarianVolcae 
[21:41:57] <OmarianVolcae> Hi Melon_Phone and princesssluttershy 
[21:41:57] <FineLine> OmarianVolcae: 2015-04-21 - 16:03:00 <weisey> FUCK YOU
[21:42:06] <OmarianVolcae> wtf weisey 
[21:42:10] <OmarianVolcae> What's that for?
[21:43:02] <weisey> Getting either GN1 or SEM way before me
[21:43:06] <weisey> <3
[21:43:11] <weisey> cant remember
[21:43:34] <OmarianVolcae> Oh
[21:43:42] <OmarianVolcae> GN1 is hard
[21:43:52] <weisey> not really
[21:43:54] <weisey> im gn1
[21:43:55] <OmarianVolcae> I dun like getting shooted
[21:44:09] <weisey> getting lobbied with GN3s and still topfragging
[21:44:15] <OmarianVolcae> I get shooted way more than I got shooted in Silvers
[21:44:33] <weisey> its actually easier than silvers because in silver i was playing like not a silver
[21:44:50] <weisey> so now, my metagame actualy works, because people do what i expect
[21:44:50] <OmarianVolcae> I was hoping some of the silver MM bullshit would go away in GN
[21:45:01] <OmarianVolcae> But I've had a series of mute teams
[21:45:11] <OmarianVolcae> people who just scream in their mic.
[21:45:26] <OmarianVolcae> Or any variety of annoying worse-than-bots teammates.

[21:47:05] <weisey> it gets better once you start getting lobbied with mostly golds

[21:47:57] <OmarianVolcae> I've been playing with an SE for awhile, so he's been dragging my MM down a bit
[21:48:04] <OmarianVolcae> He just ranked up to SEM a few minutes ago
