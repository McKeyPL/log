[00:20:38] <freeeeee> helo Colgate 
[00:20:44] <freeeeee> innocent here
[00:21:04] <freeeeee> what does it men when chanserv shows access on a list as custom
[00:22:05] <Colgate> it means you have a custom level that isn't defined by a template
[00:22:47] *** Joins: Pony_68061 (Lapsus@Pony-n6olie.cable.rogers.com)
[00:22:49] <freeeeee> custom means deifind seting by owner cant be seen by us
[00:22:56] *** Pony_68061 is now known as Lapsus
[00:22:57] <Colgate> or rather, role, not template
[00:23:05] <Colgate> you can see the flags
[00:23:25] <Colgate> they just aren't a defined role for the channel
[00:23:27] <freeeeee> if there is some one owner it shows him also as custom
[00:23:30] <Colgate> /chanserv role #channel list
[00:25:26] <freeeeee> means if i m custom sop so my rules will be defined as per sop role
[00:25:58] <Colgate> if you are custom, you are whatever your custom flags are
[00:26:07] <freeeeee> <ChanServ>: SOP                 : acl-view, autoop, protect, exempt, acl-change, halfop, invite, op, remove, set, topic, voice
[00:26:20] <freeeeee> even if i m sop i cant add ppl rite
[00:26:37] <freeeeee> and if it shows sop to me not custom then i can add rite
[00:27:02] <Colgate> "acl-change" is +f, which lets you add/remove chanserv flags from users
[00:27:08] <Colgate> acl stands for access control list
[00:29:42] <freeeeee> ok
[00:29:53] <freeeeee> then y i am not able to add user
[00:30:08] <freeeeee> when i do it there is a msg you cant
[00:30:58] <Colgate> "add user"
[00:31:05] <freeeeee> yes
[00:31:06] <Colgate> what command are you trying to use?
[00:31:06] <freeeeee> <ChanServ>: You are not authorized to perform this operation
[00:31:17] <freeeeee> ./msg chanserv aop #gupshupcorner add flirty
[00:31:29] <freeeeee> sorry for room name
[00:31:46] <wolfyshy> try /msg chanserv flags #CHANNEL add NAME aop
[00:31:58] <Colgate> wolfyshy: no
[00:32:01] <Dusk> aop isn't a flag
[00:32:03] <Dusk> :T
[00:32:09] <wolfyshy> it's /something/ like that
[00:32:11] <Dusk> you could manually set the flags
[00:32:13] <Colgate> no, it isn't
[00:32:38] <Colgate> freeeeee: you do not have the appropriate flag to set flags on other users in that channel
[00:32:38] <freeeeee> same
[00:32:49] <freeeeee> <ChanServ>: You are not authorized to execute this command.
[00:33:02] <freeeeee> yes thats what i was saying
[00:33:04] <Colgate> yes, that is working as intented, you do not have the +f chanserv flag, so you cannot set flags on other users
[00:33:11] <freeeeee> i m ristricted from ownr
[00:33:31] <freeeeee> i can only remove
[00:33:32] <Colgate> the owner of the channel can do that if they wish
[00:33:34] <freeeeee> cant add
[00:33:35] <Dusk> something like /msg chanserv flags #CHANNEL user +AOehiotv
[00:33:38] <Dusk> oh
[00:33:38] <Colgate> you cannot remove flags either
[00:33:41] <wolfyshy> sorry not 'add'
[00:33:49] <wolfyshy> no it will accept template names in flags
[00:33:49] <Colgate> you do not have +f, you cannot modify flags
[00:33:51] <wolfyshy> I just tested it
[00:34:04] <wolfyshy> /msg chanserv flags #CHANNEL NAME aop will work if you have appropriate permission
[00:34:06] <Dusk> wolfyshy we know it doesnt' work :p
[00:34:30] <wolfyshy> well, yeah, not if you have no permissions
[00:34:41] <Dusk> nono the specific command you said
[00:34:49] <Dusk> the one earlier
[00:34:52] <freeeeee> so the sop i have is like fake op :P
[00:35:07] <Dusk> I mean you can still kick people :p
[00:35:10] <Dusk> :D
[00:35:14] <freeeeee> hahhaha
[00:35:25] <Dusk> the little things eh?
[00:35:32] <freeeeee> well you know authorities make you feel batter
[00:35:47] <Colgate> wolfyshy: yes, that will work
[00:35:50] <wolfyshy> like I said it's not 'add'
[00:35:55] <Colgate> without the add, yes
[00:35:56] <wolfyshy> I'm sorry
[00:36:04] <freeeeee> less authorities you feel like you are nothing and they just make you feel good . so that they can use you
[00:36:46] <freeeeee> it feels like you are not trustwroty
[00:36:53] <freeeeee> it feels like you are not trustwrothy
[00:37:10] <freeeeee> well thenks all of you i will keep disturbing you
[00:37:15] <Colgate> look, that's channel policy, they are free to set their flags however they want
[00:37:17] <freeeeee> :) when ever i feel i should
[00:37:56] <freeeeee> yes they are boss but there are some personal relation . that come sin front of you what they really are..
[00:38:05] <freeeeee> if you have knowledge
[00:38:14] <freeeeee> like today i learn some thing
[00:38:16] <freeeeee> :)
[00:38:31] <freeeeee> i dont need access
[00:38:53] <freeeeee> why they give me puppet access
[00:38:54] <freeeeee> :P
[00:38:59] <freeeeee> you know
[00:39:06] <freeeeee> how it feels
[00:39:26] <Colgate> giving people the ability to kick others/moderate the channel, but not be able to add other ops is very common
[00:39:38] <freeeeee> when you come to know some one you know feels for you trust less
[00:39:57] <freeeeee> yes boss ur right :)
[00:40:04] <freeeeee> there channel

[04:47:42] <Fluttershi> how to you invite yourself back into an invite only chan you aren't in at the moment?
[04:48:06] <wolfyshy> /query chanserv invite #channel
[04:48:57] <Fluttershi> gotta query cs, eh?
[04:49:28] <Colgate> yep, chanserv will send you an invite to the channel, assuming you have the invite flag set
[04:49:40] <Fluttershi> ah, there we go, thanks
[04:50:29] <Fluttershi> what's the format for adding excepts to the invite list, /chanserv mode +I ?
[04:51:05] <Colgate> /mode #channel +I
[04:52:19] <Fluttershi> there we go, thanks
[04:54:35] <Fluttershi> can you mlock +I?
[04:56:01] <Googie> No, but every registered channel is +P now, so mlock shouldn't be needed.
[04:59:02] <Ashfire> is that automatic now, or do you still have to set it when you make a brand new channel?
[05:10:20] <Colgate> it is set on registration
[05:10:27] <Colgate> and unset on deregistration
[05:11:09] <Colgate> there may be a few registered channels that are not +P, since they didn't exist when the command was run
