[00:44:05] <Frosty> But now she has a girlfriend
[00:44:23] <ponder> True
[00:44:34] <ponder> Although, hugs don't have to be sexual in any way
[00:44:39] <ponder> they can just be friendship hugs
[00:44:44] <Frosty> I'm aware.

[00:50:29] <ponder> I'd say it is the best thing on TV today

[01:00:28] <Frosty> And Breakfast Princess. I'l suck her syrup, fo'sure.

[01:13:59] <thaostra> I used to during my teenage years
[01:14:04] <ponder> If you touch it with a thunderstone, does it evolve into an Eelectross guitar?
[01:14:07] <Frosty> Damn, you got me beat.
[01:14:19] <Frosty> I don;t even know if mine is tuned proper
[01:14:50] <thaostra> A tuning fork helps if you're not familiar with the sound strings are supposed to make
[01:14:57] <Frosty> I can't wait to get my new 3DS
[01:15:23] <Frosty> I know how to do it if you can get the first string tunned, but I don't think it is.
[01:16:05] <thaostra> Hence the tuning fork, but in the end you should be be able to acquire perfect pitch
[01:16:48] <Frosty> I looked up the sound on the internets
[01:17:47] <thaostra> I suppose, but hearing a reference sound coming from a physical analog gets the best results
[01:18:20] <Frosty> I used to have a tuner.
[01:18:26] <thaostra> Getting an electric tuner is also an option, as it'll give live feedback whether you're tuning too high or too low
[01:18:28] <Frosty> But then I sold it before I left home.

[07:00:25] <Squirrelly> Can anybody find the clopfic that this is from? Or any story relating to it? And to the following few pics? [tentacles, oviposition, noncon] http://g.e-hentai.org/s/a8c861a471/788714-23
[07:00:26] <FineLine> [ Fall of Equestria ]
[07:01:20] <thaostra> RubyPinch, Not really. Straightforwardness is almost always something to strive for in system design, and to the end user it's anything but. Complex systems don't need to be complicated.
[07:01:56] <RubyPinch> how is it complicated to the end user? its like, press-button-to-update
[07:02:02] <RubyPinch> not much more
[07:03:47] <RubyPinch> http://i.imgur.com/01YGSRq.png 2 be specific
[07:05:00] <thaostra> Even the most trivial updates will require a restart, and often times it'll force the user to restart even at the most inopportune moments. It'll also try to apply updates when a user wants to just shut down for the night, turning what should be a 10 second shutdown tops into a 5-10 minute process, which will only complicate things if you suddenly get low on battery. And sometimes an update will require another restart to apply a 
[07:05:00] <thaostra> second phase in the update process
[07:05:07] <princesssluttershy> I'm really hungry but there's nothing to eat D:
[07:05:28] <thaostra> Oh, and updates will sometimes fail, and they do happen, so you often need to re-apply those updates for them to go through
[07:05:56] <thaostra> Believe me, updates are easier than they were before, but they're anything but simple as a process
[07:06:23] * Flame sighs
[07:06:26] <Squirrelly> Anybody find anything on that clopfic?
[07:06:35] <Squirrelly> I couldn't find it anywhere
[07:06:42] <RubyPinch> "and often times it'll force the user to restart even at the most inopportune moments" it gives you over 4 hours to get ready. and half the complaints are just because your settings are poorly set up, you should really fix your computers

[07:09:03] <RubyPinch> if its timing is a problem, there has always been an option to fix that, since windows update was added to windows
[07:09:08] <Flame> ...this is taking forever :|
[07:09:09] <thaostra> "half the complaints are just because your settings are poorly set up, you should really fix your computers" <- Then it's no longer a simple press-button-to-update. If users need to reconfigure the update settings that came with their OS, then it's not exactly simple now is it
[07:10:22] <RubyPinch> considering it shows the options pretty dang clearly in plain english, and advertises the fact each time one updates
[07:10:29] <Flame> lolz it takes over a minute to stop an installation XD
[07:10:32] <plushie_pegasus> [foal, futa]  http://i.imgur.com/myC72ue.png

[07:25:51] <Quinn> the movie finished
[07:26:13] <Quinn> and they invited me to the couch they were on for cuddles
[07:26:21] <Quinn> I'm sitting in between them
[07:26:31] <Flame> :o
[07:26:46] <Quinn> for context, one of them is bi, the other girl is lesbian

[07:27:15] <Quinn> the lesbian girl takes her girlfriends hand and puts it on my crotch jokingly and they both have a giggling fit
[07:27:20] <Quinn> and uh

[07:30:12] <Flame> hehe school girls <3
[07:30:13] <Flame> lol
[07:30:39] <Quinn> and the bi one unzipped me and started blowing me while her gf was kinda touching herself
[07:30:49] <Squirrelly> O.O
[07:30:57] * Squirrelly nods
[07:30:59] <Quinn> I wasn't really prepared for any of it so  I came within a minute which was kind of embarassing

[07:31:27] <Squirrelly> That's super cute, tbh
[07:31:36] <Quinn> it was pretty embarassing
[07:31:46] <Quinn> but then I moved on to return the favor 
[07:31:49] <Squirrelly> Not cumming early in general, but in that situation it's adorable
[07:31:57] <Flame> Squirrelly: agreed :$
[07:32:16] <Quinn> and while I'm eating her out she's playing with her girlfriend
[07:32:48] * princesssluttershy sits in her lonely virgin corner
[07:32:55] <Quinn> I didn't have any condoms and it was getting late, so we did that along with touching and stuff and then they went home :x

[07:33:04] <Quinn> I don't even
[07:33:04] * Flame joins princesssluttershy *
[07:33:20] <Flame> Quinn: lucky
[07:33:27] <Squirrelly> That's...awesome
[07:33:49] <Quinn> it would have been better if I hadn't come so fast :/
[07:33:53] * Squirrelly would definitely let Quinn cum inside, because birth control is awesome
[07:34:16] <Squirrelly> You just gotta be careful you don't hit it lol
[07:34:18] <Quinn> they don't have any need for birth control obviously, so PiV was off the table
[07:34:26] <Squirrelly> Yeah
[07:34:47] <Quinn> they didn't really strike me as the type who'd want to do that sort of thing
[07:34:49] <Quinn> but it happened
[07:34:53] <Quinn> so I guess I was wrong
[07:34:54] <Squirrelly> Well
[07:34:58] * Vulpixbrew notes dudes don' really need birth control but condoms are still kinda needed
[07:34:59] <Squirrelly> Sounds fun
[07:35:12] <Squirrelly> Well yeah, for safety
[07:35:25] <Squirrelly> But if you've both been tested, I think it's fine
[07:35:34] <Quinn> that wasn't too much of an issue, we trust each other for that stuff
[07:35:43] <Quinn> it's just I can't really go and get her pregnant 
[07:35:46] <Quinn> :x
[07:35:50] <Squirrelly> Yeah..

[07:36:04] <Vulpixbrew> yep

[07:36:15] <Quinn> It happened out of nowhere and I doubt it'll happen again, so it's a non issue anyway
[07:36:18] <Flame> fate-induced abstinence XD LMAOROTFLOL...
[07:36:26] <Squirrelly> Lol
[07:36:45] <Quinn> well, if you feel any better, if you'd been in this situation you'd still be a virgin
[07:36:48] * Squirrelly pats Flame on the head
[07:37:19] <princesssluttershy> If I was in the situation I would have dropped spaghetti everywhere and gone to the bathroom for an hour :/
[07:37:22] <thaostra> Legend has it that if you reach the age of 30 and still a virgin, you become a wizard
[07:37:43] <Quinn> I don't want to mess up their relationship so I'm gonna steer clear of anything in the future, however
[07:37:56] <Quinn> I would have probably said no if given the time to think about it, but it was just all in the moment

[07:39:02] <Quinn> but damn eating someone out really is tiring
[07:39:03] <thaostra> He was born 30
[07:39:05] <Quinn> blowjobs are easier

[07:39:17] <Flame> Quinn: I wouldn't know o.o
[07:39:47] <Quinn> it's like... there's more effort on your part vs a blowjob
[07:40:11] <Quinn> still just as satisfying to give though, I think
[07:40:25] <Quinn> maybe less, because she didn't cum

[08:18:25] <princesssluttershy> the portal 2 speedrun is also really broken
[08:18:39] <Katniss> Maybe because I loved it so much as a kid and the fascination just stuck with me

[08:24:20] <Katniss> Why don't we just hook up a million ps4's together and make a supercomputer

[08:24:49] <Vulpixbrew> with ps3s?
[08:24:56] <princesssluttershy> 20fps at 800p is so cinematic it doesn't even matter if the game is only 4 hours long

[08:28:13] <Flame> Vulpixbrew: IIRC the USAF did that with a cluster of PS3s that all ran Linux and used it for simulation or number-crunching...

[22:26:20] <iamalion> talking to two college girls trying to get their internet working
[22:26:39] <iamalion> after getting everything done and scheduling a tech, went over my stuff and said goodbye and muted myself
[22:26:52] <iamalion> normally the ustomers hang up so i dont ever bother, but this time they didnt and i heard them talking in the background
[22:26:53] <Squirrelly> lol
[22:27:02] <iamalion> and one of them was like "he sounds pretty savvy"
[22:27:10] <iamalion> and the other girl was like "I know!"

[22:51:05] <Frosty> Any good game for the 3DS?
[22:51:20] <Squirrelly> Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate
[22:51:23] <Squirrelly> Any of the pokemon games
[22:51:28] <Squirrelly> Fire Emblem Awakening
[22:51:34] <podner> Fire Emblem Awakening, Pokemon X, Y, and ORAS, Monster Hunter, Animal Crossing: New Leaf, 
[22:51:35] <Squirrelly> Super Smash Bros
[22:51:48] <iamalion> ^
[22:52:02] <Squirrelly> I didn't like animal crossing, because I'd already played the crap out of the first one
[22:52:04] <podner> Professor Layton x Phoenix Wright
[22:52:07] <Squirrelly> well, the first DS one
[22:54:29] <podner> Super Mario 3D Land is quite good. Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Bravely Default I've heard good things about, The Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask remakes are good...
[22:55:22] <Squirrelly> ^
[22:56:04] <Frosty> Eh. I think I'll sleep on it a bit more.
[22:56:43] <Squirrelly> Get Fire Emblem
[22:56:46] <Squirrelly> Or pokemon
[22:56:50] <Squirrelly> then monster hunter
[22:56:52] <Squirrelly> Then I dunno
[22:57:02] <iamalion> meow
[22:57:25] <Frosty> If I got anything it'd be the red star bundle
[22:57:35] <iamalion> meow.
[22:57:37] <podner> I haven't heard anything about Kirby Triple Deluxe, but it looks fun
[22:59:15] <Squirrelly> Oh it is
[22:59:17] <Squirrelly> It's awesome
[22:59:32] <podner> I haven't played a Kirby game since Crystal Shards
[23:00:39] <Frosty> My favorite was CS.
[23:01:00] <podner> The power combination ability was the best
[23:02:40] <Squirrelly> yeah
[23:02:45] <Squirrelly> They need to bring that back
[23:03:09] <podner> yes.

[23:12:47] <Frosty> I want a Lightning love pillow, but I don't want to buy one. Because that's a bit too depressing for me.
