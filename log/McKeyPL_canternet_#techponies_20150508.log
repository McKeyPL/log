[16:44:43] <Nelly> :(
[16:45:07] * Nelly would hug a RazorSharpFang but doesn't want to bleed.
[16:45:16] <RazorSharpFang> I need a method of comparing two sets of numbers to evaluate the effectiveness of a piece of software.
[16:45:28] <Nelly> Excell?
[16:45:46] <Nelly> Google document spreadsheets?
[16:45:51] <RazorSharpFang> I don't know which functions to use. It's not as simple as that.
[16:45:58] <Nelly> Uh...
[16:46:01] <RazorSharpFang> i need to test for significance of the difference.
[16:46:28] <Nelly> You can't just manually crunch the numbers? O3O
[16:46:41] <RazorSharpFang> It's not as simple as finding the means of the two sets of data.

[19:30:53] <firestream>     5¢/Text Canada/US -wide
[19:30:53] <firestream>     25¢/Text Global Texting
[19:30:53] <firestream>     5¢/MB Data
[19:31:14] <RazorSharpFang> 5cent, not 0.05cent
[19:31:24] <RazorSharpFang> That's what I was talking about.
