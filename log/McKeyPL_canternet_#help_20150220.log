[15:00:02] <Moonlightning> Funkar_: A lack of preparedness on your part does not constitute an emergency on our part.
[15:00:10] <Moonlightning> Cool the highlights, geez.
[15:00:24] <Moonlightning> IRC help channels tend to be VERY SLOW. Get used to it.
[15:00:49] <Moonlightning> As for your question, I'm not even going to bother to answer it, beacuse it's answered in the topic.
[15:00:52] <Moonlightning> Get used to reading those, too.
[15:01:00] <Moonlightning> Y'know, after you join and /before/ you post anything.
