[05:03:33] <Moonlightning> O.o
[05:03:40] <Moonlightning> Is it just me, or is YouTube's DNS all derpy?
[05:04:11] <Moonlightning> …it's just me. Never mind.
[05:24:55] <firestream> made a ts3 server with over 400 slots any room i should make befor i post info ?
[05:25:56] <Moonlightning> Anypony know if I can make dnsmasq use multiple search domains?
[05:27:16] <JustAberrant> probably
[05:27:42] <Moonlightning> s/if I can/how to/
[05:28:13] * JustAberrant can not provide any answer to that question :(
[05:28:43] <JustAberrant> are we talking dhcp?
[05:29:05] <Moonlightning> No, just DNS.
[05:29:13] <Moonlightning> I figure it's better to do this server-side
[05:29:34] <Moonlightning> I'm running a DNS server just for my VPN
[05:30:03] <Moonlightning> And I want unqualified names to resolve to addresses on the VPN
[05:30:06] <JustAberrant> you probably need to use bind to do that I'd think
[05:30:15] <Moonlightning> As opposed to dnsmasq?
[05:30:23] <JustAberrant> mmhmm
[05:30:40] <Moonlightning> welp
[05:30:44] <cyborg_ar> /etc/hosts
[05:30:47] <cyborg_ar> :3
[05:30:48] <JustAberrant> you can definitely specify multiple forwarders for bind
[05:30:56] <Moonlightning> Yeahhh, but then I have to go
[05:31:14] <Moonlightning> 172.17.1.3   rainbow-dash.vpn.blackl.net rainbow-dash rainbow.vpn.blackl.net rainbow
[05:31:32] <Moonlightning> 172.17.1.4   derpy-hooves.vpn.blackl.net derpy-hooves derpy.vpn.blackl.net derpy
[05:31:37] <Moonlightning> It's annoying. :p
[05:31:46] <Moonlightning> I was actually thinking of writing a proper zonefile >.>
[05:32:14] <Moonlightning> But it seems dnsmasq can't serve from a zonefile? I don't see any options for it, anyway.
[05:32:22] <Moonlightning> So, yeah, maybe should get a different DNS daemon.
[05:32:37] <JustAberrant> dnsmasq is meant to be simple for when you are doing simple stuff
[05:32:47] <Moonlightning> I thought this was fairly simple…
[05:32:51] <JustAberrant> an alternative to using a real daemon
[05:33:03] <Moonlightning> well, time to graduate to a real daemon, I guess :p
[05:33:16] <JustAberrant> can always ask on freenode

[05:36:11] <Datguy> So I bought a VPS for $6 a year and I don't know what to do with it. 
[05:36:17] <Datguy> Any suggestions?
[05:37:02] <Moonlightning> O.o
[05:37:08] <Moonlightning> What are you getting for $6/year?
[05:37:30] <Webster> Run a telnet honeypot.
[05:37:51] <Googie> Hehehe, VPS prices certainly have dropped over the years.
[05:38:05] <Datguy> I kinda bought it as a joke, because I already have a much better vps at digitalocean that runs everything else
[05:38:35] <Datguy> CloudAtCost. I had serious issues with their Ubunutu image, but for whatever reason Centos works great
[05:38:52] <firestream> i pay 3.00 a month for mine
[05:38:57] <firestream> that is whatm y TS server is on
[05:38:57] <Sol> And here I thought that $6/MO classified as a budget VPS
[05:39:12] <Datguy> The VPS does have a dedicated 100Mbps connection so thats a plus
[05:39:19] <Googie> That's high end for some people Sol :P
[05:39:31] <Datguy> Yeah this was $6 a year haha :P
[05:39:33] <Googie> LowEndBox won't list offers at over $7 a month
[05:39:35] <Sol> Also, firestream, you can't run a 400 slot TS off of that I'm sure :P
[05:39:44] <JustAberrant> you can get a VPS pretty cheap if you don't need single thread performance or stability
[05:39:58] <Datguy> This provider also sells boxes for a one time fee which I've never seen before
[05:40:34] <Moonlightning> $3.75/month here, yearly
[05:40:43] <Sol> I wouldn't trust a $6/mo VPS for anything production I cared about
[05:40:46] * JustAberrant pays $80 a month for his linode :(
[05:40:51] <Datguy> Sol, oh im not
[05:40:55] <Sol> :3
[05:41:02] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it's rock solid and has very good single thread performance
[05:41:13] <Sol> Datguy, I said /mo
[05:41:23] <Moonlightning> A gig of RAM, twenty of storage, four SI terabytes a month of Internet usage
[05:41:25] <Datguy> and JustAberrant I spend that much on an internet connection to leave my own physical server at a datacenter :P
[05:41:48] <Moonlightning> It works great for what I use it for
[05:42:16] <Datguy> 64GB ram 4 cores and then 20TB storage and unlimited bandwidth :)
[05:42:21] <Googie> Linode are still the go to for rock solid performance/connectivity I think, but the lower end market is getting way better.
[05:42:24] <JustAberrant> I'm moving to a house in june in a fibre service area.. so I'll be able to run a decent server from home :D
[05:42:44] <Datguy> but shelling out the money to purchase the machine definitely hurt
[05:42:51] <JustAberrant> so I plan to move all my non-critical stuff to that, and probably downgrade my linode to one of the cheap plans for running stuff like email that I care about
[05:43:12] <Googie> I pay that much for a nice dedi :P
[05:43:14] <Moonlightning> My host is /kind/ of like that
[05:43:21] <Sol> I tend to trust NFO when I need a VPS that doesn't suck
[05:43:23] <Moonlightning> They do $5 a month as a baseline
[05:43:28] <Googie> Though, the DC is a little bit eeeh
[05:43:38] <Moonlightning> And if you want more specs, you pay a one-time fee (usually spread out over the months)
[05:43:40] <Datguy> My city just got selected for Google Fiber and now all the ISPs are trying to get their infrastructure together after neglecting it since 2006
[05:43:49] <Datguy> Im ready for the gigabit options :)
[05:43:53] <Moonlightning> but unlike cell service providers, once you've paid it off, your monthly bill drops back down to $5
[05:43:54] <JustAberrant> hehe
[05:44:01] <Sol> But have had my share of budget VPSs, usually meh results, but I expected that :P
[05:44:03] <Moonlightning> And you get to keep the higher specs
[05:44:09] <Googie> (A Xeon E3-1230v3, 24GB ram, 1GBPS, 240GB SSD)
[05:44:59] <Datguy> I was looking at getting a Hetzner dedi, but then i read that they just take your machine off the network if you get too much traffic
[05:45:02] <Datguy> can't have that
[05:45:18] <Datguy> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6577465
[05:45:21] <PinkiePieBot> [ How to destroy someone who hosts stuff at Hetzner dedicated server | Hacker News ]
[05:45:24] <Googie> That's what a lot of companies do if you don't have DDoS mitigation.
[05:45:34] <Moonlightning> If /they/ don't have DDoS mitigation, you mean.
[05:45:49] <Googie> Either or.
[05:45:53] <Moonlightning> That's not something that would make a difference to the provider if you did it at the machine level.
[05:45:53] <Datguy> But you have to wait days for a human to re-add it
[05:45:56] <Googie> You can run it as a tunnel from a third party.
[05:46:11] <Moonlightning> That requires you to never ever /ever/ leak the real address.
[05:46:12] <Sol> What's that cheap dedi host a lot of people get for game servers...OVH. That one.
[05:46:21] <Datguy> And cloudflare is an amazing tool
[05:46:23] <Googie> Which can be done if you're careful.
[05:46:23] <Moonlightning> And hope that no one scans the Internet and finds you
[05:46:45] <Googie> Just... you have to be careful.
[05:46:50] <Moonlightning> /very/ careful.
[05:47:08] <Datguy> Cloudflare +  Authenticated Origin Pulls = perfection
[05:47:18] <Datguy> Too bad I can't use them because of websockets
[05:47:21] <Googie> With one of my boxes that always uses a VPN, the VM itself doesn't have any direct connectivity, the host tunnels it all.
[05:47:38] <Googie> The VM doesn't know what it's public address is :P
[05:47:45] <Datguy> Neat
[05:48:09] <Moonlightning> its *
[05:48:11] <Moonlightning> That's a good solution.
[05:48:33] <Googie> Whoops. I still have a terrible habit of its vs it's
[05:48:39] <Googie> I thought I'd beaten it, but I guess not.
[05:49:14] <Moonlightning> The author of this anthology always mixes up /it's/ and /its/
[05:49:17] <Moonlightning> And…grrrrrr
[05:49:25] <Moonlightning> It's kinda frustrating.
[05:49:51] <Datguy> Just don't let it bother you
[05:50:26] <Moonlightning> How you tell: the apostrophe is a wildcard.
[05:50:52] <Moonlightning> If it would make sense to use /it is/ or /it was/ or /it has/ or something, use /it's/. Else, use /its/.
[05:53:15] <Datguy> /its/ is possession. /it's/ is a contraction 
[05:54:09] <Moonlightning> possession, and also a pronoun.
[05:54:41] <Moonlightning> object|nonsentient pronoun
[05:54:54] <Googie> I know the theory, it's just too easy to let it slip out when focusing on typing quickly.
[05:55:04] <Googie> I imagine it's the same for a lot of people.
[05:55:30] <Moonlightning> I don't seem to hve that problem.
[05:55:38] <Googie> Though, considering people still use stuff like "u" as an individual word...
[05:55:51] <Moonlightning> But then, I type a lot and I seem to have a knack for remembering rules. :p
[05:56:07] <Datguy> I deal with end-users and their emails all day so it's kinda desensitized me to grammatical errors

[08:28:08] <Moonlightning> > *rndc* requires a configuration file, since all communication with the server is authenticated with digital signatures that rely on a shared secret, and there is no way to provide that secret other than with a configuration file.
[08:28:29] <Moonlightning> and you're supposed to use this instead of sending signals to `bind`??
[08:31:02] <AppleDash> sure?
[08:33:18] <tiwake> yeah thats kinda dumb facebook is holding off on linux support when the steambox is coming out closeish to the same time

[08:35:09] <Googie> I'm a little bit disappointed in their support for Linux and OSX. OSVR does support the DK2 though, and probably eventually the CV1.

[08:36:50] <Moonlightning> > In routine operation, signals should not be used to control the nameserver; *rndc* should be used instead.
[08:37:34] <Googie> OSVR is a hardware independent VR API.
[08:37:46] <tiwake> oh ok
[08:38:17] <tiwake> is it some sort of interface for the game engines?
[08:41:21] <tiwake> or whatever program

[21:47:18] <Moonlightning> Okay, I'm a little confused.
[21:47:40] <Moonlightning> >> /etc/bind/db.empty
[21:47:43] <Moonlightning> > @       IN      NS      localhost.
[21:48:20] <Moonlightning> That would tell the clients that the authoritative nameserver for the current zone is `localhost`, right?
[21:51:24] *** [A]McKey is now known as McKey
[21:51:31] <Moonlightning> That hardly makes sense…if this is in place in order to return proper responses to misconfigured clients…wouldn't it just break the client further?
[21:51:39] <Moonlightning> Assuming the client isn't running a DNS server.
[21:53:22] <AppleDash> Why would it break the client further?
[21:54:52] <Moonlightning> The client would try to query itself for the IP of `localhost`.
[21:55:34] <Moonlightning> And would fail, because at this point we've established that the client doesn't have that record for `localhost` anywhere (else why would it have queried a higher DNS server in the first place?)
[21:55:42] <JustAberrant> any client that is that broken is probably best left to its own devices
[21:55:56] <Moonlightning> Heh.
[21:56:04] <Moonlightning> And I guess that would reduce load on this server?

[22:01:52] <Moonlightning> I think the convention of writing hostnames least-significant portion first was a mistake.
