[03:25:45] <Quinn> hi
[03:25:57] <Quinn> I got a job finally
[03:26:27] <cloppyhooves> Doing what? :o
[03:26:47] <Vulpixbrew> sweeet a job
[03:27:20] <Quinn> yknow those cards that you can put your information on when you're at a booth or something, and then they start sending you emails?
[03:27:43] <Quinn> I'm the guy that takes all those notecards and transfers the info to an excel doc and then checks to see if they all  are spelled right
[03:27:57] <Quinn> it's boring as hell but it pays better than flipping burgers or something
[03:28:00] <cloppyhooves> c:
[03:28:26] <Quinn> I'm running out of savings and this house is big so the electricity bill is kinda high
[03:28:34] <Quinn> now it's not as much of an issue
[03:29:55] <Quinn> so yay
[03:29:56] <cloppyhooves> That's good!
[03:30:21] <Quinn> I have my own little cubicle area thingy
[03:30:28] <Quinn> kinda surprised
[03:30:35] <Vulpixbrew> cool
[03:30:58] <Quinn> I've been just non stop applying to stuff for the past month and received nothing until now
[03:31:14] <Quinn> I was hoping for a computer science related job, but I never finished college so I guess I shouldn't be surprised 
[03:31:27] <cloppyhooves> It's not too late c:
[03:32:11] <Quinn> I'm still paying for the year and a half I took, I don't know if  I can afford to try again
[03:32:48] <cloppyhooves> I'm sure there's lots of free code-teaching places that you can look at c:
[03:33:05] <cloppyhooves> I don't know of any, but maybe the computer scientists of the chat do c:
[03:33:22] <Quinn> I mean, I already have a ton of programming knowledge
[03:33:27] <Quinn> but no degree + no experience = no job
[03:34:58] <Quinn> the plan was to be a stay-at-home mom, but obviously that's never happening
[03:35:01] <Quinn> so gotta improvise
[03:35:06] <cloppyhooves> Nah, you don't really need a degree
[03:35:20] <cloppyhooves> But you can work on personal projects
[03:35:25] <cloppyhooves> Build up a portfolio c:
[03:35:36] <Quinn> yea maybe
[03:35:56] <cloppyhooves> c:
[03:35:58] <Quinn> I've done stuff but all personal things that aren't worth putting on a portfolio 
[03:36:14] <Vulpixbrew> every bit helps I think
[03:36:19] <cloppyhooves> Then ask other computer scientists for advice for portfolio-worthy projects c:
[03:36:31] <weisey> Actually CS is one of the jobs you really don't need a degree for if you have a good folio
[03:36:37] <Quinn> hm
[03:36:42] <weisey> Like, at all
[03:37:08] <weisey> I've seen kids with portfolios beat out CS masters
[03:37:12] <weisey> For jobs
[03:37:48] <Quinn> hm
[03:37:53] <Quinn> I don't really know where to start
[03:38:01] <Quinn> most of my experience is with Java and C# in Unity3D
[03:38:11] <cloppyhooves> I think there are a lot of CS people on reddit
[03:38:15] <cloppyhooves> Try asking there c:
[03:38:35] <weisey> Start by making a small project goal
[03:38:56] <weisey> Don't try to do it in a linear education fashion
[03:39:14] <weisey> Its largely learn as you go
[03:40:18] <weisey> Learn you a Haskell for great good is also a good book for haskell
[03:40:47] <Rylee> why would you learn haskell if you want a job :-P

[06:16:03] <Quinn> their dicks don't go that far forward
[06:16:16] <Quinn> weird cause mine is almost at that degree normally, it never lies against my stomach

[06:18:36] <Katiepony> It's a nice pic, though o:
[06:19:20] <Quinn> yea
[06:19:25] <Quinn> but apparently it would hurt most guys
[06:20:34] <Quinn> I'm actually super self conscious about that, it just kinda sticks straight in the air D: 
[06:20:52] <Quinn> well, it's pointed a little bit towards me, but mostly up
[06:21:14] <RNGsus> So wait
[06:21:23] <RNGsus> Im having a hard time picturing this
[06:21:41] <RNGsus> If 180 is your head and 0 is your toes, what degree does your dick stand at
[06:22:10] <Quinn> like 110
[06:22:21] <Quinn> when laying down
[06:22:36] <RNGsus> So whats the problem, what do you think is normal
[06:23:06] <Quinn> from what i understand it should be something like 160
[06:23:07] <weisey> I can do that position, but they have to be rocking back and forth on me, I can't thrust that way

[06:24:48] <RNGsus> You shouldn't be self conscious about it though, imo it doesn't really matter

[08:21:06] <Quinn> only awkward after when you're cleaning up
[08:21:13] <Quinn> but that faded pretty fast
[08:21:14] <Squirrelly> You need a REALLY big shower for it to not be awkward, in my experience
[08:21:17] <Quinn> we used to do it often
[08:21:23] <EbonMane> Enclosed space, not particularly comfortable, impossible to get warm water on both people at once
[08:21:30] <Squirrelly> Yup
[08:21:34] <Quinn> yea our shower is hilariously big, it's a waste of space not to use it for such reasons
