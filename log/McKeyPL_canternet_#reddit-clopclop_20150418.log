[03:25:27] <Drago> I never liked math. AP calc was a nightmare, especially at 7am
[03:25:32] <Puddles> Not sure what the problem is Drago. They're upset because they like you? 
[03:25:57] <Puddles> Or they're just kind of emotionally flailing on you and it's a lot to take in?
[03:26:32] <Puddles> I hate to say it, but I deal with that all the time and pretty much unless I know what to say
[03:26:35] <Puddles> I just listen
[03:27:10] <Puddles> but that's mostly 'cause I feel like I might make them feel worse if I say something stupid
[03:28:14] <Puddles> Though sometimes people just need an ear, too.
[03:28:16] <Drago> Pretty much the first. I didn't say anything rude or anything, an ERP just didn't work out great...but it wasn't bad. I guess it's because I am not reciprocating 
[03:29:39] <Puddles> Well, don't feel too bad.
[03:29:45] <Puddles> You're not trying to be a dick.
[03:29:55] <Puddles> If it's not working out for you, it's still in their best interests to split.
[03:30:06] <Puddles> Cause it's not fair to them for you to continue if you're not in it.
[03:30:14] <Drago> Been wanting me to be a pet for as long as I can remember making a pet character. I pretty much just said I'm not really into the fact that you have like 20 pets listed in your profile, yet say you can't have another master because that breaks the bond. I said it's kinda the same way the other way around.
[03:30:22] <Puddles> So you're making the best decision
[03:30:59] <Puddles> I could see people having more than one pet
[03:31:11] <Puddles> But that's a bit excessive.
[03:31:32] <Puddles> I'm glad you stuck up for yourself and for what makes you happy.
[03:31:47] <Drago> Then says he feels like he has wasted his time blah blah blah, so I said fine, sorry. he *nuzzled* and I didn't do anything, then he made his status do not disturb: thinking of quitting doing pet play (or something like that)
[03:32:16] <Puddles> :l
[03:32:18] <Puddles> sounds like a jerk.
[03:32:36] <Puddles> I don't tell people they're a waste of my time because they didn't want to date fuck or w/e with me.
[03:32:48] <Drago> Yeah, that pissed me off.
[03:33:17] <Puddles> Don't worry about feeling bad for people whom you weren't a priority for more than a means to an end.
[03:33:26] <Puddles> he saw you as a thing, an accessory. 
[03:33:27] <Drago> Pretty much why I am trying to decide whether or not to say anything. He is generally nice, but this is just odd.

[03:39:05] <Puddles> to role play is to pretend you're something you're not

[05:22:04] <thaostra> That part was like really early in DBZ, before Freeza
[05:22:11] <Frosty> Yep.
[05:22:53] <thaostra> Actually, you may enjoy DBZ abridged, which gives a compressed version of the show with lots of comedy thrown in

[06:20:13] <Flame> :( can't get into programming
[06:20:32] <Flame> perhaps I'm in the wrong major...I really don't know...
[06:20:52] <expatriate> how long have you been doing it?
[06:21:45] <Flame> Background: I've taken Java A & B, Assembly (this semester), and the intro to programming. I have trouble self-teaching, as I am not good at it and have little motivation. I've programmed for FRC (first robotics competition) in java for ~3 years.
[06:21:49] <Flame> nothing complicated, but still.
[06:22:52] <expatriate> and you haven't ever liked it? or is it just hard to motivate sometimes?
[06:23:29] <Flame> Here's the situation: I am good when given a task, and need to do something. Especially when given examples. But on my own? With my own "imagination"? Nothing.
[06:23:29] * expatriate is a programmer
[06:23:46] <Flame> I've enjoyed it.
[06:24:34] * Algido loves everyone here <3
[06:24:48] <expatriate> hm
[06:25:09] <expatriate> well at a job you certainly wouldn't have to worry about coming up with your own projects
[06:25:30] <iam[a]lion> meow
[06:25:32] <iam[a]lion> i am bachg
[06:25:32] <expatriate> but everyone I know at work does things on the side just because they enjoy it
[06:26:04] <expatriate> and the senior people who are really fucking good didn't get that way just from going to work, they got it from playing with new things because that's what excites them
[06:27:12] <Flame> :( yeah
[06:27:16] <expatriate> so I dunno what to tell you
[06:27:26] <expatriate> personally I don't really believe the "everyone has their passion" thing
[06:27:37] <expatriate> some people just have to find something to pay the bills
[06:27:43] <expatriate> and programming is a fantastic option for that
[06:27:47] <Flame> that's what I'm really...idk...I feel guilty that I've so far went down the road for a cs degree without really having a "passion" for it
[06:28:45] <expatriate> do you have any idea what else you might like more?
[06:29:36] <Flame> idk
[06:30:34] <expatriate> I guess my recommendation would be stick with it for now but also try other things
[06:30:54] <expatriate> if you find out your passion is interpretive dance, you're going to need a real job anyway
[06:31:57] <Frosty> Huh. All Titanfalls mpas are now Free forever. Shame I already bought two of them,
[06:32:05] <expatriate> but if you try game design, for example, your programming skills will be a help and it's a more reasonable transition

[19:40:16] <Frosty> Bah, I'm so pissed now.
[19:40:46] <Princesssluttershy> Why? D:
[19:42:13] <Frosty> So my bike pedal broke, right? well, it ripped out all of the threads. No biggy, I'm a machinist. I have tools to fix this. Except I don't. For whatever reason, the threads are left-handed. I have left-handed taps. Oay, cool. I don't have the right size with the correct TPI. Shit. Oay, helicoil? No left-handed helicoils. That's not a thing we have in the shop.
[19:43:13] <Frosty> So no, I have to order a new crank arm. Normally, I would be too butt hurt over this, but he bie cost me $300. For $300, I expect better QA from a producr.
[19:44:06] <Princesssluttershy> That sucks D:
[19:44:44] <Frosty> I know. That's whay I'm pissed.
[19:45:11] <weisey> 300$ bike?
