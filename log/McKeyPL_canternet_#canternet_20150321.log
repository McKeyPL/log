[21:55:12] <Raiden_Sparklephone> Why is it whenever I join anything, it dies? Not having the greatest of times recently.
[21:55:35] <Colgate> what?
[21:57:01] *** Joins: Zuzu (zuzu@is.robo.licious)
[21:57:31] <Raiden_Sparklephone> Just seems like it. Whenever I am in a place or have logged in, everything dies until I provoke conversation. Even then there is little going on when I do get conversation.
[21:57:46] <Pony_1> hi
[21:57:46] <Twili> I read in a book once that said hi is there anyone here?
[21:57:53] <Pony_1> any cute tranny here
[21:58:08] <Raiden_Sparklephone> Hi _1
[21:58:31] <Pony_1> hi Raiden_Sparklephone 
[21:58:38] <Pony_1> u tranny?

[21:59:58] <Pony_1> i'm a guy btw
[21:59:59] <Raiden_Sparklephone> Nope, why you even asking that straight up, unless you are trying to troll.
[22:00:30] <Pony_1> because i want to find a tranny 
[22:00:41] <Pony_1> why is it wrong or something
[22:01:29] <Colgate> Pony_1: not really something to ask in a PG channel
[22:01:42] <Raiden_Sparklephone> Its best to get to know people, and q, its just that it seems odd that you haven't even got a name, just a guest name.
[22:01:55] <Raiden_Sparklephone> And as Colgate has said, not in PG
