[17:23:35] *** Quits: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[17:24:21] <TheFlutterGuy> noobs
[17:24:50] <StarStream> this is interesting 
[17:24:51] <TheFlutterGuy> also her horn is wider
[17:24:53] <StarStream> so there is resistance 
[17:27:25] <TheFlutterGuy> butt animation changed
[17:27:39] <StarStream> so delicate... 
[17:27:50] <TheFlutterGuy> I think the general flash animation quality went down
[17:28:58] *** Joins: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning)
[17:29:12] <TheFlutterGuy> that looked wrong in my mind
[17:29:17] <StarStream> wth 
[17:29:27] <TheFlutterGuy> cm removing
[17:29:39] <StarStream> thats lame 
[17:30:13] <StarStream> so round 2 
[17:30:26] * Electron sits in shock
[17:30:26] <StarStream> somehow it feel weird
[17:30:59] * TheFlutterGuy pet pet's Electron 
[17:31:10] <ShadowPony> ITS A TRAP!!
[17:32:01] * ShadowPony pokes TheFlutterGuy
[17:32:10] * TheFlutterGuy giggles
[17:32:14] <StarStream> tbh i kind of wonder how come they didnt retaliate 
[17:32:17] <StarStream> other than twilight only 
[17:32:24] <StarStream> its like not enough time 
[17:34:16] <TheFlutterGuy> fluttershy doesnt get the twitter
[17:34:28] <TheFlutterGuy> welcome to the club
[17:34:40] <StarStream> yea
[17:34:50] <StarStream> so hynotism and propaganda
[17:35:15] <TheFlutterGuy> a bit like in my kindergarten
[17:36:07] <StarStream> huh
[17:36:15] <StarStream> awww pinkie no more skill 
[17:37:57] <Electron> Fluttershy, save us
[17:38:29] <StarStream> so its kindness trial 
[17:38:39] <StarStream> the trial of kindness 
[17:39:10] <TheFlutterGuy> how bad is equestrian government to allow to this?
[17:39:12] <TheFlutterGuy> like
[17:39:19] <ShadowPony> XD
[17:39:27] <TheFlutterGuy> Nopony who goes into this ever come back
[17:39:32] <ShadowPony> this is like a movie
[17:39:33] <TheFlutterGuy> so maybe
[17:39:41] <TheFlutterGuy> just maybe something is wrong there
[17:40:04] <TheFlutterGuy> what? the army they sended never came back so they just erased the town from map
[17:40:09] <TheFlutterGuy> who does that
[17:40:22] <TheFlutterGuy> its like with silent hill
[17:40:25] <StarStream> yea 
[17:41:05] <Electron> it's pure policy in the episodes
[17:41:15] <Electron> dark stinky policy in its form
[17:41:58] <TheFlutterGuy> so they are like a fix it party now
[17:42:01] <StarStream> yea 
[17:42:06] <TheFlutterGuy> They are going to visit places now
[17:42:10] <StarStream> the equation 
[17:42:11] <StarStream> yea 
[17:42:17] <TheFlutterGuy> barely any action in ponyville
[17:42:19] <StarStream> so that means possibly a griffin country visit 
[17:42:29] <TheFlutterGuy> just clearing the celestias governmental mess
[17:42:38] <TheFlutterGuy> most likely
[17:43:55] <StarStream> so pinkie become sane
