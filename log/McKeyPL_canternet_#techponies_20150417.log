[06:28:06] * Phase4 wouldn't be surprised if australia still does, burried in some law somewhere
[06:28:07] <Kinsley> It's just that unless the circumstances were so dire as to be a direct threat to the nation, e.g. invasion, no politician would ever call for a draft.
[06:28:17] <JustAberrant> oh
[06:28:47] <Kinsley> So the Selective Service requirement basically amounts to "have proof or you can't do things like attend university"

[23:30:30] <Phase4> AppleDash, i may need some help
[23:30:49] <AppleDash> Phase4: Go on
[23:31:04] <Phase4> i may or may not have lost my linking book home
[23:32:36] <Phase4> nevermind, found it
[23:32:40] <Phase4> apparently it teleported away from me
[23:33:22] <AppleDash> lol
[23:34:17] <Phase4> found it in a random place quite far from where i used it
[23:34:25] <Phase4> AppleDash, do you have a mining age set up?
[23:34:46] <AppleDash> I don't think so, Lapsus was going to make one that we were going to share
[23:35:18] <Phase4> just made two random ages and they're both unsuitable for mining
[23:35:30] <Lapsus> gta5 happened so I'll be stuck on that for a while
[23:35:30] <Phase4> https://i.imgur.com/lc8nGQY.jpg first was this and i'm disapointed it had debufs
[23:35:55] <Lapsus> I can totally make a proper digger if AppleDash will turn off decay on it :v
[23:36:07] <AppleDash> I will
[23:36:23] <Lapsus> might take me a while to get all the pages I'll need though
[23:36:24] <AppleDash> Once you are not busy playing game I want to play but can't afford and all the cracks are shit or viruses or both
