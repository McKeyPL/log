[05:10:20] <Fallfeathers> Guys I have a job interview with Cisco on Tuesday, quiz me on my networking knowledge. :v
[05:10:57] <Starthunder> That's quite vague.
[05:11:06] <Fallfeathers> I am expecting everything.
[05:11:49] <JustAberrant> hmm
[05:11:50] * Starthunder sits on her haunches next to Fallfeathers.
[05:12:22] <JustAberrant> what is RARP ?
[05:12:32] *** Neptune|sleep is now known as Neptune
[05:12:42] <JustAberrant> and how much RARP should you have as part of a well balanced diet?
[05:13:07] <Fallfeathers> JustAberrant, reverse address resolution protocol
[05:13:39] <Fallfeathers> and it's not used anymore, so the answer is none
[05:14:17] <JustAberrant> what is the main difference then between BOOTP and RARP
[05:14:18] <Starthunder> Is there something that supercedes RARP?
[05:14:24] <JustAberrant> and why has BOOTP replaced RARP?
[05:14:48] <JustAberrant> oh, and... uh.. what replaced RARP ;p
[05:15:32] <Fallfeathers> JustAberrant: BOOTP is part of DHCP, it's basically used to request an IP address from the network server
[05:15:40] * Starthunder (boops Baron_Von_Clop.)
[05:15:48] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: that doesn't answer the question ;p
[05:15:54] <Fallfeathers> I don't think anyone replaced RARP
[05:16:48] <Fallfeathers> RARP relies on the local machine's MAC address for address assignment, BOOTP doesn't. uhm.
[05:16:49] <Fallfeathers> I think
[05:18:13] <Fallfeathers> there's probably other differences but I can't recall off the top of my head
[05:20:13] <Fallfeathers> I got it wrong didn't I :V
[05:20:20] <JustAberrant> nah
[05:20:29] <JustAberrant> I was off getting more wine
[05:20:37] <Fallfeathers> you mean silently judging me
[05:20:39] <Starthunder> (When I said /supersede/, I didn't mean /replace and provide only that functionality/—a protocol can be superseded by a second protocol that does more than the first did.)
[05:20:42] * Fallfeathers hyperventilates
[05:20:53] <Fallfeathers> Starburn, it goes RARP > BOOTP > DHCP
[05:21:10] <Fallfeathers> but BOOTP is still used by the initial requests in DHCP
[05:21:11] <cyborg_ar> Fallfeathers: all routers in a rack are down, what do you do?
[05:21:17] <Fallfeathers> cyborg_ar, kill myself
[05:21:23] <Starthunder> I dunno abotu this stuff…but Wikipedia says RARP was superseded by BOOTP and DHCP. AFAIK they're all distinct protocols.
[05:21:25] * JustAberrant doesn't know enough about networking to know what an interview for a networking gig or a gig with cisco would be like
[05:21:45] <Fallfeathers> i'd just commit seppuku in front of the  rack
[05:21:50] <cyborg_ar> Fallfeathers: you cheer them up
[05:21:51] <Fallfeathers> the janitors wouldd find my body eventually
[05:21:56] <cyborg_ar> hahah
[05:21:57] * Starthunder plays a rimshot.
[05:22:12] <Starthunder> Fallfeathers: quick! Reboot the ventilation system!
[05:22:18] <cyborg_ar> haha
[05:22:27] <JustAberrant> for programmers though, I generally focus on whether they actually know what all the various acronyms/terms actually mean.. so I tend to ask a lot of "what does that actually mean" type questions
[05:22:28] <Starthunder> You're gonna start hallucinating!
[05:22:42] * cyborg_ar performs CPR via RPC
[05:22:51] <JustAberrant> but if CCN* is any indication, they'll probably want to know what type of rock is used for polishing fibre or something
[05:23:09] <cyborg_ar> hahaha
[05:23:49] <Fallfeathers> well, I don't know a lick of programming :B
[05:24:00] <Starthunder> :O
[05:24:06] <JustAberrant> so I assume then it's a networking job with cisco?
[05:24:10] <Fallfeathers> yeeesss
[05:24:12] <JustAberrant> and not like a dev job .. 
[05:24:23] <Starthunder> …I feel like ponies going into this field should know the basics of at least a couple languages.
[05:24:28] <Starthunder> Am I right? >.>
[05:24:36] <Starthunder> I mean, counting shell scripting
[05:24:38] <Fallfeathers> essentially i'd be the guy who goes to clients and says "okay, this is what you need to do the thing you want to do"
[05:24:40] <JustAberrant> networking.. nah
[05:24:40] <cyborg_ar> i know someone who workes at a HP NOC for american airlines, a botched firmware upgrade to a cisco router caused 400 million dollars in losses due to downtime
[05:24:51] <cyborg_ar> or was it pesos
[05:24:53] <cyborg_ar> anyway
[05:24:54] <Fallfeathers> cyborg_ar: rip
[05:24:55] <cyborg_ar> haha
[05:24:58] *** Gigabit is now known as Gigaway
[05:25:13] <Fallfeathers> Starthunder: trust me, my programming illiteracy is not from a lack of trying :x
[05:25:23] <Fallfeathers> like the most complex i can get is.. batch scripting
[05:25:23] <JustAberrant> sysadmin maybe, but yeah, networking I don't think requires any kind of programming background
[05:25:48] <cyborg_ar> yeah
[05:25:53] <JustAberrant> though I'd say programmers should know a decent bit of networking
[05:26:05] <cyborg_ar> if anything they probably should know a bit more about hardware than programming
[05:26:11] <JustAberrant> because almost everything we do now involves a network at some point.. for reasons
[05:26:17] <cyborg_ar> things like signal integrity
[05:26:23] <JustAberrant> ^ what cyborg_ar said
[05:26:25] <cyborg_ar> and why cables have ratings
[05:26:27] <Fallfeathers> well yeah you need to know networking to write networked programs right :v
[05:26:42] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: you'd be amazed :>
[05:26:47] <cyborg_ar> why you need to terminate cables in certain ways
[05:26:50] <Fallfeathers> i am, every day
[05:27:02] <Fallfeathers> by how little i know :B
[05:27:06] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: a lot of people I work with have absolutely no idea what happens after they do  someCommsFramework.sendSomething(...)
[05:27:09] <JustAberrant> like.. none
[05:27:21] <Fallfeathers> JustAberrant, neither do I
[05:27:40] <cyborg_ar> :) they produce gigabytes of traffic
[05:27:42] <JustAberrant> well yeah, but your not writing software that runs on a networked distributed system :>
[05:28:02] <Fallfeathers> I might be eventually
[05:28:07] <cyborg_ar> what do you mean data doesnt get to the other side instantly?
[05:28:26] <cyborg_ar> hahaha
[05:28:58] <JustAberrant> :>
[05:29:58] <cyborg_ar> what? it also doesnt get there in one piece?
[05:30:27] <cyborg_ar> what do you mean TCP only guarantees data will get there in order "eventually"?
[05:30:30] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: which OSI layer do you relate the most to and why?
[05:31:06] <Fallfeathers> JustAberrant: probably application because it's always on top~
[05:31:08] <Starthunder> I…don't understand how anypony could get an IT job (besides helpdesk|user-support or something) without knowing at least the basics of this kind of thing
[05:31:21] <Fallfeathers> basics of what
[05:31:21] * Starthunder leans into Fallfeathers and ohmaiiis
[05:31:39] <Starthunder> Erm…oh, nothing important…only //how the freaking Internet works// :p
[05:31:44] <Fallfeathers> oh
[05:31:51] <Fallfeathers> everyone knows it's magical packet fairies
[05:32:05] <JustAberrant> well, in fairness almost all of it is abstracted away
[05:32:17] <JustAberrant> just about every dev shop wraps their networking stuff
[05:32:25] <Fallfeathers> also the more I work in IT the more I understand how conceivably fuckin' vast technology is so it's forgiveable that some people don't know what something does
[05:32:41] <JustAberrant> and junior guys starting out are going to be working on top of that
[05:33:07] <JustAberrant> I forgive people for not knowing stuff, because what Fallfeathers said
[05:33:17] <JustAberrant> though a lack of willingness to dive in annoys me
[05:33:23] <Fallfeathers> yeah, I had the grace of living in a country with free university
[05:33:25] <Starthunder> Yeah, but…even if you go in not knowing, shouldn't you learn fairly quickly?
[05:33:50] <JustAberrant> should, sure
[05:34:00] <JustAberrant> but not everyone gets to be a rockstart
[05:34:07] <JustAberrant> * rockstar
[05:34:08] <Fallfeathers> Starthunder: i've met people who have worked in the IT industry for a decade who don't know things I consider 'basic'. it's feasible that they've just never needed to know something to do their particular area
[05:34:29] <Starthunder> huh.
[05:34:31] <Fallfeathers> and you know, people keep telling me I shouldn't be working in IT unless I know how to  program, so
[05:34:33] <Fallfeathers> :p
[05:35:02] <JustAberrant> meh, end of the day it's a job.. if you can actually do the specific job you are paid for, you can get by

[05:35:13] <JustAberrant> everything else is just career growth
[05:35:40] <Fallfeathers> (i spent a good year at uni trying to learn to program... even had a dedicated tutor for a few months. no progress.)
[05:35:52] <JustAberrant> if you've got a job keeping some network running.. not knowing programming isn't gonna hurt

[05:36:34] <JustAberrant> having extra skills is nice because it makes you more flexible and opens up more opportunities

[05:37:07] <Fallfeathers> I'm trying to move to the US before the Australian economy crashes
[05:37:15] <JustAberrant> but not everyone dabbles outside of work or has an interest outside of their job.. lots of people find their rut and stick with it, and I don't think there's much wrong with that
[05:37:38] <cyborg_ar> i think basic notions of how signals travel down the tubes is gonna help more than knowing programming
[05:37:59] <Fallfeathers> JustAberrant: i'd like to learn to program, don't get me wrong... just like, I've pretty much given up hope of "getting it"
[05:38:12] <cyborg_ar> basic things, like knowing that routers need mains power to work
[05:38:15] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: dunno if they'll do it, but troubleshooting excersizes are an interview technique I like.. and would seem pretty applicable to networking
[05:38:21] <Fallfeathers> even node-based editors are daunting  for me
[05:38:26] <JustAberrant> Fallfeathers: like.. given scenario X, where do you start
[05:38:30] <Fallfeathers> yeah
[05:39:06] <JustAberrant> no one on the 3'rd floor seems to be able to reach the SAP portal.. productivity is sky rocketting, but the bosses are pissed.. 
[05:39:09] <JustAberrant> what do?
[05:39:14] <Fallfeathers> rofl
[05:39:29] <cyborg_ar> step 1: have you tried turning it off and on again?
[05:39:31] <cyborg_ar> step 2: is it really plugged in?
[05:39:33] <cyborg_ar> step 3: ????
[05:39:35] <cyborg_ar> step 4: PROFIT!

[09:10:32] * nscoots is unsure what itanium refers to
[09:10:57] <JustAberrant> the processor I assume
[09:11:02] <Phase4> nscoots, intels non-x86 server processor
[09:11:11] <JustAberrant> spoiler: it flopped
[09:11:13] <Phase4> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium
[09:11:14] <PinkiePieBot> [ Itanium - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[09:11:39] <nscoots> oic
[09:11:47] *** Gigaway is now known as Gigabit
[09:12:25] <nscoots> I was running card based intels around 2003 but they were the earliest P3's :P
[09:14:03] <JustAberrant> itanium isn't that old
[09:14:32] <nscoots> that wikipedia page argued for mid 2001-present
[09:14:39] <nscoots> so some of it might be?
[09:14:45] <Phase4> nscoots, iirc the intent was instruction-level parallelism 
[09:15:01] <JustAberrant> well.. it doesn't feel that old :(
[09:15:01] <nscoots> oOoOo
[09:15:14] <Phase4> but it turns out that 1: writing compilers to do this is rather hard
[09:15:25] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (Bluepon@Pony-up5.b6a.250.69.IP) (Quit: Oops, a kernel panic)
[09:15:33] <Phase4> 2: a lot of tasks don't parallelize much better at the compiler level
[09:16:00] * nscoots cleans off a chair in the old corner for JustAberrant
[09:16:13] <nscoots> (tis a rocker and it comes with a glass of lemonade)
[09:16:18] <JustAberrant> hmm, I thought it was a lot newer then this
[09:16:21] <JustAberrant> :(
[09:16:33] <JustAberrant> well, at least HP was talking about it within the last few years :(
[09:16:34] * nscoots pouts hoping somepony would finally join her
[09:16:46] <Phase4> i think microsoft is dropping support for itanium
[09:16:47] <JustAberrant> :>
[09:17:52] <JustAberrant> random: I feel like I should start watching season 5 :>
[09:18:20] <cyborg_ar> itanic lol
[09:18:28] <nscoots> so will that be the end phase4?
[09:18:47] <nscoots> seems sad
[09:18:59] <nscoots> lasted this long still has gentoo...
[09:19:05] <Phase4> it'll limp on for a while, there's a marketfor unix-ish stuff running on itanium
[09:19:18] <Googie> Debian 8 just killed off Itanium support
[09:19:56] * JustAberrant assumes because of systemd.. somehow
[09:19:59] <nscoots> I would not be displeased to see x86 die if improvements can be made...
[09:20:31] <Phase4> it's unlikely
[09:20:47] <Googie> JustAberrant: Nah, it's just... nobody cared about the platform.
[09:20:55] <Phase4> x86 has multiple implementations, afaik no other serious architecture does
[09:21:17] <JustAberrant> sounds to me like debian isn't respecting users freedom of choice :(
[09:21:19] <Googie> Plenty of new ARM ISAs
[09:21:37] <Phase4> ARM cores are licensed though
[09:21:42] <JustAberrant> also I should go to bed :(
[09:21:43] <Googie> Kinda.
[09:21:55] <Googie> You can license the core, or the right to make your own
[09:22:01] <Phase4> one implementation, multiple manufacturers
[09:22:13] <Googie> So it is actually different implementations
[09:22:31] <Phase4> kinda, but it's derived from the one codebase
[09:23:19] <Googie> Well, it's hard to say without access to the design
[09:23:56] <Googie> There's certainly a ton of competition in the ARM space though
[09:24:54] <nscoots> so one could try to place the blame for itanium's failure on AMD?
[09:25:17] * Googie blinks.
[09:25:30] <nscoots> as they didn't offer  a similar arch
[09:25:49] <Googie> They couldn't though.
[09:26:03] <nscoots> and instead released the opteron
[09:26:21] <Googie> From what I can see, Itanium simply died because of it being too complex and unwieldy.
[09:26:36] * nscoots did enjoy having an opteron
[09:26:42] <Googie> No benefits + lacking backwards compatibility when there's a huge x86 market growing rapidly...
[09:27:52] <nscoots> well didn't it have huge benefits prior to x86-64 being about?
[09:28:35] <Googie> Not really. 64 bit isn't /strictly/ better.
[09:29:12] * nscoots likes her memory leaks large
[09:30:04] <Googie> x86 /does/ have support for a larger memory space, PAE
[09:32:11] <Googie> Been around ages, but most people (at least in the consumer space) never used it.
[09:32:23] <nscoots> ic
[09:32:24] <Googie> On Windows, driver support for it was lacking.
[09:32:35] <Googie> (Since every driver had to be PAE aware)
[09:34:51] *** Q0 is now known as Q0|Away
[09:42:13] * Lapsus joins nscoots in the corner for rocking and lemonade.
[09:42:22] <nscoots> yay
[09:43:42] * nscoots offers some oatmeal cookies to lapsus
[09:45:58] <Phase4> Googie, that and it's explicitly disabled outside of windows server
[09:46:23] <Phase4> but that's a less relevant restriction now x64 is so common
[09:46:25] <Googie> Yeah, but that's the reason given for why it was disabled.
[09:49:25] <Googie> Supposedly XP shipped with PAE enabled by default, but I'm trying to find a source for that

[20:17:31] <PinkiePieBot> I'm not here to wipe up any tears, OK?

[20:18:15] <AppleDash> lol
[20:18:54] <johnsey> :<
[20:18:57] <johnsey> :[
[20:19:16] <johnsey> :{
[20:19:19] <mniip> johnsey, what do
[20:20:42] <johnsey> trying to elicit a response 
[20:21:26] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-bfp.0d7.20.67.IP)
[20:21:37] <johnsey> Starthunder: you can't get it to work?
[20:21:39] <JustAberrant> unless it's changed, there's literally an if statement in PinkiePieBot that's like..  if (sender == "JustAberrant") sendSomethingMean();  ;p
[20:21:56] <mniip> johnsey, I loaded r8169 with RTL8169_DEBUG, set the loglevel to debug
[20:22:04] <mniip> no new information in dmesg
[20:22:19] <Starthunder> johnsey: got the environment variables set up, `use-agent` in the config, there's a `pinentry` installed (though I can't test it 'cos I have absolutely no idea how it works)…
[20:22:35] <johnsey> mniip: looks like whatever is causing the problem isn't covered by the debugging output
[20:22:46] <mniip> oh really
[20:22:49] <Starthunder> johnsey: there's an instance running…but when I try to decrypt a file, `gpg` hangs for a few seconds, then goes 'gpg: problem with the agent - disabling agent use'
[20:23:05] <johnsey> mniip: nothing like stating the obvious!
[20:23:12] <johnsey> mniip: i'd try to trace it back manually then
[20:23:55] * JustAberrant gives that a try...
[20:24:11] <mniip> johnsey, the issue is that I can't exactly reproduce it
[20:24:40] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: you should try to isolate where the problem is actually occurring, attempt to identify the root cause of that issue, then make whatever configuration changes are required to fix it
[20:24:40] <mniip> also there is a weird pattern in the times of the disconnect, which makes me thing it's some sort of outside attack
[20:24:43] <mniip> intended or not
[20:24:47] <mniip> think*
[20:24:49] <johnsey> Starthunder: it's running with --daemon?
[20:25:10] <Starthunder> Yeah, it is.
[20:25:24] <JustAberrant> also.. mniip 's mirror is back up :D
[20:25:27] * JustAberrant quickly grabs stuff
[20:26:00] <mniip> JustAberrant, I played KSP with a friend all night :| only noticed the downtime 4 hours after
[20:26:18] * JustAberrant was worried ;p
[20:26:23] <JustAberrant> (seriously)
[20:26:29] <JustAberrant> I haven't watched any of season 5 yet
[20:26:42] <JustAberrant> so I figured you'd taken it offline
[20:26:46] <johnsey> mniip: if you think that's the case and the problem is reoccuring, you could record interface traffic and review it later
[20:27:03] <mniip> JustAberrant, spoiler: there are events occuring in the episodes
[20:27:13] <mniip> johnsey, but that's gigabytes of data
[20:27:32] <JustAberrant> (not because I hadn't watched season 5.. but because I haven't visited the mirror in like.. months.. so I didn't know it was up recently ;p
[20:28:19] <JustAberrant> GB of pcap data is no problem ;p
[20:28:39] <JustAberrant> (all seriousness, wireshark will choke on it, but tshark (their command line dealie) has no problems 
[20:28:58] <JustAberrant> you can also use splitcap and friends to chop it up into nice manageable pieces once you find an interesting window
[20:29:08] <mniip> JustAberrant, how's 90 GB sound
[20:29:18] <JustAberrant> shouldn't be an issue
[20:29:33] <JustAberrant> assuming you have somewhere to store it and enough IO bandwidth
[20:29:39] <Starthunder> Oh, I figured out what's going on. It's a pinentry issue.
[20:29:44] <mniip> yeah I just checked the IO bandwidth
[20:29:53] <johnsey> mniip: while I haven't tried it out personally yet, I can recommend https://www.bro.org/community/time-machine.html based on knowing some people behind it
[20:29:53] <PinkiePieBot> [ Time Machine ]
[20:30:19] * JustAberrant actually has a lot of experience dealing with huge tcpdump captures .. in the several hundred GB range.. but we also have a really damn fast storage array for those data captures
[20:30:54] <JustAberrant> at work I have what can best be described as a spaghetti plate of perl scripts I use to wrap tshark and do various things
[20:31:26] <mniip> there's also the chance that it's a hardware problem
[20:31:27] <JustAberrant> (tcpreplay is also nifty) ;p
[20:31:41] <johnsey> yeah that's always a possibility
[20:31:45] <mniip> hmm
[20:32:06] <mniip> I could hook the traffic at the router
[20:32:26] <mniip> but I don't have anywhere to send it to, other than through the server's nic
[20:33:01] <mniip> hmm, my laptop maybe
[20:33:22] <Starthunder> So, from a fresh system, if I try to decrypt a file and then hit control-c when I get the prompt, the terminal is left in this weird state, and if I kill the window, `pinentry` gets backgrounded and starts eating up processing power, probably in some kind of busy-wait loop.
[20:33:58] <Starthunder> And then future decryption attempts do the whole problem-with-the-agent thing
[20:34:00] <mniip> Starburn, while(size -= read()) probably
[20:34:08] <johnsey> in any case, a ring buffer is probably what you want, and maybe something to stop recording after the messages is detected in /proc/kmsg
[20:34:39] <Starburn> o-o
[20:34:56] <mniip> oops
[20:34:57] <mniip> Starthunder, *
[20:35:12] <Starthunder> Yeah, probably.
[20:35:19] <Starthunder> …wait, what? There's no fixed size.
[20:35:45] <Starthunder> Anyway, there's an update, I'm gonna install it and see if anything changes.
[20:35:48] *** Quits: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning) (Quit: The Nightmares will collide. And become a dream. <3)
[20:41:53] <Starthunder> On an unrelated note. If I have a v6 address block, is it possible to sort of redirect one address to another dynamically, so I can e.g. connect to my laptop even if it's not actually there?
[20:42:37] *** Joins: MistVeil (aqua@Pony-qbk.jpi.211.189.IP)
[20:45:19] <firestream> i'm not sure
[20:45:23] <firestream> i don't have a ipv6 yet
[20:46:46] <Starthunder> Probably not really…I can't make the route propagate out so that packets get sent directly to wherever it happens to be
[20:47:22] <Starthunder> I could probably just have my router redirect packets, but then my home connection becomes a bottleneck
[21:03:59] <JustAberrant> <mniip> JustAberrant, spoiler: there are events occuring in the episodes
[21:04:14] <JustAberrant> I actually get the impression that something big and/or weird happened in the last one
[21:04:23] <JustAberrant> cause various places I hang out are freaking out about consistency
[21:04:29] <AppleDash> Starthunder: use NAT
[21:04:30] <AppleDash> lol
[21:05:00] <Starthunder> Yeah, no thanks.
[21:05:24] <Starthunder> So there /is/ a use for a v6 VPN, and it is to keep the same addresses :P
[21:05:25] * JustAberrant plans on using ipv6 nat in 10 years when we actually transition over in a serious way
[21:05:37] <JustAberrant> just to piss off all the ipv6-ers :D
[21:05:59] <JustAberrant> you may give me a /64 .. but I'm still gonna use one address.. muahahahahaa :D
[21:07:55] * Starthunder goes the opposite way, is sad she can't really do anything with her /56
[21:08:40] <AppleDash> Starthunder: Just assign a static address?
[21:09:46] <Starthunder> AppleDash: but the Internet will still route packets addressed to the address in my home network…to my home network.
[21:09:58] <AppleDash> And?
[21:10:08] <Starthunder> That takes me back to square one.
[21:10:12] <Starthunder> Are you paying attention?
[21:10:43] <AppleDash> nope
[21:10:55] <mniip> JustAberrant, I'd say the consistency is more broken in E01 than in E05
[21:11:10] <JustAberrant> well, I'll find out shortly I guess..

[21:13:01] <Colgate> does it use infinite memory?
[21:13:14] <Lapsus> I must go on an Aberrant hunt
[21:13:14] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: It shouldn't be
[21:13:32] <AppleDash> I don't know why it is
[21:13:33] <AppleDash> Oh
[21:13:34] <Lapsus> I also need to get around to fancying up the nether highways

[21:13:47] <AppleDash> I'll fix it later JustAberrant :P

[21:22:36] <Starthunder> I wrote a Morse codec /specifically/ for times like these!
[21:22:57] <Starthunder> …wait a sec, that has no pauses in it. It can't be valid Morse O.o
[21:23:26] <Colgate> Starthunder: welcome to me 5 minutes ago >.>
[21:23:29] <Webster> Maybe one letter is a dot, one is a dash, and the other is a space?
[21:23:48] <cyborg_ar> it's just a really long prosign
[21:24:40] <cyborg_ar> :3
[21:25:28] <Starthunder> That's an insane prosign >.>
[21:26:56] <cyborg_ar> it's the british new emergency signal
[21:27:05] <cyborg_ar> since sos would be easily confused
[21:27:18] <cyborg_ar> in line with the deprecation of 999
[21:29:53] <Starthunder> In favor of what?

[21:33:58] <cyborg_ar> the phone companies should get into the joke and route that number to 999
[21:36:24] <AppleDash> Yes
[21:36:48] <cyborg_ar> provided their systems can cope with that many digits
[21:36:50] <cyborg_ar> lol
[21:38:46] <cyborg_ar> my full phone number (for international calling) is only 14 digits, counting the double 0 for international dialing
[21:39:00] <cyborg_ar> dont think there are numbers much longer than that
[21:40:15] <cyborg_ar> aha
[21:40:48] <cyborg_ar> so the ITU normative for international phone exchange limits the number size to 15 characters
[21:41:55] <cyborg_ar> oh interesting, in the US, international dialout is 011, not 00
[21:42:08] <Starthunder> 0:118:999:881:99:9119:725:3
[21:42:22] <Starthunder> It fits so perfectly! o3o

[21:45:20] <cyborg_ar> Starthunder: what's that?
[21:45:33] <Starthunder> Oh, come on, you just linked it!
[21:47:18] <cyborg_ar> i mean the formatting
[21:48:04] <Starthunder> Oh. Just what seemed best.

[21:54:20] <Starthunder> The grouping in the song goes `0118 999 88199 9119 725  3`
[21:56:25] <Starthunder> The 88199 bit is too many digits, so I broke it into two
[21:57:23] <Starthunder> And you can't really have leading zeroes, /but,/ canonical addresses only use :: for the longest run of zero groups, and fill in single 0s for the rest
[21:57:28] <Starthunder> But only if there are at least two.
[21:58:17] <cyborg_ar> ahh that was my question
[21:58:26] <cyborg_ar> you were making an ipv6 address
[21:58:34] <cyborg_ar> it wasnt that difficult to answer that :3
[21:59:14] <Starthunder> So 2001:db8:0:4813::b70c and 2001:db8:0:4813:956d:e73d:ba54:0 are canonical
[21:59:20] <Starthunder> Oh.
[21:59:24] <Starthunder> Well.
[21:59:26] <AppleDash> Starthunder: You can have leading zeroes.
[21:59:31] <Starthunder> Yes, you CAN
[21:59:39] <AppleDash> At least in Canada, 011 is the prefix for dialing internationally
[21:59:43] <Starthunder> But I'm talking about the /canonical/ representation.
[22:00:51] *** McKey is now known as [A]McKey
[22:02:00] <Starthunder> Knowing v6, nothing in 0:118::/32 has been allocated yet.
[22:02:30] <Starthunder> They should totally just reserve the relevant /112 or something for shits and giggles
[22:05:19] <Starthunder> If you do no grouping at all and just convert it to hex, it fits perfectly in a /64 network, too :D
[22:05:26] <Starthunder> ::1083:b99f:34b5:9645
[22:05:44] <Starthunder> And it even has a 99 in there.
