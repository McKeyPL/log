[01:15:27] <iamalion> sec
[01:15:32] <Rylee> /version
[01:15:42] <iamalion> version charybdis-3.5.0-dev
[01:16:06] <Rylee> (I'm a network techgryphon over at PonyChat and am always looking for ways to improve our ircd, which is based on a fork of charybdis)
[01:16:08] <Rylee> thanks much
[01:17:03] <iamalion> mhm
[01:17:06] <iamalion> chary is good though
[01:17:09] <iamalion> never netsplits 
[01:17:24] <Rylee> it's certainly a feat of engineering
[01:17:32] <Rylee> just as long as you don't look at the insides without a welding mask on
[01:17:38] <Rylee> they may burn off your eyes otherwise
[01:17:51] <Rylee> not that inspircd is much better
[01:17:51] <iamalion> haha yeah its... interesting
[01:18:33] <Rylee> it is better just by virtue of being C++ and being logically separated into namespaces instead of 9 million globals, but there's only so far you can go with C languages sadly
[01:19:20] <iamalion> well we have been on p much all other ircds over the years
[01:19:26] <iamalion> chary is giving us the least trouble
[01:19:39] <iamalion> now if only ovh would stop going down that'd be greeeeaaat
[01:19:47] <Rylee> lol
