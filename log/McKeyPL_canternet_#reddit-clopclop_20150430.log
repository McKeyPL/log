[04:33:06] <Pony387_2> the goal is to space
[04:33:12] <Psi> ok, i imagined
[04:33:30] <Pony387_2> most of your time is spend blowing up rockets and going to space
[04:33:35] <Vulpixbrew> yep

[04:35:17] <Squirrelly> How is that goofy physics
[04:35:33] <Pony387_2> it's funny because the models don't bend dynamically so everything just falls apart like jenga as opposed to crushing together

[09:42:59] <Giggles> What need?
[09:42:59] <Pony387_314> My friend told me to watch a stephen lynch like movie called pi which had mostly nothing to do with pi it was more about spirals theta and like hebrew? or something? I dunno
[09:43:21] <Pony387_314> but then I looked up pi cause I never really bothered looking into further understanding about pi
[09:43:22] <Giggles> spirals and theta sound related to pi.
[09:43:38] <Pony387_314> Well it is but not directly I don't think

[09:44:43] <Giggles> Eh, maybe not directly
[09:44:52] <Pony387_314> But anyways now I'm freaking out cause like wtf even is pi anyways. I mean it's the part of the circumfrance of a circle but what wigs me out is like how is that kind of constant so damn specific.
[09:45:06] <Giggles> I think one could at least say theta is closely related to pi.
[09:45:19] <Pony387_314> it's just a circles diamter multiplied by 3 and some change
[09:45:28] <Pony387_314> but like holy shit that change
[09:45:45] <Giggles> Exactly, it's the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle.
[09:46:33] <Giggles> It seems fairly intuitive that there must be SOME number as such.
[09:47:04] <Flame> night!
[09:47:07] *** Quits: Flame (Taka-nii@Pony-dg9.49i.43.99.IP) (Quit: be back laterz)
[09:47:45] <Pony387_314> I mean consider this. If you multiply say 3 by 3.14 and then you multiply it by pi you get 9.42 from the first one and then 9.424.... for the second one. But if you do it with a bigger number like 200 you get 628 for the first one and then 628.313...
[09:48:50] <Pony387_314> In just 197 numbers the difference between the answers has gone from a 4 thousanths difference to a difference of more than 3 tenths
[09:50:32] <Pony387_314> But like say you had to figure out the circumference of the known universe you have to go through to 39 decimal points to get an accurate calculation of that circumfrance
[09:51:24] <Pony387_314> And we've been doing pi for so much and have gotten nearly what 3 trillion places down and we still can't see a pattern in how the constant works?
[09:51:34] <Pony387_314> That's a fucking anomoly
[09:51:45] <Pony387_314> There has to be something there
[09:51:54] <Pony387_314> there just has to be
[09:52:45] <cloppyhooves> I think there are mathematical proofs that there aren't
[09:53:08] <Pony387_314> That's fucking mind blowing to me
[09:54:30] <Pony387_314> The bigger the circle gets the more specific pi has to be in order to create an accurate calculation for circumfrance
[09:54:41] <Pony387_314> and yet it's still patternless

[09:59:15] <Giggles> There's actually more irrational numbers than there are rational ones
[09:59:34] <Pony387_314> yes but how many of those irrational numbers are mathematical constants?
[09:59:36] <Pony387_314> 3?
[09:59:50] <Giggles> Well, they're all numbers.
[09:59:59] <Giggles> So they are constant.
[10:00:16] <Giggles> there are named ones that I can think of.
[10:00:33] <Giggles> 3
[10:00:48] <Giggles> 3 named one, pi, phi and e. Might be others I just don't know.
[10:02:14] <Pony387_314> still though the whole idea of an irrational constant like that is just extraordinary to me
[10:02:42] <Giggles> irrational numbers are pretty weird, no doubt.
[10:03:30] <Giggles> It's even weirder that it turns out most numbers are irrational.
[10:03:58] <Pony387_314> that doesn't weird me out tho
[10:04:07] <Giggles> No, that's what gets me.
[10:04:37] <Giggles> I just see pi being irrational as, sort of just a thing. Like, it had to be some number, why not an irrational one?
[10:05:07] <Pony387_314> wait now I think I get what you're saying
[10:06:56] <Pony387_314> like something like 8/7 is an irrational number
[10:07:31] <Pony387_314> even though it's something that's just 8 and 7 it still comes up with whatever the fuck
[10:07:44] <Giggles> Nah, an irrational number is a number that can't be written as a fraction.
[10:08:05] <Giggles> It's a decimal number that you can never write as one thing divided by another.
[10:08:23] <Pony387_314> oh now I understand
[10:08:43] <Giggles> well, sorry, you can never write it as a rational number divided by a rational number.
[10:09:43] <Giggles> That's why they're all letters. They're sort of hard to grasp because you can never write them.
[10:09:49] <Pony387_314> if I'm not mistaken 1.999... is a rational number because there's a pattern right?
[10:10:38] <Giggles> Yes. also that's equal to the fraction 2/1.
[10:11:14] <RubyPinch> math is very context specific in some areas too
[10:11:51] <Giggles> Oh, my bad. The internet tells me that irrational numbers are defined as not being able to be written as an integer over an integer.
[10:12:10] <Giggles> not a rational over a rational.
[10:12:29] <Pony387_314> as I learn more and more about math it becomes more and more interesting to me
[10:12:34] <RubyPinch> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF
[10:12:35] <FineLine> [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ - ... ]
[10:12:50] <Pony387_314> just how numbers work with each other it's just like
[10:12:51] <Giggles> What's the highest math you've learned?
[10:12:53] <Pony387_314> there's so much
[10:13:12] <Pony387_314> highest math I learned was algebra 1 in highschool
[10:13:24] <Pony387_314> cause I got bullied a lot and droped out and got my ged
[10:13:32] <Giggles> Oh wow, ok.
[10:13:42] <Giggles> Yeah number theory is awesome.
[10:13:55] <Pony387_314> It's pretty fucking awesom
[10:14:06] * RubyPinch dives on cloppyhooves 
[10:14:12] <Giggles> I've always liked math a lot, but I really fell in love with it during calculus 2.
[10:14:30] <Pony387_314> I tried learning calculus but I hit my limits very early
[10:14:41] * Pony387_314 slaps knee
[10:14:42] <RubyPinch> (was that a pun)
[10:14:46] <RubyPinch> (gosh plssss)
[10:15:14] <Pony387_314> no but like the early lessons of calculus that I found were all about limits and it got boring to me so I ignored it
[10:15:49] * cloppyhooves snuggles up the RubyPinch 
[10:16:56] <Giggles> Yeah, you gotta love it. calc is very boring in a lot of ways, especially calc 1.
[10:17:19] <Pony387_314> yeah when I first learned about -1/12 I was so amazed
[10:18:06] <Pony387_314> tfw you get bored of videogames and turn to doing math in your free time instead
[10:19:54] <cloppyhooves> http://i.imgur.com/dDkAif2.jpg
[10:20:15] <Pony387_314> another interesting number I learned about recently is 3 minus the square root of 5
[10:21:24] <Giggles> wow, that's awesome Cloppy
[10:22:38] <Pony387_314> apparently a lot of people hesitate if you ask them if 0 is even
[10:24:03] <RubyPinch> my 0s are negative or positive
[10:26:01] <Giggles> It's not really intuitively obvious that 0 is even.
[10:27:06] <Giggles> like how it's not obvious that 1 isn't prime.
[10:27:32] <Pony387_314> I just figured since it was inbetween -1 and 1 it was even
[10:27:46] <Pony387_314> plus you can divide it by 2
[10:28:08] <Giggles> Yeah, most people would figure based on that pattern, but if you've never thought about it before you would pause for a moment to do so,
[10:28:22] <Pony387_314> oh

[19:50:42] <weisey> You're under no obligation to work when you walk out the door
[19:50:54] <weisey> So literally all your work happens from 9-5
[19:50:59] <Squirrelly> ^
[19:51:03] <Squirrelly> That's also really nice
[19:51:06] <weisey> Then the rest of your life happens after
[19:51:12] <Squirrelly> When I get home I know that my time is MINE
[19:51:17] <weisey> Exactly
[19:51:27] <cloppyhooves> But how do you stay focused in the moment?
[19:51:29] <Squirrelly> Which is why I'm so excited for tonight, because I think my sex toys might get here today :3
[19:51:32] <Squirrelly> Easy
[19:51:38] <weisey> It just happens
[19:51:39] <cloppyhooves> The only 9-5 thing, I spent a lot of time on reddit
[19:51:47] <weisey> You lose track of time
[19:51:48] <Squirrelly> Mountain dew and busy work and little stuff to distract myself
[19:51:55] <Squirrelly> Music helps
[19:52:05] <cloppyhooves> I do have problems focusing in other areas, so maybe it's just a general problem of mine
[19:52:11] <Squirrelly> I watch netflix in my free time at work
[19:52:22] <Squirrelly> Works, as long as nobody sees
[19:52:25] <Melon_Phone> I just focused on the objective as it must be finished
[19:52:30] <weisey> Its also not *constant* work
[19:52:32] <Melon_Phone> then again I was fired 
[19:52:33] <Squirrelly> Yeah same
[19:52:34] <weisey> Like
[19:52:48] <weisey> I'm at work right now

[20:09:25] <Pony_387_0> I'm trying to learn it but the logic side of my brain is pissed off at something and I need help understanding it if anyone is willing
[20:10:10] <Cantaloupe> ah then I'm of no use

[20:12:58] <Squirrelly> Cantaloupe!
[20:13:01] <Squirrelly> Also Calc is easy
[20:13:04] <Squirrelly> You draw a line
[20:13:09] <Squirrelly> calculate area
[20:13:21] <Squirrelly> then eventually spin it around an axis and calculate volume
[20:13:25] <Squirrelly> Fun stuff
[20:13:36] <Cantaloupe> wheee!
[20:13:42] <Squirrelly> It's been...what, 4 years since I did calc?
[20:14:15] <Cantaloupe> that's a long time 
[20:14:25] <Squirrelly> Figures, I did like 15 math classes and now I'm going in a major that requires pretty much ZERO math
[20:14:33] <Squirrelly> I took calc 1-3
[20:14:45] <Squirrelly> I had a bit of trouble with 2 but eh
[20:15:02] <Squirrelly> I prefer algebra

[20:16:39] <Squirrelly> I have a recipe for you
[20:16:43] <Cantaloupe> gimme 
[20:16:48] <Squirrelly> Do you like shrimp?
[20:16:53] <cloppyhooves> A lot of derivatives/integrals are based on formulas that you learn
[20:16:54] <Cantaloupe> yess
[20:17:03] <Squirrelly> Do you like things that are slightly-very spicy?
[20:17:12] <cloppyhooves> d/dx of x^n is n * x^n-1
[20:17:19] <Cantaloupe> I love spicy food
[20:17:24] <Squirrelly> Well then
[20:17:27] <Squirrelly> You're gonna love this
[20:17:28] <Squirrelly> Hang on
[20:17:36] <cloppyhooves> integral of x^n is x^(n+1) / (n+1)
[20:17:50] <cloppyhooves> It's kinda something that you learn and then get used to over practice
[20:17:58] <Pony_387_0> can I pm you pls?
[20:18:12] <cloppyhooves> I don't have a ton of time, but sure c:
[20:18:42] <Cantaloupe> because the x^2 kinda levels up
[20:20:02] <Cantaloupe> deriving x^2 gives you 2x.  now you make the x^2 the derivation 
[20:20:23] <Squirrelly> ^
[20:20:30] <Cantaloupe> so instead of lowering the number you bump it up by one

[20:21:05] <Cantaloupe> and think ok, since x is like one, 3 times what is 1? 
[20:21:20] <Cantaloupe> so it becomes 1/3 x ^3 
[20:21:31] <Cantaloupe> derive that and you get x^2
