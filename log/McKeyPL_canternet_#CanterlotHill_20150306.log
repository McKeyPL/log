[00:13:29] <Hamtramck> got letter from local tax auditors saying they're not crediting the 2% tax I paid to the city where I work because I didn't provide the documents they wanted.
[00:13:41] <Hamtramck> I sent them my w2s showing that I paid the tax what do they WANT
[00:14:14] <MikeM> That doesn't sound like any fun at all
[00:14:35] <MikeM> Can you go talk to them, or call them?
[00:14:53] <Hamtramck> I will tomorrow :T
[00:15:13] <Hamtramck> This is the difference between owing like 800ish in back taxes and 4000.
[00:15:39] <MikeM> Yipes!
[00:17:49] <Hamtramck> I even called and asked if the fax went through the next day
[00:17:52] <Hamtramck> and they said it did
[00:17:58] <ynoP> Those are some serious ramnifications
[00:20:03] <Hamtramck> I mean I used an online fax sendy thing that had a limit of 10 pages, and I might've sent a document with 11, which... would've either dropped the last page, which doesn't matter because that was just some blurk, or it would've sent nothing, in which case why'd they tell me they got the thing I faxed >:T

[03:15:10] <ynoP> It's kind of like if you took the cheese out of a cheese stick, wrapped it in pepperoni, applied pizza sauce, then wrapped it a thin dough sheet and then deep fried it.

[03:15:22] <BerryPunch> I'm okay with this. What's up with you Eywind?

[03:15:44] <BerryPunch> Is there any other time to have iced coffee?
[03:15:50] <Eywind> When it's -10 outside
[03:15:55] <BerryPunch> that works, too
[03:15:57] <Eywind> Any time above like 20 it's stupid to have it cold

[03:17:29] <Eywind> I hate time changes
[03:17:32] <BerryPunch> Me too
[03:17:32] <EM-C> I heard Timmy's in the well again.
[03:17:33] <Eywind> they don't matter anymore
[03:17:34] <Eywind> let's get rid of them
[03:18:30] <MikeM> What? And turn on the lights for the factory workers? Absurd.
[03:18:32] <thereallynewmop12100_> Remember 2 years ago? TOonami played Kickheart as the DST surprise 
[03:18:40] <EM-C> I hate daylight savings time with a passion.
[03:19:14] <EM-C> Stupidest idea in forever.
[03:19:14] <MikeM> Arizona does not participate.
[03:19:22] <EM-C> Because it's so hot there.
[03:19:33] <EM-C> Neither does Hawaii, because it's in the tropics.
[03:19:45] <EM-C> Used to part of Indiana didn't, but I think all of it does now.
[03:20:07] <StrykerVylon> DST hasnt been relevant for about 30-40 years
[03:20:11] <thereallynewmop12100_> Canada will participate for DST
[03:20:14] <EM-C> And some geniuses introduced a bill into the General Assembly last year to have Tennessee put on year round DST.
[03:20:29] <MikeM> That would be like having none at all.
[03:20:41] <EM-C> Fortunately it didn't happen, but I wasn't sure up until we were told to run the clocks back in November.
[03:21:13] <EM-C> No it wouldn't, MikeM.  The clock would still be one hour ahead of the sun.
[03:21:32] <EM-C> Now I'm aware that Standard Time isn't solar time, but it's closer to it than DST is.

[03:21:57] <EM-C> The whole point of DST is to *distort* solar time...to make it noon at 11am and midnight at 11pm.
[03:22:18] <EM-C> Everyone involved must die.
[03:22:29] <Eywind> KILL THEM ALL KEKEKEKEKE
[03:22:48] <EM-C> How come you can use all caps?  It tells me I can't use all caps.
