[14:06:30] <StarStream> good enough actually

[14:09:02] <JustKayneNL|School> why then
[14:09:06] <JustKayneNL|School> yea
[14:09:25] <Dusk> it's why apple's processors can still keep up with the modern quadcores in android phones
[14:09:34] <JustKayneNL|School> yes 
[14:09:46] <JustKayneNL|School> snapdragon should start making x86
[14:09:53] <JustKayneNL|School> or x64
[14:10:19] <Dusk> They won't for a while...at least another year
[14:10:29] <Dusk> Nvidia's beating them to the punch with their k1
[14:10:37] <JustKayneNL|School> yea ikr
[14:10:45] <JustKayneNL|School> or intell bbroadwell

[14:19:59] <StarStream> when it release ?
[14:20:01] *** Joins: Lunia (ellen@ChumPony.Enterprises)
[14:20:05] <Dusk> I have no need to update my GPUs though
[14:20:09] <StarStream> ok 
[14:20:20] <Dusk> 4 290xs is more than enough for 4k gaming
[14:20:27] <StarStream> what kind of job u have dusk which allow u to do that kind of setting 
[14:20:35] <Dusk> I was a nuclear engineer
[14:20:52] <Dusk> Still am technically, but I don't have a job at /this/ moment
[14:20:59] <StarStream> wow 
[14:21:07] <Dusk> I just got out of the navy
[14:21:15] <StarStream> which part of the nuclear engineer ?
[14:21:17] <Dusk> now I'm sorta wandering till I find a new job
[14:21:22] <StarStream> controlling the cooling ?
[14:21:41] <StarStream> who know what u might land 
[14:22:03] <Dusk> Reactors, and I worked on the mechanical side so yes. Ensuring that pumps worked and the boilers were in good shape with enough heat transfer to make sure our hot rock didn't melt through the container of water :p
[14:22:23] <StarStream> yikes
[14:22:25] <Dusk> I'm hoping to get on with a southern company and work at their power plants in the south
[14:22:43] <StarStream> is it dangerous to be that close to the reactor ?
[14:22:56] <StarStream> or u guys wear the radiation suit ?
[14:23:21] <Dusk> I mean...kinda? Standing on top of the shielded zone is a bit tingly and staticy
[14:23:29] <Dusk> "radiation suit"
[14:23:37] <Dusk> Do you mean the yellow anti contamination suits?
[14:23:42] <StarStream> yea
[14:23:50] <StarStream> i mean the hazmat suit 
[14:23:56] <Dusk> Those don't block anything...they just prevent stuff from getting /on/ your skin
[14:24:04] <Dusk> it doesn't block radiation any better than your clothing
[14:24:29] <StarStream> ah ok 
[14:25:19] <Dusk> And while being in the reactor compartment is cool and all (I've stood on top of my ship's reactor before, it's fun) it's rather boring in there unless you're doing primary maintenance
[14:25:39] <StarStream> oh 
[14:25:56] <Dusk> It's just really loud when we're running reactor coolant pumps :/
[14:26:27] <StarStream> poh
[14:26:28] <StarStream> oh*
[14:26:30] <Dusk> Those things are like...built to pump /anything/ from water to liquid metal, to sand
[14:26:49] <StarStream> well they are use for circulation 
[14:26:54] <Dusk> Sometimes
[14:27:01] <Dusk> Most of our modern reactors don't need pumps
[14:27:25] <Dusk> We only ever use em when we have the reactor shut down really
[14:27:30] <StarStream> ah 
[14:27:36] <StarStream> self sustainable ?
[14:27:55] <Dusk> It's thermodynamics in action, cold (relative) water likes to sink and hot (relative) water likes to rise
[14:28:04] <StarStream> ok 
[14:28:09] <StarStream> u ever visit CERN before ?
[14:28:28] <Dusk> No. I'd like to, but I'm no physicist
[14:28:49] <StarStream> ok
[14:28:50] <Dusk> I know how it works, but like you start feeding me 72 digits after the decimal point and I start freaking out
[14:29:11] <StarStream> ah 
[14:29:27] <StarStream> i think anyone tend to freak out once the number get to exorbitant amount 
[14:29:31] <StarStream> or super miniscule
[14:29:33] <Dusk> That's the difference between engineering and actual scientists
[14:29:40] <Dusk> Engineers make things work
[14:29:52] <Dusk> Scientists invent the theory engineers use
[14:30:16] <StarStream> fair enough 
[14:31:39] <Dusk> I spent enough time rebuilding a submarine to know that all those decimal points are worthless if in practice the system doesn't like it. (You have to keep in mind every machine is alive. If you don't they'll break. Every machine has it's own quirk. Even if it's the same make and model as the other thing you're looking at)
[14:33:25] <StarStream> yea
[14:33:29] <StarStream> i understand that 
[14:33:41] <StarStream> everything is living 
[14:33:48] <StarStream> u treat them badly they break easily
