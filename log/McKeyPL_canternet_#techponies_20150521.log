[00:08:58] <Phase> why wouldn't you
[00:12:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> nothing shoudl run XP anymore
[00:13:23] <Colgate> is embedded XP unsupported now? or did that finally end as well
[00:13:31] <Seoson> A most of our ATMs do^^

[00:14:48] <Colgate> what's the difference? o.O
[00:14:54] <Seoson> Ah* Also if you have a D-Link, Netgear, TP-Link or ZyXEL router that support USB over IP check for updates in the upcoming days.
[00:15:04] <Phase> ShivalPonyWolf, there's a tray sealer here that uses embedded xp for a ui, ~$50k of machine i think
[00:15:06] <Phase> maybe more
[00:15:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> Seoson: days
[00:15:09] <ShivalPonyWolf> you mean moths right
[00:15:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> good luck any of the vendors fixing the millions of affected devices in a short time
[00:15:27] <Phase> either way they're not gonna stop supporting it with any haste
[00:15:35] <Seoson> supports* Yeah probably
[00:16:03] <Colgate> as if running unsupported things has stopped anyone before :/
[00:16:23] * Colgate still has a win98 box at work :(
[00:16:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> Colgate: theres still a win 3.11 prod box at my work
[00:17:03] * Phase would recommend moving those to vm's at some point
[00:17:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> it runs a very special card that talks a really nasty custom protcol to manage a really obsolete system
[00:17:13] <Colgate> 3.1 received updates more recently than win98 iirc
[00:17:26] <Colgate> Phase: we can't... it requires a special isa card
[00:17:38] <Phase> i think we've had this conversation before

[00:17:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol yeah it sounds familliar
[00:18:01] <Colgate> gotta love legacy systems that just won't die
[00:18:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> yep
[00:18:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> i need to go on a walk around on soem of our old datacenter floors
[00:18:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> and just take photos of some of the really old kit

[00:19:38] *** Seoson is now known as Kim
[00:20:01] <Colgate> what's the difference between "end of support" and "end of license" on microsoft's eol page?
[00:20:11] <Kim> Did I mention that my company sticks with XP until the end of this year, maybe longer? And that critical parts of our infrastructure are based on software from the 80's ?
[00:20:13] <Colgate> https://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/product-lifecycles.aspx
[00:20:16] <Colgate> for reference
[00:20:37] *** Kim is now known as Seoson
[00:20:41] <Kinsley> I had to do a double take there.
[00:20:41] <Colgate> oh wait, nm, it says above it
[00:21:03] <Colgate> but my search failed because I searched for "end of license" and they used hyphens in the text above, zzz
[00:21:27] <Seoson> No Chat!Zilla please don't change my nickname without asking :P
[00:21:30] <Phase> Colgate, and yes, embedded xp != xp embedded
[00:21:45] <Phase> i don't remember the difference, but it's very important to some people
[00:21:56] <Colgate> bah, too many versions of the same thing
[00:22:40] <Phase> ones ce like and the other is kinda like an offical version of nlite
[00:24:18] <Colgate> also, the fact you have to log into a microsoft account to see sites on support.microsoft.com is annoying...
[00:24:39] <Phase> microsoft sites randomly force me to log in
[00:24:47] <Phase> no apparent reason for it, they just do
[00:25:05] <Phase> probably no one at microsoft checking they work without ms accounts
[00:25:59] <Colgate> I just use google's cached version of the page
[00:26:30] <Seoson> or change your user-agent to Googlebot :P
[00:29:04] <Colgate> true, should do that
[00:33:46] <frackster> ShivalPonyWolf: cameras are allowed in your dc? in ours any kind of camera or other recording device is expressly forbidden
[00:34:07] <frackster> and since the whole building is under surveillance they won't mind escorting violators out either :P

[00:40:18] <Seoson> One day that building of almost ancient technology will collapse on top of big companies and I will stand there and watch it burn warming my hands.

[01:42:43] <Webster> HexChat is broken for me. I use XChat on Linux or XChat-WDK for Windows.
[01:42:47] <Moonlightning> weechat > irssi
[01:42:54] <Moonlightning> Colgate uses weechat. Clearly best client.
[01:43:05] * JustAberrant admits it probably is.. but.. I'm so used to irssi
[01:43:12] <JustAberrant> and there's nothing weechat does that compels me to switch

[01:43:24] <Seoson> No it's Luna IRC - totally different thing xD
[01:43:30] <Moonlightning> Anyway, question, tech pones: how do I add a file to a specific directory inside a tape archive?
[01:43:32] *** Joins: Sellyme (quassel@Pony-vg0g36.0880.gi54.19f0.2001.IP)
[01:43:50] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: an actual tape archive, or a file you created with tar?
[01:44:07] <Moonlightning> A `tar` file.
[01:44:17] <JustAberrant> why the hell would you call that a tape archive ;p
[01:44:24] <Moonlightning> Because that's what it stands for?
[01:44:34] <Moonlightning> I'd say /tarball/, but it's not compressed.
[01:44:34] <JustAberrant> like, no one uses tar for actual tape now that I've heard of
[01:44:48] <Moonlightning> Then why wouldn't you assume it wasn't stored on a literal tape? :p
[01:44:50] <JustAberrant> tarball doesn't imply compression
[01:44:59] <JustAberrant> it implies grouping ;p
[01:45:34] <JustAberrant> and because it's such a weird way to refer to a tar file.. no one actually says out "tape archive" because no one has actually used it to write files to a tape since like the late 80s
[01:45:38] <Moonlightning> Tape archives always group.
[01:45:41] <Moonlightning> That's all they're good for.
[01:45:49] <Moonlightning> If you don't need grouping, you don't need tar.
[01:45:52] <JustAberrant> it's like if I said I was going to send you an electronic letter
[01:46:04] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: you can write a single file to a tape

[01:46:46] <Moonlightning> Do you know how, or :p
[01:46:47] <JustAberrant> anywya, just specify the path ;p
[01:47:58] <Moonlightning> I wanna specify the destination path in the archive, though.
[01:50:03] <JustAberrant> well now that's just silly
[01:50:34] <JustAberrant> but you probably need to use --transform
[01:51:18] <JustAberrant> also fun factoid, when you "override" a file in a tar.. you are actually adding another copy at the end
[01:51:22] <JustAberrant> and the last one will be used
[01:51:27] <JustAberrant> but the old one still stays there
