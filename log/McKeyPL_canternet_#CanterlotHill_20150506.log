[05:19:20] <One-Trick> 5 in 110 ponies know who richard simmons is
[05:19:21] <Starlight[EoH]> then there was this part where he led everyone into basically humping the ground

[05:21:08] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: Yeap
[05:21:29] <Eywind> I'm not quite sure anyone should be doing this other than ironically nowadays
[05:21:31] <One-Trick> richard simmons has taught me one this: dont get fat, then you never have to know who he is. this is my key to weight control
[05:21:36] <Eywind> given the quality workout videos you can get
[05:21:51] <MikeM> But he was live on tv

[05:22:12] <One-Trick> i played DDR on workout mode, that was a lot more fun

[05:25:52] <Eywind> false

[05:30:18] <Eywind> don't have to do the whole hour
[05:30:31] <Eywind> When I was working out I'd use the stationary bike half an hour and watch twitch
[05:30:48] <Eywind> and then play ye olde ddr pad for like 8 songs :P cuz I still have that and it's a good workout as OT was saying
[05:31:00] <One-Trick> i put in a Ministry album and ride my bike till it ends
[05:31:04] <Eywind> nice
[05:31:06] <MikeM> I bet. 8 songs sounds pretty good

[05:31:13] <Eywind> 8 is okay

[14:21:04] <Unixkitty> Best advice ever.
[14:21:21] * RandomNinja spends money on gloriousness
[14:21:23] <RandomNinja> yay
[14:22:00] <RandomNinja> also, 25 degrees inside and rising
[14:22:16] <RandomNinja> I knew this kilt was a good investment
[14:22:35] <Unixkitty> "Inside"?
[14:22:43] <RandomNinja> indoors
[14:22:54] <RandomNinja> as in my apartment
[14:23:33] <Unixkitty> I'm not sure I understand how exactly can a single kilt have anything to do with an entire apartment's overall temperature
[14:23:35] <RandomNinja> also, this is glorious https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEnKhAbwlQM
[14:23:51] <RandomNinja> it keeps my groin ventilated and less sweaty :P
[14:24:34] <Unixkitty> Oh my. Well that's certainly nice, but don't you think that's why I wanted to make sure which "inside" you were talking about? :P
[14:24:43] <RandomNinja> lul
[14:26:35] <RandomNinja> insert tunnel snake joke
[14:26:39] <Unixkitty> On a side note, even though it's rather warm outside, since I live on the first floor of a cement kind of building and the heating has been off for days now... it's 18'C inside and dropping. I even put my fingerless gloves because of how cold my hands were getting.
[14:26:53] <RandomNinja> you can apply heating though
[14:26:57] <RandomNinja> can't exactly apply cooling
[14:27:23] <Unixkitty> Haha, certainly not, but I don't think it's that terribly bad really
[14:30:48] <RandomNinja> still tho
[14:30:55] <RandomNinja> also, my poor mead
[14:30:57] * RandomNinja flails
[14:31:07] <RandomNinja> gotta get them into a basement storage as soon as possible

[14:31:49] * RandomNinja moves it to Unixkitty's place
[14:32:16] <Unixkitty> Haha, depending on how much exactly is there, I suppose I could fit it in one of my guest rooms
[14:32:26] <RandomNinja> or like, under the sink
[14:32:49] <RandomNinja> it's a few 5,5 liter containers, they fit in lots of small places
[14:33:22] <Unixkitty> Well it's not like at least one of those two rooms gets terribly much use, so I actually think it would be as good storage as any
[14:33:42] <Unixkitty> Also considering how chilly it is in here of course
[14:34:08] <RandomNinja> perfect place to brew your own :P

[23:48:10] <Sombra> But I'm probably creepy too :(
[23:50:39] <Inucroft[NLR]> !t creepy
[23:50:39] <DinkyBot> aww, it's too creepy to me
[23:50:43] <Inucroft[NLR]> ^
[23:51:15] <Sombra> You don't know how much I appreciate it though Araxnus
[23:51:24] <Araxnus> lol. Okay.
[23:52:01] <Sombra> Really, I've pretty much been stiffed everywhere else.  But you've given me a chance.  For that I'll do whatever you wish.
[23:52:43] <Araxnus> Well. This is a new Network. Canterlot Hill is not Everfree Network so ;)
[23:53:56] <Sombra> I will be your loyal servant~ Fangy teeth, crystals, stairs and gak, all at your command.
[23:54:25] <Araxnus> Could you be less creepy? That would be nice.
[23:54:43] <Sombra> I dunno... I can try.  What do I do?
[23:55:12] <Araxnus> It is what you don't do. Just be normal.

[23:57:03] <Araxnus> I like Hickory better ;)
[23:58:29] <Araxnus> Sombra: ^
[23:58:46] <Sombra> Hickory isn't really me.  I mean I can play him sure, but he's not really me.
[23:59:14] <Araxnus> Well. He is less creepy.
[23:59:45] <Sombra> When you picture me, just picture Michael fassbenders voice
