[00:04:54] <Moonlightning> What was the tradeoff between gz and bz2?
[00:05:16] <Moonlightning> One of them compresses better, but I think takes longer to compress and maybe also decompress?
[00:05:32] <Moonlightning> And then xz is better than one of them in that regard?

[00:09:18] <Colgate> bz2 takes much longer to compress, but has better compression
[00:09:28] <Colgate> is xz lsmz?
[00:09:33] <Colgate> lzma*
[00:09:40] <Moonlightning> I think xz is somehow related to lzma. Maybe a successor?
[00:09:58] <Colgate> xz is a lossless data compression program and file format which incorporates the LZMA/LZMA2 compression algorithms.
[00:10:03] <Colgate> thanks wikipedia!
[00:10:06] <Moonlightning> ah, lzma2
[00:10:31] <Colgate> yeah, xz is probably going to supercede gzip for everything later
[00:10:44] <Colgate> er
[00:10:46] <Colgate> everything but
[00:10:52] <Colgate> GAH
[00:11:07] <Colgate> jdg;ajdlagjl gzip will still be around, for when compression speed is really important
[00:11:11] <Colgate> is what I mean
[00:11:16] * Moonlightning nodnods.
[00:11:47] <Colgate> because yeah, gzip is stupid fast
[00:13:03] <johnsey> also, pxz
[00:13:07] <Moonlightning> pxz? x.x
[00:13:35] <johnsey> parallel xz compression

[00:14:29] * Colgate wants a pkernel
[00:14:35] <johnsey> because xz on its own is pretty damn slow
[00:14:49] <Colgate> isn't it faster than bzip?
[00:14:50] * johnsey gives Colgate a zImage
[00:15:46] <johnsey> not on highest compression level

[14:53:08] <DataByte> i was helping some guy set up a mc game server, he was paying me for the program and database, and another guy to do php for the site he'd made
[14:54:01] <DataByte> this other guy told me string PK are bad and that i was bad and didn't know anything
[14:54:39] <DataByte> guy charged $400 for adding a login/logout that saved passwords as plain text
[14:54:48] <DataByte> took him a week
[14:55:52] <DataByte> i got so mad when i saw what he did, i re-wrote it all in 4 hours using SHA-512 and mysqli (he'd used the deprecated mysql methods)
[14:56:21] <DataByte> even added a nifty stats browser with pages xD
