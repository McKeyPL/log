[17:29:39] <RandomNinja> fun.jpg
[17:29:53] <wobniaR> This is my last week so yolosweg
[17:29:59] <RimeTM> Chart isn't finalized yet, because April's votes haven't come, but the preliminary top 10 probably isn't going to change
[17:30:22] <RimeTM> Top 5 are all the same: Dark Horse, Strangers, The Real Pink Pony, Fighting Back, and Battle of the Bands (Eile/Gato)
[17:30:25] * RandomNinja replaces wobniaR's degree with beer
[17:30:40] <RimeTM> Notable is that Strangers is making doubling gains each week somehow
[17:30:42] <wobniaR> Beer would probably be worth more
[17:30:58] <RandomNinja> tastier at least
[17:31:16] <wobniaR> I'm not a fan of any of those songs
[17:31:20] <RimeTM> It's at 30,000 points compared to Dark Horse's 39,000
[17:31:30] <RimeTM> 1 top ten debut so far: Heaven Knows / Aviators
[17:31:35] <RandomNinja> needs more metal
[17:31:43] <RandomNinja> Aviators is good tho
[17:31:45] <wobniaR> Fighting back was meh, pink pony is an eminem parody but still not mom's spaghetti level
[17:32:12] <RimeTM> We Dreamt Our Dream gains 9-7 this week
[17:32:20] <RimeTM> I Am a Parasprite continues to grow 7-6
[17:32:36] <RimeTM> Heaven Knows is a #8 debut
[17:32:44] <RimeTM> Fly Like You moves up 10-9
[17:32:56] <RimeTM> I'll Fly (microThunder remix) holds on 6-10
[17:33:09] <wobniaR> I am totally out of the loop with a majority of pony music
[17:33:16] * RandomNinja applies best Rime to RimeTM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2xV3_U4mBA
[17:33:28] <RimeTM> The only song off the top 10 this week is Making Cupcakes, which falls 8-24
[17:33:30] <wobniaR> I'm not subbed to most of those people so yeah
[17:33:35] <RimeTM> So yeah, there was metal last week
[17:34:02] <wobniaR> I listen to way too much edm right now
[17:34:03] <RimeTM> RandomNinja, I must admit that song was part of the reason I chose this alias :P
[17:34:06] <RandomNinja> there was? :P
[17:34:07] <RandomNinja> yay
[17:34:18] <RandomNinja> God-tier album
[17:34:27] <RimeTM> Sayonara Maxwell's Rainbow Factory metal cover was also a top 10 just a few weeks ago
[17:34:43] <RimeTM> That moves down to #46 this week
[17:35:27] <RimeTM> Honestly, I have no idea what the new vote #1 will be for April
[17:35:38] <wobniaR> Discord
[17:35:41] <RandomNinja> needs more prog metal
