[00:28:37] <Twilightlicious> How easy will it be to transfer the entirety of a 256GB HDD to a 250GB HDD?
[00:28:49] <Twilightlicious> it's a system drive
[00:28:59] <Twilightlicious> i've only got like 200GB of stuff on it
[00:29:15] <Twilightlicious> i could probably just shrink the filesystem, now that i think about it
[00:30:10] <Twilightlicious> My friend needs a HDD, so im going to upgrade myself from a 256GB HDD to a 250GB SSD, and give her my old one.
[00:34:05] <Colgate> shrink filesystem, dd over
[00:34:09] <Colgate> should be fine
[00:34:34] <Colgate> I'd shrink it more than you think you need to
[00:34:41] <Colgate> since you can just expand once it is copied
[00:35:09] <Twilightlicious> uh huh
[00:35:15] <Twilightlicious> except the DD Part, being i don't use Linux
[00:35:24] <Twilightlicious> i've always used a program called Macrium Reflect
[00:35:39] <Twilightlicious> but, if DD is easy to use and i can do it from a Linux boot disk, then that'll work too
[00:37:02] <Colgate> # dd if=/dev/disktocopyfrom of=/dev/disktocopyto bs=4K
[00:37:09] <Colgate> then you wait
[00:37:31] <Colgate> make sure you don't reverse if/of, otherwise you nuke everything :P

[03:20:03] <tiwake> anyone happen to know where I can buy a motherboard with this processor? http://www.cavium.com/pdfFiles/ThunderX_ST_PB_Rev1.pdf
[03:22:54] <Googie> Doesn't look like the sort of chip that you'd just buy a motherboard with/for. More for when they try to sell you a whole server solution :P
[03:23:14] <tiwake> but I just want one
[03:23:20] <tiwake> silly peoples
[03:23:31] <tiwake> why cant normal people have nice server stuff?
[03:24:14] <tiwake> rack mount is too big for what I want
[03:24:53] <tiwake> http://www.cavium.com/ThunderX_ARM_Processors.html
[03:26:38] <Finwe> http://www.cavium.com/pdfFiles/ThunderX_CRB_1S_Rev1.pdf
[03:27:26] <Googie> The thing is, this isn't for consumers. There's no "platform" like with x86. It's a custom chip and needs a custom board, which in turn probably isn't compatible with most consumer components (depending on the hardware on the board)
[03:27:27] <tiwake> oooo look at that bandwidth
[03:27:38] <Googie> (As well as the software on the controllers)
[03:27:49] <Finwe> Or http://www.cavium.com/pdfFiles/ThunderX_CRB_2S_Rev1.pdf
[03:28:14] <tiwake> neh, I don't need dual processor :P
[03:29:13] <tiwake> ideally, DDR4 ECC memory
[03:29:16] <Googie> There's not really a thing as just "buying a motherboard", it's /not/ a PC, a motherboard on its own doesn't make sense except as a replacement component
[03:29:17] <tiwake> hmm
[03:29:29] <Finwe> Just persuade Cavium to send you one.
[03:29:35] <tiwake> Googie: motherboard+processor
[03:30:08] <Googie> It still doesn't make sense
[03:30:47] <tiwake> I'll buy my own hard drives, possibly a couple SSD drives, and make my own computer case
[03:30:51] <Googie> It's a custom chip with a custom board.
[03:31:03] <Googie> It probably won't accept DIMMs aside from select ones.
[03:31:11] <Googie> The PSU is potentially custom.
[03:31:28] <tiwake> then I'll make a custom PSU
[03:31:34] <tiwake> no big deal
[03:31:56] <Googie> Making your own ram too ?
[03:32:18] <tiwake> neh, I don't have the fabs in my shop for that XD
[03:32:38] <Googie> My point is though, this isn't going to be sold except as a whole server, because it probably doesn't make sense otherwise.
[03:32:42] <Googie> And wouldn't be profitable.
[03:32:53] <tiwake> hmm
[03:33:08] <tiwake> and my problem is I want a shiny thing like that, that is not rack mount
[03:33:35] <Googie> If "not a rackmount" is your biggest concern there... honestly I think you are very much looking at the wrong market :V
[03:34:17] <tiwake> not really, I want proper server equipment, I just want to build my own case
[03:35:10] <tiwake> rack mount networking switches are fine because they are generally pretty thin
[03:35:18] <tiwake> switches/routers
[03:35:27] <tiwake> I have my eye on a few :3
[03:36:57] <tiwake> I'll just wait to see what AMD's A1100 is released as
[03:37:57] <Googie> My point is though, it's not like those chips come with a selection of motherboards. You'd talk to them directly, ask about a reference design... ask someone to manufacture a board based on the reference design...
[03:38:14] <tiwake> meh
[03:38:29] <Finwe> Googie's got a point here.
[03:39:03] <tiwake> that would devolve into "can I ask your next customer to order one extra one? I'm not picky about what kind it is exactly"
[03:39:59] <JustAberrant> or just buy it in a rackmount case and like.. take it out of the rackmount case ;p
[03:40:44] <Googie> Yeah, that'd be the only way really. Buy a complete system from a distributor and modify it.
[03:41:18] <JustAberrant> economies and all that, sometimes it's worth buying a mass produced unit for a part :>
[03:41:24] <JustAberrant> * economies of scale
[03:42:15] <tiwake> maybe
[03:42:18] <Finwe> Or know someone who works with ARM server development and kindly ask for one of those ThunderX 1K boards.
[03:42:22] <tiwake> donno where I could get that either
[03:43:10] <Googie> Honestly, just go x86. "big" ARM servers aren't economical at the personal level
[03:43:53] <tiwake> I don't like x86 though
[03:43:55] <tiwake> XD
[03:45:54] <Googie> There's really not many other options. Not unless you are planning to turn it into either a /big/ project, or just directly buy a system from someone. x86 is used so much specifically because the PC is so open, and standardized.
[03:47:29] <tiwake> there are tons of options though
[03:47:47] <tiwake> MIPS, Power7, ARM...
[03:48:01] *** Quits: Xero (Xero@Pony-hgj.222.243.96.IP) (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[03:48:15] <tiwake> any one of them would be fantastic
[03:48:22] <Googie> Yeah, but try making a custom system out of any of those architectures... 
[03:48:36] <JustAberrant> get yourself a VME chassis and a PPC board then ;p
[03:49:10] <JustAberrant> can't get much more non conformist than that
[03:49:24] <JustAberrant> and vesabus is actually pretty cool shit
[03:50:11] <Googie> I mean, to get access to Power7... well, I don't think it's possible to get ahold of those chips outside of contact with IBM.
[03:51:02] <johnsey> you can make a custom system with ARM :)

[03:54:29] <johnsey> very true :)
[03:54:55] <johnsey> of course, everybody's free to do the research

[03:55:46] <Googie> I'd love to do something like that, although my thoughts are more on something Z80 based :P
[03:57:15] <Googie> A fair bit simpler :P
[03:58:05] <johnsey> also, has anyone else noticed how 90% of the SELinux-related problems you find described on the web are concluded with "fixed it, found out how to disable SELinux"?
[03:59:12] <Googie> (There's also this, which is awesome: http://www.homebrewcpu.com/)
[03:59:30] <JustAberrant> johnsey: probably relates directly to how much of an epic pain it is to use selinux ;p
[03:59:58] <johnsey> it is
[04:00:09] <johnsey> no wonder, way overcomplicated
[04:00:36] <Googie> Every time I look into it I come to that conclusion... I do really need to dig into it properly at some point

[04:02:07] <johnsey> I kinda need it, having a mail server on the same machine as a webserver makes me queasy, which is necessary for this project for $reasons
[04:02:52] <johnsey> running dodgy php applications alongside your mail server is asking for trouble
[04:03:24] <JustAberrant> grsecurity is also great if you want to make your life a lot harder
[04:04:17] <Googie> I've heard good thing about AppArmor compared to SELinux, but I don't really know enough about either.
[04:04:42] <JustAberrant> AppArmor seems like SELinux - beginners edition to me ;p
[04:04:49] <JustAberrant> but.. that's probably what everyone really wants :D
[04:05:06] <johnsey> i was considering grsecurity
[04:05:34] <JustAberrant> PaX is reasonably painless, the role stuff though...
[04:06:35] <johnsey> well yeah, PaX is mainly for kernel security
[04:07:11] <JustAberrant> yeah
[04:07:19] <johnsey> RBAC just tends to be complicated as soon as you wanna do anything non-standard
[04:07:32] <JustAberrant> PaX is basically "we do a bunch of stuff that's mostly transparent.. some shitty code might stop working but generally you won't notice much.."
[04:08:07] <JustAberrant> the role stuff is basically.. "so.. you want to spend a few months doing what used to take a few hours eh, come on in!"
[04:08:11] <johnsey> the hard part is is finding the standard configuration that's supposed to work(tm)

[04:16:23] * JustAberrant actually legitimately surprised by this.. I figured you as the type who ran selinux on your desktop ;p
