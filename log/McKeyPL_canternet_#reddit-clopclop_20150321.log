[03:25:19] <OmarianVolcae> In your drawing, you can see a little bit of blue to the right of her right eye which makes her face seem wider than it should be.
[03:26:13] <OmarianVolcae> Also, not sure if it's just your way of drawing muzzles, but her nostrils seem a little bit too big.

[17:48:13] <thaostra> I guess you could say it's stalking if someone else is posting yet another link of the same exact user who's singling out one of our site staff on their public dA profile and comes onto our channel yet again to get on their moral high horse by calling the mod in question racist and a thug because they didn't get special treatment
[17:48:48] <thaostra> Yeah, I'm the one who's obsessive

[20:41:33] <RNGsus> He always was
[20:41:39] <RNGsus> he was never in the games you played
[20:41:56] <RNGsus> he was only in the anime, and he was a pokemon from the next region that made a guest appearance
[20:42:02] <RNGsus> he is from the next games, gold and silver
[20:42:40] <Drago> He was introduced as the first pokemon after mew to my memory. I remember some big hype about him. I guess I am crazy
[20:43:14] <Drago> Too many years
[20:43:26] <RNGsus> he was the first to be introduced, but hes just a random poke from the next gen
[20:43:39] <Drago> ah, ok
[20:44:07] <Drago> Well that's when I stopped because I recognized what they were doing. 
[20:44:19] <Drago> It is kinda fun to play again.
