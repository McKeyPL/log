[00:04:35] <One-Trick> i got a beatport pro invite
[00:04:37] <One-Trick> huh
[00:05:00] <One-Trick> ohsnap, all the tracks are free for me o.o
[00:05:12] <wobniaR> Free music?
[00:05:38] <StrykerVylon> !t music
[00:05:40] <DinkyBot> for get any way is events well you see i dont want kids, id hafta turn down the music during the time I read GaP, I imagine this fella is probably 16 or younger.... or she just got banned from equetriaafterdark
[00:05:48] <One-Trick> but, lol, none of the tracks play
[00:06:00] <StrykerVylon> Pfft........ xD
[00:06:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> wait beatport is really confusing me
[00:07:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> what are they doing?
[00:07:27] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t Beatport
[00:07:28] <DinkyBot> As in have her go after it. I'm sure your execution is far better than Beatport.
[00:07:29] <wobniaR> New site or something, pro.beatport.com
[00:07:43] <wobniaR> So they changed their alias, big deal
[00:07:56] <Cloud_Zephyr> whats the invite then? cus i can already use beatport pro

[00:08:52] <One-Trick> yeah, wow
[00:08:56] <One-Trick> havent heard  it yet
[00:09:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> are they moving us to beatport pro for now while they work on the new site?
[00:09:28] <wobniaR> I'm confused why beatport charges $2.50 for some songs 
[00:09:36] <One-Trick> i dunno, but my login lets me download 5 songs a day for free
[00:09:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> and why is there music so overpriced? :P
[00:10:04] <wobniaR> I mean most other digital music sellers charge $1-2
[00:10:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[00:10:51] <M3reel> wobniaR:  because Beatport gives you Original Mixes 
[00:10:54] <wobniaR> 5 songs of your choosing a day is a good deal though
[00:11:06] <wobniaR> Free*
[00:11:09] <M3reel> and sometimes Remix Packs for the songs 
[00:11:13] <One-Trick> ima take advantage of this while it lasts xD

[00:12:16] <wobniaR> Then release their original mixes and sell it for more?

[00:13:13] <RandomNinja> gg m8
[00:13:15] <M3reel> wobniaR:  most of the money goes to the label 
[00:13:17] <wobniaR> That's like selling a full price game with day 1 DLC
[00:13:25] <wobniaR> That could've been included in the game

[00:14:14] <wobniaR> So people use beatport, itunes and amazon to reach a larger customer base but the distributors take a cut of the profits
[00:14:23] <LunaticHell> No really, that is a thing that did happen.
[00:14:24] <RandomNinja> are there other angry screams?
[00:14:32] <LunaticHell> Of course.

[15:06:11] <wobniaR> I'm open to suggestions
[15:06:28] <Moonlightning> Well, what TLS libraries does Icechat support? :P
[15:06:41] <Moonlightning> Or is stunnel the only one. x.x
[15:07:02] <wobniaR> That's a good question because i don't know
[15:07:11] <wobniaR> Their site suggested stunnel
[15:07:39] <Moonlightning> â€¦oh, stunnel isn't actually a library
[15:08:32] <Trildar> Suggestion: Stop using Icechat. XD
[15:08:43] <wobniaR> Pls
[15:08:51] <Moonlightning> It's a proxy thing to provide TLS to apps that don't actually support it.
[15:08:53] <Trildar> I'm just kidding.
[15:09:21] <wobniaR> I did say icechat 7 doesn't have built in ssl
[15:09:37] <Moonlightning> I thought you meant that they didn't write the TLS implementation themselves. :P
[15:09:43] <wobniaR> 9 does but it's not the best client for when you need scripts
[15:10:06] <Moonlightning> What OS?
[15:10:25] <wobniaR> Windows 7
