[00:30:40] <iam[a]lion> .
[00:30:41] <iam[a]lion> so my mom didnt have surgery. CT showed the blockage still there, but her adrenal gland behind it is bleeding a bit and hurts when pressed on. She had an enema to try and clear the bowels which went in but didnt come out. Letting her sit there and percolate for a bit. Step 1 is the clear the bowel to rule that out, then we will address the bleeding adrenal gland. No clue what caused that, dr thinks it might have been weak due to the radiation trea

[05:13:25] <thaostra> I'm so old that I've let a beard grow despite my prior obsession with being clean-shaven. On the plus side, I get compliments for me and the occasional feeling-up
[05:13:28] <Lumia> I rest at about 55 xD
[05:13:28] <Frosty> I don;t feel it;s that fast, though

[05:16:56] <Frosty> I can't touch type, so it's difficult for me. 
[05:16:58] <RNGsus> or i get a bunch of words with 'w' for some reason im really fast at those

[05:21:21] <RNGsus> I could get a brand new graphics card for that money
[05:21:22] <Quinn> it's mechanical

[05:22:17] <Vulpixbrew> also the high wpm :c
[05:22:18] <Frosty> :D
[05:22:23] <Quinn> you ask why it's expensive

[05:23:14] <OmarianVolcae> Wat
[05:23:20] <Vulpixbrew> r/mechianlkeyboard
[05:23:28] <Frosty> Mine is expensive because it's reprogramable, and it lights up and shit. You're looks like a basic keyboard from an early 90's Macintosh.
[05:23:42] <princesssluttershy> I use a Razer Black Widow that I got for $30 somewhere on sale
[05:23:54] <Frosty> I got mine 60% off
[05:24:09] <Quinn> purchasing razer products new is like buying beats by dre
[05:24:12] <Quinn> they're shit but they look nice
[05:24:13] <OmarianVolcae> I got my Razer Chroma on clearance sale from Newegg
[05:24:24] <OmarianVolcae> How are they shit?
[05:24:27] <OmarianVolcae> Like, really?
[05:24:29] <Frosty> Beats are actually really good.
[05:24:36] <Vulpixbrew> I have a razer Naja I ike
[05:24:41] <Frosty> Expensive as beans, yeah, bu qualoty.
[05:24:43] <OmarianVolcae> The switches on this chroma are exceptionally high quality.
[05:24:44] <Quinn> beats are not good
[05:24:45] <Quinn> ._.
[05:24:56] <Vulpixbrew> if beats were have the price yeah
[05:25:01] <OmarianVolcae> And I got it for less than half the price of your off brand.
[05:25:01] <Quinn> they're shitty quality with nice packaging
[05:25:02] <Vulpixbrew> but not for how much they are
[05:25:19] <Quinn> if beats were like $40 they'd be good
[05:25:19] <Frosty> Why do you say that, Quinn?
[05:25:36] <Quinn> because the audio quality is terrible on them
[05:25:39] <Quinn> and they're pretty cheap
[05:25:44] <Frosty> Except it's not
[05:25:45] <OmarianVolcae> Quinn is just going full consumer elitist right now. 
[05:26:01] <Quinn> nah it's pretty well known how much of a rip beats are
[05:26:41] <princesssluttershy> My $100 Audio Technica something or others sound way better than any Beats I've ever used
[05:26:43] <Frosty> I'm not saying they aren't. I'm not saying they are woth the money. They're quality. Extremely over priced, but quality.
[05:26:58] <Quinn> they're quality $40 headphones sold for $100

[05:40:50] <thaostra> I didn't like it, but poverty makes you do some things you'd otherwise feel too dignified to snoop down to

[05:41:23] <Quinn> honestly I've considered camming for a living and then realized I'd never make any money 
[05:41:25] <Quinn> I wish I could though
[05:41:27] <Vulpixbrew> everytime it's been either under qualified not enough experience or tomuch experience
[05:42:06] <Squirrelly> I'd watch you, Quinn...
[05:42:14] <Squirrelly> I don't have much money though, lol
[05:42:17] <Quinn> or prostitution but I doubt there's a market for me for that either, and it probably isn't as glamorous as it seems in my head ;-; 
[05:42:17] <Vulpixbrew> same
[05:43:00] <Quinn> I feel like sex is the only thing I really have to offer, but even then nobody would really pay me well enough for it :/
[05:45:48] <thaostra> There is a market for male escorts, but it's regulated and you'd need to go to a city like Las Vagas where there's a high concentration of wealthy businessmen and businesswomen who desire some company
[05:46:15] <Quinn> yea, and here I am in virginia
[05:46:17] <Quinn> :/
[05:47:29] * Vulpixbrew curls up into a ball
[05:48:22] * OmarianVolcae collects Vulpixbrew.
[05:48:30] <thaostra> You'd need to really put work into it to make it as an escort, like getting into shape, maintaining hygiene and grooming, keeping good relationship with your handler and clientele, dressing well
[05:48:56] <Quinn> I'm already in extreme shape :x
[05:49:03] <Quinn> and I'm always clean and kept
[05:49:11] <Quinn> but there is no market for it here
[05:50:12] <thaostra> Not to mention having knowledge of all the social hubs and being able to keep a conversation interesting
[05:50:25] <Quinn> yea yea I know it's not plausible :/
[05:50:41] <Vulpixbrew> the social thing alone keeps me away
[05:50:49] <thaostra> Yeah I hate to be debbie-downer
[05:50:49] <Quinn> I don't have a problem with the social aspect
[05:51:14] <Quinn> I know it's not really possible
[05:53:03] <thaostra> It is possible, but like most careers that revolve around non-essential services, it's going to require extra dedication

[06:02:29] <Squirrelly> I haven't had sex in over a week
[06:02:33] <samonuh> I made my girlfriend orgasm during it, which surprised me

[06:03:31] <Squirrelly> lol
[06:03:34] <samonuh> Guess I was good
[06:03:38] <Squirrelly> Well
[06:03:46] <Squirrelly> I mean, it's bad if she DOESN'T orgasm
[06:03:48] <Lumia> Altough, a majority of girls take to fame orgasms during sex xD
[06:03:57] <Lumia> Tend to fake**
[06:04:00] <Squirrelly> Yeah....I don't
[06:04:14] * princesssluttershy hasn't had sex ever
[06:04:19] <Quinn> the girl who raped me orgasmed each time 
[06:04:23] <Quinn> so it's possible :x
[06:04:26] <samonuh> It's not bad really. Sometimes I finish first, then I finish her off with my mouth/hands
[06:04:35] <thaostra> Squirrelly, Not necessarily; some girls are fine with not having an orgasm, instead merely enjoying the closeness with their partner
[06:04:42] <samonuh> Exactly
[06:04:54] <Squirrelly> Fair enough
[06:04:55] <Lumia> Uuunnnnffff~
[06:04:58] <Vulpixbrew> I alwys try to give orgasms
[06:05:02] <Vulpixbrew> at least one
[06:05:04] <Squirrelly> But like, for me, orgasming is pretty awesome
[06:05:22] <Squirrelly> Oh yeah I meant orgasming sometime during the encounter
[06:05:28] <samonuh> Sometimes my girlfriend skips the opportunity to orgasm so we can cuddle sooner :P
[06:05:33] <Squirrelly> Not every girl always orgasms during vaginal intercourse
[06:06:29] <Quinn> she orgasm'ed just from riding me vaginally with literally no other touching

[06:57:45] <EbonMane> There was a panel on how to flirt. It was remarkably unhelpful.
[06:57:52] *** princesssluttershy is now known as princess_sleeping
[06:57:58] <EbonMane> But incredibly entertaining.
[06:58:04] <Vulpixbrew> and the first thing I saw was the fex and bowtie
[06:58:09] <Vulpixbrew> fez*
[06:59:06] <EbonMane> It's really easy to get laid at any con, if you're willing to lower your standards a lot. Otherwise, you need to be lucky and at least semi-competent. And not a creeper.
[06:59:40] <plushie_pegasus> [human, bronycon, plushie] i want that plushie!!!   http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article7902741.ece/alternates/w620/AN5410359Matthew-Zadonia-ca.jpg

[07:50:06] <Flame> I'm dumb socially. 
[07:51:33] <EbonMane> People think of things in terms of dumb or smart, organized or disorganized, cool or uncool, as though they're things you have or you don't
[07:52:18] <EbonMane> The difference between an organized man and a disorganized man are the tools they use, the habits they have, and the processes they go through
[07:52:34] <Quinn> this isn't that
[07:52:40] <Quinn> this is just me being completely fucked in the head
[07:53:08] <EbonMane> Mental health is different. I didnt see the context, if that's what the discussion is about.

[07:56:28] <EbonMane> I think it'd be intense

[07:58:48] <weisey> Angry sex is hard yo do
[07:58:52] <weisey> To*
[07:58:52] <Quinn> what point have I reached where I can do that

[07:59:07] <weisey> You're angry
[07:59:36] <weisey> And stuff
[07:59:37] <weisey> And its hard to stay focused
[08:00:13] *** RubyPinch|DCed is now known as RubyPinch
[08:00:27] <EbonMane> I've jerked off while thinking of my dead ex. The sexual memories I have of her are still memories, and they're worth cherishing in the way most fitting for them.
[08:00:52] <Quinn> it's not like that
[08:01:03] <Quinn> I'm not thinking of him sexually
[08:01:12] <Quinn> I'm thinking of /him/
[08:03:21] <Quinn> I don't even deserve to have known him
[08:04:43] * RubyPinch hugs quinn
[08:05:59] <Quinn> if he hadn't met me he'd probably still be here
[08:06:15] <Quinn> and he'd have been happier
[08:07:04] <Quinn> and my family wouldn't hate me or him
[08:07:10] <Quinn> and his family would still have him
[08:07:20] <Flame> but maybe things would have been worse
[08:07:26] <Flame> no one can forsee an alternate path
[08:08:38] <Quinn> he'd have never been dragged down by me
[08:08:43] <Quinn> that's better 
[08:09:04] <RubyPinch> he could of been dragged down ten times further
[08:09:46] <Quinn> doubt it
[08:10:20] <Quinn> what happened to him was my fault
[08:11:26] <RubyPinch> not tryin' to be rude, but ya really need to spend less time trying to find the most negative things, not a good habit for ya health n' stuff
[08:11:48] <Quinn> it's not negative it's just the truth
[08:12:06] <RubyPinch> the truth for a single moment in time, a single decision
[08:12:17] <EbonMane> the term in the literature for this is 'egocentric bias', it means that you experience everything about your own life but you don't get to experience everything else that happens in the world. 
[08:13:00] <Quinn> I'm sorry
[08:13:06] <EbonMane> So you look for the place where you touched a sequence of events and blame yourself
[08:14:21] <EbonMane> It's not your fault.
[08:14:51] <RubyPinch> well, ain't anyones, no fault has been done here
[08:14:55] <Quinn> who's then
[08:15:09] <EbonMane> No one.
[08:15:27] <EbonMane> The world isn't clean. No one person is ever singularly responsible for anything.
[08:16:17] <EbonMane> Most things are the fault of more people than will ever know that the thing even happened
[08:16:32] <Quinn> :/
[08:16:36] <RubyPinch> I'd blame the butterflies, they seem to affect everything.
[08:16:57] <EbonMane> And if that's unsatisfying, oh well. The way the world works is unsatisfying.
[08:17:26] <EbonMane> It's not a CSI episode, where within 48 minutes someone will have all the bad things pinned on them.
[08:17:37] <EbonMane> We make up stories about blame and fault
[08:17:45] <EbonMane> But they're no more real than unicorns
[08:17:58] <EbonMane> They only make us feel better. Or worse.
[08:18:03] <EbonMane> Tell yourself some new stories
[08:18:07] <Quinn> how can I not feel responsible? how can I just shrug my shoulders and let it go?
[08:18:14] <EbonMane> Because this is just a story you're telling yourself
[08:18:20] <Quinn> I should have been keeping him safe and I messed it all up
[08:18:36] <RNGsus> I tried explaining it to him
[08:18:38] <RubyPinch> things could of changed if someone was late to work or not
[08:18:40] <RNGsus> he didnt get it
[08:18:42] <EbonMane> Nobody can keep anyone safe all the time
[08:19:04] <EbonMane> What's your next rationalization?
[08:19:26] <EbonMane> You don't have facts that are making you feel this way. You feel this way and are making up things to justify it.
[08:19:39] <Quinn> I'm sorry im messing this up too I should just get off
[08:20:00] <EbonMane> Don't get off, you don't deserve that either
[08:20:09] <RubyPinch> EbonMane: :\
[08:20:43] <EbonMane> People are trying to be supportive, but everyone has a different idea of what support means
[08:21:21] <EbonMane> I don't think keeping silent as you beat yourself up over something you couldn't have controlled is support
[08:22:00] <EbonMane> I wish I knew what to say that could help you forgive yourself, but nobody knows what that is.
[08:22:13] <EbonMane> I'm sure you don't either. And that sucks.
[08:22:30] <EbonMane> The world usually sucks. And we can't change that.
[08:22:32] <Quinn> I should just get the courage and jump
[08:22:37] <Quinn> its the closest thing
[08:23:03] <RubyPinch> Quinn: you know like, that you are seeking negatives specifically, right?
[08:23:13] <RNGsus> ^
