[04:27:04] <Dulset> because I got plenty of those ;)
[04:27:31] <Angel_Bunny> Ha well hopefully you still enjoy them
[04:27:32] <Angel_Bunny> for what they are
[04:27:51] <Dulset> Some of them
[04:27:57] <Scootaloo> Season 4 stole my waifu
[04:28:02] <Angel_Bunny> XD
[04:28:49] <Dulset> Pinkie Pride for one, I could complain about it all day but I still liked it for everything except Pinkie
[04:29:10] <Scootaloo> Well that's just like, your opinion man

[04:29:52] <Angel_Bunny> Yessss
[04:29:56] <Angel_Bunny> A+ gold star to Scootaloo
[04:30:04] <Angel_Bunny> my friend and I at work are trying to get that to be a thing
[04:30:11] <MikeM> It isn't?
[04:30:13] * Dulset facepalms
[04:30:16] <Dulset> it is
[04:30:17] <Angel_Bunny> I mean it exists
[04:30:22] <Angel_Bunny> but it's not like a big meme like it could be
[04:30:32] <Dulset> fact is some opinions are better than others
[04:30:33] <MikeM> That's one of my favorite movies.
[04:30:36] <Scootaloo> I an a master memer
[04:30:41] <Scootaloo> am*
[04:31:00] <Scootaloo> Bow before my Mountain dew throne and Doritos crown
[04:32:07] <Angel_Bunny> Xx_Sc00tal00_420blazeitgod_xX[FaZe]
[04:32:18] <Scootaloo> (Canonically god)
[04:33:21] <Dulset> So what's your favorite episode?
[04:33:31] <Scootaloo> All of them
[04:33:48] <Scootaloo> Except Mare do well and that Spike one with Applejack
[04:33:56] <Angel_Bunny> the not-yet-aired one of my alicorn OC stuck in a love triangle with Luna and Celestia
[04:34:08] <Scootaloo> Those are kinda universally disliked
[04:34:09] <Angel_Bunny> it's totally gonna happen guys I even sent my script into larson
[04:34:30] <Dulset> how's he going to get it out?
[04:34:39] <Angel_Bunny> ha
[04:34:41] <Scootaloo> Larson totally got it in, if he can get in a Game of thrones reference a black red alicorn OC is no problem
[04:35:31] <Dulset> Mare do well was definitely problematic but I wouldn't call it a bad episode
[04:36:44] <Scootaloo> It wasn't bad but the conflict and resolution wasn't pleasant
[04:37:02] <Dulset> yeah, agreed
[04:37:11] <Dulset> but then there started being bad episodes
[04:38:57] <Scootaloo> Yeah canterlot wedding was terrible, Luna slept through the whole conflict, Celestia got rekt and so did Cadance
[04:40:14] <Dulset> I will say BBBFF was the first bad somg of the series
[04:40:19] <Dulset> but hey, This Day Aria
[04:41:42] <MikeM> You should meet Muffin_Spectacles.
[04:41:51] <Dulset> oh?
[04:42:04] <MikeM> He likes getting in-depth on episodes.
[04:42:08] <Dulset> oooh :)
[04:42:10] <Angel_Bunny> BBBFF makes me sad when I hear it
[04:42:21] <Angel_Bunny> cuz I have a few siblings I can't really have a relationship with at the moment
[04:42:51] <Angel_Bunny> at least there's some good remixes lol
[04:42:52] <MikeM> That sucks. I hope it can change.
[04:42:57] <Angel_Bunny> Me too
[04:43:10] <Angel_Bunny> they're my half-siblings
[04:43:19] <Angel_Bunny> same dad, who is a felon lol
[04:43:38] <Angel_Bunny> so things were cool before he got in jail etc
[04:44:05] <Angel_Bunny> went down to Florida a few times, but meh... they're still dependenton their mom and she doesn't particularly like me
[04:44:15] <Dulset> What are the opinions here on Magical Mystery Cure?
[04:44:30] <Angel_Bunny> Probably the best they could have done, given the situation.
[04:44:44] <Angel_Bunny> I think it's a worthless endeavor to be too hard on MMC
[04:44:54] <Angel_Bunny> At least from a show staff standpoint
[04:45:07] <Scootaloo> It's a worthless endeavor in general to be too hard on the show
[04:45:13] <Dulset> sooo everyone knows it was awful :P
[04:45:16] <Angel_Bunny> agreed, but -especially- MMC
[04:45:51] <Angel_Bunny> there were good points
[04:46:10] <Scootaloo> There's always good points of an episode, cause the people who make it are good
[04:46:14] <Angel_Bunny> Find a Way was really good
[04:46:17] <Dulset> uh...
[04:46:32] <Dulset> I wouldn't say there's anything good about One Bad Apple
[04:46:48] <Dulset> except, I GUESS, the golden apple float
[04:46:52] <Angel_Bunny> pls
[04:47:01] <Angel_Bunny> derp scootaloo
[04:47:10] <MikeM> What is your standard for a good episode?
[04:47:25] <MikeM> Recognising that the target audience is 6?
[04:47:54] <Dulset> ideally, one I can think back on and, realizing new things, appreciate even more than before
[04:48:08] <Dulset> as opposed to a bad episode, which becomes worse after looking back
[04:48:14] <Angel_Bunny> I liked Babs kinda, and the song >.>
[04:48:41] <Angel_Bunny> and some of the visual gags
[04:49:12] <Dulset> the golden apple float was a clever reference
[04:49:19] <Angel_Bunny> it was quite big
[04:50:20] <Dulset> the golden apple of Eris
[04:50:34] <Angel_Bunny> that works
[04:51:44] <Dulset> Ooh, what abooooout Rainbow Rocks?

[04:52:59] <Dulset> Everyone I talk to, and I mean everyone, says it was way better than the first
[04:53:04] <Dulset> I thought it was worse though :P
[04:53:19] <Angel_Bunny> I liked it better than the first one, but that might have been because we were all super down about the first one before watching it
[04:53:48] <Dulset> and not the second?
[04:54:00] <Angel_Bunny> Well the first one exceeded most people's expectations
[04:54:07] <Angel_Bunny> so there wasn't this feeling of dread going into the movie like the first one
[04:54:09] <Dulset> ...really??
[04:54:23] <Angel_Bunny> ?
[04:54:45] <Dulset> the first one exceeded expectations?
[04:54:49] <Angel_Bunny> Yea
[04:54:53] <Angel_Bunny> Most people's expectations were super low lol
[04:54:54] <Dulset> wow
[04:55:05] <Angel_Bunny> at least that I talked ot
[04:55:06] <Angel_Bunny> to*
[04:55:16] <Dulset> I mean obviously but how could it have exceeded then
[04:55:25] <Angel_Bunny> low expectations = going to exceed them...
[04:55:42] <Dulset> only if it's not bad
[04:55:51] <Angel_Bunny> you said you thought the first was better than the second
[04:55:56] <Dulset> Indeed I did
[04:56:15] <Angel_Bunny> so I'm confused then
[04:56:28] <Dulset> doesn't mean I didn't think the first was just terrible :P

[07:57:24] <Trildar> Why would you have any reason to even think Ubuntu wouldn't run on it? :P
[07:58:16] <ThunderPie> Trildar i used to have acer aspire 5517 it couldn't run ubuntu well at all..
[07:58:36] <ThunderPie> stuff like flash player would make the whole system load extremely slow xD
[08:00:28] <Trildar> Ew, single core. Still don't know why it would do that if Vista ran fine on it.

[08:02:32] <ThunderPie> Trildar it had windows 7 and it didn't even run that well xD
[08:03:15] <ThunderPie> My current laptop is Gateway NE56r41u it has an Intel Pentium b960, intel HD Graphics, 4GB DDR3, 500GB HDD
[08:03:25] <Trildar> Could have tried a more lightweight Linux distro maybe. But maybe Flash is just butts. :P
[08:04:21] <ThunderPie> trildar flash player on a dual-core on ubuntu would work fine?
[08:04:30] <Trildar> Probably.
[08:04:40] <Trildar> Can't say for sure.
[08:05:32] <Trildar> but a single core 1.6 GHz is quite epically slow.
[08:05:49] <ThunderPie> I'm so glad i don't have that laptop no more xD

[09:17:43] <GL1TCH> A buddy of mine used to work for Inside Sim Racing
[09:18:08] <Ali> Also for those that don't know, the Coca Cola 600 is the longest NASCAR race
[09:18:14] <Ali> Its about 5-6 hours long
[09:18:17] <GL1TCH> Now he runs his own sim racing website, Sim Racing Paddock.
[09:18:21] <GL1TCH> THat's pretty long
[09:18:30] <Ali> Well its a 600 mile race
[09:18:35] <GL1TCH> Yeah
[09:18:52] <GL1TCH> 600 miles in 6 hours means average speed of 100mph.
[09:19:15] <Ali> Well the cars get up to 180mph a lap
[09:19:29] <Ali> but cautions and pit stops drive the overall speed down
[09:19:41] <GL1TCH> Yeah. The peaks have got to be quite high
