[01:51:34] <Octavia> Oooh! How did that go?
[01:51:37] <Octavia> What was it for?
[01:51:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> It was kinda weird going into it because I worked there a few years back
[01:51:50] <Sketchy_Sounds> and one of the guys running part of it was my old boss XD
[01:52:09] <Octavia> Did you leave on good terms?
[01:52:15] <Sketchy_Sounds> Thankfully I used to get on pretty well with my old boss, so that was good.
[01:52:30] <Octavia> Should not be an issue if bridges were not burned.
[01:52:45] <Sketchy_Sounds> Eh, my previous leaving of that workplace was due to repeated lateness, which, y'know, is somewhat of a side effect of your landlord going bankrupt and having to find a new place on short notice :p
[01:53:04] <Sketchy_Sounds> But the Ops manager that took that decision doesn't work there any more.
[01:53:14] <Octavia> Ah.
[01:53:22] <Octavia> What is the job for?
[01:53:53] <Sketchy_Sounds> And I also know from what my old boss said that they really need folks. Funnily enough, it's basically doing exactly what I used to do a coupla years back. Tax Credits Advisor, basically.
[01:53:54] <Littlestoycompany> toy tester?
