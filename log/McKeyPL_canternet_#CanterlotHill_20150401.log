[00:45:27] <Inucroft[NLR]> MikeM british medical scientist have discovered that a 9th Century eye-infection cure kills ~90% of MRSA bugs during the experment
[00:45:30] <Hamtramck> and shooting
[00:45:47] <MikeM> I saw that story today. Pretty neat
[00:45:51] <MikeM> MRSA's no joke, either.
[00:45:56] <Hamtramck> Oh.
[00:45:58] <LightSpeed> i mean theres always a risk with surgery, but something like foot surgery would probably have about a 95 to 99% sucess rate
[00:46:02] <Hamtramck> Serious answer for how you can die of foot surgery:
[00:46:18] <Inucroft[NLR]> onions, garlic and cow bile, who knew? Apparently Anglo-Saxons did
[00:46:20] <Hamtramck> Your doctor is secretly a sociopath and replaced your foot with a swarm of angry bees
