[10:08:08] <Electron> some random pone asked about top 10 pony music on PVL
[10:08:28] <Sakura> This is actually the first time in years that I'm actually legitimately excited about doing a radio programme & one that would be potentially bigger & better than I've ever done.
[10:09:01] <Sakura> Yep.
[10:09:05] <Electron> I'm here almost for 2 years but never seen you around
[10:09:24] * Dusk boops Sakura so far it's been well received
[10:09:47] <Sakura> I've been around but technically starting fresh on the internet....again.
[10:10:09] <SilverEagle> yeah your real name is still the old one
[10:10:37] <SilverEagle> on IRC I mean
[10:10:37] <Sakura> You're right, it is the same.
[10:10:49] <Dusk> You can change that in the bouncer settings dear
[10:10:53] <Sakura> Gotta change that.
[10:11:00] <Dusk> But it takes a reconnect to make it permanent
[10:11:46] <Electron> and I say "hell yes" as well

[10:14:37] <Sakura> Stop derping on meh ;_;
