[17:48:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> Hey guys I've noticed something a bit suspicious
[17:48:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> There is a channel named #gupshupcorner which is now the most popular on the network.
[17:49:25] <Cloud_Zephyr> As far as I'm aware its not pony related. Also its password protected however you can access it from there website http://www.gupshupcorner.com
[17:49:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> Any thoughts?
[17:49:59] <AppleDash> It's not that suspicious
[17:50:11] <AppleDash> Either A: they have a lot of users or B: They're currently being attacked by a botnet
[17:50:46] <AppleDash> Maybe both
[17:50:57] <AppleDash> Either way they're not currently causing any trouble
[17:53:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> maybe not but it doesn't seem pony related (if thats required)
[18:01:05] <Lunia> Why being pony related should be required when starting a new channel here?
[18:02:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> well this is a pony related network. but yeah i guess they aren't causing any harm
[18:03:03] <Lunia> let them bee
[18:23:30] <AppleDash> It is not required.
[18:33:10] <Shutter> Cloud_Zephyr: They're legit. Not pony related but *shrugs* - doesn't interfer with the pony business going on here so who cares.
[18:33:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> okey dokey
[18:33:41] <Shutter> Normally they're +s though. Dunno why they unset it.
[18:40:31] <Lunia> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I95XrYX1-_0 happy derpy day
