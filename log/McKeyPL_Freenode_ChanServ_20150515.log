[21:14:57] -ChanServ- ChanServ gives normal users the ability to maintain control
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- of a channel, without the need of a bot. Channel takeovers are
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- virtually impossible when a channel is registered with ChanServ.
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- Registration is a quick and painless process. Once registered,
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- the founder can maintain complete and total control over the channel.
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- Please note that channels will expire if there are no eligible channel successors.
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- Successors are primarily those who have the +R flag
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- set on their account in the channel, although other
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- people may be chosen depending on their access
[21:14:57] -ChanServ- level and activity.
