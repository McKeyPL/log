[22:27:41] <jacob1> asdf, I don't think anyone answered my question, can we do this in groups? (like of 2 :P)
[22:27:46] <jacob1> I know the last puzzle allowed that

[22:28:05] <nyuszika7h> 1 AM UTC

[23:06:33] <Twilight`Sparkle> So never (ducks)

[23:06:41] <jacob1> lol
[23:06:42] <xnr> what Twilight`Sparkle, yes lol
[23:06:51] <xnr> s/,/ said,/
[23:06:51] <jenni> xnr meant to say: what Twilight`Sparkle said, yes lol
[23:06:52] <jacob1> someone I know was testing GMS a few months ago. Idk what happened :P
[23:07:09] <xnr> do you not realize? GMS is freenode's half-life 3
[23:07:10] <jacob1> I think he found a bug. Probably had to spend these months figuring out how to fix it :P
[23:07:27] <xnr> there will be no GMS
[23:07:53] <xnr> and just like valve will tease us with press conferences on 03/03, 03:03 PM, freenode will do the same
[23:08:04] <Twilight`Sparkle> The  gms channel has been dead for some while
[23:08:09] <xnr> and instead, try to realize the truth, there is no GMS
[23:08:26] <xnr> (and there's also no spoon)
[23:08:56] <xnr> then you'll see, it's not the GMS that gets developed, it is only yourself
[23:10:06] <Twilight`Sparkle> I think it'll happen, it just will take a while
[23:11:12] <xnr> no, Twilight`Sparkle, that doesnt fit with my matrix reference so be quiet :(

[23:12:21] <jacob1> well hopefully it won't be so easy that is solved in a day lol
[23:12:22] <yano> someone tried beta testing it
[23:12:38] <Arch-TK> is it because it will be broken like last year's challenge ? :P
[23:12:40] <yano> they got stuck on level 5
