[01:33:59] <wobniaR> Welcome to the internet WildSoft
[01:34:11] <WildSoft> is it strange that my deciding factor for getting a tablet was the Humblebundle MLP comic bundle? =P

[01:35:44] <WildSoft> then a bookreader would probably be more suitable
[01:35:51] <WildSoft> they are cool as heck
[01:36:05] <OctaveMobile> This was free though
[01:36:07] <WildSoft> with e-inc it looks just like printed pages
[01:36:12] <WildSoft> Free tablet?
[01:36:14] <WildSoft> hmm
[01:36:26] <OctaveMobile> My brothers old one
[01:37:03] <WildSoft> Got mine on Black Friday + Sony cashback campaign so got another $55 back :P
[01:38:32] <WildSoft> saw the Humble Bundle and was like "I want this. No, I need this!" then I realized I had a small screen phone and no fun reading comics on the computer (no laptop) so that was the deciding factor for me getting a tablet :P
[01:38:43] <OctaveMobile> But now I better put it aside before I fall asleep on it
[01:38:55] <WildSoft> Don't do that. I did
[01:39:08] <WildSoft> fell on the floor, 1 month old and got a scratch in the screen -_-
[01:39:26] <WildSoft> ironic part is I got a screenprotector that I hadn't put on yet

[09:41:13] <FN> It is a ground effect vehicle which gained traction in soviet union and scared the bajesus out of united states
[09:41:38] <RandomNinja> I'm guessing that's just a model though
[09:41:57] <RandomNinja> solution: get RC skeleton, apply 3d printed parts :P

[09:49:01] <FN> It is a bit different
[09:49:30] <FN> Also rich in bee pheromones and other secretions from a queen bee
[09:49:38] <RandomNinja> yay
[09:49:40] <WildSoft> I have seen cheaper honey with additives and even mixed with glucose syrup
[09:49:45] <RandomNinja> ^
[09:49:54] <RandomNinja> this honey is inferior and overly sweet
[09:50:06] <WildSoft> yes, just testes wrong
[09:50:10] <RandomNinja> El Dorado, pls
[09:50:11] <RandomNinja> get out
[09:50:20] <FN> I don't know how effective it really is, but even if it is just a placebo with queen bee poop in it, I am ok with that as long as it helps people
[09:50:23] <Trildar> Too sweet? What's that?
[09:50:39] <RandomNinja> it's just a bunch of sugary sweetness and no subtle flavors
[09:50:43] <WildSoft> I mix a table spoon of pure honey with my tea every morning (big cup, like 5 dl)
[09:50:57] <WildSoft> no, I refuse to convert that from metric to imperial
[09:51:00] <RandomNinja> use 3 spoons for sore throats ^
[09:51:01] <FN> Why artificial honey when you can buy real???
[09:51:06] <RandomNinja> because price
[09:51:33] <FN> But artificial is just a thick gel sugar...
[09:51:47] <WildSoft> glucose syrup
[09:51:56] <FN> Like you can such on sugar with the same result
[09:51:58] <RandomNinja> also note that different source gives vastly different honey

[09:53:00] <RandomNinja> well yeah ofc
[09:53:12] <FN> I like the one from raddish flowers
[09:53:33] <FN> It has some interesting taste
[09:53:37] <RandomNinja> I have actually no idea what the local honey is, they didn't label it :/
[09:53:49] <WildSoft> Like maple syrup, here it's expensive to get the real deal over the one that is just glucose syrup and artificial flavours
[09:54:12] <RandomNinja> even local-er honey shall be acquired fresh from the beekeeper club come summer :3

[11:11:15] <OctaveSymphony> I also played Wasteland
[11:11:21] <RandomNinja> never played that
[11:11:21] <OctaveSymphony> Got Wasteland 2 lined up for playing

[11:12:18] <Unixkitty> Wasteland 2? Isn't that game top down or something?
[11:12:28] <OctaveSymphony> It's a turnbased game
[11:12:32] <Unixkitty> Ewww
[11:12:33] <WildSoft> and there's no achievement in Steam for owning more games than like 50 :P
[11:12:34] <OctaveSymphony> And it's top down to yes

[11:13:19] <RandomNinja> it's about strategy though
[11:13:32] <RandomNinja> also, world exploration and talking
[11:13:41] <OctaveSymphony> I also have X-Com... pre-ordered it and Wasteland 2 then forgot to play them xD
[11:13:50] <Unixkitty> My experience with strategies has always been around not understanding what's going on and... building pretty bases.

[20:29:41] <OctaveSymphony> I dislike it even the cheapest items, since they just don't taste good or make me feel full after
[20:29:51] <Cloud_Zephyr> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQdxO-36Tjg#t=67 this is so beautiful
[20:29:53] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[20:29:53] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Darude - Shitstorm
[20:29:56] <StrykerVylon> RandomNinja: Im in a subway right now. :P
[20:30:11] <RandomNinja> what u eatin
[20:30:25] <StrykerVylon> Nothing. I had a sub earlier though.
[20:30:33] <Flurshy> burger king's new chicken nuggets are a thousand times better than mcdonalds nuggets
[20:30:35] <Cloud_Zephyr> RandomNinja listen to this masterpiece
[20:30:47] <Flurshy> and they're selling them at dollar menu prices
[20:30:48] <RandomNinja> nu
[20:30:53] <OctaveSymphony> Never had SubWay
[20:31:00] <Flurshy> anyone else here tried the new nuggets?
[20:31:01] <RandomNinja> also Whopper > everything McD
[20:31:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> RandomNinja dont listen to this awful song :P
[20:31:10] <OctaveSymphony> Closest one to me opened, then went out of business 2-3 months later
[20:31:19] <RandomNinja> Subway is high tier fast food
[20:31:33] <Flurshy> RandomNinja: I'm starting to prefer jimmy johns over subway
[20:31:45] <RandomNinja> we don't have that I think
[20:31:56] <Flurshy> if I want to spend $7 on a sandwich I'll get one down the road that's biger than what subway sells
[20:32:05] <Flurshy> and better. yummy tuna sandwich

[20:32:16] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Darude - Dankstorm
[20:32:23] <RandomNinja> chicken teriyaki tho
[20:32:39] <Flurshy> tuna tho
[20:32:48] <Flurshy> also have you had steak n shake? if there is one near you
[20:32:54] <OctaveSymphony> Closest fast food places to me are 40 minutes or so away by car
[20:32:56] <RandomNinja> nope
[20:32:59] <RandomNinja> sweden, remember
[20:33:30] * StrykerVylon applies Germany to RandomNinja
[20:33:38] * RandomNinja biers
[20:33:42] * Cloud_Zephyr consumes caffeine everyday
[20:33:45] <OctaveSymphony> And I don't have a car, or a drivers license so can't get anywhere
[20:33:59] <RandomNinja> no driver's license? madness
[20:34:17] <Unixkitty> Same here
[20:34:23] <Unixkitty> I have neither
[20:34:31] <Cloud_Zephyr> you must live in the literal middle of nowhere
[20:34:50] <Cloud_Zephyr>  not the figurative middle of nowhere
[20:34:52] * Unixkitty happens to live in a major city.
[20:34:53] <RandomNinja> eh? that's when you need a car
[20:35:09] <OctaveSymphony> I live in nowhere
[20:35:22] <OctaveSymphony> Luckily my workplace is also in nowhere. 5 minutes walk from here
[20:35:34] <Cloud_Zephyr> whats the internet like?
[20:35:46] <OctaveSymphony> 36mb download speed, best they have
[20:36:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh not bad
[20:36:47] <OctaveSymphony> And a fiber network being built
[20:37:17] *** FN is now known as FruitNibbler
[20:37:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> yay fibre!
[20:37:49] * RandomNinja noms 100 mbps
[20:37:58] <OctaveSymphony> But like I told someone earlier, the price is massive. ‚Ç¨ 2000 is what they're asking for atm, but in a nearby town it ended up at over ‚Ç¨ 5000
[20:38:06] * Cloud_Zephyr noms 72mbps
[20:38:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> ‚Ç¨ 2000 per what?
[20:38:32] <OctaveSymphony> To get it connected to you house
[20:38:35] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh
[20:38:45] <Cloud_Zephyr> thats still insanity
[20:38:52] <OctaveSymphony> Then you need to pay installation and the regular monthly fee
[20:39:11] <Cloud_Zephyr> wait the ‚Ç¨ 2000 isn't the installation? O.o
[20:39:15] <OctaveSymphony> Nope
[20:39:18] <RandomNinja> nu
[20:39:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> whats that for then
[20:39:20] <FruitNibbler> COD http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/791/044/79f.png
[20:39:24] <RandomNinja> it's infrastructure
[20:39:32] <OctaveSymphony> That's just getting the fibre from the street to the outside of the house.
[20:39:32] <FruitNibbler> BF3/4 http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/768/026/f1d.jpg
[20:39:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> so i guess the infrastructure isn't prebuilt then?
[20:40:05] <OctaveSymphony> Under construction
[20:40:17] <OctaveSymphony> And all the households that want to be connected are paying for it
[20:40:19] <FruitNibbler> Installing fibres requires some expensive tools
[20:40:34] <FruitNibbler> No wonder it cost a lot
[20:40:55] <FruitNibbler> Although in all fairness prices are also overblown as well
[20:40:58] <Cloud_Zephyr> ah k. in the uk BT sends fibre to cabinets in the streets and then its sent over the traditional copper cables already there
[20:41:45] <Cloud_Zephyr> in simpler terms this http://www.broadbandspeedtest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fibre-to-the-cabinet.jpg

[20:42:03] <Duskshine> hello everypony
[20:42:20] <OctaveSymphony> Yeah, here they're putting down new pipes and all
[20:42:30] <OctaveSymphony> I wants me 100mbit
[20:42:56] <FruitNibbler> What for?
[20:43:09] <RandomNinja> why not :P
[20:43:10] <OctaveSymphony> For download speeds.
[20:43:21] <RandomNinja> of... steam library. yes
[20:43:24] <RandomNinja> <.<
[20:43:39] <FruitNibbler> Here in Germany the infrastructure for the optical fibre is now being laid down everywhere for free
[20:43:45] <Cloud_Zephyr> for all the things!
[20:43:45] *** Observer is now known as Away|Observer
[20:44:15] <Cloud_Zephyr> yeah I think the UK government has given grants to my isp to get fibre everywhere
[20:44:22] <FruitNibbler> Like literally every house gets a cable network rearranged to have a channel for a fibre wire
[20:44:34] <OctaveSymphony> Here each town handles the fibre on its own
[20:45:23] <FruitNibbler> That doesn't mean everyone will get a free fibrewire, it is merely an infrastructure, but not the cable itself
[20:45:51] <OctaveSymphony> Like I said, do want to get connected. But sicne they can't say what the final price will be... very hesitant
[20:46:06] <FruitNibbler> But in case you want it, you will not need to dig and buy special casing for it: just pay the connection fee and cost of fibre itself

[21:57:21] <Princess_Twilight[NLR]> I read a fanfic yesterday, was describeing Spike's funeral, i cried like a big baby, was from twi's POV.
[21:57:36] <Inucroft[NLR]> Duskshine there are worse things out there, but it wasn't that good. 
[21:57:44] <Nelly> That's fairly objective but I suppose if you expect to be sad or aren't saddened by such things it may well be boring to you.
[21:57:46] <Inucroft[NLR]> The grammar was jaring
[21:58:02] <Duskshine> bet you won't say my lil rarity is bad once I have it done
