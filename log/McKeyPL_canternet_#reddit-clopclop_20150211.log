[21:11:46] <TheRedTwo> I'm not sure if it's, uh, fit for human consumption.
[21:12:01] <TheRedTwo> then, I'm not sure horse cum would be, either
[21:12:42] <Drago> Horse cum is perfectly safe to ingest.

[21:24:21] <Drago> I already miss having a sexual pet.
[21:25:11] <Drago> Back to opportunistic sex for now

[21:28:21] <Drago> ooo nice
[21:28:25] <Drago> :P
[21:29:37] <TheRedTwo> reminds me of that one time where I was stuck on ts with my pals
[21:30:09] <TheRedTwo> and someone on this chat dared me to not turn my mike off, instead try to stay in conversation
[21:30:16] <TheRedTwo> wwhile clopping, mind you
[21:31:09] <Vulpixbrew> sounds hot
[21:31:19] <Vulpixbrew> how did you do?
[21:32:03] <TheRedTwo> it was surprisingly easy. helps of course that three of them were engrossed in their game and yelling at each other
[21:32:23] <Vulpixbrew> lols
[21:33:36] <Vulpixbrew> also hot
[21:33:53] <TheRedTwo> so I didn't have to reply much. and I'll admit, I had lowered my mike sensitivity
[21:34:09] <cloppyhooves> Lowered your mike sensitivity but not your genital sensitivity :3
[21:34:37] <TheRedTwo> of course not
[21:34:49] <TheRedTwo> but
[21:34:56] * Vulpixbrew wiggles at the thought of getting caught
[21:35:08] <TheRedTwo> and that's what's kinda vexing me
[21:35:32] <TheRedTwo> it didn't feel like much of a risk, odddly enough
[21:36:07] <Drago> heh, well what's too lose?
[21:36:40] <TheRedTwo> not sure.
[21:36:42] <Drago> to*
[21:36:56] <Drago> I'd love to get caught, Vulpixbrew :P
[21:37:00] <TheRedTwo> but I think it'd be "worse" for them to find out I clop than to find out I consume pornography in general
[21:37:17] <Drago> right? lmao
[21:37:35] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[21:37:39] <TheRedTwo> and I think that's the difference. if they hear me moan, then yes that's "ew dude go offline for that"
[21:37:44] <Drago> well rather, that you clopped while on mic. that's what would kinda get me :P
[21:37:53] <Drago> I'd join in
[21:38:03] <TheRedTwo> heh
[21:38:48] <TheRedTwo> but yeah it's not like they'd know I'm knocking myself out over an image of twilight getting spitroasted by her brother andd dad
[21:39:49] <Drago> Fuck I am horny as hell. Gotta stay in control though ><
[21:40:02] <Drago> Good ole spitroat lol
[21:40:08] <Drago> spitroast
[21:40:43] <Vulpixbrew> mmm sspitrosast
[21:40:44] <Drago> I won't have time to clop properly, get ready, and make it to my appt.
[21:40:47] <TheRedTwo> or maybe, skewered by a black vine
[21:40:58] <Vulpixbrew> appt?
[21:41:09] <Drago> appointment
[21:41:30] <Vulpixbrew> figured that much :P
[21:41:40] <TheRedTwo> now it would be cynical and sadistic to mention other sexy arrangements, like having pinkie pie suck a hundred dicks
[21:41:44] <Drago> I know there are tons of cloppers in this city, I just need a way to find them lmao
[21:42:01] <TheRedTwo> there aren't even many bronies round here, let alone cloppers
[21:42:37] <TheRedTwo> who could forget the legendary friendship orgy, canterlot style, the mane six had in that one fan fic
[21:43:18] <Drago> I finally found one, female, but unless things change, not much is gonna hapen anymore, like I keep saying. I need someone with a cock. It's been years
[21:44:52] <TheRedTwo> how about big macintosh, who's got plenty of loving for everyone to go around

[22:08:01] <TheRedTwo> the weird thing is
[22:08:37] <TheRedTwo> I basically took started in a NPC village
[22:08:46] <TheRedTwo> expanded on it
[22:08:54] <TheRedTwo> and the buildings just got consecutively bigger
[22:09:13] <TheRedTwo> now it's starting to look like a city in some parts, which look nothing like the village itself
[22:09:38] <Vulpixbrew> aww thats right I lost the save file......
[22:09:42] <TheRedTwo> because NPC houses are tiny
[22:09:46] <TheRedTwo> ah, that's a shame :/
[22:10:03] <Vulpixbrew> to bad cause io already had like 10 hours in on that Luna
[22:10:21] <TheRedTwo> 3d or 2d?
[22:10:32] <Vulpixbrew> 2d
[22:10:37] <TheRedTwo> I once tried to build a statue
[22:10:38] <Vulpixbrew> but it was massive
[22:10:43] <TheRedTwo> it didn't go too well.
[22:10:53] <Vulpixbrew> well above the cloud layer
[22:11:28] <Vulpixbrew> dang
[22:12:07] <Vulpixbrew> I know one time i was on a server on creative and mmade a  few missle silos
[22:13:16] <TheRedTwo> hah, awesome
[22:13:45] <Vulpixbrew> the plan was to go creative and build up abses then switch it to survival
[22:13:47] <TheRedTwo> we had this "war server" for a while. where we'd build air fields and fortresses and submarine bunkers competitively
[22:13:52] <TheRedTwo> ahh nice
[22:14:41] <Vulpixbrew> My one above ground base was a small sub base but I had miles upon missles of tunnel fully lit with powered carts
[22:14:53] <TheRedTwo> awesome
[22:15:29] <Vulpixbrew> sadly the server got griefed some one spawned in like 7 ior 8000 cows
[22:16:03] <TheRedTwo> ahh damn
[22:17:09] <TheRedTwo> on our war server the idea was to have everybody contribute, and whenever there was a combat event - as in, permitted griefing - everyone would afterwards help repair or reset the server to last version
[22:21:33] <bad_rooster> TheRedTwo: why repair when you can reset? oO

[22:26:56] <RNGsus> So I was thinking earlier, I would totally be down for a relationship where we had sex together with other people as long as the other person was okay with it. Any thoughts?
[22:27:52] <TheRedTwo> basically open relationship
[22:28:05] <TheRedTwo> or you mean like a polyamoric threesome
[22:28:42] <RNGsus> I dunno
[22:28:52] <RNGsus> those are some long words you are using thar

[22:31:10] <cloppyhooves> I can still take questions, though c:
[22:31:36] <RNGsus> I wouldnt know any to ask
[22:31:56] <RNGsus> That is pretty cool cloppyhooves though
[22:32:01] <TheRedTwo> hell I haven't been in a relationship for over five years, leave alone a good one :/
[22:32:40] <TheRedTwo> I'dd need to compile a questionnaire
[22:33:06] * Vulpixbrew has a question
[22:33:08] <Dusk> I'm poly, so I can take questions if you're curious how some of that works 
[22:33:53] <cloppyhooves> Yay poly c:
[22:34:00] <cloppyhooves> Yes, Vulpixbrew c:
[22:34:01] <cloppyhooves> ?
[22:34:03] <Dusk> Yush
[22:34:09] <RNGsus> Well for a start, for people who are ignorant like me, can we have a general definition of what that means?
[22:34:24] <Vulpixbrew> CVloppy I'm hungry what should I try to get to eat
[22:34:28] <cloppyhooves> Tacos
[22:34:29] <cloppyhooves> Always tacos
[22:34:36] <Vulpixbrew> fair enough
[22:34:37] <cloppyhooves> Good, authentic tacos :3
[22:34:42] <TheRedTwo> so how'd that come to be, Dusk?
[22:34:42] * RNGsus gives Vulpixbrew a sitrus berry
[22:35:05] <cloppyhooves> RNGsus, polyarmory is a form of nonmongamy involving multiple romantic partners c:
[22:35:22] <cloppyhooves> It can be in a lot of different configurations
[22:35:25] <TheRedTwo> like did you just come together, or did two decide to take up others in their relationship
[22:35:32] <Dusk> I found that I had fallen in love with several people...three to be exact at the time...and I had no way to pick so I asked if they minded being in a relationship with me together. It's a shared relationship between all partners in a perfect form of it.
[22:35:49] <Dusk> Open relationships tend to mean one person has multiple separate partners that aren't associated.
[22:36:44] <TheRedTwo> has there ever been an issue about jealousy
[22:36:55] <RNGsus> you see i would be down for poly but in reality i dont think i would do so well with jealousy and all
[22:37:42] <cloppyhooves> It's not for everyone c:
[22:37:56] <TheRedTwo> as would I, but I'm not really sure if that's actually me or just basically me fantasizing

[22:49:49] <cloppyhooves> I just learned recently that jealousy and envy are different things
[22:49:53] <cloppyhooves> I thought they were synonyms :o
[22:49:59] <Dusk> Definitely not
[22:50:22] <Vulpixbrew> TiL to
[22:50:31] <cloppyhooves> Can you remind me what the difference is? c:
[22:50:39] <TheRedTwo> always been
[22:50:41] <TheRedTwo> basically
[22:50:58] <TheRedTwo> jealousy is when you want what the other guy has
[22:51:09] <TheRedTwo> envy is when you don't want him to have it
[22:51:34] <RNGsus> what
[22:51:35] <Dusk> No, jealousy is showing envy. Being envious doesn't require you to be jealous
[22:51:55] <RNGsus> Yeah red envy is almost the direct opposite of what you said
[22:52:09] <RNGsus> if someone has an awesome car you envy them
[22:52:12] <TheRedTwo> okay wait, translation issues them
[22:52:13] <TheRedTwo> then
[22:52:34] <Dusk> jealousy is usually in terms of a relationship, but it is the act of showing envy.
[22:52:47] <Dusk> But it can be used otherwise
[22:53:07] <Dusk> however envy is the base term being jealous, and 'envious' are synonyms
[22:53:22] <TheRedTwo> ok my mistake. see I learnt it with that distinction I mentioned
[22:53:25] <Cel> i'd say it's... envy is when you want what someone else has, but jealousy is when you're worried someone's trying to take what you have. (cuz that's what vocabulary.com says)
[22:53:32] <Dusk> ^
[22:53:39] <Dusk> That's a good way to put it
[22:54:18] <cloppyhooves> Ah, okay c:
[22:54:18] <TheRedTwo> interesting. never knew this bit
[22:54:38] <cloppyhooves> In that case, I'd say that in my open/poly relationship, I feel envious pretty often, but basically never jealous
[22:54:55] <Cel> someone told me way back when... but I forgot, so I had to look it up^^
[22:54:57] <Dusk> In those kinds of relationships you sorta have to throw that away
[22:55:12] <Dusk> Otherwise you'll end up hating them and yourslef
[22:55:17] <Dusk> yourself*
[22:55:29] <TheRedTwo> again I know envy as "I hate this guy's guts for having that car" - even if I don't want him to have that car myself
[22:55:45] <TheRedTwo> if I ddon't want to have that car myself*
[22:56:28] <RNGsus> I would say no
[22:56:38] <RNGsus> To envy you sort of have to want to be in their place?

[22:57:02] <FineLine> [YouTube] Yiff the Police (11secs) | Likes: 2 | Dislikes: 0
[22:57:04] <RNGsus> However if you envy someone, you can also hate them too, which would be wanting them not to have the car
[22:57:56] <TheRedTwo> see that's jealousy far as I learnt it. "I'd really like that car of his, damn this guy"
[22:58:13] <cloppyhooves> I wouldn't say I throw jealousy away
[22:58:16] <cloppyhooves> I just don't really feel it
[22:58:30] <Dusk> You know what I meant cloppy :P
[22:58:33] <cloppyhooves> c:
[22:58:43] <Dusk> if you know you're prone to jealousy then being open/poly might not be for you.
[22:58:49] <Dusk> It ends up being harmful to the relationship
[22:59:17] <RNGsus> I think red you are thinking of the noun a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck. while im thinking of the verb desire to have a quality, possession, or other desirable attribute belonging to (someone else).
