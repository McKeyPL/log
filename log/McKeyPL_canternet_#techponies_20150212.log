[01:21:01] <AppleDash> Stik: For the reord, I looked into modern OpenGL and I don
[01:21:05] <AppleDash> 't like it :(
[01:26:17] <JustAberrant> modern openGL :O
[01:27:27] <Stik> heh
[01:27:40] <Stik> it has a steep learning curve
[01:27:55] <Stik> but old opengl is just plain broken, so there's not really an alternative :)
[01:28:19] <Googie> Yeah, fixed function pipeline is dead :P
[01:28:26] <Stik> it was very quick to get something up and running in old opengl i suppose
[01:28:38] <Stik> easy to do so wtihout needing to understand what was going on, at any rate
[01:28:44] <JustAberrant> I haven't done anything with opengl in about 4 years, so I'm assuming I was using.. uh.. classic opengl? :>
[01:29:00] <Stik> you'd remember if you weren't :)
[01:29:17] <Stik> if there were lots of calls to glVertex, glColor, glBegin etc then it was old-skool
[01:29:24] <JustAberrant> yeah ;p
[01:29:28] <Stik> and not even supported on modern devices like tablets and phones sadly
[01:29:35] <Stik> or the web
[01:29:36] * JustAberrant goes and pops some stuff ;p
[01:29:50] <Stik> heh
[01:30:04] <JustAberrant> but yeah, I don't remember it too fondly
[01:30:10] <Stik> it was a bit of a mess
[01:30:14] <JustAberrant> I remember thinking "well, this is a lovely incoherent mess"
[01:30:19] <Stik> yup
[01:30:24] <Stik> but it was a very easy mess
[01:30:47] <Stik> the "new" way is significantly more tangled, and that's easy to mistake for mess if you aren't careful :)
[01:30:47] <JustAberrant> I suppose
[01:31:42] <Stik> shadertoy is a good way to get into modern opengl i think, it lets you play around with the pretty stuff (shaders) without having to do any of the dull underlying bits
[01:31:43] <Googie> Khronos is working on a complete revamp of OpenGL, hopefully that'll succeed
[01:32:08] <Stik> once you're hooked on that then there's a reason to learn how it actually works, and that makes it much easier
[01:32:11] <Googie> They've got a lot of support this time around
[01:32:12] <JustAberrant> I just avoid opengl and graphics in general
[01:32:21] <Stik> fair enough :)
[01:32:23] <Stik> i enjoy graphics stuff
[01:32:23] <Phase4> hopefully they Acutally do it this tim
[01:32:24] <Phase4> time;
[01:32:35] <Googie> Hehehe, yeah
[01:33:55] <JustAberrant> and yeah, mniip made a cool RD with (I think) shadertoy
[01:34:05] *** Joins: nscoots (FreyGrimrod@Pony-pgr.ff4.191.107.IP)
[01:34:29] <Googie> They've got the support, hopefully too many politics won't get in the way
[01:35:17] <Phase4> Googie, now dx12 is doing it first :P
[01:35:22] <AppleDash> I do what JustAberrant does
[01:35:31] <JustAberrant> :>
[01:35:47] <Phase4> it's a bit too little, too late imo
[01:37:19] <Googie> Nah, dx12 doesn't have anywhere near the portability needed
[01:37:51] <Googie> Different back in 2006 or so,  but these days, with tablets, phones, browsers...
[01:38:11] <Phase4> maybe, but they're already doing gles, and doing it badly
[01:38:29] <Googie> There isn't any realistic competitor to OpenGL in most spaces outside of XBone and Windows
[01:38:59] <Phase4> well there's metal on ios
[01:39:41] <Phase4> Googie, ultimately what i'd like to see is completely discarding the concept of a graphics api at the system level
[01:39:52] <Googie> This is supposed to be a complete rewrite breaking backwards compatibility, so it'll be interesting to see what they come up with
[01:39:57] <Phase4> they're prety much generic processors now
[01:40:25] <Phase4> so you want something conceptually closer to opencl that gl, d3d, mantle, or whatever else you please can be implemented ontop of
[01:40:37] <Phase4> and it's far less code for vendors to screw up
[01:41:09] *** Joins: Datalink (Datalink@Datalink)
[01:44:03] <Googie> I think in theory that's a good idea, in practice is a different matter though.
[01:44:54] <Googie> I haven't dealt with graphics that much, so I don't really have much more to say than that :P
[01:47:33] <Stik> got a link to mniip's rd? that sounds cool
[01:47:39] <Stik> can't find anything through their search
[01:48:30] <JustAberrant> it might have been another one of those live shader sites
[01:48:36] <Stik> maybe
[01:48:39] <Stik> ah well, bedtime for me
[01:49:07] <JustAberrant> wait

[23:31:44] <AppleDash> OK
[23:33:29] <Hck> Moonlightning> Yes you can
[23:33:59] <Hck> Question is if you have to write own command...
[23:35:23] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: the things that all your yanked and deleted text gets put into.
[23:42:12] *** eyeburn is now known as Starburn
[23:42:49] <Hck> Moonlightning> I'm not really into vim hacking but I think it'll be something like
[23:42:50] <Hck> :map <F9> :new<CR>p:w
[23:43:21] <Hck> after F9 you write name and close temp buffer
[23:43:41] <Hck> now I dunno how to close it automagically
[23:45:33] <Moonlightning> hmm.
