[07:07:58] <Compu> how much does it cost to get central air conditioning installed?
[07:09:16] <JustAberrant> round $4000 I imagine
[07:09:21] <locodashie11> depends on the house layout, and how many rooms you're adding?
[07:09:25] <JustAberrant> (assuming you are getting it installed and not doing the work)
[07:09:41] <JustAberrant> and that's assuming you have existing forced air system
[07:09:46] <JustAberrant> if not, you probably can't
[07:09:55] <JustAberrant> or it would be insanely expensive to run ducting/etc
[07:10:20] <JustAberrant> most companies that do this kinda thing will give you an estimate for free
[07:10:35] <Compu> JustAberrant: have central forced air heating
[07:12:12] <Compu> locodashie11: theres 4 rooms in this apartment, we're on the bottom floor of a 2 apartment house (used to be 1 whole house but was converted, bottom gets old central heating system, upstairs gets individual electric, in-wall heating units
[07:12:17] <JustAberrant> then yeah, my guess would be $3000 to $4000.. but yeah would depend on all manner of things
[07:13:07] <Compu> and we're already planning on getting a new wifi thermostat when i get my ssi
[07:14:13] <Compu> JustAberrant: if they can do some sort of payment plan i can maybe handle that but no way i can do $3000 to $4000 in one go, ssi only allows u to have $2500 at any one time
[07:14:37] <Compu> they upped that limit from $1000
[07:14:56] <JustAberrant> well, also keep in mind that using AC will make your power bill go quite insane
[07:15:23] <Compu> meh
[07:16:18] <locodashie11> mine changes my power bill about 3x higher in summer
[07:16:24] <Compu> we currently pay like $15 a month for power with 2 desktops and a laptop running nonstop, an hdtv with a 2000s CD player sound system for tv audio, dish box, and a few other things
[07:16:33] <locodashie11> and that's with it usually set to 80 degrees
[07:16:41] <JustAberrant> when your power bill doubles you won't be meh-ing unless you've got really cheap power ;p
[07:16:54] *** Quits: Gigabit (GigabitPony@wonderbolt.wannabe) (Quit: Need to be alone for a while.)
[07:16:57] <locodashie11> and mine's about 100 per month
[07:17:09] <locodashie11> just one rack server added 50
[07:17:18] <JustAberrant> power is expensive here :(
[07:17:31] <Compu> JustAberrant: just said, power bill is currently $15 a month, double would only bring it to $30
[07:17:53] <locodashie11> with all those low power things, I'd think closer to 70
[07:18:03] <locodashie11> do you have an electric dryer?
[07:18:12] <JustAberrant> also all those things combined probably don't add up to how much juice an AC unit uses..
[07:18:13] <locodashie11> because those add quite a lot too
[07:18:17] <JustAberrant> fridge/stove/drier/etc ..
[07:18:23] <Compu> as long as we check the power meter and report it to the power company it stays that way, if we dont read the meter then they up it to like $100 for that month
[07:18:36] <JustAberrant> that's uh.. weird
[07:18:45] <locodashie11> sounds very weird
[07:18:56] <Compu> JustAberrant: no dryer but fridge, stove uses gas
[07:19:04] <JustAberrant> things are simple here.. I pay based on how much power I use :>
[07:19:09] <locodashie11> why would a company rely on their costumers to report those numbers correctly?
[07:19:27] <Compu> and we have this extremely underpowered 600 watt microwave
[07:20:02] <Compu> locodashie11: cuz thats how power companies work, they have a guy come check it like every year or 2 to make sure everything adds up
[07:20:23] <locodashie11> so yeah, I'd guess about 3-4x your power bill then, depending on how low you set the temperature
[07:20:33] <locodashie11> not here, heh
[07:21:05] <locodashie11> it's automatically checked by address on their special transformers
[07:21:35] <JustAberrant> old fashion "bunch o` dials" meter for me.. but they check it every month
[07:21:49] <JustAberrant> occasionally they skip a month and do an "estimate"
[07:22:15] <JustAberrant> water is same deal but every 4 months
[07:22:17] <Compu> locodashie11: we live in new york state, temps dont get too high here, maybe 100° fahrenheit 5 days out of the year, in the summer it averages around 70 with higher temps getting to the 80s and 90s
[07:22:39] <locodashie11> here is just averaged per year, so some months aren't especially low or high

[07:22:48] <Compu> JustAberrant: landlord pays for our water

[07:23:29] <locodashie11> still kind of low
[07:23:55] <Compu> well the only other option is getting a window unit

[07:25:02] * JustAberrant shruggles.. fair `nuff
[07:25:11] <Compu> figure central AC could only bring the value up
[07:25:53] <locodashie11> find a local contractor, and call them, that'll give you the best estimate on price
[07:26:26] <JustAberrant> yeah, most people will happily give you a free estimate if they think you're actually serious (and some probably even if not)
[07:27:08] * JustAberrant just googled it.. I was close:  When added to an existing forced-air heating system, central air for a 2,000-square-foot home costs $3,500 to $4,000 and can be done by two technicians in two to three days, often with little or no change to the ducting.
[07:27:12] <Compu> if he can keep it under $2000 or offer financing options then i might be able to pull it off
[07:28:00] <locodashie11> I'd assume there would be some financing plan for something that costs that much
[07:28:41] <JustAberrant> also if you don't have forced air in the upper rooms, then you probably won't be able to easily get it in there
[07:28:51] <Compu> $100 a month payments i might be able to handle, $200 would be starting to stretch my SSI income
[07:29:12] <Compu> JustAberrant: dont need it, we only have the bottom floor
[07:30:37] <JustAberrant> for $3500.. $100 a month would be like 2 years.. plus whatever interest
[07:31:01] <Compu> i could probably save up for a down payment of $1500

[07:35:42] <Compu> it wouldnt work as well

[07:36:11] <JustAberrant> yeah, though probably way damn cheaper
[07:36:21] <locodashie11> you could probably get one of two of those temporarily at least
[07:36:39] <locodashie11> for $50-200 depending on what you can find
[07:36:42] <Compu> maybe 1, dunno if the electrical system can handle 2
[07:36:53] <locodashie11> they aren't too crazy on power

[08:05:03] <Compu> locodashie11: cuz torrenting omg
[08:05:10] <locodashie11> there are a perfecly large ammount more things networks can be used for other than illegally
[08:05:10] <ShivalPonyWolf> its a big issue here becuase theres no legal services
[08:05:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> well there are now
[08:05:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> so its changing
[08:05:21] <locodashie11> I know torrenting
[08:05:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> but for the last few years
[08:05:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> most bandwith usage is spam and torrent data
[08:05:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> youtube then took in a big chunk
[08:05:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> and now that netflix is finnaly here thats taking up a massive chunk
[08:05:59] <Compu> ShivalPonyWolf: also gaming
[08:06:38] <locodashie11> I'm pretty sure most games don't use much bandwidth other than initial downloads
[08:07:43] <Compu> i wouldnt be surprised if itunes takes up a decent chunk
[08:08:03] <locodashie11> that makes sense too
[08:08:04] <Compu> also spotify and google play music might be getting up there
[08:08:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> the 1st week of netflix there was a 50gbits spike in network useage
[08:09:20] <Compu> vudu might take a decent chunk too
[08:10:14] <Compu> oh and cant forget amazon and steam

[08:10:41] <locodashie11> also, add twitch in there too
[08:10:54] <Compu> amazon has so much power that it is literally impossible to successfully DDoS them
[08:11:22] <locodashie11> 'impossible to ddos' doesn't sound like anything I'll really ever believe, heh
[08:11:26] <Compu> like honestly they must have enough bandwidth to download 1 TB in 1 second
[08:11:42] <locodashie11> sounds perfectly doable

[14:18:08] <sleumas2000> because there are lods of IRCd s
[14:18:21] <sleumas2000> (just for me and a couple of mates)
[14:32:46] <Shutter> Eh, depends what you want from an IRCd really
[14:32:55] <Shutter> Pretty much any would do the job ...
[14:33:00] <sleumas2000> well
[14:34:50] <sleumas2000> the only thing that would be useful is if it could either log everything from when a user DCs until they come back and PM it to them when they reconnect, or if it supports services (preferably with a library in another language to support easy coding, preferably a python library, or command line options, that could be called from anything) that could do it for them)
[14:34:51] <Shutter> On this network we use https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd
[14:34:52] <PinkiePieBot> [ inspircd/inspircd · GitHub ]
[14:35:10] <Shutter> Modular, easy to use and set up imo.
[14:36:09] <Shutter> I'm not aware of any ircds having a built in BNC at the moment
[14:36:28] <Shutter> Integrated services isn't terribly much used either. Just go for anope or one of the atheme forks.
[14:37:38] <Shutter> As for modular, it's easy to extend on inspircd if you know C++. One guy made a patch to add support for python modules but it was never merged.
[14:38:45] <sleumas2000> it needn't be a built in bouncer
[14:39:49] <sleumas2000> it could just PM a small fuckton of lines at someone when they connect

[19:55:48] <JustAberrant> like, XP used to be pretty good about that.. 
[19:56:13] <JustAberrant> I suspect any time now it'll be like.. "yo, we installed some updates, that's what all that grinding shit was about..."
