[06:00:35] <Moonlightning> Hmmm
[06:00:41] <Moonlightning> Python's `int`s are arbitrary-magnitude
[06:00:59] <Moonlightning> Couldn't it have similarly made its `float`s arbitrary-precision and -magnitude?
[06:01:50] <Moonlightning> By defining them not as the traditional floating-point number, but as a sort of fraction thing?
[06:01:58] <Moonlightning> Not unlike its fractions.Fraction, I guess
[06:02:11] <Moonlightning> But without strictly integral parts

[07:47:16] <Phase4> did you know: the windows registry supports transactions?
[07:47:28] <Phase4> as does ntfs, infact you can have a transaction that spans both
[07:47:35] <Moonlightning> a…wat?
[07:48:17] <Moonlightning> isn't that a bit like saying “did you know, these two separate and independent databases both support transactions…in fact, you can have a transaction that spans both”?
[07:48:48] <Phase4> it is, until you learn about the 'distributed transaction coordinator'
[07:49:11] <Phase4> it can span the filesystems, registries, and databases of every machine in a domain
[07:51:18] <Phase4> AppleDash, there is a remarkably small number of biomes on the server
[07:51:24] <mniip> isn't registry just a file?
[07:51:44] <LegionRed> lol
[07:51:46] <Phase4> mniip, in the same way sqlite databases are just a file
[07:52:21] <mniip> well the fact that a transaction can include files, and content of a specific kind of file
[07:53:20] <Phase4> mniip, registry transactions are implemented separately to ntfs transactions
[07:53:57] <Phase4> it may make use of ntfs transactions but i suspect otherwise

[08:06:30] <mniip> how did you get he-- ah
[08:06:36] <icelesstea> Yes.
[08:07:16] <mniip> is C even popular nowadays
[08:08:20] <icelesstea> Popular might not be the word. It certainly is wide spread and widely used, but it's not really hip, hop and happening.
[08:08:24] <mniip> everything seems to be written in abominable languages like php or java
[08:08:47] <mniip> shall I write mine in visual basic?
[08:08:50] <icelesstea> Try Rust, they're finally reaching stablish state.
[08:09:33] <icelesstea> Rust seems like a language that'd fit you.
[08:09:43] <mniip> I think I'll prefer the power of C
[08:10:03] <mniip> the thing I'm writing involves a good amount of system hacking and binary processing
[08:10:29] <icelesstea> What are you writing?
[08:11:10] <mniip> it's a secret :3
[08:11:35] <icelesstea> You're such a tease ;3
[08:11:59] <mniip> what C build systems are hip nowadays
[08:12:32] <mniip> I don't feel like autoconfing
[08:13:59] <icelesstea> All you need to know is that it should be C to JS.
[08:14:03] <icelesstea> That'd be so hip.
[08:17:14] <icelesstea> Hack Cabal to do C.
[08:17:31] <mniip> then I'd build-depend ghc
