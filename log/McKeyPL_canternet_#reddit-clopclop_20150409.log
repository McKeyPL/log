[01:04:16] <stomper> which one do you guys like better - the more "human" ponies or the classic style from the show?
[01:04:28] <princesssluttershy> I like both
[01:04:40] <Melon_Phone> anthr 
[01:04:42] <Melon_Phone> mo
[01:04:45] <Melon_Phone> o
[01:04:52] <Melon_Phone> anthro ffs
[01:05:10] <stomper> i dunno i find the anthro ones kinda weird
[01:05:15] <stomper> but maybe its just me
[01:05:20] <Yetione> personally, depends on artist, but in general, I like more pony stlye (like in the show) (let's say show style impresses me more easily than anthro)
[01:05:54] <Melon_Phone> Equestria untamed is just plain weird
[01:08:28] <Yetione> I actually liked some of equestria untaimed pages

[01:12:05] <Drago> She is interestingly fun to play on super smash bros
[01:12:23] <stomper> do people actually buy wii u's
[01:12:35] <princesssluttershy> I have one
[01:12:46] <princesssluttershy> I've barely used it because I got it just before I moved
[01:13:07] <Vulpixbrew> I almost brouhgt one
[01:13:12] <Melon_Phone> I'll rather buy a n3ds and play smash than a wiiu
[01:13:16] <Vulpixbrew> when they had the Zelda special editions
[01:13:19] <Drago> That was rude stomper...
[01:13:26] <Melon_Phone> no it wasn't
[01:13:29] <Yetione> http://i.imgur.com/HWMQ65u.jpg
[01:13:31] <stomper> the only reason i can imagine someone buying it is smash bros
[01:13:39] <stomper> i mean cmon pcs have a lot more stuff
[01:13:42] <Melon_Phone> wink wakey!
[01:13:47] <Melon_Phone> waker*
[01:13:55] <stomper> but the wii u is cool for party games i guess
[01:13:55] <princesssluttershy> I got it for WW HD and MK8
[01:14:00] <Drago> I have it on 3DS
[01:14:24] <Melon_Phone> what's the new one that was announced last e3? 
[01:14:30] <Vulpixbrew> II have Smash Bros on 64
[01:14:42] <Melon_Phone> by myamoto himself 
[01:14:50] <princesssluttershy> I have Perfect Dark and Goldeneye on N64
[01:14:59] <Drago> Obviously people buy Wii U's though. 
[01:15:03] <Vulpixbrew> I need to play perfect dark
[01:15:10] <princesssluttershy> It's really good
[01:15:23] <Melon_Phone> smash, omega ruby and majoras mask is my n3ds wish list
[01:16:07] <stomper> i never played legend of zelda 
[01:16:14] <stomper> am i missing out?
[01:16:15] <Drago> i have smash, alpha saphire, link between worlds, majora's mask, emblem of fire and bravely default
[01:16:17] <princesssluttershy> They're really good
[01:16:29] <Drago> I would say you are.
[01:16:31] <Melon_Phone> I haven't either played them so I'm gonna
[01:16:38] <princesssluttershy> I personally don't like the ones on N64 and Skyward Sword though
[01:17:08] <Drago> Ocarina of time was one of my top 5 gaming experiences. Hell, it's actually in my n64 right now. I should play it.
[01:17:28] <Melon_Phone> although there only one game who's actually worth to play on 3ds 
[01:17:30] <stomper> Are there some emulators and stuff to play it?
[01:17:40] <princesssluttershy> I don't like it. I found the controls really derpy and it ruined the experience for me
[01:17:43] <Melon_Phone> buying other than it is games is pointless 
[01:17:47] <Melon_Phone> guys
[01:17:50] <stomper> animal crossing new leaf looks pretty cool
[01:18:19] <Drago> I have only played The Legend of Zelda, LoZ: a link to the past, and Ocarina of time, though.
[01:18:22] <Melon_Phone> pales in comparison
[01:18:40] <Melon_Phone> guys
[01:18:43] <Melon_Phone> nintendogs
[01:18:45] <Drago> I haven't started link between worlds or MM on my 3ds yet
[01:18:57] <princesssluttershy> WW is REALLY good
[01:19:09] <Vulpixbrew> Japan makes Mood tails that wag when your happy
[01:19:13] <princesssluttershy> It's the best 3d Zelda game imo
[01:19:27] <Drago> Sweet. 
[01:19:34] <Drago> I dunno why I haven't started it yet.
[01:19:39] <Melon_Phone> Vulpixbrew, wanna see something else that wags when I'm happy? 
[01:20:38] <Vulpixbrew> its by the same people who made the ears
[01:20:44] <Vulpixbrew> and Melon pls
[01:20:44] <Drago> I am weird. I usually wait until I can dedicate all my gaming time to 1 game in particular. But I have been jumping around from game to game lately ever since I beat dante's inferno a couple weeks ago
[01:21:12] <Melon_Phone> yee visceral games studios
[01:21:29] <stomper> im stuck with league of legends and csgo

[01:37:20] <stomper> http://i.imgur.com/6ljND.jpg
[01:37:29] <Drago> Saints started out to be just like GTA, but you build your gang and take out other gangs. Sants 1 and 2 were almost identical to a GTA game. 4 is when it went over the top. In Saint's the third you still needed a car if you wanted to get around
[01:38:13] <Vulpixbrew> 3is where they really put on the humor though
[01:38:40] <stomper> my fav moment is when you jump with the parachutes into the pool or whatever
[01:38:48] <stomper> that was pretty epic
[01:38:59] <stomper> in the third
[01:39:21] <Drago> In my head, you are still in a coma and saints 2 and 3 were a dream. Then when saints 4 came out that ruined the possibility of my twist lol. I had that thought because the games kept getting more and more crazy.
[01:39:41] <Drago> I need to replay the third. I don't recall much of it
[01:39:53] <Drago> ohhh wait nvm

[01:44:21] <Vulpixbrew> one I payed with an one I put up to keep
[01:44:28] <Drago> Every game is gonna look better on PC if your shit is good enough, right?
[01:44:43] <princesssluttershy> Drago, I played it on my 4 year old laptop
[01:44:47] <Katiepony> Not if they port it horribly
[01:44:51] <stomper> well for the price of a console you can build a much better pc
[01:44:58] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[01:45:13] <Drago> I used to be good with computers before I started playing baseball seriously. Then I never got back to being a tech wizard
[01:45:15] <Vulpixbrew> and for a like $50 you can get a ton of games

[01:54:22] <princesssluttershy> no but I think of triangles when I think of the triforce
[01:54:29] <Drago> lol
[01:54:34] <Katiepony> Rarity isn't triangle butt
[01:54:36] <princesssluttershy> and triangles make me think of illuminati 
[01:54:52] <princesssluttershy> Then I remember that there were 2 half life games
[01:54:58] <princesssluttershy> and only one ricochet game
[01:55:08] <princesssluttershy> and that 1+2=3
[01:55:13] <Drago> dont
[01:55:16] <princesssluttershy> half life 3 confirmed
[01:55:16] <Drago> lol jk
[01:55:32] <Vulpixbrew> Gaben delays Half Life 3 by 2 monthes eeverytime  HL# joke is made
[01:55:55] <Drago> I will never understand
[01:56:47] <Drago> that half life 3 confirmed thing. One of those things that I am just lost about lol
[01:57:04] <Drago> All I have is what I can imagine:P
[01:57:05] <princesssluttershy> There were two half life games
[01:57:11] <princesssluttershy> that were really good
[01:57:16] <princesssluttershy> people want a third one
[01:57:45] <Drago> Obviously
[01:57:52] <stomper> "claps"
[01:57:53] <stomper> flawless explanation
[01:58:02] <princesssluttershy> and it's been a really long time since half life 2 came out
[01:58:17] <Vulpixbrew> plus that hending
[01:58:22] <Vulpixbrew> ending*
[01:58:32] <Drago> I just don't get how it has persisted for so long and permeated fecking everything lol. 
[01:58:36] <princesssluttershy> I haven't actually seen the ending of episode 3
[01:58:39] <princesssluttershy> 2*
[01:58:55] <Drago> I don't know a single thing about half life
[01:59:10] <princesssluttershy> you should play them
[01:59:13] <princesssluttershy> they're really good
[01:59:16] <Katiepony> I know half a thing about single life.
[01:59:28] <stomper> i lasted around 30 mins in half life game and got bored
[01:59:37] <stomper> but that was about 4 years ago 
[01:59:43] <stomper> maybe i should try them again
[01:59:49] <princesssluttershy> They're really good
[01:59:59] <princesssluttershy> the second one is better than the first imo 
[02:00:03] <princesssluttershy> but they're both amazing
[02:00:16] <stomper> ive watched speedruns for half life 1
[02:00:40] <Drago> what the fuuuuck
[02:00:53] <Drago> $40 million in production for HL2 o_O
[02:00:53] <princesssluttershy> I would rank them both higher than LoZ WW (which was my previous #1 game)
[02:00:54] <stomper> valve dont really have to make a new half life game they earn enough money from steam
[02:01:24] <Drago> better than loz and wow...
[02:01:42] <stomper> how much money did rockstar games earn from gta v when it was first released
[02:01:57] <stomper> i think it was a s**t ton
[02:02:06] <Drago> maybe 6 years ago.
[02:02:34] <stomper> wow it's 3 am here
[02:02:41] <princesssluttershy> Drago, i PLAYED THE HALF LIFE GAMES LAST YEAR
[02:02:47] <princesssluttershy> Sorry caps

[02:11:16] <Drago> oh man, I DL'd that back when it ws open beta and never got around to it
[02:11:38] <thaostra> Basically yes. There's no auto-aiming like on a console either because a keyboard and mouse are very precise
[02:11:45] <Drago> as if it was ever closed :l
[02:12:44] <Drago> Playing a FPS game on PC would probably change my mind. I bet it's pretty easy to get head shots :D
[02:13:07] <princesssluttershy> If you aim properly
[02:13:08] <Drago> I can;t imagine just clicking on something to shoot it that sounds so easy and awesome

[02:16:31] <Drago> lol
[02:17:01] <Drago> I had already hover zoomed it before looking at the second line
[02:17:07] <thaostra> Playing competitively in an FPS on PC can get pretty intense because everyone is moving quickly when a keyboard and mouse allows them complete control over where to hit and how fast
[02:18:20] <princesssluttershy> Like, I'm pretty sure if you put me up against a Cowwa doody MLG pro who played with an xbox controller and I had a keyboard I would probably win
[02:18:43] <Drago> Yeah thaostra, I have seen that. Kinda puts me off knowing all the tool assists and auto keying or whatever there is out there (that I have heard of)
[02:19:20] <Drago> I saw a video of battlefield 3 where some dude was getting so many head shots. had 200 something in 1 short game
[02:19:34] <princesssluttershy> Yeah that happened to me once
[02:19:45] <Drago> someone recorded it to report
[02:19:48] <princesssluttershy> he was banned half way through and the game didn't count to me overall score
[02:19:56] <thaostra> Drago, Well, tool assists and autokeying aren't really allowed in competitive play and are banworthy
[02:19:59] <princesssluttershy> my*
[02:20:30] <princesssluttershy> and there are hackers on console anyway 
[02:20:31] <Drago> That's good. Are theyban worthy in non-competitive games?
[02:20:38] <princesssluttershy> just look at MW2
[02:20:40] <thaostra> That depends on the server
[02:21:00] <princesssluttershy> in CSGO they're banworthy
[02:21:13] <princesssluttershy> otherwise it's up to server admins
[02:21:25] <Drago> I see. Thanks
[02:21:39] <princesssluttershy> (there are probably other games that work lice CSGO but that's the only one I play with a ban system like that)
[02:21:41] <thaostra> Tool assist and the like are highly frowned upon in the PC gaming community unless it's for accomplishing a feat based on speed alone, i.e., speedruns
[02:22:08] <princesssluttershy> TF2 allows scrips that hid view models and stuff
[02:22:13] <princesssluttershy> hide*
[02:23:12] <Drago> So you can be invisible and kill people? Or did I misread that? :P
[02:23:35] <princesssluttershy> your personal view model that only you can see goes invisible after you shoot
[02:23:47] <Drago> My terminology is terrible. I'm sure that's apparent.
[02:23:50] <princesssluttershy> I can make a quick video displaying it if you want
[02:23:55] <thaostra> Steam has anti-cheating mechanisms, so the chances of cheating and getting away with it are slim
[02:24:23] <princesssluttershy> *as long as you play on a server that is secured by VAC
[02:24:37] <thaostra> *which a lot of them are
[02:24:42] <princesssluttershy> true 
[02:24:55] <princesssluttershy> I think I've only played on like one server that wasn't secured by VAC
[02:24:59] <Drago> That's alright princesssluttershy. I don't know enough about TF2. Thank you very much for the offer :)
[02:25:06] <thaostra> Cheating ruins the fun for many people, so there's really no reason to disable it
[02:25:12] <princesssluttershy> host based games like CoD aren't covered by it I don't think

[02:50:21] <EbonMane> Hello
[02:51:44] <Katiepony> Hey ebbyhooves :3
[02:56:36] <y007ghg7> thaostra, macros are often used in PC gaming to do something easier than doing it normally
[02:56:58] <y007ghg7> I have one in CS:GO that fires my rifle, changes to pistol and back to skip the reload animation
[02:58:22] <Katiepony> I had an autorun macro back when I played DayZ. Turns out if I kept tapping W whilst using that macro, it would make me run a lot faster than other players sprinting normally.
[02:58:32] <y007ghg7> heh
[02:59:02] <y007ghg7> the only thing I have for dayz would be the buttons on the side of my mouse remap when I load the game to do things like open the map and such
[03:00:04] <thaostra> y007ghg7, Still technically tool-assist and thus cheating in a competitive playing context, even if it's not directly modifying game code
[03:00:22] <y007ghg7> I could do the same with the in game scripting that VALVe even allows
[03:00:40] <princesssluttershy> I find it's pretty easy to do that just by pressing "Q" quicky
[03:01:07] <y007ghg7> there were however some cheap as hell scripts that were used in tf2 that would allow an engineer to jump somewhere with his sentry and pick the sentry up at the same time
[03:01:12] <weisey> thaostra: scripting in csgo != cheating 
[03:01:12] <y007ghg7> VALVe patched that...
[03:02:20] <thaostra> weisey, Depends on the rules and regulations of the community, even if it's not directly banned by VAC
[03:02:35] <y007ghg7> VAC only bans if you modify the game exe/DLL
[03:02:45] <y007ghg7> not of you use a macro program/scripting
[03:03:04] <thaostra> "even if it's not directly modifying game code"
[03:03:56] <thaostra> bbl
[03:04:49] <y007ghg7> speaking of CS:GO lastnight me and some friends in mumble had a 4v4 comp match lastnight
[03:04:53] <y007ghg7> was pretty fun
[03:05:21] <weisey> thaostra: I don't think you realize, macros and scripts are used by pros too
[03:05:40] <weisey> They're allowed all except the bunnyhop script
[03:05:53] <y007ghg7> even Razer the gaming keyboard/mouse makers have macros for their hardware

[03:56:54] <Drago> Hey ArcticBunny :)
[03:56:56] <OmarianVolcae> Everything alright?
[03:57:18] <ArcticBunny> Hiii Drago :) :)
[03:58:32] <Drago> wow I am so far behind in what is going on in LoL
[03:59:00] <OmarianVolcae> You should pick up CS:GO and play with us :3
[03:59:05] <Drago> I just tried to catch up to 5.6 yesterday and now 5.7 is out lmao
[03:59:12] <OmarianVolcae> I picked it up a couple weeks ago and it's really fun.
[04:01:02] <Drago> How was your day Miss Bunny?
[04:01:55] <ArcticBunny> My day is going swell, Drago. I am hanging out, doing some writing. And how was yours?
[04:02:02] <ArcticBunny> Hopefully everyone had a good day :)
[04:03:06] * OmarianVolcae wrinkles his nose.
[04:03:17] <OmarianVolcae> My feet smell a bit from being closed up in boots all day long.
[04:03:30] <OmarianVolcae> It's getting warmer now, so my heavy winter boots are too hot.
[04:03:38] <ArcticBunny> I like boots
[04:04:51] <Drago> I left my boots at my friends house from back when we went camping at the lake. I hope they are still in the pack frame. I'll be pissed if his dog chewed 'em up.
[04:05:19] <OmarianVolcae> I wish I would wear more civilian style boots.
[04:05:30] <OmarianVolcae> But I have to wear 8" boots in uniform.
[04:06:43] <Drago> Mine are cowboy boots that I have had for about a decade. So comfortable.
[04:06:51] <Drago> What kind of uniform?
[04:07:03] <OmarianVolcae> ACU
[04:07:08] <OmarianVolcae> Army Combat Uniform.
[04:08:20] <princesssluttershy> My sister only wears old combat boots
[04:08:38] <Drago> The second greatest fighting force in the world :P

[06:58:11] <Flutterwhy4_2> Pretty sweet.  I got a promotion about a year ago.  Still going with the same gf I had met when I was last here, obviously not involved in clop anymore, but that's okay
[06:58:26] <Flutterwhy4_2> What's that?
[06:59:01] <cloppyhooves> Awesome that you're still together c:

[06:59:43] <plushie_pegasus> i'm back
[06:59:46] <Flutterwhy4_2> It's one of my favorite games of all time
[07:00:10] <Flutterwhy4_2> I actually made a top 100 list of my favorite video games a little while ago and uploaded it to youtube if you're interested
[07:00:52] <Flutterwhy4_2> The characters in that game are great
[07:01:01] <Flutterwhy4_2> and the visuals too
[07:01:41] <Flutterwhy4_2> I actually just played Ori And The Blind Forest which is not exactly the same, but vaguely reminds me of Dust
[07:02:13] <Flutterwhy4_2> just great visuals, a cute main character
[07:02:21] <Flutterwhy4_2> fun movement

[07:08:09] <Flutterwhy4> I had easter dinner with her family and her uncle is an actual racist. xD
