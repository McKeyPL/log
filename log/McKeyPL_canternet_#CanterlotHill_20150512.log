[00:29:47] <Sombra> And what's the point of writing a good fanfiction if no one reads it?
[00:29:50] <RandomNinja> 50 shades of blue could be a pulp drama

[01:21:21] <Sombra> doge is walked
[01:21:31] <SilentHoofsteps> cg
[01:21:57] <RandomNinja> other way around you mean
[01:22:02] <RandomNinja> upscale from 900p
[01:22:05] <thereallynewmop12100_> SilentHoofsteps: I hope there will be no blackouts tonight. 
[01:22:13] <Araxnus> Twilightlicious: "Wolfenstein: The New Order" does that too.
[01:22:35] <Twilightlicious> Thats not how i've seen it worded, RandomNinja 
[01:22:37] <RandomNinja> changing resolution? what is this, Netflix?
[01:22:40] <Twilightlicious> Though, i assumed the same thing.
[01:22:55] <Araxnus> No. Games runs at 1080p. But will go down in some parts of they game.
[01:22:56] <RandomNinja> yeah but downscaling is pretty silly unless for AA 
[01:23:04] <Twilightlicious> Perhaps theyre wording it my way for Marketing purposes, but i've seen it labeled as "1080p with dynamic scaling"
[01:23:06] <thereallynewmop12100_> The Blackout will honestly won't go to overtime until 10pm EDT. if it happens. i will watch Global's West Coast Feed 
[01:23:24] <RandomNinja> upscaling to 1080p+ resolutions?
[01:23:41] <RandomNinja> can xbone output higher resolutions?
[01:23:45] <Araxnus> Again see "Wolfenstein: The New Order"
[01:23:52] <Araxnus> They did it too.
[01:23:54] <Twilightlicious> I think it's technically possible at a hardware level
[01:23:58] <Twilightlicious> but currently no.
[01:24:16] <Twilightlicious> i read the Xbox One's hardware can output up to 2k res, or something.
[01:24:39] <Twilightlicious> something along those lines.
[01:25:06] <Araxnus> See the trick is to do 1080p. But not turn down settings to get it. I can run 1080p 60fps on any game with almost any hardware. But the settings would need to be tuneded down
[01:25:23] <RandomNinja> yeah but consoles don't have that
[01:25:27] <RandomNinja> because graphics
[01:25:36] <RandomNinja> and lack of hardware to run said graphics
[01:25:48] <Twilightlicious> I also believe most people can't tell the difference between 1080p and 900p, even when side by side.
[01:26:29] <Araxnus> Do that on a console and you will see it. Everyone would whine about the game not have good graphics.
[01:27:04] <RandomNinja> "graphics don't matter, gameplays does" *runs games at 30 fps for better graphics*
[01:27:12] <Araxnus> Twilightlicious: Not 900p vs. 1080p. The thing I said btw ;)
[01:27:43] <Araxnus> Since 900p is not a PC res. I could not tell you
[01:27:46] <Sombra> I can...
[01:27:49] <RandomNinja> it can be :P
[01:28:10] <Twilightlicious> thats what console games need
[01:28:13] <RandomNinja> every resolution is a pc resultion if you want it to :P
[01:28:20] <Twilightlicious> a setting "1080p with terrible graphics, 900p with good graphics"
[01:28:34] <Araxnus> Now I can say I had Titanfall on Max on my PC. Then played on Xbox One. I got massive frame drops on it.
[01:28:54] <Twilightlicious> What about Xbox 360 ;P
[01:28:56] <Twilightlicious> It had Titanfall
[01:29:05] <Twilightlicious> a shaderless, SNES Resolution  quality version
[01:29:08] <Araxnus> Twilightlicious: Yup. Pretty much. Odds are it would just be a shader and lower AA
[01:29:26] <Twilightlicious> yeah you wouldnt need to touch textures or models or anything really, just shaders
[01:29:44] <RandomNinja> Araxnus, consoles have AA?
[01:29:53] <Araxnus> Twilightlicious: Oh. 360. Titanfall ran better on it then on One.
[01:29:58] <Twilightlicious> I don't think any console games really use AA.
[01:30:14] <RandomNinja> FXAA at best
[01:30:24] <RandomNinja> which is heresy
[01:30:27] <Araxnus> SMAA I think. 1 or 2x.
[01:30:36] <RandomNinja> huh
[01:30:40] <Twilightlicious> they would rather up the resolution than enable AA
[01:31:02] <RandomNinja> well resolution > AA pretty much always
[01:31:08] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> I just found out
[01:31:14] <Araxnus> Thing is if they are not running AA. That is a bit sad. As I wonder where the power is going
[01:31:22] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Either SNS is on a long hiatus or that its finished for good
[01:31:34] <Araxnus> At higher res lower AA is needed.
[01:31:55] <Araxnus> But 1080p most games on PC you need some form.
[01:32:17] <Araxnus> 4K not really any. 1x SMAA if that even
[01:32:33] <RandomNinja> AA is for removing jaggies
[01:32:55] <RandomNinja> higher resolution does the same thing and show more details but is not always possible
[01:33:02] <Twilightlicious> Jaggies arent visible if the resolution is high enough to be greater than your vision lol
[01:33:08] <RandomNinja> yeah exactly
[01:33:14] <Araxnus> Now on Crysis 3. Do I need 8x MSAA. No. Do I run it. Yes :p
[01:33:30] <Sombra> That's very difficult to do, considering the resolution of the human eye.
[01:33:30] *** Parts: DiamondHeart (qtskyejexqg@Pony-9vq4tk.user.ono.com) ()
[01:33:33] <RandomNinja> but that depends on pixel density, a 4K 80" screen will still benefit
[01:33:35] <Araxnus> Am I a silly filly. Oh yeah!

[01:35:41] <Sombra> If the screen was a perfect square the resolution would have to be 25,000x25,000 pixel desity for you to not be able to tell the difference.
[01:35:45] <Twilightlicious> thereallynewmop12100_, you must live near me
[01:35:45] <Hamtramck> I don't really like antialiasing.
[01:35:51] <Hamtramck> I prefer hard pixel edges for various reasons.
[01:35:56] <Twilightlicious> not if i'm half blind :3
[01:36:02] <SilentHoofsteps> Araxnus: don't worry you're not alone
[01:36:04] <RandomNinja> no AA is good for some things
[01:36:07] <RandomNinja> games are not one of them
[01:36:17] <Araxnus> SilentHoofsteps: Yay. lol
[01:37:56] <Sombra> Not because you could actually focus on each individual pixle, in fact of the entire view of the human eye only a very small circle of it, about 1/12 of your vision is able to see at such high resolution, but the entire screen would have to have that resolution to change from different focal points, depending on what the movie, or game was trying to get you to focus on
[01:38:32] <Hamtramck> I hate DOF effects too.
[01:38:35] <RandomNinja> ^
[01:38:41] <RandomNinja> DOF is just obnoxious
[01:38:44] <Hamtramck> In general I think most post-processing loks really bad.
[01:38:59] <Araxnus> Wayyy to much math for me sorry
[01:39:00] <Sombra> Right
[01:39:06] <RandomNinja> AA is usually at least part mid-processing :P
[01:39:19] <Sombra> It's better that they just leave the entire view at maximum resolution, and let you pick which point you focus on the most.
[01:39:20] <RandomNinja> MSAA downscales textures and models, then add shaders
[01:39:35] <RandomNinja> SSAA renders the entire image and downscales
[01:39:48] <RandomNinja> Sombra yes
[01:39:48] <Sombra> Which makes sense, objects in real life are never "out of focus" your eye just brings its attention to one small area at a time rapidly.
[01:40:01] <Sombra> What I hate even more than DOF is motion blur.
[01:40:04] <RandomNinja> unless you can figure out some kind of eye-tracking
[01:40:28] <RandomNinja> eh, I like small amounts of corner blur
[01:40:39] <RandomNinja> nothing more though
[01:40:57] <Sombra> It just bothers me.  Considering that it takes up MORE graphic processing power to do it, and its just makes things look slower.
[01:41:12] <Sombra> If the frame rate is high enough, my eyes will naturally blur the image as I look side to side.
[01:41:14] <Hamtramck> Motion blur is stupid.
[01:41:34] <Hamtramck> IRL motion blur happens because your retinas like... get slight burn in.
[01:41:53] <Hamtramck> This happens if you're looking at an image on on a screen too, so you're naturally getting subtle, realistic motion bur just because of how your eyes work.
[01:42:04] <Hamtramck> Motion blur on top of that is like emulating how bad movie cameras work or something.
[01:43:10] <RandomNinja> yep
[01:43:17] <Sombra> That's why I love 100+hz refresh rates, its like the opposite of motion blur.
[01:43:43] <Araxnus> G-Sync ;)
[01:44:08] <Sombra> I have one of the few monitors that can do that but I have no idea what it's good for.
[01:44:31] <Sombra> Monitor can do 144hz, can game do 144hz? Check? K, its play at 144hz
[01:44:46] <RandomNinja> adaptive v-sync on the monitor end, isn't it?
[01:44:51] <Sombra> idk
[01:44:58] <Araxnus> Yes it is
[01:45:05] <Sombra> What's adaptive v-sync
[01:46:47] <RandomNinja> regular v-sync locks the graphics card's output to that of the monitor tp avoid screen tearing. If the graphics card can't keep up, it lowers the cap to a fraction of the monitors (1/2, 1/3...)
[01:47:57] <RandomNinja> adaptive v-sync only locks the framerate if it exceeds that of the monitor, to avoid too low framerate caps
[01:48:22] <Sombra> Well, idk what good that's for.  I only have a 750ti, and I can play bf4 at 144hz just fine
[01:49:03] <RandomNinja> it's good for people who want vsync but sometimes drop below
[01:49:44] <Sombra> I guess.  Of course, its a very intensive process.  your graphics card has to be able to run at 144hz, your monitor, and you have to be able to run the game at 144hz
[01:50:28] <Sombra> Otherwise... I guess the monitor/graphics card could keep up at 144hz, but the game could only get uh... idk, 100fps
[01:50:34] <Sombra> But 100fps is pretty bawlin.
[01:50:51] <RandomNinja> that would cap you at 72 FPS with regular Vsync though
[01:51:14] <RandomNinja> so adaptive is preferable
[01:51:32] <RandomNinja> of course, I play without vsync anyway, because it feels more responsive
[01:51:32] <Sombra> So you're saying that unless a game can do 100% of the refresh rate, it will set the refresh rate at 50%
[01:51:49] <RandomNinja> yes, because the monitor can't change it's update rate
[01:51:56] <RandomNinja> it can show each picture twice though
[01:53:16] <Sombra> You could just change the frame rate to 100hz
[01:53:35] <RandomNinja> yeah but you'd have to do that in advance
[01:54:29] <Sombra> No problem.

[04:52:15] <Eywind> let's go back, back in time
[04:52:22] <Sombra> Did anyone else secretly that there was nothing wrong with cadence she just grew up and turned into a betch.
