[16:37:14] <DataByte> he went out yesterday with someone else, and wouldn't say who - she wanted to know who the "other other mistress" was
[16:37:37] <DataByte> he replied that he does have other friends that are not female
[16:38:29] <DataByte> to this i injuncted "oh, so he goes both ways, then"

[20:00:21] <JustAberrant> :(
[20:05:15] <Twilightlicious> i'll give you a hug for it
[20:05:33] <Twilightlicious> is it PAL or NTSC? Or am i living in the 90s and this no longer matters?
[20:05:37] <Blackjack> I do not accept hugs for payment :(
[20:05:41] <Blackjack> I don't think it matters
[20:06:04] <JustAberrant> it does if you have a PAL video card and want to use an `merican monitor :(
[20:06:29] <Twilightlicious> I don't think there is such a thing as a PAL Video card
[20:06:34] <Twilightlicious> lol
[20:06:36] <Blackjack> I'm a bit confused... Googling the model number yields a 720p TV that looks like mine
[20:06:38] <Blackjack> But mine is 1080
[20:06:46] <Twilightlicious> How do you know yours is 1080
[20:06:47] <Blackjack> I know because I used it as a PC monitor for 2 years and drove it at 1080
[20:06:54] <JustAberrant> yeah, better count the pixels
[20:06:56] <Twilightlicious> Downscaling is a thing
[20:06:59] <JustAberrant> mighta got ripped off :(
[20:07:11] <Twilightlicious> 720p TVs support 1080p input
[20:07:25] <Blackjack> But when my PC powered on, in the corner it said "1080p 60hz"
[20:07:48] <Twilightlicious> Thats just the input it was reciving
[20:07:48] <JustAberrant> that probably just speaks to the input
[20:07:53] <Twilightlicious> :P
[20:07:54] <JustAberrant> the output is basically fixed
[20:08:15] <JustAberrant> if you feed it 600x800 it's gonna upscale it to it's native resolution
[20:08:16] <Twilightlicious> The value of your TV just decreased <3 Lol~
[20:08:31] <Twilightlicious> half a hug
[20:08:38] <JustAberrant> it can't change the number of pixels based on input ;p
[20:09:02] <JustAberrant> so there would be no reason to display the (consistent) native output ;p
[20:09:16] <Blackjack> I just looked
[20:09:26] <Blackjack> Even on the back of the display it says 1080...
[20:09:36] <JustAberrant> :(
[20:09:38] <Twilightlicious> What's the model number?
[20:09:49] <Blackjack> I got it from WalMart, it's not like I got it from some shady Chinese dealer or something
[20:10:05] <Twilightlicious> Walmart is a shady chinese dealer.
[20:10:09] <Blackjack> Not really
[20:10:16] <Twilightlicious> i bought a tablet from walmart once that was still half in chinese
[20:10:21] <JustAberrant> yeah
[20:10:24] <Twilightlicious> and didn't contain half the contents the box claimed
[20:10:27] <JustAberrant> walmart isn't a shady chineese dealer
[20:10:57] <JustAberrant> it's a ruthlessly efficient logistics and distribution system which happens to have a retail frontend... which connects you to the shady chinese dealers
[20:11:44] <Twilightlicious> Not to mention 90% of the products in walmart: Made In China
[20:11:47] <Twilightlicious> =p
[20:12:09] <Blackjack> They don't sell products with like fake stickers over the real ones that say better specs, though.
[20:12:38] <Twilightlicious> What is zee model number
[20:13:28] <Blackjack> RCA RLED2969A
[20:14:34] <Twilightlicious> oddly enough that brings up a bunch of links from Canada.
[20:14:57] <Blackjack> I think RCA is a Canada-only brand or something?
[20:15:26] <Twilightlicious> it wasnt like 10 years ago
[20:15:34] <Twilightlicious> but i will admit i haven't seen RCA in the US since like 2005
