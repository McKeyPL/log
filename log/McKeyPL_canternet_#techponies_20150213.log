[16:50:51] <Moonlightning> I've used Ubuntu for quite a while now with no major issues
[16:51:16] <Moonlightning> Besides a severe lack of driversâ€¦but that was on a PowerBook G4. My fault for using obsolete hardware. :p
[16:52:27] <wolfyshy> I like my PowerBook G4 :(
[16:52:31] <wolfyshy> it runs Gentoo pretty well
[16:53:08] <Kinsley> I think the biggest issue I have is trackpad related. Two things with that, really. One is that you can't use the disable "button" outside of Windows because reasons? And there's another weird bug where the trackpad scroll area can somehow copy and paste text outside of the user's clipboard.
[16:53:46] <wolfyshy> ubuntu is a fine distro though and it works pretty well but it's like windows/os x, it's not really customisable or tuneable
[16:54:37] <Kinsley> Perhaps not to the same extent as with other distributions, but I think I can tweak Ubuntu a helluva lot more than I can tweak either Windows or OS X.
[16:54:58] <Kinsley> Granted, I've also not used OS X since 10.6
[16:56:29] <wolfyshy> I stopped using OS X with 10.9, because the wifi drivers were busted in 10.9

[20:32:07] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[20:32:11] <Moonlightning> But there's no memset() call here
[20:32:13] <Moonlightning> Just __clear_user()
[20:32:26] <Moonlightning> Andâ€¦I can't be sure that it's not interpreting its arguments weirdly or something
[20:32:44] <johnsey> ah
[20:32:52] <johnsey> it doesn't do all of it, look at iterate_and_advance
[20:33:09] <johnsey> it depends on what's passed as iter type
[20:33:35] <johnsey> Moonlightning: I was assuming you're looking at iov_iter_zero?
[20:33:49] <Moonlightning> johnsey: no; zero_iovec()
[20:34:16] <johnsey> ok, then you're looking at a different kernel version
[20:34:22] <JustAberrant> btw, __clear_user is in asm-generic/uaccess.h
[20:34:46] <JustAberrant> and yeah, it basically just calls memset
[20:34:47] <Moonlightning> That's a header file, though; it can't be /implemented/ thereâ€¦?
[20:35:00] <JustAberrant> sure it can be
[20:35:03] <JustAberrant> it's a static inline
[20:35:14] *** Quits: Datalink_ (Datalink@Datalink) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[20:35:36] <JustAberrant> in other words, your clear_user call pretty much gets replaced with itr
[20:35:38] <JustAberrant> * it
[20:35:47] <Moonlightning> â€¦I don't have an `asm-generic`. >.<
[20:36:06] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant, johnsey: what version? I have 3.18.7
[20:36:21] <johnsey> ah, i was looking at 3.19
[20:36:27] <JustAberrant> /usr/src/linux-3.12.13-gentoo/include
[20:36:34] * JustAberrant really aught to like.. upgrade :D

[20:38:54] <JustAberrant> hehe
[20:38:57] <DataByte> that looks heavy
[20:42:32] <JustAberrant> random: the most "data" I've ever printed, was a 10m disk image
[20:43:18] <JustAberrant> I was trying to figure out how this archaic file system for this old processing box worked 
[20:43:32] <JustAberrant> and basically had no utilities besides hexdump to really dig into it
[20:44:14] <JustAberrant> so I printed that fucker out and splayed it out over a conference room table 
[20:46:05] <Moonlightning> â€¦wait a second
[20:46:12] <Moonlightning> Where is the access check in here? ._.
[20:46:25] <JustAberrant> you mean __must_check ?
[20:46:45] <JustAberrant> or access_ok ?
[20:46:46] <Moonlightning> â€¦what does that mean?
[20:47:13] <JustAberrant> what do YOU mean *glares*
[20:47:15] <Moonlightning> zero_iovec() calls __clear_user() directly, bypassing the access check that clear_user() does
[20:47:24] <Moonlightning> And it doesn't seem to do any checking itself
[20:47:48] <JustAberrant> what would it check ;p
[20:48:18] <Moonlightning> If the current user is allowed to write to that memory?
[20:48:26] <Moonlightning> Because this is kernel code, which can write anywhere, right?
[20:48:44] <JustAberrant> sure, but it's all within the kernel
[20:49:41] *** Neptune|sleep is now known as Neptune
[20:49:56] <Moonlightning> â€¦wha?
[20:50:47] <JustAberrant> it's not like you can give it an arbitrary chunk of memory to zero out

[20:51:53] *** Joins: ChaoticRift (ChaoticRift@Pony-jf7icb.md.comcast.net)
[20:53:12] <Moonlightning> __clear_user() doesn't do any checks in its body at all.
[20:53:32] <Moonlightning> I'm looking at it. It's literally two lines, a memset() and a return statement.
[20:54:08] <Moonlightning> So it would have to be this `__must_check` thing in its headerâ€¦?
[20:54:13] <Moonlightning> Again, what does that /do?/
[20:54:44] <JustAberrant> my point was, what scenario do you see where an access check is required, given how it gets to that point
[20:55:22] <Moonlightning> â€¦how does it get to that point?
[20:55:44] <JustAberrant> you tell me, your coding this ;p
[20:56:34] <JustAberrant> also I have no idea wtf __must_check does
[20:56:38] <JustAberrant> look at linux/compiler.h
[20:56:41] <johnsey> it's a gcc macro
[20:56:43] <JustAberrant> it's preprocessor soup
[20:57:14] <johnsey> #define __must_check            __attribute__((warn_unused_result))
[20:57:38] <johnsey> it's just in that header file to define it according to your gcc version
[20:57:39] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: like I said, I'm just copypasting functions, changing the `zero`es in their names to `one`s, and changing the second argument of memset() calls to 0xff

[21:50:40] *** Joins: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning)
[21:51:00] <Lapsus> there have been large reliability studies that I know of on 3.5" drives, but not laptop sized ones
[21:51:01] <DataByte> well, for a laptop, if you really want bang, you can go hybrid or full-ssd... but most storage for price will be platter
[21:51:20] <DataByte> manufacturer.. haven't a clue
[21:51:34] <DataByte> i don't trust them much, anyway - always keep a backup
[21:51:52] <Kinsley> Specifically, I want to know if I'd be best off with, for e.g. a 750 GB 7200 RPM drive would be faster in general than a 1TB+8GB SSHD where the 1TB drive still spins at 5400 RPM.
[21:52:38] <DataByte> yes - 8gb ssd is a tiny cache
[21:52:48] <DataByte> but they can help boot speeds.. that's about it
[21:53:17] <Lapsus> I'm not a fan of hybrid drives, but that's just me
[21:53:20] <Lapsus> I don't see the point
[21:53:21] <Kinsley> I could give a shit about boot speed.
[21:53:36] <DataByte> ^
[21:53:39] <DataByte> same, lol
[21:53:39] <JustAberrant> I think that depends so heavily on what you want to do
[21:53:48] <Kinsley> That laptop is painfully slow with anything that touches disk I/O.
[21:54:03] <Kinsley> If I torrent, launching apps takes like, 30 seconds.
[21:54:23] <JustAberrant> personally for a laptop I'd go with a small SSD.. because not having to worry about moving it, the lower power consumption, and the lower noise to me would be more valuable than the space
[21:54:31] <JustAberrant> and I don't really live off a laptop like some do
[21:54:48] <JustAberrant> I see them more as a quick temporary thing, so I don't mind having a limited amount of space on them
[21:54:51] <DataByte> i'd personally recommend the 7k drive - i had a 5k for a while, and actually noticed a bump when i got a 7k
[21:54:54] <Kinsley> This is a movie laptop. A small SSD isn't an option.
[21:55:11] <DataByte> external 2tb usb 3.0
[21:55:16] <Kinsley> I will NOT go lower than 500GB, period.
[21:55:17] <DataByte> what i do ;)
[21:55:27] <Kinsley> And I have an external USB 3.0 drive.
[21:55:35] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: so then I'd go for the best capacity
[21:55:39] <DataByte> for things like movies, usb3.0 is great
[21:55:46] <Kinsley> I know.
[21:55:49] <JustAberrant> with caching, 5200 rpm probably isn't going to be noticed much
[21:55:50] <Kinsley> I have one of those drives.
[21:56:07] <Kinsley> I know the cache on the current drive is 8MB.
[21:56:38] <DataByte> sounds like a hardware cache more than an ssd cache xD
[21:57:28] * JustAberrant runs small SSDs in most of his boxes but has a sizable spinning disk file server.. but obviously not an option for everyone and not portable if that's what you are going for
[21:58:04] <DataByte> huh.. so 8gb is actually normal.. i winder why they still make them that small?
[21:58:21] <DataByte> *wonder
[21:58:22] <DataByte> xD
[21:58:42] * JustAberrant wanders off in search of food
[21:59:58] <Kinsley> Probably a combination of cost and space. Putting 8GB of relatively fast NAND flash into an existing HDD package isn't that hard.
[22:00:14] <Kinsley> And since you're only buying a couple of NAND packages per HDD...
[22:02:36] <Lapsus> Intel's ssd caching thing supports a max of an 8gb ssd :p
