[04:47:10] <samonuh> I couldn't not I mean
[04:47:34] <pone^3> that depends on what you mean by "couldn't"
[04:48:01] <samonuh> Well, if I didn't I'd lose my internship
[04:48:09] <samonuh> Yea, I could decide to not wear it
[04:48:49] <pone^3> what I'm trying, poorly, to get at is that jobs which require suits almost universally suck in my personal opinion
[04:49:13] <samonuh> It was alright I suppose
[04:49:16] <samonuh> if it were paid

[04:55:48] <pone^3> I mean, what's stopping him?

[22:33:15] <Unfortunatelynotlost> Did he find out?
[22:33:24] <Melon_Phone> marinade them in sriacha

[22:33:49] <Giggles> And he wasn't home
[22:34:22] <Unfortunatelynotlost> Brutal Melon, brutal xD
[22:35:27] <Giggles> I wouldn't do that cause it would only hurt his girlfriend. :I
[22:36:41] <Melon_Phone> so your friend keeps his girlfriend's sex toys at his place?  
[22:37:10] <Melon_Phone> does she know about that or does she wonder where her dildoes have gone off to?
[22:37:32] <Giggles> Yeah she knows. She practically lives with him. :P
[22:37:59] <Giggles> and I think she would be uncomfortable keeping them on campus, where she lives.
