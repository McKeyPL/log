[16:05:25] <Doodles> Hi there. I'm having some difficulty watching the stream. I thought I had AdBlock configured correctly, but all i am getting is a blank screen instead of the broadcast.
[16:06:45] <Googie> This is the Canternet help channel. We deal more with helping with issues related to the service that runs the chat. Not really even sure which stream you are talking about to be honest :P
[16:07:12] <Doodles> *facehoof*
[16:07:33] <Googie> Hehehe, don't worry. Just hope you get it fixed in time.
[16:08:21] <Doodles> really would be useful to have a channel devoted to stream issues.
