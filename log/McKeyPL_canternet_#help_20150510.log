[14:05:54] <Rayvyn> reasons for bans
[14:11:10] <Shutter> What?
[14:11:10] <Twili> Somepony said it was I say, a person's rights end exactly there where another person's rights begin. It might have been Pinkie though.
[14:12:34] <Rayvyn> left chat on overnight woke up banned 
[14:12:52] <Shutter> Clearly not from the network. You're in here, after all.
[14:13:37] <Rayvyn> then why cant i use the irc chat 
[14:14:23] <Shutter> If you got banned from a specific channel I can't help you with that.
[14:14:40] <Shutter> Talk to the ops of whatever channel you got banned from.
[14:15:07] <Rayvyn> i just wanted to know why and where to go for help
[14:16:23] <Shutter> MmmBacon0[NLR] is the one who banned you. Go talk to them I guess.
[14:16:34] <Rayvyn> how?
[14:16:34] <Twili> Ponies say how is it going
[14:17:16] <Shutter> Leave them a memo, for instance. http://atheme.net/help/7.1/MemoServ.html
[14:18:30] <Shutter> Actually reading the channel backlog you probably don't need to do that.
[14:18:34] <Shutter> "<MmmBacon0[NLR]> I'll remove it tomorrow."
[14:18:39] <Rayvyn> this is all new to me so sorry for sounding stupid
[14:19:11] <Shutter> Eh, it's because you was pinging out and in all the time
[14:19:15] <Shutter> So they got tired of the spam
[14:21:39] <Rayvyn> oh sorry like i said its all new and i didnt realize closing the window would log me out most of the time i did it by accident
[14:21:58] <Shutter> Rayvyn: Seeing that join/quit spam, might I suggest you try the free IRCCloud package instead of Mibbit? That would at least help some on that (as they with the free package allows you to be connected for two hours while gone)
[14:22:02] <Shutter> https://www.irccloud.com
[14:22:26] <Shutter> Alternatively, if the PC keeps running just use a local client.
[14:22:36] <Rayvyn> sorry
[14:24:10] <Shutter> Hey no problem for me, I don't care. Just saying that it would make it easier for you to avoid similar situations in the future.
