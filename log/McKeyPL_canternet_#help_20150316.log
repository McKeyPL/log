[06:00:27] <GreenHelper> How do I make someone a Second Owner?
[06:00:53] <Colgate> as in, 100% equal control of the channel, or just having the "~" ?
[06:01:32] <GreenHelper> like have two owners?
[06:02:19] <Colgate> yes, I'm trying to determine what you mean by owners
[06:02:28] <GreenHelper> +q
[06:02:43] <Colgate> /chanserv flags #channel user +q
[06:03:22] <GreenHelper> And this will make them Perm Owner?
[06:03:52] <Colgate> if they don't have op status already, you may want to do "/chanserv flags #channel user sop" first
[06:04:07] <Colgate> then they get all the flags of SOP  + the ~
[06:04:54] <Colgate> it doesn't make them owner of the channel, that is the +F chanserv flag(someone with this flag can remove you as owner as they have complete control over the channel, you have been warned)
[06:06:26] <GreenHelper> It works
[06:06:31] <GreenHelper> Thank you Colgate
