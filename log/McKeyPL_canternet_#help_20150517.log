[05:31:57] <Googie> Why do you ask ?
[05:32:14] <Datguy> But I just got a tell directed for someone else 
[05:32:15] <Datguy> [20:01] -DerpyBot-: Oh, hi Jon-The_Bronynerd! RandomNinja just gave me this message for you: words
[05:33:00] <Datguy> Well, not just. But seems like a that shouldn't happen. 
[05:33:23] <Datguy> Thought maybe one of you know who Derpybot's owner is and could pass that on.

[15:27:54] <WestJ> This is a popular function called "Tell" or "Notes"
[15:28:08] <WestJ> Bots can be told to store messages for users who are offline
[15:28:15] <WestJ> When you come online, the bot PMs you the message
[15:31:56] <Googie> WestJ: It looks like a case of the bot giving the message to the wrong person though
[15:32:37] <Googie> Memoserv is the "correct" way to send messages generally.

[16:28:31] <Datguy> Haha I know what irc tell is, just that message was definitely not intended for me
[16:30:48] <Unixkitty> I'm fairly certain it's DerpyBot's thing to randomly mail to wrong people from the same channel.
[16:31:29] <Unixkitty> And for your information, it is not exactly a services bot
