[04:58:50] <ponder> That sounds like a good recommendation
[04:59:02] <Squirrelly> Yup
[04:59:19] <ponder> I just bought it at a convenience store
[04:59:36] <ponder> the old lady didn't seem to know what I was asking about. :P
[04:59:48] <Katniss> I got Bad Dragon cumlube
[04:59:56] <ponder> that sounds fun
[04:59:59] <OmarianVolcae> xD
[05:00:15] <OmarianVolcae> You asked a lady at a convenience store for lube advice?
[05:00:21] <Squirrelly> rofl
[05:00:41] <ponder> Nono, I just looked at what the durex website said, and saw what the store had, and asked her for the specific type
[05:00:58] <ponder> She was like looking at the condoms until I told her it was the blue bottle.
[05:01:08] <Squirrelly> haha
[05:01:31] * OmarianVolcae pokes ponder in the tailhole with his hoof.
[05:02:30] * ponder is not ready to try fisting yet
[05:03:11] <ponder> yet
[05:03:18] <OmarianVolcae> x3
[05:03:23] <OmarianVolcae> I was just playing.
[05:03:31] <OmarianVolcae> I'd prefer to put something else in there.
[05:03:40] <ponder> Like a penis?
[05:03:45] <Katniss> eww pervs
[05:04:00] <OmarianVolcae> Yish
[05:04:01] <ponder> You like it
[05:04:02] <OmarianVolcae> A penis.

[05:52:14] <Katiepony> I'll put it back in the freezer.
[05:53:56] <Quinn> speaking of
[05:54:08] <ponder> I tried masturbating with the lube. Can't say it was that much more interesting than normal. Cleanup was more of a hassle
[05:54:17] <Quinn> my friends, a lesbian couple, moved back to the area
[05:54:26] <Suzi> kool
[05:54:31] <Quinn> ponder: I can't do it without lube
[05:54:44] <ponder> Are you circumcised?
[05:54:49] <Quinn> sadly yes
[05:55:03] <Suzi> awh :(
[05:55:04] <ponder> I've heard that lube is pretty much a necessity for masturbation when you're cut
[05:55:15] <Katiepony> That's what I've heard, too.
[05:55:19] <ponder> I just use my foreskin, has worked pretty well for me up til now
[05:55:21] * Vulpixbrew_Laptop is cut and only uses lube every now and then
[05:55:24] <Quinn> it holds true for me
[05:55:39] <Katniss> I'm cut, not true for me
[05:55:54] * cloppyhooves is NULL_POINTER_EXCEPTION
[05:56:02] <Suzi> i've never been with a circumsized guy
[05:56:07] <Katiepony> Me neither.
[05:56:08] <Squirrelly> LOL
[05:56:09] <Quinn> I think it depends on how severe the cut was
[05:56:10] <Katniss> But I'm weird or something, but I don't want to tell y'all the intimate details of my peepee, you all might be weirded out
[05:56:14] <Squirrelly> cloppy
[05:56:30] <ponder> I have a pretty weird peepee myself.
[05:56:43] <cloppyhooves> Yes Squirrelly? :o
[05:57:25] <SleepPon> please don't? lol
[05:57:47] <Suzi> any of u guys tried anal beads?
[05:57:50] <Squirrelly> I just laughed really hard at what you said
[05:57:57] <cloppyhooves> :D
[05:58:07] <ponder> I have not
[05:58:33] <Quinn> I have
[05:58:44] <Suzi> I'm contemplating getting some. Are they any good?
[05:59:23] <Vulpixbrew_Laptop> I have
[05:59:27] <Vulpixbrew_Laptop> I liked them
[05:59:29] <Quinn> I think some circumsisions they cut more of it than others, that's what I read anyway
[05:59:54] <ponder> I'd think cutting any part of it away is cutting too much
[05:59:58] <cloppyhooves> One of the guys I've played with said he actually couldn't masturbate with lube
[06:00:04] <ponder> unless it is for medical reasons
[06:00:10] <cloppyhooves> Wait, no, it was a girl
[06:00:23] <cloppyhooves> She's uncut
[06:00:33] <cloppyhooves> And said she couldn't feel anything 'cause it got too slippery
[06:00:58] <Quinn> yea that happens to me
[06:01:01] <Quinn> just gotta deal with it
[06:01:04] <Quinn> cause it's uncomfortable otherwise
[06:01:09] <Suzi> awh :(
[06:01:20] <Quinn> can literally tear the skin just from masturbating once
[06:01:23] <Quinn> without lube
[06:01:40] <SleepPon> EW STOP
[06:01:49] <Katniss> nothxbai
[06:01:59] <ponder> According to Penn and Teller's Bullshit, there's some way to grow the foreskin back. It takes some years, but apparently it is possible
[06:02:26] <Suzi> this conversation is difficult to masturbate to

[06:02:31] <Quinn> yea it is possible
[06:02:46] <Quinn> it's painful and difficult though
[06:02:47] <ponder> I'm sorry Suzi
[06:02:52] <Quinn> you have to tug on it all day al the time
[06:02:53] <Suzi> lol
[06:03:06] <ponder> Are you a goose, Suzi?
[06:03:10] <Vulpixbrew_Laptop> well this convo took an odd turn
[06:03:33] <Suzi> is a goose a sex thing?
[06:03:56] <ponder> Nah, it is a Game Grumps reference
[06:03:59] <Quinn> I wish I had a foreskin ;-;
[06:04:06] <Suzi> oooo
[06:04:11] <Quinn> but my parents apparently thought chopping part of my penis off would make me go to heaven
[06:04:11] <Quinn> so
[06:04:22] <ponder> You could play with mine, Quinn, if that's any consolation.
[06:04:31] <Quinn> it's fun but not the same
[06:04:33] <Vulpixbrew_Laptop> yes lets all agree to play with ponder 
[06:04:50] <ponder> Yes.
