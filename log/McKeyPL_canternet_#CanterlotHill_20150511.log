[03:58:50] <RandomNinja> yeah but that's like the hypothetical situation that Araxnus isn't silly
[03:58:58] <RandomNinja> it's unpossible beyond discussion
[03:59:03] <Night_Killer> well thats a known fact though

[04:01:03] <Hamtramck> I mean I feel like anything over 60 FPS would look weird since I don't think people usually animate with that in mind?
[04:01:09] <Araxnus> Hamtramck: Low End PCs. But they want a smooth 60fps.
[04:01:10] <Night_Killer> thats on all my games and whilst running 7 windows at the same time lol
[04:01:37] <RandomNinja> I imagine 30 fps on consoles is what they're going for
[04:01:43] <Hamtramck> Also you don't want Cave's shmups running at a constant 60FPS :P They get unplayable.
[04:01:57] <Hamtramck> But yeah I've seen some games running at 60FPS and they look like they're running to fast.
[04:02:10] <Night_Killer> i use a 2 in 1 toshiba radius laptop, really great computer/tablet
[04:02:14] <RandomNinja> that's only because you're not playing yourself
[04:02:36] <RandomNinja> games will feel more and more responsive and smooth well beyond 100 fps
[04:02:48] <Araxnus> 780 Ti is a $700 GPU. The avg gamer does not need it. Nor is the game maker designing for that power. They want games to run on lower end stuff too. Like a 750 Ti.
[04:03:02] <RandomNinja> also, some games are actually made for a specific framerate and DO in fact run too fast on higher framerates
[04:03:14] <Hamtramck> Yeah, like Cave's shmups :P
[04:03:22] <Hamtramck> They were designed with slowdown on the original arcade hardware in mind
[04:03:25] <Night_Killer> i can play stuff like that cause i have a equally compatible mouse that runs 175 fps on its own and its a gaming/programing mouse
[04:03:33] <Hamtramck> So certain bullet patterns become impossible without that slowdown
[04:03:52] <RandomNinja> hardmode :P
[04:03:57] <Hamtramck> Also fighting games are really sensitive to running at a specific framerate
[04:04:07] <Night_Killer> ive yet to try to see what happens if i overclock my laptop though 
[04:04:18] <Araxnus> Unless you got a 144hz screen anything over 60 is pointless. vSync is your friend.
[04:04:45] <RandomNinja> not really, input lag is still a factor
[04:04:48] <Araxnus> But if one did have that screen. Omg. 144 is so smooth
[04:04:49] <Night_Killer> thats true lol
[04:05:04] <RandomNinja> also, >not overclocking your monitor :P
