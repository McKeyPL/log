[05:40:24] <Twilightlicious> makes you not want to buy it, and instead just get the 50 lol

[06:47:13] <AppleDash> Is there any reasonable reason to use C instead of C++?
[06:48:10] <Webster> If you need maximum throughput, or there are no C++ libraries for the architecture you're using.
[06:48:23] <AppleDash> Define "throughput"
[06:48:28] <Webster> Or minimum space usage.
[06:48:35] <mniip> Webster, any C library can be used in C++
[06:48:38] <Webster> Uh, fastest processing.
[06:48:47] <mniip> AppleDash, OOP and other means of structuring your program
[06:48:49] <AppleDash> I think he means libc, mniip
[06:49:04] <mniip> oh wait, C over C++?
[06:49:04] <AppleDash> mniip: I'm asking why I would use C over C++, not the other way around
[06:49:16] <mniip> if you need less OOP bullshit and structuring
[06:49:19] <AppleDash> lol
[06:49:28] <mniip> also C code is more easily embedded with assembly code
[06:49:40] <mniip> C++ introduces some rather indirect stuff
[06:49:45] <Webster> mniip: I'm talking about if generally C++ isn't supported on a certain microcontroller or such.
[06:49:51] <mniip> ah
[06:49:53] <mniip> yeah
[06:50:05] <Webster> Although I think these days the common ones have C++ support.
[06:50:07] <mniip> that would be weird though
[06:50:15] <mniip> you can totally make GCC translate C++ into C
[06:50:33] <mniip> hmm there's still libstdc++
[06:50:48] <Webster> Yeah, usually due to not being able to use GCC or similar for whatever weird uc you're using.
[06:51:30] <Webster> Also, C is better if you don't like C++. >_>
[06:52:32] <AppleDash> lol
[07:04:29] <Phase4> s/if.*e //
[07:04:33] <Phase4> awww, no regex bot
[07:04:38] <Phase4> PinkiePieBot, y u no regex
[07:05:45] <Phase4> AppleDash, "[..] why I would use C over C++ [..]" because C++ is rather dysfunctional, you end up using a subset of the language that's c + the class keyword
[07:06:01] <AppleDash> Hm
[07:06:15] <Phase4> or your code becomes an impenetrable mess of templating and boost
[07:06:20] <Webster> Heh.
[07:06:47] *** Joins: cyborg_ar (cyborgar@Pony-440.7gu.25.181.IP)
[07:07:19] <Webster> I've been thrown into a mess of code that was basically 5k+ lines of C in a single file that did the bare minimum to make use of some C++ libraries.
[07:07:52] <Webster> Actually more than that originally, I think. Miserable either way.
[07:08:07] <cyborg_ar> shit
[07:08:13] <cyborg_ar> 5k lines in a single file?
[07:08:19] <Webster> At least.
[07:08:38] <cyborg_ar> you sure they didnt pipe the output of cpp into a file?
[07:08:47] <Phase4> AppleDash, std::string is really fun
[07:08:52] <Webster> Yeah...
[07:08:57] <Phase4> it's a rather trivial class, and doesn't have, say, .split()
[07:09:04] <Phase4> so everyone subclasses it
[07:09:14] <Phase4> now you've got two incompatible string classes
[07:09:18] <AppleDash> lol
[07:09:22] <AppleDash> I've been reformed from that
[07:09:32] <cyborg_ar> std:* is pretty fun in some sadistic ways
[07:09:48] <AppleDash> I was taught to make a method instead, say string_split(), that takes a string and a delimiter and returns a vector or array or something
[07:10:12] <cyborg_ar> which is the object oriented way, and the whole point of encapsulating strings in a class
[07:10:17] <AppleDash> Maybe even put it in a StringUtils class and call it as StringUtils::Split("Hello World", " ") to return ["Hello", "World"]
[07:10:17] <Kinsley> Phase4: write the module yourself.
[07:10:18] <cyborg_ar> or something like that
[07:10:21] <cyborg_ar> lol
[07:10:36] <Phase4> Kinsley, now you have three incompatible classes
[07:10:54] <Kinsley> Funnily enough, regex actually solved my problem today.
[07:11:09] <cyborg_ar> why would the class be incompatible though?
[07:11:50] <cyborg_ar> in theory you should be able to cast a subclass into it's base class
[07:12:03] <Phase4> into the base class, but not other sub classes
[07:12:44] <cyborg_ar> subclassA -> baseclass -> subclassB?
[07:12:45] <Phase4> it depends on them accepting std::string on their public api, which will most likely result in a cast, thus a new instance
[07:12:48] <cyborg_ar> :3
[07:13:05] <Kinsley> Though I was referring to earlier, the complaint about Pinkie not doing the regex s/// thing
[07:13:49] <cyborg_ar> why should pinkie do regexes?
[07:13:54] <Phase4> and boost is a joy
[07:13:57] <cyborg_ar> she makes cupcakes
[07:14:05] <JustAberrant> :)
[07:14:09] <Phase4> "launch 4 threads, now you can start instancing the factories needed for io"
[07:14:13] <cyborg_ar> which are better
[07:14:49] <JustAberrant> Phase4: waz wrong with that ;p
[07:15:01] <cyborg_ar> ^java
[07:15:04] <JustAberrant> most of my network code ends up being 4 threads :(
[07:15:04] <cyborg_ar> lol
[07:15:14] <JustAberrant> async is for wussies
[07:15:29] <Phase4> JustAberrant, no epoll on your platform?
[07:15:45] <Kinsley> Real programmers use a magnetized needle and a steady hand?
[07:15:56] <JustAberrant> I like to have a block queue for input and output
[07:16:05] <cyborg_ar> :) cheap forks
[07:16:16] * Lapsus hands Kinsley a powerful magnet
[07:16:17] <JustAberrant> so there's 2 threads right there (for the consumers)
[07:16:49] <JustAberrant> my solution to everything is pretty much blocking queue all the things
[07:17:01] <JustAberrant> its my hammer.. and the world is a nail
[07:17:24] <Phase4> http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2012/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b017742d249d5970d-800wi.jpg
[07:17:36] <JustAberrant> bahaha, awesome :>
[07:18:17] <Phase4> JustAberrant, but really, most modern platforms have proper in-kernel io loops
[07:18:41] <JustAberrant> yeah, but I still tend to end up dispatching stuff out to other threads
[07:18:44] <Phase4> windows having completion ports which are a single purpose subset of poll
[07:21:05] * JustAberrant has cyborg_ar watch an instructional video on how to read a water meter for 6 days straight
[07:21:50] <AppleDash> :(
[07:23:22] * cyborg_ar removes threading support from JustAberrant's OS
[07:24:36] <Phase4> actually i will complain. you don't give a completion port handles to poll, you associate the handle with a completion port and it pushes events into it
[07:24:36] * cyborg_ar adds heuristics to detect and terminate processes that attempt to implement green threads in JustAberrant's computer
[07:25:27] <Phase4> which means not only do you have no generic way to watch a handle, it's also remarkably limited in what handles it'll take. sockets, files, and job objects
[07:25:41] <Phase4> notice how events are missing from this list, despite them being first class kernel objects on windows
[07:26:09] <Phase4> completion ports are also bound to a process for no adequately explained reason and care how many threads you want to wait on
[07:26:29] <Phase4> and i'm done
[07:26:33] <Phase4> continue
[07:26:38] <cyborg_ar> Phase4: i dont think even MS kernel hackers&architects have access to all of the source and/or it's documentation

[08:04:51] <AppleDash> OK

[08:05:48] <Kinsley> :D
[08:05:52] <AppleDash> Lapsus: That would honestly probably be viable
[08:06:07] <AppleDash> There are still people with shit internet
[08:06:33] <Lapsus> Phase4: honestly, I don't think shipping would be too bad assuming a usb stick in a photo mailer or something
[08:06:37] <nscoots> this seems better a decade ago but still rather viable?
[08:07:19] * nscoots is still rather partial to usb sticks and has shit interweps
[08:07:53] <Lapsus> Well, a decade ago I would have been a customer rather than a client, but considering I have 130mbit internet now I think I could pull it off?
[08:08:00] <AppleDash> lol
[08:08:13] <AppleDash> Lapsus: let's do it
[08:08:31] <Lapsus> I'd bet it'd work great for large games like the upcoming gta5 at 60+ gb
[08:08:41] <AppleDash> Yeah
[08:08:49] <Kinsley> Or huge collections of videos.
[08:08:59] <Kinsley> *cough cough*
[08:09:04] <AppleDash> videos
[08:09:22] <nscoots> 60+ gigs.... 
[08:09:26] * nscoots blinks...
[08:10:33] <cyborg_ar> hmm microsd cards are light enough to fit in a postcard weight bracket (20 grams)
[08:10:50] <Lapsus> actually that's a very good idea
[08:10:53] <AppleDash> ^
[08:10:55] <cyborg_ar> that's around a dollar worldwide
[08:11:02] <Kinsley> Problem: tracking
[08:11:03] <Lapsus> slow, though
[08:11:08] <Kinsley> Also slow.
[08:11:10] <Kinsley> But tracking
[08:11:14] <AppleDash> Perhaps we could let people choose what they want - microsd, usb flash, or external hard drive
[08:11:35] <Lapsus> Yeah come to think of it we'd need to have a tracking number for each one
[08:11:45] <AppleDash> Tracking isn't that expensive though
[08:11:49] <Lapsus> large microsd cards aren't cheap enough to lose in the mail and not care
[08:11:54] <AppleDash> Indeed
[08:11:58] <cyborg_ar> might be viable to set up an office in shit internet places
[08:12:05] <cyborg_ar> send an M sack to each
[08:12:18] * nscoots goes off on a tiny rant about how Lapsus could be a high bandwidth ISP.... delivering a pallet of hdd's every few days.... who cares about latency...
[08:12:37] <Lapsus> cyborg_ar: Possible, but it's not yet economically viable seeing as I'm poor
[08:12:39] <Lapsus> :p
[08:12:40] <Kinsley> Introducing 1 Tbps!
[08:12:52] <cyborg_ar> getting a torrent over a couple tens of GB takes over a week here
[08:12:53] <Kinsley> * Terms and conditions apply
[08:12:54] <cyborg_ar> easy
[08:13:05] <cyborg_ar> also for aus, it would easily go over the monthly cap
[08:13:17] <cyborg_ar> such isp i mean
[08:13:26] <Lapsus> We'd also need an easy way to get the files the users want, either as a url submitted by the user or something else
[08:13:40] <AppleDash> Yeah
[08:13:49] <cyborg_ar> magnet link
[08:13:51] <AppleDash> I think there would be 2 separate ways
[08:13:52] <Lapsus> cyborg_ar: I have to have my 100/10 package because the next cheapest option has a 200gb cap :c
[08:14:03] <AppleDash> Simple downloads, a URL
[08:14:11] <Lapsus> cyborg_ar: A lot of ISPs throttle torrents, though
[08:14:14] <AppleDash> More complex downloads, a list of instructions to get the download
[08:14:24] <cyborg_ar> hehe shipping a single 1TB hard drive would be faster than that, even if it took 5 months to arrive
[08:14:54] <cyborg_ar> makes one think
[08:15:03] * nscoots is pretty sure even with shit interweps with a 1980's download manager that no pony seems to have anymore could arrive much faster...
[08:15:31] <Lapsus> Assuming we buy drives wholesale at some point, then charge retail for them, it could also be a little extra profit :v
[08:15:39] <cyborg_ar> maybe front as a store that sells mass storage devices from a super fast internet location, but you can ask them to be preloaded with content of your choice
[08:16:27] <AppleDash> I think we need to start small :P
[08:16:30] <cyborg_ar> in the 200gb cap case, it would take much longer to load it up once it arrived than have it loaded in america
[08:16:31] <AppleDash> See if there's interest
[08:16:37] <cyborg_ar> oh!
[08:16:40] <cyborg_ar> server
[08:16:52] <cyborg_ar> have the drive be in a vps
[08:16:58] <cyborg_ar> user can do whatever with it
[08:17:10] <cyborg_ar> and have an eject button that gets the drive mailed to the user
[08:17:13] <AppleDash> You know what, that may not be a bad idea
[08:17:22] <AppleDash> It would probably be a windows VPS though
[08:17:27] <cyborg_ar> "withdraw hard drive"
[08:17:33] <Lapsus> haha
[08:17:38] <AppleDash> Are you writing this down Lapsus
[08:17:55] <Lapsus> how do we prevent people from using the service as a seedbox before withdrawing the drive though
[08:18:08] <cyborg_ar> limit upload bw
[08:18:10] <AppleDash> Yeah
[08:18:16] <AppleDash> Cap upload to like 1Mbps
[08:18:17] <Lapsus> I don't want DMCA stuff, I just want to be a sneakernet provider
[08:18:26] <AppleDash> Or even 100k
[08:18:31] <AppleDash> To make it completely useless as a seedbox
[08:18:38] <Lapsus> no little kids running MC servers off the boxes :v
[08:18:46] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (ChaoticRift@Pony-5fhbss.7h3b.037j.000a.2601.IP) (Quit: Oops, a kernel panic)
[08:18:47] *** Joins: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning)
[08:18:51] <AppleDash> Also, impose a reasonable limit of a couple of days
[08:18:59] <cyborg_ar> hmm
[08:19:03] <Lapsus> the problem with windows vpses would be licensing issues for the os installs
[08:19:11] <nscoots> seed boxes seem to have fallen off? although that may very well be a case of rising income rather than legal availability finally arriving on demand w/o commercials...
[08:19:16] <Kinsley> Single OS, multiple users?
[08:19:18] <AppleDash> windows loader.exe
[08:19:21] <Phase4> Lapsus, i think the datacenter edition allows unlimited vms
[08:19:28] <Phase4> but it's also very expensive
[08:19:35] <AppleDash> I would not pay for a license
[08:19:38] <Lapsus> also I was thinking more of being able to cache frequent requests so I don't spend like 6 weeks constantly redownloading the latest game release
[08:19:42] <AppleDash> lol
[08:19:48] <Colgate> datacenter license is unlimited VMs yeah, it is also ~5k$
[08:20:04] <cyborg_ar> how about this, have the DC be a sneakernet "hub", people can freely copy content from drives that are in the system, and everyone can mail in or out their drives
[08:20:25] <cyborg_ar> the only internet traffic would be file commands and a little bbs
[08:20:36] <cyborg_ar> no data would travel over the internet
[08:20:38] <cyborg_ar> only metadata
[08:20:43] <Lapsus> cyborg_ar: having free access to files in the systems means a raid by the rcmp for running a filesharing site
[08:20:48] <cyborg_ar> that would probably anger the nsa
[08:20:55] <AppleDash> lol
[08:21:06] <cyborg_ar> but you dont know what's in the files
[08:21:13] <cyborg_ar> they could be huge chunks of 0s
[08:21:15] <nscoots> the NSA does have access to high explosives loaded on drones...
[08:21:21] <nscoots> perhaps best to be fearful
[08:21:36] <Lapsus> I have access to explosives on a drone, those lipos scare me
[08:21:39] <Lapsus> lol
[08:21:40] <AppleDash> lol
[08:21:42] <cyborg_ar> HAHHAA
[08:21:48] <cyborg_ar> maybe that's what the NSA uses
[08:22:05] <AppleDash> For simple URL downloads it would be manually done by us, the VPS would only be needed for complex downloads like a steam game
[08:22:09] <cyborg_ar> they have a relay that shorts the crappiest chinese lipo they could find, overcharged to the brim
[08:22:21] <Lapsus> seriously, a 3s 5Ah lipo would make a great incindiary weapon
[08:22:27] <AppleDash> lol
[08:22:53] <Lapsus> Once I get new batteries I'll try that with my old ones, cyborg_ar
[08:22:57] <AppleDash> Lapsus: I know someone who can write the website
[08:23:04] <Lapsus> is it shutter
[08:23:08] <Lapsus> lol
[08:23:12] <AppleDash> no
[08:23:50] <cyborg_ar> i wonder if someone would set a plane cargo compartment on fire with a slightly modified laptop surrounded by polyester clothing
[08:24:26] <Phase4> would or could?
[08:24:28] <AppleDash> that's called a bomb
[08:24:52] <cyborg_ar> lol
[08:25:10] <Lapsus> aw sneakernet.ca is taken
[08:25:11] <Lapsus> lol
[08:25:14] <cyborg_ar> well it would be more plausible than making the thing explode with sunscreen
[08:25:16] <AppleDash> lol
[08:25:19] * nscoots raises a hoof about could understanding being very different than would...
[08:25:21] <AppleDash> Lapsus: use porni.es
[08:25:26] <Lapsus> lol no
[08:25:36] <AppleDash> You wanted a use :P
[08:25:42] <cyborg_ar> hahah
[08:25:45] <Lapsus> that's for porn, not business
[08:26:03] <cyborg_ar> hoofnet.ca?
[08:26:35] <Lapsus> Ideally a name that wouldn't cause controversy and attract negative attention
[08:26:55] <Lapsus> I won't be approaching the bank asking for a small business loan for hoofnet.ca
[08:26:55] <Lapsus> lol
[08:27:10] * nscoots labels lapsus  "blackface homophobe banker"
[08:27:11] <AppleDash> Why would a loan be needed in any case
[08:27:43] <Lapsus> AppleDash: Do you seriously expect me to start buying a stock of drives and arranging shipping contracts out of pocket?
[08:27:45] <Lapsus> I'm broke
[08:27:51] <AppleDash> Err
[08:28:06] <cyborg_ar> shoenet.ca?
[08:28:06] <Lapsus> at small scale yes it can be done on the fly
[08:28:07] <AppleDash> Generally, you do their stuff AFTER they pay
[08:28:17] <Lapsus> at large scale we'd need to have stuff in reserve
[08:28:24] <Lapsus> faster turnaround etc
[08:28:27] <cyborg_ar> and the brony version would be horse.shoenet.ca
[08:28:29] <cyborg_ar> heheh
[08:28:39] <AppleDash> Of course, but by then we'd have some money probably
[08:28:41] <AppleDash> from profit
[08:29:08] * JustAberrant looks in
[08:29:28] <JustAberrant> you know.. this kind of business discussion usually requires a couch and a bowl.. just saying ;p
[08:29:38] <cyborg_ar> hmmm
[08:29:57] <Lapsus> Yes, but I'm not goddamn forgetting to budget some money for me this time
[08:29:58] <Lapsus> lol
[08:30:35] <Lapsus> I've started too many businesses while forgetting to pay myself
[08:30:48] <cyborg_ar> hmm
[08:30:53] <AppleDash> lol
[08:30:56] <cyborg_ar> been thinking more about the metadata thing
[08:30:57] <nscoots> just abberant you might have to be moved to good advice list from "bad cable management"
[08:31:12] <cyborg_ar> it would be disruptive regulations wise
[08:32:11] * nscoots should not have said that...
[08:32:31] <nscoots> your cable management was fine just prolific....
[08:32:35] * nscoots admits to nothing
[08:32:40] <JustAberrant> :>
[08:32:43] <AppleDash> Lapsus: Let's get popular to the point where we can get an office and have 10Gbps ran to it
[08:33:37] * nscoots hopes to have JustAberrant's cable management some day
[08:34:00] <cyborg_ar> crowdsource! make people pass along a single hard drive, being recipients if they pay a deposit
[08:34:07] <JustAberrant> you guys would pretty much be dealing with LEAs all day ;p
[08:34:08] <AppleDash> lol
[08:34:34] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: Why?
[08:35:01] <JustAberrant> because at least.. all.. the URLs would be illegal content ;p
[08:35:05] <cyborg_ar> the thing with passing around hard drives is pretty much how child pornographers operate since they are banned from most of the internet
[08:35:23] <JustAberrant> ^ pretty much that
[08:35:24] <cyborg_ar> the visible one anyway
[08:35:27] <cyborg_ar> lol
[08:36:00] * nscoots hangs head on behalf of privacy...
[08:36:03] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: It would be made clear that by using the service, it's your problem if you DL illegal content
[08:36:31] <Lapsus> the thing I'm thinking is that I don't give a shit about illegal content because I'll have your full name and shipping address to hand off to whoever decides to subpoena me for it
[08:36:32] <Lapsus> :p
[08:36:40] <AppleDash> lol
[08:36:42] <cyborg_ar> but then you have to have some sort of dmca compliance to afford safe harbor status
[08:37:06] <nscoots> I miss privacy... I'm old enough to remember...
[08:37:06] <Lapsus> cyborg_ar: I can forward DMCA stuff to the user
[08:37:07] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: that hasn't exactly worked out for the likes of google and friends ;p
[08:37:18] * AppleDash shrugs
[08:37:42] <cyborg_ar> hmm
[08:37:42] <JustAberrant> and without an army of lawyers, they'll steam roller you regardless of what you put in your TOS
[08:37:50] <cyborg_ar> though it's less possible for you to get hit
[08:37:59] <cyborg_ar> since you're not making things publicly available
[08:38:04] <cyborg_ar> once it's gone through you
[08:38:07] <cyborg_ar> it's gone
[08:38:10] <Lapsus> Yeah I'll have to speak to a couple friends about the legal side
[08:38:17] <Lapsus> another reason I'd need the small business loan
[08:38:29] <AppleDash> I once checked my ISP's mailbox they gave to me
[08:38:31] <nscoots> child pornographers breath so clearly everypony that breaths? this is the argument I see far too often towards tor privacy etc... is all...
[08:38:42] <AppleDash> It was full of at least 100 DMCA complaints over the past 4 years from torrents I've downloaded
[08:38:47] * nscoots rabbles and shakes a broom
[08:38:50] <AppleDash> Apparenntly my ISP just sends them to me and doesn't care :D
[08:39:00] <Phase4> XD
[08:39:14] <JustAberrant> if it were me I'd want a lawyer on board early, but I'm a fairly risk adverse person ;p
[08:39:40] <AppleDash> I think that a lawyer would be gotten when a lawyer became needed
[08:39:47] <Lapsus> nscoots: I like privacy, but I also like not being sued into oblivion or arrested for something someone did with my service
[08:40:07] <Phase4> though to be fair, they'd have to give a for-profit entity their postal address, then use that service illegally
[08:40:12] <Lapsus> a lawyer would sadly be needed really early on
[08:40:17] <AppleDash> Lapsus: Alternatively I could just do all the downloading so I'm the one who gets sued and then arrested and then sued in jail
[08:40:21] <Phase4> i mean, you're asking for things to happen there
[08:40:45] * nscoots also does just not want to be sued
[08:40:51] <Lapsus> AppleDash: No, we'd need to form some sort of company so it gets fucked instead of us
[08:40:55] <AppleDash> lol
[08:41:05] <AppleDash> But like, would it not be my personal connection?
[08:41:12] * Phase4 would pay a few $1 to get his steam library shipped on permernant storage
[08:41:17] <Lapsus> lol
[08:41:17] <Phase4> a few #'
[08:41:19] <Phase4> $'
[08:41:20] <Phase4> bah
[08:41:26] <Phase4> i would pay mroe than $1
[08:41:29] <Lapsus> Phase4: how big is it :v
[08:41:40] <Phase4> Lapsus, big
[08:41:45] <AppleDash> how big is big
[08:41:56] <Phase4> one sec
[08:42:07] <Lapsus> we'd also need a way to download stuff from services that need logins like steam, I don't want to buy everything just to have it and back it up :v
[08:42:25] <cyborg_ar> maybe partner up with valve?
[08:42:33] <Lapsus> I could ask them
[08:42:34] <AppleDash> That is why the VPS idea ws suggested
[08:42:36] <AppleDash> was*
[08:42:42] <Lapsus> technically it'd be a content server
[08:42:46] <AppleDash> they could log in to their own steam
[08:42:50] <cyborg_ar> steam has a headless linux client
[08:43:10] <mniip> a headless client
[08:43:11] <Lapsus> lol, have a "download and compress all" option in the steam client
[08:43:12] <mniip> not linux-specific
[08:43:23] <cyborg_ar> but it does run on linux
[08:43:27] <cyborg_ar> :/
[08:43:31] <cyborg_ar> hehe
[08:43:32] <Phase4> https://i.imgur.com/jl73LL7.png
[08:43:53] <AppleDash> Phase4: we need numbers here, GB, TB
[08:43:56] <Phase4> also 1/3 of my library is steam compatible
[08:44:01] <Phase4> linux compatible'
[08:44:03] <Phase4> that's awesome
[08:44:22] <Lapsus> I do wonder how difficult it'd be
[08:44:29] <Phase4> AppleDash, i'd estimate ~400GB
[08:44:36] <Lapsus> we'd want to automate early and thoroughly
[08:45:01] <Lapsus> Phase4: bull. I have 360something and it's well over 1.5tb for all of it
[08:45:04] <Lapsus> :v
[08:45:08] <AppleDash> "Give us 100$ and your steam password" doesn't sound very legit
[08:45:09] <Phase4> also yeah steamcmd is a thing and it's easy to script, but some games need an account
[08:45:19] <Lapsus> lol AppleDash ues
[08:45:21] <Lapsus> yes
[08:45:53] <Phase4> Lapsus, last time i had the majority of it downloaded it was 300GB, a lot of it is smaller games
[08:46:01] <Lapsus> well, fair enough I guess
[08:46:06] <Lapsus> steam is big as hell
[08:46:52] * nscoots throws up hooves and flops over attempting to sleep
[08:50:04] <Lapsus> I think the main end problem is going to be just copying a whole fuckload of shit to a buttload of usb sticks
[08:50:08] <Lapsus> lol
[08:54:01] <cyborg_ar> usb stick bandwidth is not terribly remarkable
[08:54:08] <cyborg_ar> specially if they are used
[08:55:31] * JustAberrant starts an impromptu game of "see how much nacho cheese we can put on nscoots"
[08:55:48] <Lapsus> Well, we'd be buying new drives, formatting them, putting on the requested data, and then shipping them
[08:56:28] <Lapsus> assuming usb3, it wouldn't be /too/ awful?
[08:56:40] <Lapsus> it will get awful once it hits a bit of volume
[08:57:01] <Lapsus> one person can only plug in so many USB and sata devices at a time
[09:01:34] <cyborg_ar> i wonder how many usb3 PCI-E cards you can put in your motherboard
[09:01:36] <cyborg_ar> haha
[09:07:29] <JustAberrant> you can buy expansion busses that hold like 20 cards ;p
[09:10:02] <AppleDash> lol
[09:10:17] <Phase4> cyborg_ar, one per available pci-e lane, and with hubs a little over a hundred ports per-port
[09:10:17] <JustAberrant> I still think you guys are all insane ;p
[09:11:12] <JustAberrant> anything to do with moving arbitrary anything between people is basically legal soup
[09:27:12] *** Quits: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:28:35] <JustAberrant> also I've made myself an old fashioned.. except I had no orange bitters or even an orange, so I used orange extract
[09:28:45] <JustAberrant> and I put like 10 cherries in there cause cherries are awesome :D
[09:29:04] <JustAberrant> just though you should all know this
[09:31:52] <Moonlightning> I'm trying to set up gpg-agent
[09:32:08] *** Quits: Coco_Pommel (coco@Pony-l3n1m0.ma.comcast.net) (Quit: zzzzzz)
[09:32:26] <Moonlightning> The ponypage says there should be only one gpg-agent running at any given time. Okay.
[09:33:35] <Moonlightning> On startup, it writes an environment variable to a file, so that subsequently-started shells can read it back from that file and use the same agent
[09:33:57] <Moonlightning> But if that file's in my homedir, how the heck is my shell supposed to know whether to start a new gpg-agent?
[09:34:07] <JustAberrant> your shell init script?
[09:34:10] <Moonlightning> Yeah

[09:35:37] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: weird
[09:35:43] <JustAberrant> most programs create a socket
[09:36:39] * JustAberrant does not know anything about gpg or the agent it employs though
[09:36:51] * AppleDash employs JustAberrant as his GPG agent
[09:37:09] * JustAberrant is employed as a GPG agent by Apple_Bloom 
[09:37:12] <JustAberrant> * AppleDash 
[09:37:16] <AppleDash> :D
[09:37:35] <AppleDash> You must handle my decrypted key(s) and provide them to me upon request
[09:37:39] <JustAberrant> Apple_Bloom: please update your nickname so as it is unique from any commonly referenced users :(
[09:37:52] <JustAberrant> .. to say, at least 3 characters :(
[09:38:01] <AppleDash> :(
[09:38:03] <Lapsus> lol
[09:38:12] <JustAberrant> ... I would suggest  zq3Apple_Bloom ;p
[09:38:53] <Apple_Bloom> Huh
[09:38:55] <Apple_Bloom> Why? 
[09:39:19] <AppleDash> /nick JustAberrdash
[09:39:20] <Apple_Bloom> I'd rather not
[09:39:24] <AppleDash> To create confusion
[09:39:51] <JustAberrant> Apple_Bloom: I see :(
[09:40:03] <Lapsus> Apple_Bloom: He's being facetious :p
[09:41:17] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: it /does/ create a socket.
[09:41:33] <JustAberrant> ah, so then what is it that is the issue.. is?
[09:41:42] <Moonlightning> rainbow-dash:~ blackl% <~/.gpg-agent-info
[09:41:42] <Moonlightning> GPG_AGENT_INFO=/tmp/gpg-1pt8Az/S.gpg-agent:61780:1
[09:41:48] <Moonlightning> It makes a file like this, yeah?
[09:42:02] <Moonlightning> And my shell is supposed to source that file and export that variable.
[09:42:13] <AppleDash> OK?
[09:42:16] <JustAberrant> k
[09:42:21] <Moonlightning> Eventually, I'm going to reboot.
[09:42:24] <JustAberrant> makes sense so far
[09:42:33] <Moonlightning> The file will still be there, but the socket will not, nor will the agent have that PID.
[09:42:39] <JustAberrant> right
[09:42:40] <AppleDash> Umm, it will make a new file then?
[09:42:49] <JustAberrant> I presume that's what it uses to figure it needs to create a new instance
[09:42:49] <AppleDash> / overwrite the file
[09:42:56] <Moonlightning> No, it won't, because it will never have been started/
[09:43:02] <JustAberrant> and yeah, what AppleDash said
[09:43:07] <AppleDash> Isn't gpg-agent meant to be a service?
[09:43:17] <Moonlightning> It's a per-user thing.
[09:43:41] <JustAberrant> maybe it forks off a new instance the first time it's run and decides it's not running
[09:43:47] <JustAberrant> that's how a lot of user level stuff works
[09:43:50] <JustAberrant> (firefox, etc)
[09:43:58] <Moonlightning> It doesn't, though.
[09:44:12] <JustAberrant> I see :(
[09:44:23] <Moonlightning> I tried to launch two `gpg-agent`s, and I ended up with…two `gpg-agent`s. Which it says should not happen.
[09:44:31] <Moonlightning> So /I/ have to be responsible for making sure there's only one.
[09:44:42] <AppleDash> I think you should just hire JustAberrant

[09:49:16] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: I didn't have orange bitters, so I just used orange extract
[09:49:27] <JustAberrant> and I put like 10 cherries in it
[09:49:54] <JustAberrant> and knox creek bourbon (which I like very much)
[09:50:02] <JustAberrant> errr..
[09:50:10] <Kinsley> I think my dad's got a bunch of Knox Creek.
[09:50:25] <JustAberrant> knob creek
[09:50:29] <Kinsley> Yeah, that
[09:50:31] <JustAberrant> I.. actually had to look at the bottle
[09:50:36] <JustAberrant> drew a complete blank there
[09:50:42] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it's good stuff
[09:50:51] <Kinsley> I've got some Wild Turkey bourbons. The American honey and the 101.
[09:51:01] <AppleDash> I should go to bed
[09:51:34] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: where'd you get the -f bit from?
[09:52:22] <Moonlightning> https://gist.github.com/BlacklightShining/a718e5892d81be7e5b38/raw
[09:52:29] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: like did something tell you to do that, or is it your own idea?
[09:52:45] <JustAberrant> ah
[09:52:54] <Moonlightning> Putting the `eval` line under an `else` was the only thing that was my idea
[09:53:24] <Moonlightning> I did that because without it, I'd get a new `gpg-agent` every time I launched a shell
[09:53:25] <JustAberrant> do you have the GPG_TTY line anywhere?
[09:53:43] <Moonlightning> No.
[09:54:20] <JustAberrant> does zsh support ~
[09:54:37] <Moonlightning> Yes?
[09:54:48] <Moonlightning> zsh has tilde expansion
[09:55:06] <JustAberrant> in it's init script though?
[09:55:13] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[09:55:33] <Moonlightning> I mean, the init script is written in zsh, not in csh or something… :P
[09:55:53] <Moonlightning> 'sides, I use the tilde a ton in my zshrc and it works fine
[09:56:36] <JustAberrant> ah
[09:56:44] <JustAberrant> in zsh, does -f match all files?
[09:56:50] <JustAberrant> or will it only match regular files
[09:56:55] <JustAberrant> because it's probably not a regular file
[09:57:01] <Moonlightning> It is.
[09:57:04] <Moonlightning> But that doesn't matter.
[09:57:11] <Moonlightning> This isn't a code question.
[09:57:21] <Moonlightning> well, I mean, it sort of is, but…
[09:57:36] <Moonlightning> The question is /what do I have to do to make it so that gpg-agent gets invoked once per reboot/?
[09:57:48] <JustAberrant> hmm
[09:57:52] <JustAberrant> quick look in the pony pages..
[09:57:58] <JustAberrant> try changing -f to -p ;p
[09:58:17] <JustAberrant> or -s
[09:58:20] <Moonlightning> My first idea was to make the agent info file a tempfile, but I'd have no idea what the filename would be
[09:58:22] <JustAberrant> er
[09:58:23] <JustAberrant> -S
[09:58:24] <Moonlightning> this fiel is a regular file, JustAberrant
[09:58:26] <Moonlightning> I CHECKED
[09:58:47] <Moonlightning> The file I'm `test`ing is not the socket itself. It's more of a pointer to the socket.
[09:58:51] <Moonlightning> Also, all that is irrelevant!
[09:59:01] <JustAberrant> all is relevant :(
[10:01:02] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant, what gets `test`ed there doesn't change the fact that if the `eval` /is/ under the `else`, no `gpg-agent` will be launched after reboot; and if it is /not/ under the `else`, one `gpg-agent` will be launched for each new shell.
[10:01:23] <JustAberrant> :(
[10:01:41] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: check if there's a gpg-agent running
[10:01:51] <Moonlightning> /How?/ x.x
[10:01:54] <JustAberrant> that's hacky :(
[10:01:57] <AppleDash> ps aux
[10:02:03] <Moonlightning> …yes, that's hacky.
[10:02:07] <Moonlightning> Also it's prone to race conditions
[10:02:09] <AppleDash> So?
[10:02:16] <AppleDash> So is pretty much everything else in shell.
[10:02:32] <JustAberrant> this should work as described, no idea why it wouldn't
[10:02:39] <JustAberrant> I'm gunna attribute it to "weirdness"
[10:02:46] <JustAberrant> but without being able to actually poke at it, I have no idea
[10:03:58] <JustAberrant> I'm not familiar with zsh nor gpg, and the problem is probably with one of them and/or some strange thing you've done to your setup for reasons
[10:07:47] <JustAberrant> for all I know maybe gpg doesn't manage itself and you have to using the env var.. I doubt it though
[10:08:08] * AppleDash fills all of JustAberrant's disks with the entirety of Geocities :(
[10:09:07] <JustAberrant> actually...
[10:09:10] <JustAberrant> "You can write the content of this environment variable to a file so that you can test for a running agent."
[10:09:18] <JustAberrant> that might imply that you indeed do have to deal with it yourself
[10:10:42] * JustAberrant shruggles
[10:10:53] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: I was legit annoyed when they killed geocities :(
[10:10:58] <Moonlightning> OH
[10:11:10] <Moonlightning> Okay, source the file, then test for the socket directory
[10:11:28] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: I'm currently extracting what part of geocities they managed to save
[10:12:14] <JustAberrant> geocities was like 99% crap.. but there was like 1% from people who actually had something interesting to say and whome geocities gave a voice back when it wasn't east to just publish something on the net :(
[10:12:28] <AppleDash> Mmhmm
[10:12:30] <JustAberrant> it was sad when they killed it
[10:12:40] <JustAberrant> especially given that it couldn't have actually been that expensive to keep going
[10:13:05] <AppleDash> I bet they still have it on HDDs somewhere and it'd be trivial for them to release it to the public as a torrent or something
[10:13:09] <AppleDash> but they're just being cunts

[10:20:33] <AppleDash> It's not the most well put together thing, but this set of scripts is meant to make it a bit easier to work with :P
[10:20:34] <JustAberrant> seems appropriate
[10:20:48] <Twilightlicious> alternatively, package it correctly.
[10:21:10] <JustAberrant> guessing it's to make all the weird internals of geocities page builder work properly?
[10:21:19] <JustAberrant> I can only imagine what that looks like
[10:21:23] <AppleDash> Yeah...
[10:21:28] <Twilightlicious> i thought Geocities shut down in 2004 lol
[10:21:41] <JustAberrant> although actually this was before js all the things was really a thing

[18:42:20] <Moonlightning> As opposed to being zero.
[18:42:37] <Moonlightning> Which would be written as`<uint32>=0x00000000`
[18:43:20] <Moonlightning> This is explicitly /null/, as opposed to /zero/
[18:43:43] <Moonlightning> That makes it, by definition, not an integer.

[18:48:51] <Moonlightning> Integers cannot be null.

[19:11:44] <Moonlightning> You can set a C string to null, because a C string is really a pointer, and null in C is also a pointer.
[19:12:10] <mniip> AppleDash, haskell has no variable
[19:12:10] <mniip> s
[19:12:39] <Moonlightning> You cannot, for example, set a Swift string variable to null.
[19:13:28] <Moonlightning> fuck I've forgotten Swift's declaration|initialization syntax
[19:14:32] <Moonlightning>   1> var foo: String = nil
[19:14:32] <Moonlightning> repl.swift:1:19: error: type 'String' does not conform to protocol 'NilLiteralConvertible'
[19:14:32] <Moonlightning> var foo: String = nil
[19:14:34] <AppleDash> mniip: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993124/does-haskell-have-variables
[19:14:35] <PinkiePieBot> [ Does Haskell have variables? - Stack Overflow ]
[19:14:55] <Moonlightning> You can set a variable that is an OPTIONAL string to nil.
[19:15:00] <Moonlightning> Because that is the DEFINITION of optional.
[19:15:08] <Moonlightning> A variable that is EITHER <X> OR null.
[19:15:18] <AppleDash> OK
[19:15:22] <Moonlightning>   1> var foo: Optional<String> = nil
[19:15:22] <Moonlightning> foo: String? = nil
[19:19:05] <Moonlightning> Oftentimes, you can use `nil` in place of another object.
[19:19:15] <Moonlightning> null *
[19:19:29] <Moonlightning> But that only works because the handling code CHECKS to see if the variable is null, and special-cases that.
[19:22:14] <Moonlightning> In C, you can check if a `char *` is `NULL` and do something special.
[19:22:24] <Moonlightning> If you tried to use it as a string directly, though, you'd segfault!
[19:22:39] *** Giganoms is now known as Gigabit
[19:27:35] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: Depends what you're using it with
[19:27:56] <AppleDash> I know printf() will print "(nil)" in its place
[19:28:14] <Moonlightning> That's because printf() is special-casing it, like I said.
[19:28:21] <AppleDash> And?
[19:28:45] <AppleDash> You could also say it was "special-casing" it when it has a value.
[19:29:05] <Moonlightning> if (foo == NULL) foo = "(nil)";  // is not using null as a string.
[19:29:19] <AppleDash> It is using it in a string context.
[19:30:34] <Moonlightning> This isn't about context.
[19:30:40] <Shutter> AppleDash: Why are you fighting over semantics? You know as well as anyone else that if you change Moonlightning's phrasing from 'use' to 'dereference' it's entirely correct.
[19:31:06] * Shutter puts both AppleDash and Moonlightning on his head, using them both as a very pretty and fluffy hat
[19:31:27] * Moonlightning continues fighting AppleDash on Shutter's head.
[19:32:39] * AppleDash shrugs
[19:32:50] <AppleDash> The point is, I can pass NULL to functions that take a string
[19:32:56] <AppleDash> For all intents and purposes, a string can be null
[19:33:08] <Moonlightning> And for all intents and purposes, a container can be a boolean.
[19:33:15] <AppleDash> Sure
[19:33:21] <AppleDash> You can use it as one if you really want
[19:33:23] <Shutter> You can only pass null strings to functions which don't dereference the pointer unconditionally
[19:33:30] <AppleDash> Shutter: No?
[19:33:33] <AppleDash> There's nothing stopping me
[19:33:36] <Moonlightning> foo(bar, some_option=[object(), object(), object()])  # see, it turns `some_option` on just like a boolean!
[19:33:38] <AppleDash> There's no hard wall
[19:33:46] <Shutter> AppleDash: Fine, you can. But you will crash :P
[19:34:22] <AppleDash> Really though, almost everything should have a check
[19:34:28] <AppleDash> I'm not saying it does, but it SHOULD
[19:34:49] <Moonlightning> You're kind of proving my point.
[19:35:00] <AppleDash> k
[19:35:15] <AppleDash> I will continue saying this as I have for the past 4 or so years
[19:36:13] <Moonlightning> That aside…how am I supposed to interpret these signed integers?
[19:36:43] <Moonlightning>     "scrp"<sint32>=0x00000000 
[19:36:55] <Moonlightning> …okay, so that one's just zero, but in general.
[19:41:16] <Moonlightning> meh, all the ones I have are zero
[19:54:48] <Moonlightning> …
[19:54:57] <Moonlightning> Okay, now THIS is just bullshit.
[19:54:59] <Moonlightning>     "type"<uint32>="note"

[20:05:21] <Moonlightning> But don't label something /integer/ and then put something formatted as a string there!
[20:05:30] <Moonlightning> At LEAST put the integer version!

[20:20:47] <Moonlightning> so THAT'S why it doesn't let you add URLs with schemes that it doesn't recognize.
[20:21:34] <Moonlightning> It stores the scheme seperately from the address, port, and path
[20:21:41] <Moonlightning> It stores all four separately, actually
[20:21:52] <Moonlightning> And the protocol is stored as…/guess what type?/ :P
[20:22:50] <Moonlightning> A uint32!
[20:23:19] <Moonlightning> So they have to map schemes to four-character versions.
[20:23:26] <Moonlightning> And stuff them into ints.
[20:24:21] <Moonlightning> There're seven used in my keychain.
[20:24:25] <Moonlightning> {'AdIM', 'afp ', 'htps', 'http', 'imap', 'smtp', 'ssh '}
[20:24:46] <cyborg_ar> what software is that?
[20:25:31] <Moonlightning> Apple's password manager thing.
[20:25:40] <cyborg_ar> lol apple
[20:25:50] <Moonlightning> Yeah. I used to be a total Apple fanboy.
[20:26:10] <cyborg_ar> why would they store it that way?
[20:26:19] <Moonlightning> Vendor lockin? :P
[20:26:36] <Moonlightning> This feels a LOT like vendor lockin to me.
[20:26:55] <Moonlightning> The actual file format is rather strange. You can probably google and find ponies who've dissected it.
[20:27:23] * JustAberrant has Moonlightning combed
[20:29:27] <cyborg_ar> there are less braindead ways to do vendor lock in
[20:30:02] <Moonlightning> They provide a utility called `security` that you can use to “dump” the contents of a keychain
[20:30:07] <Moonlightning> And it gives you stuff like /this:/ https://gist.github.com/BlacklightShining/e22dd783f5fec1bb1a09
[20:30:08] <PinkiePieBot> [ keychain-dump ]
[20:30:15] <Moonlightning> Times however many passwords and other things you have.
[20:31:39] <Moonlightning> I'm currently tinkering with a horrible oneshot Python script I've written to parse that mess.
[20:32:26] <Moonlightning> Note all the things like `<uint32>=<NULL>`. That's what sparked the argument in here over what null is.
[20:46:04] *** Joins: Nick (nobody@Pony-rgmjhl.res.rr.com)
[20:46:41] <cyborg_ar> lol
[20:47:05] <cyborg_ar> depends on what it means for that particular file format
[20:47:16] <cyborg_ar> either way
[20:47:32] <cyborg_ar> everybody knows booleans can either be true, false or FILE_NOT_FOUND

[21:02:37] <PinkiePieBot> [ What Is Truth? - The Daily WTF ]
[21:04:12] <Shutter> "nothing but simple dualities" - obviously the solution to this is to instead use ints denoting the probability of something =p
[21:05:42] <cyborg_ar> anyway the short answer is that databases have a thing called nullable types
[21:05:52] <Shutter> Indeed
[21:06:07] <cyborg_ar> so a value can either be any valid value for the type, or NULL
[21:06:16] <cyborg_ar> really dont see the point of the argument
