[02:16:38] <Frosty> We uploaded warheads, let them sit on the jets, then downloaded them.

[02:17:06] <samonuh> Oh...
[02:17:07] <iamalion> did they enjoy sitting on the jets?

[02:17:26] <iamalion> thats about as physical as it gets

[02:17:38] <samonuh> I'm so confused

[02:42:48] <iamalion> I love when customers say "wow comcast needs more people like you"
[02:42:50] <iamalion> ^_______^
[02:43:02] <samonuh> You work for Comcast, or...?
[02:43:06] <iamalion> yus
[02:43:10] <samonuh> Neat
[02:43:14] <iamalion> I work from home as a level 2 wifi callcenter person
[02:43:32] <samonuh> I get annoyed by the anti-Comcast circlejerk
[02:43:40] <samonuh> It's just so unoriginal
[02:43:46] <iamalion> haha
[02:44:16] <Frosty> Do people normally beat the first level and actually make it to you?
[02:44:59] <iamalion> only if they need our help. tier 1 can do basic internet fixes. i do stuff like wifi passwords, connecting to wifi, comcast email password resets, things like that
[02:45:05] <iamalion> nice thing is that tier 1 filters out all the angry people
[02:45:09] <iamalion> so i get like 1 angry person a month
[02:45:11] <iamalion> if that
[02:45:31] <samonuh> Do you have to say "I understand" every sentence?
[02:45:53] <Frosty> I'm going to keep calling until I get you, and then I'll be super butthurt.
[02:46:37] <iamalion> wut
[02:46:38] <iamalion> no
[02:46:46] <iamalion> Frosty taht would take forever xD
[02:46:53] <samonuh> You have no script?
[02:47:03] <iamalion> I do
[02:47:08] <Frosty> I might get lucky and skip all the Indian people.
[02:47:10] <iamalion> but its more of guidelins
[02:47:15] <iamalion> only my intro is a hard script
[02:47:24] <samonuh> What's wrong with Indian people?
[02:47:36] <RNGsus> lol
[02:47:55] <Frosty> Nothing. Most Comcast employees I've been connected to are "Dave" from "New Jersy" or something.

[02:48:57] <iamalion> ive talked to a lot of them, so i have a p good idea
[02:49:13] <samonuh> So, like any other type of person?
[02:49:33] <iamalion> I know if I had comcast and I needed to call Id just call teir 2 directly and cut out tier 1

[04:18:18] <weisey> We are
[04:18:31] <samonuh> It's still wrong
[04:18:33] <Katiepony> I wouldn't go as far as saying it was assault. It was a little degrading, though.

[04:46:00] <Vulpixbrew> I miss living in my own place
[04:46:04] * Vulpixbrew flails
[04:46:40] <samonuh> Buy a house
[04:49:00] <Luvbi> 13Rearanged my desk, went to reach for my mouse and ended up with a hand full of baby powder >.< probably not my smartest moment
[04:49:35] <samonuh> Why do you have baby powder?
[04:49:49] <Luvbi> 13Because my hands get really sweaty and it's annoying and gross
[04:49:57] <Luvbi> 13Plus it smells nice ^-^
[04:50:46] <Luvbi> 13So I take a pinch and rub it on my hands every once in a while. Kinda like lotion, but the exact opposite
[04:51:33] <samonuh> Heh, nice :P
[04:51:36] <Luvbi> 13Anyways, I put a dixie cup of it right where my mouse USED to be, and I wasn't paying attention and hit it. That wasn't fun
[04:52:29] <samonuh> Damn
[04:52:31] <samonuh> That stinks
[04:53:02] <Luvbi> 13Well, no. It actually smells quite pleasant. XD
[04:53:06] <Luvbi> 13But I get what you mean

[05:06:12] <samonuh> Yup
[05:07:09] <Frosty> I do want a daughter some day, f'real tho
[05:07:32] <samonuh> Why?
[05:07:53] <Frosty> Why a daughter over a son?
[05:08:05] <samonuh> Yea
[05:08:16] <Frosty> Not quite sure. Just always have.
[05:08:41] <samonuh> I personally don't care about the gender of my kids
[05:08:56] <samonuh> I'm going to be a pretty egalitarian parent
[05:09:17] <Frosty> IDK what that means
[05:09:39] <samonuh> It means whatever you'd like for it to mean

[05:39:31] <samonuh> Oh, neat
[05:44:40] <Drago> samonuh what about freebird? Or sultans of swing? Doesnt matter that the outro is long?
[05:44:55] <Drago> well I guess to you but... 
[05:45:04] <Drago> they are popular songs so...
[05:45:07] <samonuh> I don't mind decent outros
[05:45:26] <samonuh> But I don't want to hear McCartney having an aneurysm for 4 minutes
[05:46:06] <Drago> then don't listen to it.
[05:46:47] <samonuh> I needed to remind myself how awful it was
[05:47:19] <plushie_pegasus> Hi Drago
[05:47:42] <Quinn> you're one of thoes people who complain about a song in the comments
[05:47:45] <Quinn> like why the fuck are you there
[05:48:19] <samonuh> You finally acknowledge my existence
[05:48:21] <samonuh> It's an honor
[05:48:22] <Drago> I am fucking mad at riot. ever since the champion mastery went live it seemed to  fuck up the MMR. I hadn't seen any trolls or toxic players/ragers for months until this shit.
[05:48:56] <Drago> probably m,ore like a year of 95% peacefull games now its like playing sub-30
[05:49:23] <samonuh> I'll have you know that I don't comment on YouTube, however. 
[05:49:43] <Drago> ad soraka... thresh spamming top and refusing to support the adc. god damnit
[05:50:20] <samonuh> I've listened to too much of The Doors these past couple of weeks. I've gone full circle in my musical tastes.
[05:50:21] <Drago> people talking shit for ne reason... The game has changed SO much in like 2 weeks, I am about to quit.
[05:50:44] <samonuh> Haven't really listened to hip hop in a while
[05:51:10] <Quinn> Drago its always been that way
[05:51:39] <plushie_pegasus> PMV freepony   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaX1EculZ3c
[05:52:02] <Drago> not for me Quinn. as I said I rarely had a toxi player/afk/whatever negative and now it's multiple in a single game
[05:52:13] <samonuh> Fuck it, listening to pop punk
[05:52:33] <Drago> I was in a great MMR. whatever this champ mastery did totally fucked it up
[05:52:54] <Drago> pleasant games. Now I am having a hard time to not rage with these trolls all of a sudden.
[05:53:47] <Drago> and I have been playing since early season 2. several months after I hit 30 there were rarely any flamers or trolls. 
[05:54:00] <Quinn> no clue
[05:54:13] <Quinn> I have 3,100 ranked matches and I know that the game has always been full of toxic and mean people
[05:54:29] <Vulpixbrew> thus why I dont play
[05:54:30] <samonuh> Toxic and mean people on a video game? 
[05:54:45] <Vulpixbrew> game is decent but all the toxicity just is to much for me
[05:54:50] <Quinn> silly reason not to play a game when you can just mute people
[05:54:57] <samonuh> Which game?
[05:55:13] <Drago> league of legends.

[05:56:03] <princesssluttershy> I'm gonna try to do that every friday and saturday
[05:56:08] <samonuh> Damn
[05:56:11] <Drago> but when you get into a good MMR you are with other frindly people.
[05:56:51] <samonuh> I remember when I played video games I was a rude little piece of shit who insulted everybody. Probably good that I stopped. 
[05:57:22] <Quinn> what do you mean good mmr
[05:57:23] <Drago> which is where I was. It was great. No flaming, raging, afking etc. and since they introduced champion mastery score it totally fucked everything to hell.
[05:57:30] <Drago> match making rating
[05:57:37] <Quinn> what do you mean "good" mmr
[05:57:40] <Quinn> I know what mmr is
[05:57:45] <Drago> friendly people
[05:57:56] <Quinn> your mmr has nothing to do with how friendly people are
[05:58:08] <Quinn> and champion mastery doesn't effect your mmr
[05:58:13] <Drago> I went so many game without any bullshit but now it's rediculous
[05:58:31] <Drago> ok whatever
[05:58:38] <Drago> it has changed the game
[05:59:16] <Quinn> no it hasnt :P
[05:59:22] <Drago> but i dont wanna fucking argue with you since iyou kow everything

[06:02:15] <Quinn> more likely than not you just got an unlucky streak of annoying people in your games
[06:02:40] <Quinn> your mmr has nothing to do with the friendliness of players, and champion mastery has nothing to do with mmr

[06:05:22] <Quinn> yea sorta like csgo ranks
[06:05:24] <Quinn> except its not a rank
[06:05:45] <Quinn> your actual rank isnt always the same as your mmr
[06:05:48] <Quinn> its complicated
[06:06:00] <Quinn> but basically it's irrelevant, especially concerning how toxic anyone is
[06:06:53] <princesssluttershy> You're going to run into toxic players no matter what game you play
[06:06:57] <Quinn> yup
[06:07:07] <Quinn> in fact, if anything it gets worse the higher your mmr is
[06:07:10] <samonuh> Even Go Fish?
