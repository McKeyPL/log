[01:03:13] <aji> one of the things i love about math is being able to define and describe things that can't possibly exist in the real world
[01:03:23] <wolfyshy> normally with makefiles you can just specify CFLAGS
[01:03:23] <aji> very easy example, N, the set of natural numbers
[01:03:44] <aji> there will always be more natural numbers than particles in the universe, because the number of particles in the universe is finite
[01:04:02] <aji> so N can't exist in our universe, it's simply too big.

[01:13:40] <Moonlightning> That, or I'm still doing stuff wrong >.>
[01:13:49] <AppleDash> The Linux kernel is not meant to be compiled with c89
[01:15:00] <Moonlightning> Then why doesn't it invoke the compiler with `-std=`?

[01:16:32] <wolfyshy> it isn't even really C
[01:16:34] <wolfyshy> it's GNU C
[01:16:39] <wolfyshy> you have to use std=gnu99

[01:17:15] <Moonlightning> And the job of everyone who wants to build it?
[01:17:25] <Moonlightning> Why doesn't it makefile or something specify that?
[01:17:30] <Phase4> it isn't, the build tools should check for this
[01:17:44] <Phase4> i'm not sure how you're compiling it to make them not check

[01:36:44] <Phase4> Ah, if your distro has dkms use that. i've gotta look up how out of tree modules are built again
[01:36:57] <Moonlightning> None of the sample makefiles have `-std=` in them, johnsey.
[01:37:03] <johnsey> why would they?
[01:37:16] <johnsey> forget about -std
[01:37:17] <Phase4> Moonlightning, they include makefiles from the  kernel source
[01:37:18] <Moonlightning> Because apparently Linux uses C99 features
[01:37:24] <Phase4> or are at least supposed to
[01:37:25] <Moonlightning> According to the error I got

[01:38:08] <Phase4> make -C <path_to_kernel_src> M=$PWD
[01:38:31] <Moonlightning> That's what I'm doing.
[01:38:55] <Moonlightning> …wait a second, isn't that the line from the makefile?
[01:39:36] <Phase4> ?
[01:44:47] <Moonlightning> Oh, no, it's not.
[01:45:10] <Moonlightning> make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules  # so this goes in the makefile
[01:45:52] <Moonlightning> make -C /usr/src/$(uname -r) M=$(pwd)                          # and then you invoke `make` like this?
[01:46:08] <johnsey> if you read the link above, you would know the answer -.-
[01:46:26] <johnsey> -> Example 2-4. Makefile
[01:47:21] <johnsey> you put it in a file called Makefile and invoke rm -rf /*
[01:47:23] <johnsey> sorry i mean make
[01:48:14] <Moonlightning> In section 2.1, it says to use `make -C <path_to_kernel_src> M=$PWD` to build an external module, but `make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD` to build an external module against the running kernel.
[01:49:28] <johnsey> and this is different from the Makefile how?
[01:49:35] <Moonlightning> It's not!
[01:49:37] <johnsey> see
[01:49:53] <Moonlightning> So…since you're apparently giving `make` this information on the command line
[01:50:00] <Moonlightning> What exactly is the point of having it in the makefile?
[01:50:13] <johnsey> that you can just type "make"?
[01:51:03] <Moonlightning> …okay.

[01:51:30] <cyborg_ar> lol
[01:52:16] <cyborg_ar> and rule-based dependency tracking recipes :)
[01:53:02] <johnsey> in the end, it's about noting having to type a million lenghty, hard-to-remember commands
[01:55:57] <Moonlightning> So…I'm supposed to include Linux' makefile?
[01:56:46] <johnsey> Moonlightning: man make, /-C
[01:57:37] <johnsey> i.e. you're invoking the Linux Makefile and you're telling it to build your module.
[01:57:54] <Moonlightning> Ohhhhhh.
[01:58:01] <johnsey> oh and by the way
[01:58:41] <johnsey> grep HOSTCFLAGS /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/Makefile
[01:58:59] <johnsey> maybe this helps with your -std question in regards to the linux kernel

[06:25:19] <Phase4> unlikely, what do you need help with?
[06:27:48] <RazorSharpFang> I wanted to ask about the feasibility of a html5-compliant browser written in actionscript.
[06:28:02] <Phase4> uh...
[06:28:10] <JackG> ActionScript ~ ECMAScript ~ JavaScript
[06:28:10] <Phase4> 'possible'
[06:28:33] <JackG> given how much people are doing with JS these days...
[06:28:34] <Phase4> it's a superset of javascript circa ~97
[06:29:02] <Phase4> but it is not javascript compatible, nor does it have a dom or any kind of sandboxing
[06:29:13] <RazorSharpFang> Specifically, i wanted to emulate a browser.
[06:29:24] <RazorSharpFang> Implementing the DOM and the like manually
[06:29:28] <JackG> Phase4: I know, but I was just pointing it out
[06:29:45] <JackG> also, "circa around 97"
[06:31:18] <Phase4> RazorSharpFang, well there's dom and js implementations written in javascript
[06:31:25] <Phase4> it 'might' not be too much work to port them
[06:31:47] <RazorSharpFang> Phase4: Hmm. That does sound intriguing.
[06:32:03] <Phase4> you'd need to write all the css related code yourself
[06:32:22] <Phase4> RazorSharpFang, so again, possible, but why?
[06:32:58] <RazorSharpFang> If I could make a html5 browser in flash, we could deliver html5 content to IE6 with flash.
[06:35:28] <Phase4> RazorSharpFang, IE6 is thankfully not relevant anymore, and there's other ways to work around it
[06:35:35] <JackG> I doubt you would need an entire browser for that
[06:35:38] <Phase4> a whole browser in flash would be huge and slow
[06:36:02] <RazorSharpFang> I imagine it like a flash i-frame.
[06:36:06] <RazorSharpFang> No nav-bar, etc...
[06:36:38] <RazorSharpFang> Phase4: IE6 irrelevancy is music to my ears, but what of IE8?
[06:37:01] <Phase4> 8 and 9 are 'good enough' that you can shim individual extensions
[06:40:04] <RazorSharpFang> Hmm.
[06:40:14] <Phase4> RazorSharpFang, there's libraries that implement <video> and websockets, and most js extensions can be implemented in js itself
[06:40:52] <RazorSharpFang> Phase4: So, they use flash to make up for the browser's defeciencies?
[06:41:27] <RazorSharpFang> **deficiencies.
[06:41:41] <RazorSharpFang> Almost got that one.
[06:42:00] <Phase4> in some cases, depends on the site

[18:15:07] * JustAberrant halps
[18:16:41] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: How do I use java NIO help it's not working
[18:18:39] * JustAberrant does not know :(
[18:18:52] <AppleDash> You don't? :(
[18:18:56] <AppleDash> I need someone who knows :(
[18:19:00] <JustAberrant> :(
[18:19:51] <AppleDash> I'm reading from one channel, I print out the buffer and there IS the right data in it, and then I'm writing it to another channel
[18:19:57] <AppleDash> But writing it to another channel is not working
[18:22:49] <AppleDash> I fixed it
[18:23:01] <AppleDash> Apparently you have to call .flip() on a buffer you just read into, before you can write from it
[18:31:08] <JustAberrant> :)
[18:45:52] <Moonlightning> The bigger question AppleDash, is why are you writing Java?
[18:52:06] <AppleDash> Because it's the language I have chosen for this project.
[18:52:24] <JustAberrant> probably came to the realization that life doesn't have to be miserable, and you can have nice things :)

[19:55:02] <DonutSteele> HEY! You can get a lot done with 1 chopstick.
[19:55:04] <Lapsus> also, mirc
[19:55:05] <Lapsus> :p
[19:56:23] <DonutSteele> Why mirc in particular? GUI or term? Riced Config or getting used to the defaults?
[19:56:57] <Lapsus> I'm just so used to it, I've been using it forever
[19:57:11] <Lapsus> heck, I even have a licence for it
[19:58:43] <JustAberrant> scary ;p
[19:59:03] <DonutSteele> A license for mirc? What does it do?
[19:59:04] * JustAberrant uses mIRC way back in the day, then bitchx for a long damn time, and now irssi
[19:59:17] <JustAberrant> actually come to think of it, I've probably been using irssi now longer than bitchx
[19:59:37] <JustAberrant> I'll probably be using irssi long after weechat makes it obsolete.. cause I'm like that :>
[20:00:19] <Lapsus> The licence removes the nag screen? That's it as far as I can tell
[20:00:48] <DonutSteele> Forgot that mirc was nagware.
[20:00:54] <Lapsus> I'm pretty sure it also used to disconnect after a few hours at regular intervals, but I never had solid proof of that
[20:01:01] <DonutSteele> I haven't used pay for software in years.
[20:01:15] <JustAberrant> hippy :(
[20:01:26] <Lapsus> What, you don't play videogames? :v
[20:01:30] <DonutSteele> I saw it in winrar on my brother's computer, and I just had no idea what to do.
[20:01:35] <Lapsus> I guess that's not too weird
[20:01:58] <Lapsus> anyways I got a free licence so I figure I might as well use it
[20:02:04] <Lapsus> Thanks khaled
[20:02:04] <Lapsus> :v
[20:02:12] <JustAberrant> irony: I probably pay for more software now, having used linux almost exclusively for like 10 years, then I did back in the bad ol` days :>

[20:03:43] * JustAberrant doesn't pirate software at all now.. I prefer open source, but when I do actually need something that's not free/open source .. I just buy it :(
[20:04:13] <DonutSteele> Like a boss.
[20:04:17] <Lapsus> I think the only major bits of software I haven't bought so far that I use all the time is windows itself?
[20:04:19] * JustAberrant nods :(
[20:04:24] <DonutSteele> Who's looking forward to CSI: Cyber?
[20:04:49] <JustAberrant> hehe, is that an actual thing? :>
[20:04:57] <JustAberrant> like, wouldn't surprise me.. but ugh :D
[20:04:58] <Lapsus> I'm going to see if I can steal a free upgrade to w10 because this copy passes windows genuine whatever
[20:04:58] <Lapsus> lol
[20:05:10] <Lapsus> if not, I might just buy it and get it over with
[20:05:15] <JustAberrant> hehe
[20:05:30] <JustAberrant> the one time I bought windows, it took a lot of effort
[20:05:58] <JustAberrant> was around when I got my oculus rift and decided you pretty much needed windows to get anything out of it
[20:06:13] <DonutSteele> Yeah. I'm gonna get a wintablet too. Gonna put W10 on it, get cortana, and then use chocoloatey and cygwin so I don't feel like a fish out of water.
[20:06:15] <JustAberrant> didn't want win8.. took forever to find a legit copy of win7
[20:06:44] <Lapsus> IIRC win8 licences include win7 downgrade rights
[20:06:54] <JustAberrant> it's like.. jesus fuck.. take my money you idiots!
[20:07:07] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: I think that's only at a certain tier
[20:07:37] <Lapsus> either way I'm trying to get the nonprofit I volunteer at to get to at least win7 so we can homogenize the systems when the w10 upgrade becomes available
[20:07:44] <DonutSteele> I remember being so exited about XP service pack 2
[20:08:00] <DonutSteele> Damn.
