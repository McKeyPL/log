[07:17:51] <Ali> FOIL FETCHES BABY
[07:17:54] <Eywind> Yeah yeah yeah
[07:17:59] <Eywind> I had expensive cards once
[07:18:07] <Ali> Jace the Buttmunch?
[07:18:08] <Eywind> then I sold them to make sure I had enough money after my down payment
[07:18:18] <Araxnus> I had a Life then I sold it to Pony :p
[07:18:23] <Kelazi5> Twilight the libs can be read here http://thefaithbreaker.tumblr.com
[07:18:29] <Eywind> Yeah I mean I had blue duals and goyfs and mana crypt and cradle and stuff
[07:18:33] <LadyAubernon> and then pony made a game called MLP Life
[07:18:35] <Eywind> so the tier down from power prices
[07:18:42] <Araxnus> LadyAubernon: Yes. lol
[07:18:42] <DixieTokusatsuKuuga-RX> Good thing  I still have my life.
[07:19:03] <Eywind> But sold that, then I'm working on reacquiring at least one copy of a lot of the stuff
[07:19:06] <DixieTokusatsuKuuga-RX> Or else I be a zombie or something.
[07:19:10] <Faith> If you don't look like Spike after a massage, you're doing it wrong
[07:19:19] <Ali> Eywind, I tried getting back into Magic in Khans, but then work said NOPE no friday's off for you
[07:19:23] <Eywind> Ah
[07:19:31] <Eywind> You could play magic online or do some of the midweek/saturday tourneys
[07:19:31] <Ali> I picked up the foil fetches to hold onto
[07:19:36] <Eywind> Yeah those are a good call
[07:19:40] <LadyAubernon> i like to feel extra crunchy after a massage by big pegasuseessss myself
[07:19:41] <Eywind> Fetches are hilariously low
[07:19:45] <Eywind> you going to pick up the zendikar ones too?
[07:19:50] <Eywind> since they're totally going to be in there
[07:19:54] <Ali> Well I own one of each Zendikar one
[07:19:57] <Eywind> Ah
[07:20:00] <Araxnus> Oh my Gabe
[07:20:01] <Eywind> well return to zendikar is next block
[07:20:01] <Ali> But Not foil
[07:20:06] <Ali> Oh god
[07:20:11] <Ali> Are they...gonna reprint them?
[07:20:13] <Eywind> Probably
[07:20:14] <Araxnus> xD I bet Nora says that a lot
[07:20:18] <Eywind> No
[07:20:21] <Eywind> She says Oh My Gaga
[07:20:27] <Araxnus> Dat too
[07:20:35] <Eywind> Yeah Ali prices have already taken a hit on the fetches
[07:20:40] <Faith> welp, I think I'm gonna skedaddle. Goodnight all, see you next weekend!
[07:20:44] <LadyAubernon> also: "I love Gabe!"
[07:20:44] <Eywind> see ya Faith
[07:20:46] <LadyAubernon> nini faithy

[07:20:50] <Faith> !missile
[07:20:50] * DerpyBot picks up LadyAubernon and aims carefully for Faith
[07:20:50] <Eywind> instead of like 80
[07:20:52] <Faith> ayyy
[07:20:52] * DerpyBot throws LadyAubernon towards Faith with all her might
[07:20:53] <LadyAubernon> weeeeeee
[07:20:54] <Ali> Well the non foil fetches from Khans are probably next to nothing now.
[07:20:55] *** Faith was kicked by DerpyBot (Incoming!)
[07:20:59] <Eywind> They are
[07:21:00] * LadyAubernon hits the wall
[07:21:03] <Eywind> blue ones are ~10
[07:21:05] <Eywind> others are like 5-8
[07:21:06] <Ali> Wow
[07:21:09] <Ali> That's...quite a hit
[07:21:15] <Araxnus> I love Gaben. He is like a high doller call girl :p
[07:21:19] <Eywind> onslaught versions are about double that
[07:21:27] <Araxnus> So PG cause I used my words
[07:21:33] <Ali> Don't know why you'd pay more for the older ones then
[07:21:37] <Eywind> cuz bling?
[07:21:40] <Ali> Other than to just say you have them
[07:21:45] <Eywind> although if I blinged it's judge or bust
[07:21:55] <Ali> Foil Fetches won't lose their price
[07:21:57] <Eywind> $225 each
[07:21:58] <Eywind> lol
[07:22:09] <Eywind> My roommate sold his judge basics he got today for $275/set
[07:22:28] <Ali> I Paid $80 for the a Blue foil, but I had store credit to help bring the price down.
[07:22:52] <Eywind> well delta is still like 75-80
[07:22:58] <Araxnus> Bling? http://www.extravaganzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Swarowski-studded-Pioneer-HDJ-2000-headphones-5.jpg
[07:23:00] <Ali> I think that was the one
[07:23:02] *** Quits: Scootaloo (wobniaR@Monoshy.Hydra.Fighter.64) (Quit: Bruh)
[07:23:04] * LadyAubernon paid $$60000000000 for vash's head
[07:23:09] <Eywind> strand is like 75
[07:23:11] <Eywind> if you're doing trade that's fine
[07:23:14] <Ali> But I paid maybe $55 for it
[07:23:15] <Eywind> or part trade
[07:23:19] <Araxnus> Rarity would rock those headphones
[07:23:21] <Eywind> yeah you got a good deal
[07:23:22] <Eywind> and they will go up
[07:23:25] <Eywind> I like the new fetches more than the old ones
[07:23:29] <Ali> Eywind, Store credit baby
[07:23:32] <Eywind> Yeah exactly
[07:23:36] <Eywind> that's 'trade' IMO
[07:23:48] <Eywind> since it's just card money instead of cash
[07:23:54] <Ali> Well the store has a $10 for every $100 you spend
[07:23:58] <Eywind> ahh nice
[07:24:11] *** Joins: VashPeanulam (VashPeanula@Pony-ack.ukr.178.24.IP)
[07:24:24] <Eywind> onslaught fetches are gross
[07:24:26] <Ali> So yeah, I picked up most of the fetches for a good price
[07:24:28] <VashPeanulam> any of you bloodborners?
[07:25:12] <Eywind> Yep sounds like it
[07:25:13] <LadyAubernon> nope; i just watch woolie and pat
[07:26:01] <VashPeanulam> ?
[07:26:13] <Eywind> Ali seriously though if you want to get into the game and you're in a non-little city you can usually find a LGS that has non-Friday events
[07:26:26] <Eywind> My roommmate goes to Saturday night modern
[07:26:32] <Eywind> he went 4-0 with soul sisters tonight lol
[07:26:55] <Kelazi5> Well, I'm thinking I'll head out for the nght. See you next weekend or sooner.
[07:26:59] <Eywind> see ya Kelazi5!
[07:27:05] <LadyAubernon> nini kelkel
[07:27:13] <Kelazi5> !cadence
[07:27:13] * DerpyBot picks up Gethiox and aims carefully for Kelazi5
[07:27:15] * DerpyBot throws Gethiox towards Kelazi5 with all her might
[07:27:18] *** Kelazi5 was kicked by DerpyBot (Incoming!)
[07:27:18] * Ali has her foil fetches locked up in a fireproof lockbox.
[07:27:21] <Eywind> XD
[07:27:25] <One-Trick> the robot in interstellar is weird
[07:27:34] <Eywind> Have you ever played Cube?
[07:27:37] <Eywind> It's the best format ever
[07:28:14] <Ali> Eywind, no, I don't know enough players to even cube draft, and wouldn't play with them cause they're just meta players that would rather crush you under their hand than anything else.
[07:28:17] <Eywind> aah okay
[07:28:32] <Eywind> That sucks, sorry you have a bad area
[07:28:36] <Ali> I don't like meta players cause they're not fun to play
[07:28:46] <Ali> Meta EDH, Meta FNM's, nothing
[07:28:57] <Eywind> Well FNM is one thing
[07:28:59] <Eywind> EDH is another lol
[07:29:01] <Ali> Its not fun when you just watch someone combo out or whatnot
[07:29:10] <Ali> Small group FNM is fun
[07:29:18] <Ali> But the bigger it gets, the more bleh it becomes.
[07:29:22] <Eywind> Yeah, you don't have any other LGS to try?
[07:29:22] <Araxnus> One-Trick: I still need to watch that
[07:29:31] <Eywind> I totally agree, though; I really liked the one I went to by my old apartment
[07:29:34] <Ali> No, I moved to the smallest one, and I'm 2 sets behind
[07:29:39] *** Quits: VashPeanulam (VashPeanula@Pony-ack.ukr.178.24.IP) (Quit: Page closed)
[07:29:42] <Eywind> I could take the most random decks and still do well
[07:29:45] <Eywind> and have a lot of fun
[07:29:50] <Ali> I played Monored Stormbreath Dragon.
[07:29:53] <Eywind> Ah
[07:30:00] <Eywind> that got some good cards lol
[07:30:07] <Araxnus> Oh my butts what a Saturday.
[07:30:09] <Eywind> if you want to make R or Rx Dragons
[07:30:15] <Ali> It was Mono Red Burn with Dragons
[07:30:18] <Araxnus> Best one in like over a year
[07:30:23] <Ali> With Swiftspear as the smallest creature
[07:30:25] <Eywind> yeah have you seen the searing blaze if you have a dragon?
[07:30:30] <Ali> Rabblemaster as mid
[07:30:45] <Ali> Stormbreath was top tier, and with Generator Servant~
[07:30:51] <Eywind> Haha one of those decks
[07:30:57] <Ali> I think to me, that is the most underrated M15 card
[07:31:06] <Eywind> Yeah it could be really good with thunderbreak regent
[07:31:13] <Ali> Getting Stormbreat out on turn 3 is really sick
[07:31:14] <Eywind> http://magiccards.info/scans/en/dtk/162.jpg
[07:31:37] <Ali> OH SNAP
[07:31:41] <Eywind> http://magiccards.info/scans/en/dtk/134.jpg and for your dragons
[07:31:46] <Ali> But it also used under rated cards
[07:31:50] <Ali> Like Chandra
[07:31:57] <Ali> And a few Sarkhan
[07:32:01] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Ali
[07:32:01] <Eywind> Yeah Pyromaster's fallen out of favor
[07:32:02] <DinkyBot> Ali, aw yiss
[07:32:03] <Eywind> Sarkhan not as much
[07:32:17] <Ali> Pyromaster Eywind is just under rated
[07:32:25] <Eywind> Oh I don't disagree
[07:32:26] <Ali> She's really really good for burn
[07:32:33] <Eywind> Thunderbreak seems a little better in the 4 drop slot
[07:32:40] <Eywind> but depends on what kind of curve you want
[07:32:41] <Ali> You have to understand Eywind 
[07:32:48] <Ali> That card wasn't around when I played my deck
[07:32:48] * LadyAubernon wonders who frosty heights is; listening to ponyville still
[07:32:56] <Eywind> Oh I understand
[07:33:00] <Eywind> I was just saying if you're trying to update
[07:33:06] <Ali> Chandra's ping damage was great
[07:33:07] <Eywind> That's why people aren't using them now
[07:33:13] <Eywind> Yeah hitting stuff like siege rhino 
[07:33:13] <Ali> and paired well with Seering Blood
[07:33:27] <Araxnus> Know that feelin after a Rave when the sugar, booze and red bull wears off. Yeh I'm to that point
[07:33:30] <Ali> Best 2 drop burn ever
[07:33:39] <Eywind> Well Ali, did you see the dragonic roar card?
[07:33:43] <Ali> Kill a creature AND hit them for 3 if said creature died
[07:33:48] <Eywind> (also Searing Blaze > Searing Blood)
[07:33:53] <Ali> Eywind, nothing from the 2 latest sets dear
[07:34:02] <Eywind> Yeah but I mean now I like it more than then :P
[07:34:14] <Ali> I don't think Blaze was legal when I was playing
[07:34:15] <Eywind> Just saying there's a lot of new fun tools you could have
[07:34:17] <Eywind> Yeah it wasn't lol
[07:34:22] <Eywind> but you said ever lol
[07:34:37] * Ali boops Eywind 
[07:34:41] <Eywind> Yeah
[07:34:44] <Eywind> I like that deck idea
[07:34:51] <Eywind> And it's gotten some fun new toys
[07:35:22] <Ali> Well a 4/4 hasty dragon that's pro white
[07:36:08] <Eywind> Yea they're still really good if you can beat out their 3/7 hexproof flyer
[07:36:37] <Ali> Do what now?
[07:36:52] <Ali> What 3/7 flyer?
[07:36:54] <Eywind> http://magiccards.info/scans/en/frf/157.jpg <-- big flying wall
[07:36:56] * Ali is way out of the game
[07:37:27] <Ali> Eh, he's a 6 drop, much slower than Stormbreath
[07:37:31] <Eywind> Yeah I understand
[07:37:33] <Araxnus> Biznis Numbers
[07:37:43] <Eywind> just saying if they get it out you better have some extra burn lol
[07:37:49] <Eywind> or you're dead haha
[07:37:53] <Eywind> or at least walled
[07:37:54] <Ali> Fanatic of Mogis!
[07:38:00] <Ali> >.>
[07:38:06] <Eywind> lol yeah
[07:38:22] <Ali> Creature AND a burn all in one nice little package
[07:38:29] <Eywind> Yeah
[07:39:05] <Eywind> Creatures are pretty awesome right now
[07:39:18] <Ali> Sounds like it, and Mono Red didn't get hosed either
[07:39:39] <Ali> Isn't searing blaze basically a fireball?
[07:39:44] <Eywind> umm
[07:39:53] <Ali> My memory might be off
[07:39:55] <Eywind> Kinda better
[07:39:58] <Eywind> 2 mana 3 damage
[07:40:11] <Ali> Sounds like Lightening Strike
[07:40:12] <Eywind> it's 1 damage to target creature and 1 to its controller
[07:40:16] <Eywind> but 3 with landfall
[07:40:29] <Ali> So a better 1 drop huh?
[07:40:35] <Eywind> well it's RR
[07:40:37] <Eywind> it's searing blood
[07:40:39] *** Quits: Ampersand (Ampersand@Overpropelled.Pegasus) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[07:40:41] <Eywind> but a little different lol
[07:40:53] <Ali> Yeah, but its dependent on a landfall trigger
[07:40:59] <Eywind> Oh yeah it is
[07:41:01] <Ali> Still not a bad card though
[07:41:09] <Ali> Pairs well with Swiftspear
[07:41:12] <Eywind> But it's still slightly better than blood cuz you don't have to kill the creature
[07:41:19] <Ali> True true
[07:41:24] <Eywind> In either case
[07:41:31] <Eywind> lots of burn cards
[07:41:33] <Ali> Swiftspear loves burns
[07:41:34] <Eywind> burn's viable in modern right now
[07:41:39] <Ali> Cause of Prowess
[07:41:41] <Eywind> Yep
[07:41:46] <Eywind> Swiftspear is in my cube
[07:41:55] <Eywind> 1/2 first turn, 2/3 every turn after lol
[07:41:57] <Ali> Its a great and powerful 1 drop
[07:42:15] *** DixieTokusatsuKuuga-RX is now known as TokusatsuKuuga-RX
[07:42:27] <Araxnus> Trixie
[07:42:31] <Ali> Burn the creatures, get bigger, hit them for more damage
[07:42:56] <Eywind> Indeed
[07:43:05] <Eywind> then rabble on
[07:43:08] <Ali> Good to see Mono Red not get too screwed over, I was a bit worried
[07:43:13] <Ali> Oh yeah the Rabblemaster
[07:43:21] <Ali> I saw his price is going back up
[07:43:55] <Eywind> Yea a little
[07:44:08] <Ali> Well he fell quite a bit
[07:44:14] <Eywind> He was 25ish for a while
[07:44:16] <Eywind> 15 isn't too bad
[07:44:30] <Ali> I thought I saw him for awhile under 10
[07:44:43] <Eywind> Yeah 
[07:44:45] <Eywind> Shouldn't be that low
[07:44:54] <Eywind> Army in a cans are too powerful
[07:44:59] <Ali> I still think Stormbreath Dragon is one of the most underrated Mythics out.
[07:45:10] <Eywind> It was a huge part of RG monsters
[07:45:28] <Ali> Well I feel like Generator Servant made him playable
[07:45:30] <Eywind> RG Dragons runs Thunderbreak right now, but also runs Stormbreath
[07:45:40] <Eywind> Well it's an easy way to power him out early
[07:45:43] <Ali> This was before Thunderbreak though
[07:45:47] <Eywind> But it hasn't really been ran with generator
[07:45:55] <Eywind> Well yes I'm aware
[07:46:00] <Ali> I always ran Stormy with Generator
[07:46:26] <Ali> Nothing is scary as watching one drop in on T3 and Swiftspear has been an annoyance
[07:46:39] <Eywind> Definitely
[07:46:54] <Ali> Mainly cause of that awesome haste
[07:47:03] <Eywind> yep haste makes your powerful creatures into burn spells
[07:47:11] <Ali> That's all he has to do
[07:47:18] <Ali> Hit you once and he's done his job
[07:47:19] <Eywind> Yep
[07:47:25] <Ali> Until the next one comes out 2 turns later
[07:47:29] <Ali> Or Sarkhan
[07:47:34] <Eywind> Yes Sarkhan is awesome
[07:47:55] <Ali> Just a dragon deck lacked speed due to their high CMC
[07:48:03] <Ali> That's why I love Generator servant
[07:48:21] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Okay, starting up Dark Souls 2 gonna late night stream it on my channel but first need to find a Cestus build
[07:48:23] <Eywind> Yeah it's a cool card
[07:48:34] <Eywind> I do like the concept
[07:48:36] <Ali> As long as he lives the 1 turn to activite the suicide mana, people have to worry about him.
[07:48:42] <Araxnus> LadyAubernon: Look Fashion Ponies http://firebrandkun.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Rarity-and-Coco-Pommel-471941794
[07:48:55] <LadyAubernon> :D
[07:49:01] <Araxnus> Also how the heck is it like 11pm?
[07:49:10] <Eywind> it's not
[07:49:11] <Eywind> it's 1:49
[07:49:12] <Ali> You can, if you really want, use a servant to boost the Stormbreath, but that's not likely.
[07:49:24] <LadyAubernon> it is here :D
[07:49:30] <Araxnus> ^
[07:49:34] <Ali> I don't think I've ever monsterous a Stormbreath Dragon.
[07:49:40] <Araxnus> West Coast. Join us
[07:49:45] <Eywind> It's a great feeling vs the WU control decks
[07:49:46] <Eywind> they don't remove it
[07:49:49] <Eywind> next turn you pop it for 5
[07:49:51] <Eywind> then attack for 7
[07:50:01] <Ali> Well White can't touch Stormy~
[07:50:07] <Eywind> Exactly
[07:50:10] <Eywind> Though now it's usually black
[07:50:13] <Eywind> cuz of 5 mana board wipes
[07:50:26] <Ali> Well board whipes you have to worry about
[07:50:27] * Araxnus sets Topic. Eywind x Ali MAGIC CHAT ROOM.
[07:50:31] <Araxnus> <3
[07:50:31] <Eywind> hahaha
[07:50:39] <Ali> But single target?  White can't touch it.
[07:50:43] <Eywind> Indeed
[07:50:46] <Eywind> That's why it's great vs the wu
[07:50:51] <Araxnus> Imma go bread, Wub you guys
[07:50:53] <Eywind> Only half their colors will be able to answer it
[07:50:54] <Eywind> Night rax
[07:50:59] * Araxnus hugs LadyAubernon 
[07:51:04] <Araxnus> Thanks :)
[07:51:05] <Ali> And the surprise turn 3 drop might catch them without a counter
[07:51:06] * LadyAubernon hugs raxy
[07:51:08] <LadyAubernon> nini
[07:51:11] <Araxnus> ^.^
[07:51:16] <Eywind> Yeah maybe
[07:51:23] <Ali> Cause of Swiftspear?
[07:51:23] <Eywind> Most setup now is instant
[07:51:34] <Araxnus> !lullaby
[07:51:34] * DerpyBot carries Araxnus off to bed
[07:51:34] * DerpyBot tucks Araxnus in and hums a lullaby
[07:51:45] <Ali> They might waste their removel on Spear, and leave them open to the Stormbreath
[07:51:55] <Eywind> Eh, if you play servant out
[07:52:00] <Eywind> they're probably not going to remove the 1/2
[07:52:09] <Araxnus> She still puts me to bread even after kicking m 5 times today
[07:52:14] <Eywind> they'd probably remove the 2/1 lol
[07:52:14] <Araxnus> Dawww

[07:52:34] <Ali> Eh, who knows, again I'm not a pro magic player
[07:52:38] <Eywind> yeah me either
[07:52:43] <Ali> I just loved my Mono Red
[07:52:45] <Eywind> control at FNM is always a weird machup
[07:52:47] <Eywind> matchup*
[07:52:53] <Eywind> At worst I'll play tempo
[07:53:06] <Ali> As long as red has the burn threat
[07:53:16] <Ali> It has control in a problematic spot
[07:53:19] <Eywind> I've played UWR and GU tempo before; I don't want to make my game and my opponent's game both boring with control
[07:53:44] <Ali> Like that burn spell
[07:53:57] <Ali> Do you want to get burned for 3?  AND get punched by a 2/3 creature
[07:54:02] <Eywind> haha yeah
[07:54:38] <Ali> 5 damage on turn 2 is something you don't want to happen.
[07:54:58] <Ali> And doesn't spear have haste?
[07:54:59] <Eywind> agreed
[07:55:04] <Eywind> yup
[07:55:14] <Ali> So that's 6 damage on turn 2 if red went first
[07:55:17] <Eywind> yup
[07:55:22] <Eywind> Very solid
[07:55:41] <Ali> Puts control in a bad spot if you ask me
[07:55:47] <Eywind> It definitely does
[07:55:56] <Eywind> the control decks nowadays aren't really well-positioned against the aggro decks
[07:56:09] <Ali> And if you get more than one Swiftspear out
[07:56:09] <Eywind> but the sligh red decks aren't really a thing cuz they get wrecked by midrange
[07:56:14] <DinkyBot> !sunshine
[07:56:14] <DerpyBot> Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake!
[07:56:15] <DerpyBot> Clop your hooves...
[07:56:16] * DerpyBot clops her hooves
[07:56:17] <DerpyBot> ...and do a little shake!
[07:56:18] <Ali> Yeah I'm sure
[07:56:18] * DerpyBot wiggles at her muffin
[07:56:18] <DinkyBot> That was fun, momma!
[07:56:19] <Eywind> at least in the gp/pt cycle
[07:56:23] <Eywind> And everyone's playing midrange right now
[07:56:28] <Eywind> cuz of siege rhinos and tasigurs and stuff
[07:56:30] <Ali> Its a fun casual deck if you ask me
[07:56:45] <Eywind> Yep
[07:57:08] <Eywind> I played Goblins in modern a couple years ago
[07:57:14] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> !t October 31, 2015
[07:57:16] <DinkyBot> 31... That's odd...
[07:57:24] <Eywind> Never made me happier to see my opponent go fetch>shock>thoughtseize and look at my hand of like 4 1-2 drop hasters
[07:57:29] <Ali> Again I'm 2 sets behind so I don't know what's the norm and what isn't
[07:57:56] <Ali> And Thoughtseize does what again?
[07:58:02] <Ali> I know its the staple black card.
[07:58:03] <Eywind> Black sorcery, pay 2 life
[07:58:12] <Eywind> look at opponent's hand and pick a nonland to discrd
[07:58:27] <Eywind> but going fetch>shock>seize is them taking 5
[07:58:29] <Ali> Ah so instead of hitting a power card, he his that small guy
[07:58:31] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yeap that day I will watch Back to the future Part II
[07:58:39] <Eywind> they take 5 to take one of my random dudes in my deck
[07:58:46] <Ali> And then you smack him back for 5 damage with the spear
[07:58:50] <Eywind> Really I made the deck cuz my friend would take 7-8 life every game
[07:58:59] <Eywind> Well it was Modern, so it was Goblin Guide, but same premise
[07:59:37] <Ali> Ah
[07:59:55] <Eywind> Goblin Guide (2/2 haste), legion loyalist (1/1 haste, but if you attack with it and two other creatures your dudes have first strike and can't be blocked by tokens), etc.
[08:00:08] <Ali> Still your swiftspear is good, cause you landfall burn the gobo, hit him for 3, and the spear hits for 2
[08:00:16] <Eywind> Well yeah
[08:00:22] <Ali> Guide also looks at the top card of your deck and if a land, puts it into hand right?
[08:00:30] <Ali> Oppenent*
[08:00:31] <Eywind> opponent's deck yeah
[08:00:32] <Eywind> which is fine
[08:00:42] <Ali> Which helps trigger landfallburn :P
[08:00:44] <Eywind> they draw a card every 2.2 attacks or something
[08:01:02] <Teal> !t Teal
[08:01:03] <DinkyBot> Teal : lol. true
[08:01:07] <Teal> !t smite
[08:01:08] <DinkyBot> WhiteGryph0n playing smite? Looks like I'm screwed then
[08:01:37] * Ali liked Magic, but its an expensive game to get into.
[08:01:39] <Eywind> it really is
[08:01:50] <Eywind> but it's fun and a cheaper hobby for the amount of time you get out of it honestly
[08:02:11] <Ali> Well I changed how I bought into sets recently..before I had to stop
[08:02:19] <Eywind> You'd get like a case or something?
[08:02:22] <Ali> I would buy a box, 2 if it was a good price set
[08:02:27] <Eywind> ah okay
[08:02:29] <Ali> Case?  I'm not that crazy
[08:02:42] <Eywind> I got a case of Zendikar when I was getting back into magic lol
[08:02:45] * Ali isn't made of money to drop everything on magic
[08:02:55] * Ali didn't pull one jace
[08:03:03] <Ali> but I got 5 of the next set Jace and he sucked
[08:03:04] <Eywind> I traded for all of mine I had
[08:03:06] <Eywind> XD
[08:03:10] <Eywind> jace memory adept?
[08:03:15] <Ali> Eeyup
[08:03:16] <Eywind> He was okay
[08:03:22] <Ali> Miller in a buyback block
[08:03:24] <Eywind> control sideboards though
[08:03:33] <Eywind> Yeah he was not as good vs flashback
[08:03:40] <Eywind> usually it was like a 5 mana fog that drew you a couple cards
[08:03:47] <Eywind> and would occasionally win you the game if you protected him for 4 turns
[08:03:49] <Ali> And the block he was in had that as the set theme
[08:03:57] <Eywind> yeah he was in the core set, innistrad after
[08:04:05] <ButtonMasher_Draco> I have never played a melee class in Dark Souls 2, this is going to be fun! haha
[08:04:08] <Ali> So the cast him and mill 10 was pointless
[08:04:22] <Eywind> Most of the time
[08:04:28] <Eywind> Sometimes it was good
[08:04:38] <Ali> Yeah but not good against flashback

[16:16:15] <Hamtramck> I heard the series went downhill after that.
[16:16:23] <RandomNinja> it did!

[16:18:43] <RandomNinja> you should, it is one of the most glorious games
[16:18:54] <Hamtramck> Yeah I thinkI heard it's where the series peaked, come to think of it.
[16:19:05] <Hamtramck> My laptop can't really handle Crysis on super-pretty settings.
[16:19:12] <Hamtramck> Like if I put them on mediumish it runs fine.
[16:19:17] <Unixkitty> Ooh, it is even on steam
[16:19:20] <RandomNinja> yeah I'd say Warhead is slightly better than 1, but also shorter
[16:19:33] <Hamtramck> But I'm lke, screw that, I'll take the lower framerate. I want pretty trees!
[16:19:48] <RandomNinja> play it on hardest difficulty :P

[16:34:25] <Hamtramck> I only played it on hardest mode.
[16:34:31] <RandomNinja> it's the only way
[16:34:43] <Unixkitty> Well... if you count that I always played Call of Duty on Veteran...
[16:34:43] <Hamtramck> Like seriously, it's like with New Vegas or Vaklyrie Profile where everything about it felt balanced towards the hardest difficulty.
[16:34:58] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t easy mode 
[16:34:59] <RandomNinja> wait no, Delta, not Ultra
[16:34:59] <DinkyBot> It's easy, mop. See ya later chattybox!
[16:35:12] <Hamtramck> Man, classic Call of Duty was so good :(
[16:35:13] <RandomNinja> New Vegas is stupidly easy vanilla though
[16:35:41] <RandomNinja> you basically become the avatar of death by the time you arrive at the strip
[16:35:58] <Hamtramck> That depends on when you get to the strip!
[16:36:09] <RandomNinja> standard main quest path :P
[16:36:16] <Hamtramck> It was the second town I went to.
[16:36:43] <RandomNinja> yeah if you can get past the cazadores or radscorpions
[16:36:58] <RandomNinja> or the blind deathclaw
[16:37:44] <Hamtramck> Also I wouldn't say any of the Fallouts were particularly hard. 1 was harder if you went out of your way to keep everyone alive. 2 had some... hard moments related to really awkward dungeon design.
[16:38:07] <RandomNinja> 2 is really hard the first hours if you don't go unarmed/melee
[16:38:14] <RandomNinja> but otherwise yeah
[16:38:56] <RandomNinja> also with the right build you can beat 1 in half an hour with some luck and/or savescumming :P
[16:39:25] <Hamtramck> That trap templ thing. Woohoo >:T
[16:40:17] <Unixkitty> !link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0tYs5U5RI
[16:40:18] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about For The New Lunar Republic (Fan Music)
[16:40:27] <RandomNinja> gotta love how savescumming is canon in Fallout 2
[16:41:14] <Hamtramck> Anyway I don't know if I like open-world RPGs when they're difficult. Like just looking back on the ones I've liked those most, they tend to be stuff like Ultima 7 or Planescape Torment, where the combat stuff is really easy.
[16:41:53] <RandomNinja> new fallout is kind of an exception though
[16:42:04] <Hamtramck> I do like the Gothic games though. Those could be pretty mean to you. Although the combat in those was way more hands-on and timing based than what you usually get.
[16:42:07] <RandomNinja> as they're very actual player-skill dependant
[16:42:24] <Hamtramck> Like Wizardry 8 was hard and it annoyed me because it was all stats and RNG.
[16:43:01] <RandomNinja> if combat is player skill heavy rather than stats and RNG, hard is more fun
[16:43:47] <Hamtramck> Good point.
[16:43:59] <Hamtramck> A lot of the reason why I can't really stand Morrowind anymore is again it's all RNG based.
[16:44:08] <RandomNinja> which is why New Vegas on hardest with Project Nevada is best New Vegas :P
[16:44:29] <RandomNinja> yeah the combat system is really what holds morrowind back
[16:44:43] <RandomNinja> beside that it's amazing
[16:44:46] <Hamtramck> (Also morrowind had weird map design issues wrt small scenery objects that you couldn't walk over even though it looked like you could of)
[16:44:49] <Hamtramck> could have
[16:45:11] <RandomNinja> yeah but that's minor
[16:45:50] * RandomNinja savescums Unixkitty 
[16:46:38] <Unixkitty> I have no clue what that means I'm afraid
[16:47:25] <RandomNinja> saving before you do anything with risk of failure (combat, lockpick, stealing, speech checks...) and reloading if it doesn't go according to plan
[16:47:50] *** Joins: LetsEatHay (LetsEatHay@Pony-htiodd.sntcca.sbcglobal.net)
[16:48:05] <RandomNinja> If you're going to play Crysis on hardest, savescumming will probably be necessary :P
[16:48:53] * Unixkitty may or may not like to press the button before entering almost any door in Skyrim pretty much...
[16:48:58] <Hamtramck> Nah man, rely entirely on the checkpoint saves.
[16:49:15] <Unixkitty> If quicksaving exists, why not make use of it?
[16:49:25] <Hamtramck> :P
[16:49:28] <RandomNinja> you can, but you kind of need to know the map by heart for that
[16:49:35] <Hamtramck> Seriously though, I'm playing Shadow Tower lately and I WAS save stating constantly but that kind of took the fun out of it, since the game's not based around saving anywhere.
[16:49:57] <thereallynewmop12100_> afk for shower then LoE Time! 
[16:49:57] <Hamtramck> So now I'm just using the actual save points.
[16:50:06] <RandomNinja> LetsEatHay, go play Crysis :P
[16:50:50] <LetsEatHay> my comp is too slow for that :P
[16:51:00] <RandomNinja> acquire better computer :P
[16:51:18] <LetsEatHay> it’s on the todo list
[16:51:21] <LetsEatHay> always lol :P
[16:51:23] * wobniaR applies secret boss Gaben to RandomNinja
[16:51:27] <RandomNinja> it is 8 years old though, so you should be able to run it on anything remotely modern :P
[16:51:40] <wobniaR> Spoiler alert: You can't win
[16:51:45] <Hamtramck> LetsEatHay, what's your GPU/CPU?
[16:51:51] <LetsEatHay> oh the original Crysis?
[16:51:55] <RandomNinja> yeah
[16:52:00] <RandomNinja> the best one(s) :P
[16:52:13] <RandomNinja> wobniaR, but you'll lose gloriously
[16:52:22] <LetsEatHay> MacBook Pro laptop a few years old, has some ATI GPU but it overheats easily
[16:52:59] <Hamtramck> Oh. I don't know anything about macs, though Crysis works fine on any sort of quasi-recentish integrated graphics. From like, 2012 at least.
[16:53:00] <RandomNinja> Core2Duo or better should run it decently
[16:53:12] <RandomNinja> mobile ATI though
[16:53:46] <RandomNinja> yeah just set everything to lowest, EXCEPT physics and objects
[16:54:17] <RandomNinja> you want maxed out physics settings to do some of the fun parts, like punching houses down and shooting out tires
[16:54:28] <LetsEatHay> haha
[16:54:47] <Hamtramck> You can put everything on Medium-High except the Shaders, really.
[16:54:50] <Hamtramck> The shaders are way heavy.
[16:54:59] <LetsEatHay> i wish days were 24000 hours long
[16:55:08] <LetsEatHay> but just for me, not for everyone else
[16:55:10] <LetsEatHay> :P
[16:55:23] <RandomNinja> in the right circumstances, you litteraly can shoot out the tires on an enemy jeep, causing it to slide and flip over
[16:55:25] <RandomNinja> it's amazing
[16:55:31] <LetsEatHay> that’s awesome
[16:55:45] <LetsEatHay> i did download the demo and play it a few years ago on my old desktop pc
[16:55:45] <RandomNinja> and then you run up and punch the koreans to death :P
[16:55:55] <RandomNinja> or drop a grenade

[16:58:21] <LetsEatHay> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwuFd5uK_xQ
[16:58:22] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[16:58:23] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Unreal Engine 4 Kite Demo - Real Time - Running on TITAN X
[17:00:00] <RandomNinja> also, people have made shader packs and textures to make Crysis even more glorious
[17:00:30] <Hamtramck> I wonder if there are any fanmade shader packs that run better.
[17:00:36] <RandomNinja> probably
[17:01:07] * LetsEatHay throws laptop at RandomNinja’s head
[17:01:17] * RandomNinja has already ascended
[17:01:43] <LetsEatHay> lol
[17:02:23] <RandomNinja> but yeah you should really give it a run, such a great game

[17:05:18] *** Mongoosie|Sleep is now known as Mongoosie
[17:05:46] <Hamtramck> Oh I watched this guy playing Doom on twitch lately. It was a literally blind run.
[17:06:00] <Hamtramck> meaning he had his monitor off.
[17:07:06] <Hamtramck> So he's relying entirely on using rockets for echolocation, monster sounds, and that grunt you make when you try to activate a wall to get around.
[17:07:06] <LetsEatHay> haha how did he do?
[17:07:15] <Hamtramck> He beat episode 1.
[17:07:23] <RandomNinja> awesome
[17:07:27] <LetsEatHay> lol awesome
[17:08:33] <Hamtramck> Anyway, PSX game I've been playing, Shadow Tower, kind of reminds me of that. You have a lowish view distance and the game's rather dark. There's no music, but enemies make a lot of noise, and you /really/ rely on the audio cues to figure out what you're dealing with since you can hear enemies way before you can see them.
[17:09:00] <Hamtramck> I think the Kenji Eno game Enemy Zero worked on a similar principle, although in that the monsters were totally invisible.
[17:10:31] <RandomNinja> this is starting to get silly, my mead is still not finished after 7 weeks

[17:17:32] <LetsEatHay> i dont understant it
[17:18:07] <LetsEatHay> how long is it supposed to take to make?
[17:18:33] <RandomNinja> fermentation is usually done within a month, then a few months of aging
[17:19:17] <LetsEatHay> so you have to plan to start making it before you’re thirsty
[17:20:00] <RandomNinja> yeah what I'm currently drinking is from last year
[17:20:19] <LetsEatHay> does it turn out good?

[17:21:17] <RandomNinja> first batch a year ago: apple mead, good young but I finished it before it got to age into excellence.
[17:21:51] <LetsEatHay> cool
[17:22:00] <LetsEatHay> i’ve never tried mead
[17:22:03] <RandomNinja> second batch last autumn, spiced apple mead, pretty good, too much cinnamon that's now starting to mellow
[17:22:36] <RandomNinja> third batch: raspberry/blueberry mead. Holy butts it's great :3
[17:22:58] <RandomNinja> you should try, starting equipment is like $30-40
[17:23:34] <LetsEatHay> that’s cheap, i thoight it would cost more
[17:23:48] <RandomNinja> 4th batch from january this year, dry peach mead, needs time but has potential
[17:24:29] <LetsEatHay> would bacon work?
[17:24:33] <LetsEatHay> bacon mead
[17:25:00] <RandomNinja> currently a "standard" (nothing but honey) mead that I'll split into 2 and and add cherries to one
[17:25:10] <RandomNinja> probably not
[17:25:21] <LetsEatHay> how much can you make at a time?
[17:25:50] <RandomNinja> I know people have made bacon stout, which apparently is acceptable at best
[17:25:53] <RandomNinja> hold on
[17:26:04] <LetsEatHay> wow lol
[17:26:53] <RandomNinja> about 3 gallons a batch, in an $8 food grade bucket
[17:27:08] <RandomNinja> usually make 1-2 though
[17:28:02] <RandomNinja> many use glass carboys though, mostly because it looks awesome http://www.homebrewtalk.com/gallery/data/1/medium/IMG_1065.JPG
[17:29:06] <Hamtramck> Man I wonder if I could order some loose manuals for someof the disc only PSX games I have.
[17:29:36] <RandomNinja> of course, if you buy like a gallon of milk, juice or something, there's nothing stopping you from fermenting it that, except that it looks a bit tacky
[17:29:48] <LetsEatHay> haha
[17:30:07] <RandomNinja> in fact, buying a gallon of juice and just dropping some yeast in is a popular way of making lazy cider :P
[17:30:14] <Hamtramck> ... That reminds me, I still have a bottle of juice that I got shortly before I moved here.
[17:30:16] <Hamtramck> In 2010.
[17:30:17] <Hamtramck> :T
[17:30:25] <LetsEatHay> lol
[17:30:32] <RandomNinja> it might have fermented, drink it! :P
