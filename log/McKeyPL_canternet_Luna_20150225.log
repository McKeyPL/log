[21:18:13] -Luna- ChanServ gives normal users the ability to maintain control
[21:18:13] -Luna- of a channel, without the need of a bot. Channel takeovers are
[21:18:13] -Luna- virtually impossible when a channel is registered with ChanServ.
[21:18:13] -Luna- Registration is a quick and painless process. Once registered,
[21:18:13] -Luna- the founder can maintain complete and total control over the channel.
[21:18:13] -Luna- Please note that channels will expire after 30 days of inactivity,
[21:18:13] -Luna- or if there are no eligible channel successors.
[21:18:13] -Luna- Activity is defined as a user with one of +FHORafhoqrsv being on the channel.
[21:18:13] -Luna- Successors are primarily those who have the +R flag
[21:18:13] -Luna- set on their account in the channel, although other
[21:18:13] -Luna- people may be chosen depending on their access
[21:18:13] -Luna- level and activity.
[21:18:13] -Luna-  
[21:18:13] -Luna- Commands can also be given on channel by prefixing one of '!'
[21:18:13] -Luna- and omitting the channel name. These are called "fantasy"
[21:18:13] -Luna- commands and can also be disabled on a per-channel basis.
