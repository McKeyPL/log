[07:07:54] <FineLine> [ Persephone Hime~ | danisnotorfire: danisnotorfire: NO BUT IT... ]
[07:08:19] <Vulpix_Necromancer> oh gods
[07:08:42] <plushie_pegasus> but zombies are slobs!
[07:09:03] <Vulpix_Necromancer> not my zombies guaranteed neat freaks or no money back
[07:09:20] <plushie_pegasus> I don't want to have to pick up body parts 
[07:12:14] <thaostra> cloppyhooves, Have you played Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball?
[07:12:51] <cloppyhooves> I have not :o
[07:12:54] <cloppyhooves> What's it about?

[07:15:01] <cloppyhooves> Looks interesting c:

[07:15:18] <cloppyhooves> What makes you think I'd like it? :o
[07:15:31] <cloppyhooves> Not meant in a defensive way, just a bit curious why the suggestion c:
[07:17:00] <thaostra> I think the game looks very accessible, and I've been thinking of finding a game some of us could play together in
[07:17:46] <thaostra> The soundtrack is catchy, the concept is simple yet has depth
[07:19:02] <thaostra> The reception has also been overwhelming positive, so I figure you'd probably like it too

[21:33:40] <EbonMane> I know, right? 
[21:33:43] <thaostra> The message is that if you drink Mike's Hard Lemonade, then you'll also want Mike's Hard Dick in your butt
[21:34:01] <EbonMane> How's the air guys thingy?
[21:34:14] <Frosty> Huh?
[21:34:43] <Frosty> I drank Mikes once, and I actually liked it. I did anal once, and I'll never do it again
