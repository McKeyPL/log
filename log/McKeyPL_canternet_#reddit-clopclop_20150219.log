[07:31:56] <weisey> There's one allergy I find stupid that we cater to
[07:31:58] <weisey> Nuts
[07:32:00] <weisey> Maybe
[07:32:05] <weisey> Just maybe
[07:32:06] <Quinn> allergic to those too
[07:32:18] <weisey> If touching a nut kills you
[07:32:29] <weisey> You were supposed to be dead
[07:32:40] <Squirrelly> rofl
[07:32:40] <Quinn> if someone is eating almonds in the same room as me I can get really sick
[07:32:43] <Quinn> that's how bad it is
[07:32:49] <Squirrelly> That sucks

[07:33:52] <PartyPopper> I didn't think a nut allergy could get that bad
[07:33:59] <Quinn> yup
[07:34:09] <Quinn> if I eat any, my throat closes up and I'll die
[07:34:18] <Vulpixbrew> eeyup, can be so massive emt wouldn't have time to arive
[07:34:23] <Quinn> ^
[07:34:31] <Quinn> that's what epipens are for
[07:34:35] <Quinn> they give the emt time to arive
[07:34:38] <Quinn> before you die
[07:34:46] <PartyPopper> That's
[07:34:49] <PartyPopper> horrifying
[07:34:59] <Quinn> meh, I've been living with it for 24 years
[07:35:03] <PartyPopper> All that happens when I eat nuts is my mouth gets a little itchy
[07:35:18] <Quinn> I check ingredients religiously
[07:35:24] <Quinn> don't even think about it, it's just habit
[07:35:32] <Quinn> also I get the same reaction to sesame seeds
[07:35:38] <PartyPopper> Oh noo
[07:36:01] <Quinn> yup
[07:36:05] <Quinn> McDonalds = death
[07:36:17] <PartyPopper> McDonalds is shit anyways
[07:36:19] <Quinn> why do they even put them on there?
[07:36:20] <PartyPopper> your not missing anythign
[07:36:22] <Quinn> what's the point?
[07:36:28] <Quinn> do they taste like anything?
[07:36:37] <PartyPopper> They're trying to be fancy or something
[07:36:39] <weisey> Its called anaphylactic shock
[07:36:46] <Quinn> yup
[07:36:47] <PartyPopper> but it's McDonalds so they can't
[07:37:03] <Quinn> fastfood I always go Wendy's because they don't put that shit all over their food
[07:37:43] <Quinn> also, surprisingly I have no allergy to peanuts 
[07:37:46] <weisey> Wendy's also has bacon
[07:37:50] <PartyPopper> Wendy's is pretty okay
[07:37:55] <PartyPopper> $1 crispy chicken though man
[07:38:16] <Quinn> cause peanuts aren't actually nuts
[07:38:19] <Quinn> so I'm good
[07:38:55] <Squirrelly> Honestly, I hate sesame seeds and poppy seeds
[07:38:58] <Squirrelly> Despise them
[07:39:06] <Quinn> still though
[07:39:10] <Squirrelly> They ruin the texture of the bun for me
[07:39:14] <Quinn> I'm the only person I know who's never had a big mac
[07:39:21] <PartyPopper> I never understood why people liked poppy seeds
[07:39:21] <Squirrelly> I haven't
[07:39:31] <PartyPopper> Or felt the need to put them all over bagels and doughnuts
[07:39:34] <Vulpixbrew> I have and I wish I never did
[07:39:40] <Squirrelly> Cuz it's opium in tiny doses!
[07:39:44] <Squirrelly> lol
[07:39:46] <Quinn> do sesame seeds actually taste like anything?
[07:39:53] <weisey> Yes
[07:39:54] <Squirrelly> Not to me
[07:40:15] <weisey> They're very very slightly sweet
[07:40:23] <weisey> I think
[07:40:23] <Quinn> I had them when I was like 4 but I almost died from it and was hospitalized so  Ireally don't remember how they taste
[07:40:40] <Flame> well i g2g momentarily
[07:41:17] <PartyPopper> I've never noticed that they taste like anything
[07:41:21] <weisey> There's a jetski in the water near this ferry dock
[07:41:22] <PartyPopper> I thought they were just for show
[07:41:32] <weisey> It sounds like someone ripping a mad fart
[07:41:39] <Quinn> so the point stands, why put them on?? it just makes people like me never be able to buy the product in question

[09:31:08] <Lumia> Hey melon c:
[09:31:51] <weisey> iamalion: also v34 css
[09:32:15] <weisey> All dem fragmovies and bunnyhops
[09:32:35] <iamalion> ?
[09:33:02] <weisey> CS:Source v34
[09:33:33] <weisey> The last update before they killed bunnyhopping and boosting
[09:33:42] <weisey> Also the longest stable update
[09:33:48] <iamalion> wait they finally fucking fixed bhopping in css? 
[09:33:50] <iamalion> woaaaah
[09:33:54] <iamalion> there were entire maps and servers for bhopping
[09:34:19] <weisey> Where most old demos and tournament clips are from
[09:34:19] <weisey> Yeah
[09:34:40] <weisey> They removed bhop and flashboost
[09:34:51] <weisey> They added cvars to re enable them
[09:34:56] <weisey> But it wasn't the same
[09:35:07] <weisey> Air accelerate got kinda broken
[09:35:27] <weisey> CSS has gone so far down hill since v34
[09:35:52] <iamalion> wow thats crazy they fixed it
[09:36:01] <iamalion> the bunnyhopping was one of hte big reasons I bought csgo
[09:36:01] <weisey> They didn't fix it
[09:36:04] <iamalion> I couldnt stand it
[09:36:04] <weisey> They broke it
[09:36:05] <iamalion> oh
[09:36:29] <weisey> Bunnyhop was an essential part of the ga.e
[09:36:29] <weisey> Game*
[09:37:06] <weisey> now there's a kinda okay version in sv_enablebunnyhopping 
[09:37:20] <weisey> Not the same as v34 though
[09:37:32] <weisey> Also, that got added around '08/09
[09:37:41] <weisey> I wouldn't call that "finally fixed"
[09:37:50] <weisey> It hasn't existed for 7 damn years
[09:39:40] <weisey> Flashboosting was cheap, yeah

[23:55:42] <iam[a]lion> yeah but no posts :(

[23:56:38] <Squirrelly> Remind me to not do Nemesis Draft when I play League
[23:56:44] <Squirrelly> because that's how I stop playing
[23:57:02] <Squirrelly> Because people apparently find it hard to just give the enemy team bad champions
