[03:04:04] <AppleDash> I think I might have gone too far this time with my borderline abuse of C
[03:04:08] <AppleDash> can someone have a look at this code
[03:04:38] <Webster> As long as it's not C++
[03:04:46] <AppleDash> It's C
[03:04:48] <AppleDash> with no +es
[03:04:51] *** Phase5 is now known as Phase4
[03:05:04] <Phase4> Webster, C++ is inherently an abuse of C
[03:05:15] <Webster> Heh.
[03:05:44] <AppleDash> https://gist.github.com/AppleDash/fc0fa4e28bac06833e7e
[03:05:45] <PinkiePieBot> [ aassa.c ]
[03:05:49] <AppleDash> Most specifically my signal handling
[03:06:25] <AppleDash> I didn't want to put everything into globals
[03:06:41] <Phase4> XD
[03:06:53] <Phase4> that is a cool way to do things
[03:09:12] <AppleDash> It works :P
[03:09:16] <AppleDash> Also, I'm missing a free()
[03:12:44] <Webster> I just did signal stuff today at work, oddly enough.
[03:13:37] <AppleDash> If curious, the actual program is an unfinished thing that will monitor a dir for images and upload them to my screenshot thingy I made
[03:13:48] <Webster> Not sure I'm liking this goto and jump stuff.
[03:14:08] <AppleDash> That's the questionable part :P
[03:14:18] <AppleDash> But the alternative is putting half of the stuff into globals
[03:14:37] <Webster> I'd just have a global 'running' flag and set it to '0'/false when a signal was intercepted.
[03:14:51] <AppleDash> But the program would hang until it received another event
[03:14:53] <Webster> Then have 'while( running )' instead of 'while( 1 )'
[03:15:02] <Webster> Oh, it's blocking?
[03:15:07] <AppleDash> Yes, read() blocks :P
[03:16:23] <Webster> Any way to check to see if there's stuff to be read instead?
[03:16:36] <AppleDash> Sure, that's what select() is for
[03:16:50] <AppleDash> But I don't know if I want to remember how to use that in C
[03:17:05] <Webster> Heh.
[03:19:51] <AppleDash> It's really a question if using a function and keyword you should never use outweighs using globals or similar :P
[03:21:16] <Webster> A couple of globals for controlling program flow isn't too bad.
[03:21:31] <Webster> Dealing with blocking IO in a single threaded program is a bit of a pain though.

[04:16:07] <Moonlightning> x.x
[04:18:07] <LegionRed> You should go watch JoeFenix tho... hes doing a bloodborne 'waste of skin' no leveling run. All bosses. 
[04:18:31] <LegionRed> Whole game with a level 4 character with base stats. Only gear and weapons upgrades.
[04:18:54] <Moonlightning> Bloodborne?
[04:20:23] <LegionRed> Bloodborne, it's the ps4 game of choice right now for people who like dying a lot.
[04:21:15] <Moonlightning> Huh.
[04:21:18] <Moonlightning> I'm not much of a gamer.
[04:21:30] <LegionRed> It's like dark souls with blood instead of souls. Gothic victorian styling. And much faster paced combat. 
[04:21:41] <Moonlightning> Don't know much about Dark Souls :p
[04:21:52] <LegionRed> Heh.

[04:48:30] <Datguy> Hey everyone 
[04:48:34] <AppleDash> Interesting
[04:48:40] <AppleDash> @ Googie
[04:50:56] <Datguy> So, how bad have I messed up if namecheap, cloudflare, and digitalocean know my IP for a website that's being sought after by viacom? 
[04:51:17] <AppleDash> Datguy: What?
[04:51:22] <Datguy> And if digitalocean knows my name... 
[04:51:48] <Datguy> I'm panicing over getting served court papers... 
[04:51:48] <Moonlightning> sought after for /what?/ o.O
[04:52:02] <Moonlightning> papers for /what?/ O.o;
[04:52:30] <Datguy> Probably for providing a means of distribution for illegal content. 
[04:52:57] <Datguy> It's a nickreboot clone. A cytube installation. 
[04:53:47] <Datguy> The admin of nickreboot is involved in a federal investigation and I didn't realize how poorly I hid my tracks until now
[04:54:04] <Datguy> And I'm freaking out 
[04:54:32] <Moonlightning> Okay, slow down. What happened?
[04:54:44] <Moonlightning> Is the IP mentioned the address of a server you run?
[04:54:48] <Moonlightning> How do you fit into all this?
[04:55:39] <Datguy> Nickreboot.com, was a website that hosted and streamed 90's nick cartoons. It started shutting down. In the panic, I bought a domain, and a VPS with digitalocean under a fake name. 
[04:56:19] <Datguy> Installed a copy of calzoneman's sync (cytube) and modified it to be more familiar to the users of nickreboot. 
[04:56:48] <Datguy> Today I found out that nickreboot and it's admin are involved in a federal investigation... 
[04:57:14] <Datguy> And I did a horrid job covering up. The ip in question is my home ip. 
[04:58:09] <Moonlightning> So…you made a video hosting site? Not unlike YouTube?
[04:58:22] <Datguy> No, this is why I thought it was OK. 
[04:58:27] <Datguy> I don't host any content. 
[04:58:42] <Datguy> Google Drive does. I just synchronize everyone to the same spot in the same file 
[04:58:51] <Datguy> It emulates a stream
[04:59:07] <Phase5> synctube-ish
[04:59:13] <Datguy> Exactly 
[04:59:51] <Datguy> But I'm starting to believe that argument would not hold up in court

[08:19:49] <Lapsus> Kinsley, AppleDash, whoever else cares: I don't really see the channel as having a rating, it's not an RP channel, it doesn't really apply. As far as SFW or not goes, well, it's not really the place to be linking porn or talking sex and all, but then again, it's a tech channel, so I don't really think the topics are likely to come up, as there are better channels for that. As far as that 
[08:19:49] <Lapsus> comment, it was a bit out of line but you've both sorted it out nicely anyways so hooray I guess?
[08:21:58] <Lapsus> I guess I could make a rules link or something in the topic but do we really need it? This is a very well behaved channel with some interesting discussions and I'd like to keep it that way. Any rules that could be written would just boil down to "try not to be a dick" and that's common sense anyways.
[08:23:42] <AppleDash> yay

[19:58:16] <endoriazel> kernel downgrade fixed the problem ... but thanks anyways
[19:58:30] <endoriazel> probably shouldve kept you guys updated
[19:58:31] <Moonlightning> Or you could look up the magic number and its offset from the start, and use that.
