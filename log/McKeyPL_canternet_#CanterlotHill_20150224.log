[04:43:39] <EM-C> I think so.
[04:43:42] <EM-C> What was wrong?
[04:43:47] <Araxnus> Awesome then.
[04:43:59] <Araxnus> Hm. Not sure. lol. Sry.
[04:44:19] <EM-C> Well...it's fixed for now at least.  This has happened before, it'll probably happen again.
[04:44:40] <Araxnus> Were looking into working out bugs so.
[04:44:51] <EM-C> Anyway, just wanted to stop by and tell everyone I'm still alive and still connected.  Just couldn't get on chat for some reason.
[04:45:37] <EM-C> Araxnus: Latin is a very very difficult language from what I hear.  Only slightly less difficult than Greek.
[04:45:53] <wobniaR> I want to learn Atlantean
[04:46:06] <Araxnus> Yup. Sure is. I do love it's style.
[04:46:08] <EM-C> Aside from Modern English, all Indo-European languages are highly complex and very difficult.

[04:47:33] <Araxnus> Ineed. It can be hard.
[04:47:47] <EM-C> Unfortunately, my pronunciation, which used to be quite good, is getting worse and worse.  I know *how* to pronounce the words; my tongue just doesn't want to work anymore.
[04:47:56] <EM-C> It **is** hard.  All the time.  Every time.
[04:48:13] <EM-C> Maybe I need reading glasses.
[04:48:22] <Araxnus> Ah.
[04:48:40] <EM-C> I stumble constantly now.  Not sure what the problem is.
[04:49:17] <EM-C> My inability may be connected with my Asperger's; I don't know.  I can't do math either.
[04:49:31] <EM-C> Ironically, textual languages are more like math than living languages.

[04:55:17] <Araxnus> One-Trick: Ah. New Skype is not so bad. I'm already used to it, But yeah that is dumb on MS.
[04:55:19] <Sketchy_Sounds> Wow. That's just plain bullheaded of 'em =/
[04:55:50] <Araxnus> EM-C: I always did think that about Dr. Pepper.
[04:56:00] <Sketchy_Sounds> New Skype is awful if you're in groups that have a lot of messages (such as, say, con organiser groups), as it lags like hell when switching to them.
[04:56:01] <EM-C> Araxnus, is your screen name adapted from the name "Arax?"
[04:56:02] <One-Trick> i like the old skype, its not all terrible
[04:56:10] <One-Trick> why do i *have* tp upgrade it to use Live
[04:56:34] <One-Trick> im going to assume theyre going to get rid of Live and just move to Skype with this kind of movement
[04:56:55] <Araxnus> EM-C: It is from Doctor Who. The spelling is a play on the Racnoss.
[04:57:17] <EM-C> Oh.  Well, that's just been bothering me all along.  Now I know.
[04:57:31] <EM-C> Kinda disappointed though.  Was kinda hoping you were Armenian.
[04:57:45] <Araxnus> One-Trick: They already have. That is why they asked you to upgrade. They moved stuff over.
[04:57:53] <Araxnus> EM-C: Ah okay.
[04:58:14] <Sketchy_Sounds> Asked? More like forced :p

[06:38:13] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: One of the first chatrooms I was ever part of. We started as a collective fandom brought together by James Cameron's Titanic, but then it became its own community. We'd talk about things outside of Titanic, and more.
[06:38:37] * Muffin_Spectacles still remembers meeting one girl on there, and doing a watercolor portrait of her in 2 weeks. I  still wonder if she kept it.
[06:41:04] <Muffin_Spectacles> I did a blog post on Titanic a few years ago, and a few of the chatroom persons commented on my blog post. It was nice to know some had fond memories like I did. It was a good introduction to internet chatrooms. If we weren't on The CLock, we'd meet on ICQ.
[06:41:59] <MikeM> ha..ICQ. I remember that.

[12:53:40] <FruitNibbler> Poor stitching RandomNinja ?
[12:55:02] <RandomNinja> a bunch of loose threads
[12:56:25] <FruitNibbler> Seems to be standard nowadays
[12:57:07] <FruitNibbler> I have a coat that was €120 worth: all the buttons are so loosely threaded on it that they came off the first week
[12:57:38] <FruitNibbler> And that is a "designer piece" straight from fashionable outlet in Milano!!!
[12:57:52] <FruitNibbler> Heresy, but it is everywhure
[12:58:54] <RandomNinja> yeah, this was 2 for €30 buttondowns though
[13:00:23] <RandomNinja> my expensive ones have been high quality
[13:00:35] <FruitNibbler> My best deal was €4 sweater and €2 t-shirt from Bundeswehr shop
[13:01:04] <RandomNinja> but fun fact: "designer piece" means you pay at least 150% too much :P
[13:01:10] <FruitNibbler> Not much choice of colour (beige, green and khaki), but Tia do I regret not buying more of those
[13:01:58] <RandomNinja> is bundeswehr second hand?
[13:02:07] <FruitNibbler> RandomNinja, it was straight from Milano (so -60%) and it was an outlet (aka older models that are "out of fashion" up to -90%) 
[13:02:23] <RandomNinja> hm weird then

[13:03:56] <FruitNibbler> It is frowned upon to buy in there for those who have income, but Celestia is my witness that army t-shirt sits on me like a charm
[13:05:10] <RandomNinja> yay. cheap quality
[13:06:00] <FruitNibbler> Maybe I should dress like in the most expensive and flashy clothing, with €350 BOSE headphones and €5000 watch too, and then go to that charity store to buy some t-shirts
[13:06:13] <RandomNinja> €5000 watch? madness

[13:09:29] <RandomNinja> which is significantly higher than your head! :P
[13:09:38] <FruitNibbler> Not that I can actually dive that deep in breath hold dive, but it is nice still
