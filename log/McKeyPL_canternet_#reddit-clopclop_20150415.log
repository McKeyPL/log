[04:58:38] <preeb> oh hi~
[04:59:05] <Drago> Hot. I've been thinking of that since i heard of it like 10 years ago. I could probably fecking hack some nice extra skin to play with
[04:59:07] <preeb> it's so nice to still have mine. thanks parents!
[04:59:17] <Quinn> lucky :P
[04:59:18] <Drago> :(
[05:00:06] <Quinn> I got a TLC tugger
[05:00:12] <Drago> Oh well. Not like I know any different
[05:00:53] <preeb> I really wish you had the chance to know though
[05:01:03] <preeb> it's unfair
[05:01:23] <Quinn> I got lucky the circumcision I had apparently left a lot of loose skin 
[05:01:49] <Quinn> I can stretch it almost over the whole head when it's not erect
[05:02:08] <Quinn> so hopefully in half a year I'll have a full foreskin :o

[05:03:22] <preeb> maan, everytime i want to measure my flaccid i start getting a boner
[05:04:22] <Quinn> I just want that added pleasure
[05:04:30] <Drago> I haven't measured my pride in probably a little less than a decade
[05:04:37] <Quinn> after getting to play with uncut penis, I realize how much I'm missing D:
[05:05:56] <Drago> The only guy I was actually with for awhile had a good 7 inch uncut cock. Good times. He was a great bottom too.
[05:06:32] <Quinn> and after watching him masturbating
[05:06:32] <Drago> I've never bottomed but I can do I good job orally if I say so myself :P
[05:06:45] <Quinn> and giving him a handjob  I realized how much nicer it is
[05:07:02] <Quinn> I have to use lube because the skin doesn't really move :c
[05:07:04] <Quinn> he doesn't
[05:07:33] <Drago> Luckily my skin isn't real taught when erect. I can still clop dry.
[05:07:56] <Quinn> I've never known that :c
[05:07:58] <Quinn> it hurts
[05:08:24] <Drago> Aww
[05:08:48] <Quinn> my husband was cut but not very tight so he didn't need lube either
[05:09:22] <Quinn> this guy's dick is flipping massive and uncircumcised, it's kinda crazy but awesome 
[05:09:27] <preeb> but what is your opinion about the look of foreskin? some seem to find it ugly
[05:09:46] <Quinn> when it's flaccid it looks like a little hoodie :3
[05:09:53] <Drago> I like both "looks"
[05:10:17] <Quinn> ^
[05:10:19] <Drago> A circumsized cock does look pretty glorious.
[05:10:31] <Quinn> but I like playing with an uncircumcised one more 
[05:10:57] <Drago> But ofc foreskin is much more functional and a little something extra to have fun with :P
[05:11:16] <Drago> mannnn

[22:41:26] <cloppyhooves> The thick, whitish fur to keep him safe in the snow

[22:52:13] <Vulpixbrew> I love the fact that if you buy something from welovefine at a con they give you a gaint freaking bag
[22:52:39] <Flame> I've been wondering if there are any free social sex online things like Playstation home...in concept that is.
[22:53:55] <Vulpixbrew> weisey that was horrible
[22:54:09] <cloppyhooves> Flame, Second Life
[22:54:16] <Flame> ...really?
[22:54:19] <Flame> has sexy things?
[22:54:25] <cloppyhooves> Absolutely yes
[22:54:27] <cloppyhooves> Also, Vulpixbrew the bag is way too big to be convenient D:
[22:54:33] <cloppyhooves> Like it hlepd one time when I had gotten too much
[22:54:50] <cloppyhooves> But it's like twice as big as a normal reusable bag so I wouldn't use it unless I had to carry an absurd amount
[22:54:58] <cloppyhooves> It looks nice, though c:
[22:55:57] <Flame> huh...I've been thinking of trying that out.
[22:56:06] <Flame> any experience with it, cloppy?
[22:56:10] <Vulpixbrew> it is a decent bag I just dont see myself using it
[22:57:19] <Vulpixbrew> aye last time i installed second life.....

[22:59:35] <weisey> Second Life has literally everything 
[22:59:58] <weisey> There was a 20/20 episode about it
[23:00:24] <cloppyhooves> No actual experience
[23:00:33] <cloppyhooves> But there's lots of user-created content
[23:00:38] <cloppyhooves> Including a lot of sexual things
[23:00:40] <weisey> (Most specifically the underage and hardcore bdsm mods, which is lolworthy)
[23:00:47] <cloppyhooves> Both character models and animations
[23:00:58] <Melon_Phone> more like loliworthy 
[23:01:02] <weisey> Pretty much the entire game is user generated
[23:01:12] <Vulpixbrew> yeah
[23:01:27] <Vulpixbrew> was better then IMVU at least
[23:01:32] <Vulpixbrew> (and thats not saing much)
[23:02:58] <weisey> Lol imvu
[23:03:19] <Flame> weisey: is it worth trying out? Not for anything serious, just fun.
[23:06:05] <weisey> I have no idea
[23:06:09] <weisey> I never played it
[23:06:19] <Flame> ahh...
[23:06:44] <weisey> I was too busy playing leauge CS1.6/Source when I was 12
[23:07:28] <cloppyhooves> I almost tried second life when I was 13 but then I didn't
[23:07:36] <iamalion> WTF why is everyone talking about imvu today
[23:07:45] <iamalion> that is literally 3 completely separate groups of friends
[23:07:53] <iamalion> that have been talking about imvu out of the blue today in the last 4 hours
[23:08:04] <Melon_Phone> the future is here
[23:08:04] <weisey> Though admittedly, there are some pretty good yiff animations done with it
[23:08:29] <weisey> iamalion *inception horn*
[23:08:38] <iamalion> !!
[23:08:54] <Vulpixbrew> I tired it once but didnt have the computer to handle it, (second life)
[23:09:30] <Vulpixbrew> have some luna but http://41.media.tumblr.com/163661a552a69a4e31984f27145329bc/tumblr_nhu9e9g7IR1ttri0jo6_r1_1280.png
[23:09:36] <Melon_Phone> man hardly knew English when I was 12/13 
[23:10:00] <iamalion> i used to hang out on newworldgrid
[23:10:09] <iamalion> which was a clone of secondlife where you could run your own servers
[23:10:44] <iamalion> looks like they dont do that anymore
[23:10:45] <iamalion> sad
[23:12:02] <cloppyhooves> I used IMVU once
[23:12:17] <cloppyhooves> I saw they had furry things but then they cost money and my friends stopped using it so I stopped
[23:12:27] <iamalion> i just remember the obnox ads
[23:14:12] <princesssluttershy> My dad's girlfriend was just showing me how easy it is to import pictures onto a mac and she wanted to use my phone as an example
[23:14:13] <Vulpixbrew> I got talked into IMVU once
[23:14:42] <princesssluttershy> I thought I just had a few pictures of mountains for the firs little bit but there was a bunch of yiff D:
[23:15:15] <Melon_Phone> yikes
[23:15:36] <Vulpixbrew> ooo dang princesssluttershy
[23:15:41] <weisey> Lolol
[23:16:41] <iamalion> ohhh lmao so eh
[23:16:43] <iamalion> whta happened
[23:16:52] <iamalion> my gallery is fine to go through on my phone
[23:16:55] <iamalion> but no touching a file browser
[23:16:56] <iamalion> ¬.¬
[23:17:22] <weisey> See my gallery just finds all the pictures 
[23:17:30] <weisey> I can't specifically exclude files
[23:17:41] <weisey> Or rather 
[23:17:46] <weisey> There's no whitelist
[23:17:54] <weisey> Or blacklist 
[23:17:59] <weisey> Which is annoying as fuck
[23:18:00] <iamalion> use quickpic and get rid of the stock photos app
[23:18:01] <Melon_Phone> I just don't have porn on my mobile device
[23:18:07] <iamalion> quickpic can hide or exclude
[23:18:14] <iamalion> exclude puts a .nomedia into the folder
[23:18:17] <iamalion> so no other apps will see it
[23:18:27] <princesssluttershy> I have borderline porn for both of my backgrounds on my phone
[23:18:36] <iamalion> my phone has sooooooo much porn
[23:18:44] <princesssluttershy> I don't care if my friends see it
[23:18:50] <princesssluttershy> I just don't want my parents to see it
[23:18:50] <iamalion> and a shortcut on the file browser that opens my porn drives from my pc over hte network
[23:18:54] <Vulpixbrew> I have tomany bags
[23:18:57] <iamalion> because you can neverh ave enough
[23:19:03] <weisey> iamalion: can't, its part of aosp
[23:20:41] <iamalion> are you rooted? just disable it
[23:22:22] <weisey> OH MY GOD I NEVER KNEW ABOUT THE .NOMEDIA TRICK

[23:35:15] <Vulpixbrew> Lydia might useful then
