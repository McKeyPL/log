[04:27:07] <MegaAbsol> Could I please have some harassment assistance. 
[04:28:44] <AppleDash> Put them on ignore./
[04:28:51] <MegaAbsol> I did.
[04:29:00] <MegaAbsol> They continued to talk bad about me in channel.
[04:29:45] <wolfyshy> have you tried the channel ops?
[04:29:50] <AppleDash> Perhaps it would be a good idea to speak to the channel ops/owner?
[04:30:10] <Fluttershi> Fire?
[04:30:15] <MegaAbsol> Yup.
[04:30:24] <MegaAbsol> Fluttershi is right. 
[04:30:34] <AppleDash> ?
[04:30:40] <MegaAbsol> It's a 18+ room they don't especially care.
[04:31:02] <MegaAbsol> But the user called me a slut on multiple occasions.
[04:31:09] <AppleDash> Like I said, put them on ignore, who cares what they say? They'll get tired of it eventually.
[04:31:26] <MegaAbsol> I put them on ignore, as I said.
[04:31:30] <Fluttershi> did you tell him you no likey, ask for stop or w/e?
[04:31:45] <AppleDash> So then what is the issue?
[04:31:52] <MegaAbsol> I told Orca to.
[04:32:12] <AppleDash> You have put them on ignore, now move on with your day
[04:32:26] <MegaAbsol> O.o
[04:32:31] <wolfyshy> rise above it
[04:32:41] <wolfyshy> don't let it affect you or get under your skin
[04:33:27] <MegaAbsol> Kinda hard when they insulted you to the entire chatroom.
[04:33:57] <AppleDash> Not really...
[04:33:57] <Dusk> MegaAbsol: This is the network help channel, not really the channel help channel. If they were attacking you outside the channel or something or something outside network rules then maybe there's something else that could be done, but if it's in the channel and the ops don't care there's nothing to be done.
[04:34:23] <Dusk> something covered in the network rules* sorry brain derp
[04:34:36] <MegaAbsol> Okay, thank you for better explaining it for me.
[04:34:44] <MegaAbsol> Have a good day.

[07:51:35] <Dusk> Uh...I know of way on other networks but I don't know if serverside ignores work here (and I don't have my test network set up yet to figure that out
[07:52:12] *** Q0 is now known as Q0|Away
[07:52:22] <Fluttershi> serverside... uh... /silence, was it?
[07:52:34] <Dusk> Fluttershi: You can set mode +g on yourself and approve people to message you 
[07:52:52] <Dusk> but that only works for not allowing people to PM you
[07:53:47] <Colgate> server side ignores are only by hostname
[07:54:44] <Colgate> for queries, yeah, you can use a combination of +g, +c, or +R to restrict who can message you directly
[07:55:33] <Colgate> +c(must share a channel wtih you), +g(you must specifically allow people), and +R(only those registered to nickserv can)

[07:58:20] <Fluttershi> hostname, what's that again? hostmask or vhost? the thing before the @? account name?
[07:58:53] <Dusk> @your.host.here
[07:59:25] <Dusk> so yea it'll be their hostmask or host
[07:59:30] <Dusk> vhost*
[07:59:30] <Colgate> it works off of the full n!u@h
[07:59:42] <Dusk> oh the enitre bit?
[07:59:45] <Dusk> :s
[07:59:48] <Colgate> so, you would usually want *!*@stuff
[08:02:04] <Fluttershi> so that'd be... /silence *!*@stuffoverhere?
[08:02:34] <Fluttershi> or still /ignore or...?
[08:04:04] <Colgate> /silence +*!*@stuff a
[08:04:09] <Colgate> is probably what you want
[08:04:19] <Colgate> /ignore is aliased server side to /silence
[08:04:36] <Colgate> so both work, if your client doesn't have its own built in ignore/silence feature(quite a few do)
[08:05:36] <Fluttershi> ah, alrighty, thanks, i vaguely recall something about this and them being lost after reconnects to the server or something?
[08:05:47] <Colgate> yes, it has to redone on every connect
[08:06:14] <Fluttershi> righto, thanks
[08:07:32] <Colgate> the "a" is important as well, that means ignore all messages
[08:07:52] <Colgate> there's a bunch of different ones that you can use if you want to only block certain types
[08:07:57] <Colgate> /helpop silence, for the list
[08:15:17] <Fluttershi> hm, i see, interesting
[08:15:52] <Fluttershi> what all does helpop do?
[08:16:08] <Colgate> it is the ircd's help command
[08:16:21] <Colgate> since a lot of clients have their own /help command
[08:17:08] <Fluttershi> that's different from /command help?
[08:18:02] <Colgate> probably not
