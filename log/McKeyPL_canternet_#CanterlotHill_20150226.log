[20:31:31] <StrykerVylon> This is a yes.
[20:31:32] <LunaticHell> Nelly: It originates from the show "Happy Days" when a character literally jumped a shark in an episode and the series went bad from that point onward.
[20:31:37] <FruitNibbler> There was one specific show series on TV where the protagonist jumps a shark with a jetski in one episode, after which the series becomes trashy, hence why it became a proverbial saying
