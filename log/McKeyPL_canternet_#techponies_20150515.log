[03:09:45] <JustAberrant> silly question, I wonder how wise it would be to have a bunch of servers near a workshop area (table saw being my big concern)
[03:11:22] <Webster> Define "near".
[03:11:43] <JustAberrant> I reckon like.. 5 or 6 meters
[03:11:58] <JustAberrant> err.. maybe as little as 3
[03:12:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> how many servers and whats the ventilation like
[03:12:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> servers really need to be kept properly cooled/proper venting
[03:12:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> you dont want dust buildup near servers
[03:12:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> or you will be cleaning out their fans/intaks every week or so
[03:13:11] <JustAberrant> I'd close the area off for sure
[03:13:29] <Webster> If it's in the same room I'd say unwise.
[03:13:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> will they have cooling/controled airflow
[03:13:37] <JustAberrant> ventilation would probably be basic airflow.. maybe an exaust fan 
[03:13:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> how many just 1?
[03:14:03] <ShivalPonyWolf> what do you call a bunch
[03:14:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> a rack full?
[03:14:38] <JustAberrant> not a densly packed rack of servers or anything..  a file server, maybe 3 other boxes, some networking equiptment..
[03:14:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> also if your using somethign like power tools with spinning motors
[03:14:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> you needt o make sure its on a speraete circuit
[03:14:55] <JustAberrant> yeah
[03:15:03] *** Joins: WestJ (westjgames@DJWestJ.Fillydelphia.Radio)
[03:15:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> servers are not a fan of suges that come from that type of stuff
[03:15:18] <JustAberrant> that would be a given, but I was still a bit concerned about EMI.. especially from the table saw
[03:15:25] <WestJ> Wassup, guys
[03:15:26] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah
[03:15:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> with airflow make sure thee is a filter
[03:15:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> you dont want dust particles being sucked in to the area
[03:15:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> sperate power circuit
[03:16:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> output fan not really that criticle if its a positive pressure going in
[03:16:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> dont need a fan sucking out
[03:16:23] <WestJ> Talking about cooling servers?
[03:16:30] <JustAberrant> (this is obviously not work related.. looking at having a small server closet in a basement where I also plan to have a workshop area)
[03:16:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> given lack of controlled cooling you will want to make thigns are sperated
[03:17:07] <WestJ> If you want to take hints from someone, look at YouTube videos of the Bitcoin Mining Farms in China
[03:17:26] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: d you have a proper rack?
[03:17:27] <WestJ> Cooling in those places is fucking obscene
[03:17:37] <JustAberrant> ShivalPonyWolf: I will
[03:17:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> then you should eb ok with cooling just make sursre you have the vent fans in the top
[03:17:54] <JustAberrant> right now I have an.. improper rack
[03:18:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> and put a layer of dust collecting mesh in the top and sides
[03:18:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> yous houdl be fine then for small use
[03:18:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> if you care about the uptime
[03:18:27] <JustAberrant> my concern heat wise was more the temperature in the room itself gradually building if it's closed in
[03:18:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> get a proper UPS that does in line filtering
[03:18:37] <JustAberrant> have that ;p
[03:18:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> good
[03:18:48] <JustAberrant> though I want to upgrade to a larger capacity online UPS
[03:18:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> you really want a good incoming fanwith filtering
[03:19:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> if you arnt goign aircon
[03:19:10] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Pony-osmcfg.co.comcast.net)
[03:19:12] <JustAberrant> the server gear has run happily at room temperature for years.. so not too concerned about the machiens themselves
[03:19:18] <JustAberrant> but that's been in open space
[03:19:22] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah
[03:19:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> i would suggest a suck in and blow out fan setup then
[03:19:39] *** locodashie11 is now known as Pony_24197
[03:19:40] <JustAberrant> and yeah, it's got front filters/etc
[03:19:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> just keep the air moving around the equipmnet
[03:19:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> as long as its moving it should be ok
[03:20:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> send exhaust air outside if you can
[03:20:34] *** Pony_24197 is now known as locodashie11
[03:20:37] <JustAberrant> that's basically what I was thinking.. a fan blowing air from inside the house into the room, and an exhaust fan to move it outside the room
[03:20:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> that should work
[03:21:10] <WestJ> Home server setup? What's it being used for?
[03:21:33] <JustAberrant> it's my basic file server/other stuff setup I've got now.. just moving it
[03:21:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: if you have the cash probably worth minimising the amount of servers and virtualising everything you can
[03:21:52] <WestJ> ^
[03:21:52] *** Daze is now known as Halcyon_Starlight
[03:22:01] <WestJ> Or downsizing your machines.
[03:22:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> old servers are crappy power hogs
[03:22:10] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/computer/setup.png  <-- basically all this crap ;p
[03:22:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> and sensative
[03:22:29] <WestJ> Hell, setup for redundancy, have it scale over to other machines if needed. But that's overkill
[03:22:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> that needs the matrix screensaver
[03:22:48] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:22:56] * AppleDash applies ponies to JustAberrant
[03:23:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: clean up your cables to
[03:23:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> its shockng how much they affect airflow
[03:23:22] <JustAberrant> hehe, yeah
[03:23:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> its sad how much i remember from working in a DC
[03:23:35] * AppleDash has given up on organizing his cables whatsoever
[03:23:39] <WestJ> Mah Gahd
[03:23:46] <JustAberrant> now that I've actually got space to have a proper setup where I can actually get around behind stuff and such
[03:23:56] <AppleDash> JustAberrant, did you buy a house?
[03:23:56] <JustAberrant> I'm really wanting to get a decent setup going
[03:23:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: cable ties and patch pannels are your friend
[03:23:59] <WestJ> Is that.... is that KDE?
[03:24:04] <JustAberrant> rather than the whole mess of stuff I've got now
[03:24:08] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: aye
[03:24:13] <AppleDash> Nice :D
[03:24:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> i wish i could buy a house
[03:24:28] <JustAberrant> WestJ: nah, openbox+xfce4
[03:24:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> gathering the deposit is killing me
[03:24:34] <WestJ> Ah
[03:24:46] <WestJ> Was gonna frown a lot otherwise
[03:24:53] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: well, it's not mine yet.. but soon
[03:25:00] <AppleDash> Yay
[03:25:04] <WestJ> KDE is a nasty POS that likes to destroy RAM
[03:25:09] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: theres 2 things i care about when i buy a house
[03:25:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> a great kitchen
[03:25:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> and a server room
[03:25:16] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:25:26] <WestJ> More importantly should be clean power lines
[03:25:35] <JustAberrant> when I actually move in I'll take lots of pics.. but I really love this place
[03:25:35] <WestJ> Otherwise you gotta buy power conditioners and shit
[03:25:45] <JustAberrant> I decided literally on the spot that I was going to buy it
[03:25:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> nice
[03:26:01] <JustAberrant> (came back for a second viewing/etc.. but yeah.. I knew that day)
[03:26:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> how much was it (if you want to share)
[03:26:07] <WestJ> Power here is shit, so I run mainly laptops and embedded shit
[03:26:21] <JustAberrant> $244,800
[03:26:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> not bad
[03:26:27] <JustAberrant> yeah
[03:26:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> how big?
[03:26:40] <JustAberrant> 1500 square feet inside
[03:26:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> how many rooms i was more thinking
[03:27:03] <WestJ> As an Australian, I can't tell if big or not big...
[03:27:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol yeah 
[03:27:11] <AppleDash> Pretty normal
[03:27:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> that
[03:27:22] <JustAberrant> has a garage, and a nice partially unfinished basement (which is the area I'm talking about) ;p
[03:27:32] <JustAberrant> 3 bedroom, 2 bath
[03:27:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> i wish housing prices here would drop
[03:27:37] <AppleDash> I'd like to move somewhere with a basement
[03:27:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: nice
[03:27:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats what iw as guessing
[03:27:41] <JustAberrant> decent sized kitchen
[03:27:43] <AppleDash> If only to avoid so much heat in th esummer
[03:27:44] <WestJ> Partially unfinished? Look out for dust!
[03:28:04] <JustAberrant> only 15 years old.. really well built
[03:28:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> id be looking at atleast 550 minimum for soemthign liek that in my area
[03:28:17] <ShivalPonyWolf> the house down the street sold for 1.2m
[03:28:19] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:28:51] <JustAberrant> yeah, the area I bought is a little out of the way, but still on municipal water/sewer and still with access to fibre internet
[03:29:03] <WestJ> My area is pretty bad. It's a stone's throw away from the poor area, et this house I'm renting will go under the hammer soon, estimated over AU$700K
[03:29:04] <JustAberrant> but you get a lot more house for that money than you would in the city
[03:29:16] <JustAberrant> in the city, it's exactly that.. $500k for something the same size
[03:29:17] <WestJ> Which is like US$650
[03:29:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> WestJ: what state?
[03:29:39] <WestJ> For a fucking 3 bedroom
[03:29:46] <WestJ> Uh, Victoria, Australia
[03:29:49] <JustAberrant> that's crazy
[03:30:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats low for vic
[03:30:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[03:30:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> housing prices are getting shocking
[03:30:20] <ShivalPonyWolf> i pay 2200$ a month in rent for a 3 bedroom
[03:30:23] <WestJ> We're in Maribyrnong. The dead bodies lower the price, I assume
[03:30:31] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:30:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[03:30:43] <JustAberrant> also here in Canada mortgage rates are at a ridiculous low
[03:30:55] <JustAberrant> I've got a 5 year fixed term for 2.59%
[03:30:58] <WestJ> I shit you not, the week we moved in, arm found floating just down the river
[03:31:04] <WestJ> Police and shit everywhere
[03:31:28] <ShivalPonyWolf> ahhh west side
[03:31:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah prices that side are lower
[03:31:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> too close to stabscray
[03:31:42] <WestJ> Indeed
[03:31:55] <WestJ> he aforementioned"Poor area"
[03:32:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> but their prices are low
[03:32:03] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[03:32:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> friend got a 4 bedroom brand new place for 360k
[03:32:18] <WestJ> It's funny, though
[03:32:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> but its in footsscray
[03:32:21] <ShivalPonyWolf> so its not great
[03:32:27] <WestJ> Photographer for Real Estate took photos
[03:32:41] <WestJ> Forgot to photoshop out the dick drawn on our fridge
[03:32:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> LOL
[03:32:48] <WestJ> It's all over the advertising
[03:32:50] <AppleDash> lol
[03:32:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> nice
[03:33:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> it adds chracter to the area lol
[03:33:22] <WestJ> THere's five of us in the house
[03:33:35] <WestJ> I'm in the detached Garage
[03:33:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> ouch
[03:33:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> cold
[03:34:01] <WestJ> Had to string fiber along the grapevines to get good net to me
[03:34:09] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[03:34:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> the main network cat6 cable for my place runs out my bedroom window aroudn the outside of the house and into the garrarge
[03:34:29] <WestJ> We got three ISPs to handle all ouor traffic
[03:34:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> couldnt go under the door that links the house to the gararge
[03:34:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> wernt allowed to cut a gap under the door
[03:34:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> so out the window and around it was
[03:35:03] <WestJ> Get yourself a pair of Mikrotik routers with Fiber ports. So much better
[03:35:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol theres 3 people here and we use 2 isps
[03:35:22] <ShivalPonyWolf> but 1 is dedicated to me for work use
[03:35:37] <WestJ> We have 100MBit Cable with one ISP, 100MBit with another, and a shitty 5MBit ADSL connection
[03:35:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> i get about 120mbit though my cable its good
[03:35:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> but its work provided
[03:36:03] <ShivalPonyWolf> so i cant do anything dodgy on it
[03:36:06] <WestJ> All previous contracts we had before congregating
[03:36:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> its nice not having to pay the cable bill though lol
[03:36:55] <WestJ> Although, thanks to Tony Abbott and the Telstra Fucksticks, we only get 2MBit out on each line max.
[03:37:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> its really only abbots fault that one
[03:37:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> and his stupid cut down NBN
[03:37:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> to 'save money'
[03:37:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> and now its goign to cost like 3x the price
[03:37:55] <WestJ> Abbott tried to DDOS China.
[03:37:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> yay for selecting to use already failing and obsolete infsutrcture to save money in the short run
[03:38:06] <WestJ> Failed, cos he didn't have enough books to throw

[03:41:10] <WestJ> Tony Abbott still writes to his mom. He puts it in an envelope and sends it via post.
[03:41:36] <WestJ> Seriously though, I heard the communications minister has never used a computer before.
[03:41:49] <WestJ> And reckons Australia doesn't need computers
[03:42:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> he origionaly claimined that the internet was not part of the communications portfolio

[03:56:02] <WestJ> Yes, yes it does
[03:56:03] <AppleDash> Yes JustAberrant
[03:56:03] <AppleDash> the desk
[03:56:04] <JustAberrant> finally we see a glimpse of it ;p
[03:56:09] <AppleDash> Mhm :P
[03:56:21] <CompuDesktop> AppleDash: u know theres an easy way to block the ads on skype there right?
[03:56:21] <JustAberrant> not bad seriously
[03:56:28] <AppleDash> CompuDesktop: Don't care
[03:56:31] <CompuDesktop> :/
[03:56:50] <Phase> dummy out apps.skype.com via c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
[03:57:02] <WestJ> CompuDesktop: add Skype credit. I got $4 left and no ads for the last 3 years.
[03:57:05] <Phase> also windows has an /etc/hosts
[03:57:14] <AppleDash> Also, I finally replaced my mouse with something better :P
[03:57:17] <ShivalPonyWolf> dont use skype problem solved
[03:57:18] <CompuDesktop> WestJ: that costs money -_-
[03:57:18] <AppleDash> Since that image
[03:57:43] <AppleDash> I don't use that machine for Skype anymore because I got another spare GPU for my desktop finally
[03:57:47] <JustAberrant> that path says everything you need to know about the windows file system ;p
[03:57:48] <AppleDash> Linux Skype has no ads
[03:58:57] <AppleDash> Also, thanks JustAberrant, I think I didn't do too terribly

[04:02:16] <AppleDash> Also yeah I love that path

[04:38:13] <cyborg_ar> Phase: HAHAHAH
[04:38:16] <cyborg_ar> no
[04:38:52] <Phase> cyborg_ar, unixish filesystem layout specifically
[04:39:05] <cyborg_ar> unix has some decades of baggage everywhere, sweeping changes do happen on linux but they tend to make people unhappy
[04:39:14] <Phase> i'm sure there's crap elsewhere
[04:39:17] <cyborg_ar> like making /usr a required boot mountpoint
[04:39:28] <Phase> cyborg_ar, programs are tolerant, the people less so
[04:39:34] <WestJ> ^
[04:39:43] <WestJ> As clearly demonstrated here
[04:39:56] <cyborg_ar> people usually complain because their programs dont work like they used to
[04:40:02] <Phase> i mean posix locks are still around, and still just as unusable
[04:40:41] <cyborg_ar> some old programs expect /dev/dsp to be present and operative to work, in some distros they wont work properly
[04:41:02] <cyborg_ar> some newer programs designed for other unices too
[04:41:06] <Phase> while that's true, alsa and pulse both have ways to emulate it
[04:41:13] <Phase> cross unix compatibility is a problem yeah
[04:41:33] *** SableFeline is now known as Halcyon_Starlight
[04:41:57] <cyborg_ar> also there were several shitstorms while freedesktop were making up their minds on where to shove the program configurations and caches
[04:42:18] <cyborg_ar> so if you have mixes of old and new softwares they will put a lot of disjointed crap in your ~
[04:42:53] <cyborg_ar> specially if you have both gtk programs and kde 3.5
[04:43:01] <Phase> that's a problem for everyone though
[04:43:05] <Phase> windows and linux alike
[04:43:27] <cyborg_ar> i'm just commenting that linux doesnt have less problems than windows in that front
[04:43:43] <cyborg_ar> one would argue there are even more issues of that kind
[04:44:25] <cyborg_ar> specially if you start counting from 2005
[04:44:54] <Phase> cyborg_ar, and by filesystem i mean /, /usr, /var, and so on, plus the tools (hardlinks, symlinks) for handling change have been ther (win 7 uses symlinks for C:\documents and settings)
[04:45:47] <Phase> and linux has had no real convention for where to store user data, windows has (%APPDATA% and friends), but program writers often don't care and dump data whever they please
[04:46:21] <cyborg_ar> freedesktop does
[04:46:24] <cyborg_ar> and it's fairly nice
[04:46:52] <Phase> windows has had it for longer, probably before freedesktop did
[04:47:06] <Phase> freedesktop is early 2000s iirc, could be wrong
[04:47:11] <cyborg_ar> yeah
[04:47:20] <Phase> before freedesktop existed'

[22:48:07] <Lapsus> Antenna! http://i.imgur.com/3ZBD4m0.jpg
[22:51:26] <DataByteBrony> that looks dangerously like a poorly-grounded lightning rod xD
[22:53:29] <Lapsus> You're a poorly grounded lightning rod

[22:53:31] <Lapsus> :3
[22:53:49] <DataByteBrony> no, mama, don't ground me!
[22:53:55] <Lapsus> it's pretty damn unlikely to get hit, and if it does, I've got larger problems
[22:54:47] <DataByteBrony> ham radio antenna?
[22:55:56] <Lapsus> yes! :v
[22:56:00] <Lapsus> It's a j-pole
[22:57:11] <DataByteBrony> looks that your post is well-sealed at the roof.. but myself, i'd want it at least painted
[22:57:21] <DataByteBrony> then the creepage can't work into the attic
[22:57:52] <DataByteBrony> also, i'm pretty sure antennas work better grounded, but don't quote me on that
[23:00:00] <Lapsus> That pole used to hold the railing up, it's on the top front porch, so any leakage just goes onto the bottom porch anyways
[23:00:35] <Lapsus> I'll have to look it up, but I was under the impression that the shorter bit was acting as a ground for the larger bit
[23:00:48] <Lapsus> not that I have a licence to transmit anyways, it's just on a scanner

[23:22:44] <AppleDash> Lapsus: pfft, who needs licenses
[23:24:12] <AppleDash> I wish I lived in a house so I could actually have a valid roof
[23:25:33] <Lapsus> People who want to talk to other people instead of just being the subject of the next fox hunt
[23:25:47] <AppleDash> lol
[23:25:49] <Shutter> AppleDash confirmed to live in a cardboard box in the street
[23:25:56] <AppleDash> Yes Shutter :P
[23:26:29] <AppleDash> I have only a balcony... Even with optimal antenna placement, the antenna can really only see out on one side
[23:26:44] <AppleDash> Every other side is shielded by large amounts of concrete
[23:27:20] * AppleDash does the thing again where he looks at houses his size in his area and realizes "wow I can't afford that"
