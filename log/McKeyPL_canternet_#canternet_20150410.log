[22:06:50] <Noone> I'd like to speak with one of the administrators of that channel, but I have no way of contacting them, or knowing who they are.
[22:06:54] <Seoson> (I'm in the channel, not a staff member)
[22:07:10] <Noone> Can you give me the name of one of the active ops so that I may message them?
[22:07:17] <Seoson> I will PM one for you giving your name
[22:07:23] <Noone> Thank you
[22:18:51] <Seoson> I've forwarded your inquiry. I've no idea if or when they are going to reply. 
[22:20:49] <Noone> Were any of them paying attention?
[22:22:34] <Seoson> I've got a reply to my message - yes
