[04:35:23] <Nikashi> Capra Demon PWNED MY FACE
[04:35:25] <OmarianVolcae> Hi Nikashi.
[04:35:26] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah
[04:35:32] <OmarianVolcae> Capra tends to do that.
[04:35:37] <Squirrelly> Meh
[04:35:37] <Nikashi> I might try to break out the fat roll
[04:35:41] <Squirrelly> Capra's easy
[04:35:42] <Nikashi> I get him to 5% most fights at least
[04:35:50] <Nikashi> Not easy if you don't have a good shield
[04:35:59] <OmarianVolcae> Capra's nowhere close to easy the first time you do him.
[04:36:05] <Nikashi> his huge attack takes off 40% HP
[04:36:07] <Nikashi> WHILE blocking
[04:36:21] <Nikashi> It's mostly I can never avoid the first one
[04:36:24] <Nikashi> but working on that
[04:36:25] <OmarianVolcae> Honestly, tanking in Dark Souls is kinda silly.
[04:36:32] <OmarianVolcae> I always dodge before blocking.
[04:36:49] <Nikashi> I usually do  but he instantly does that attack when you go through the mist
[04:37:03] <Nikashi> so it's really really ahrd to dodge since it ALSO tracks
[04:37:03] <OmarianVolcae> You need to roll under it and between the dogs
[04:37:13] <OmarianVolcae> Run up the stairs.
[04:37:17] <Nikashi> that's the issue
[04:37:22] <OmarianVolcae> Fatroll
[04:37:22] <Nikashi> I can't roll past/run past that first hit
[04:37:26] <Nikashi> I've tried a billion times lol
[04:37:26] <OmarianVolcae> Fatroll is basically suicide.
[04:37:34] <OmarianVolcae> Just start playing naked.
[04:37:38] <Nikashi> Yeah I can't do a non fatroll
[04:37:39] <OmarianVolcae> Or go get Havels ring.
[04:37:40] <Nikashi> :|
[04:37:44] <Nikashi> I just need to get more endurance
[04:37:50] <Nikashi> or maybe some um...
[04:37:52] <Nikashi> fire stuff
[04:37:56] <OmarianVolcae> Play naked, two handing whatever weapon you like.
[04:37:57] <Nikashi> whatever it's called
[04:37:59] <Nikashi> Charcoal resin?
[04:38:04] <OmarianVolcae> Charcoal pine resin.
[04:38:05] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah.
[04:38:08] <Nikashi> Because I get Capra to 5% normally
[04:38:13] <Nikashi> that stands to reason with resin
[04:38:15] <Nikashi> I'd do it for sure
[04:38:35] <Nikashi> regardless, he's giving me less trouble than Twin Gargoyles were
[04:38:52] <Nikashi> I feel like I CAN beat him I just haven't yet
[04:39:04] <OmarianVolcae> Capra is one of those asshole bosses that turns into a wall for some people.
[04:39:15] <OmarianVolcae> He's kinda gimmicky since his arena is so small.
[04:40:23] <Nikashi> to be honest that's the ONLY reason he's hard
[04:40:28] <Nikashi> the lack of movement/dodge space
[04:40:32] <Nikashi> and the camrea being a dick
[04:42:04] <OmarianVolcae> Y'know how there's an archway in the back of his arena?
[04:42:20] <OmarianVolcae> If you run up on top of it, he will try to hit you, and fall down into the bottom.
[04:42:25] <OmarianVolcae> Then you can plunging attack him.
[04:42:51] <Nikashi> sometmies he can still do that fucking jump attack and hit you though
[04:43:01] <Nikashi> But again I'm SO close to beating him
[04:43:04] <OmarianVolcae> What shield are you blocking with?
[04:43:09] <Nikashi> like even 1 more point of endurance
[04:43:23] <Nikashi> would probably top up the stamina to block that first hit
[04:43:25] <Nikashi> um... 
[04:43:32] <Nikashi> the Warrior basic one still, haevn't found one with a better rating
[04:43:39] <Nikashi> I will upgrade it I guess
[04:43:48] <OmarianVolcae> Meh, not really worth upgrading armor.
[04:43:50] <OmarianVolcae> Most of the time.
[04:43:59] <Nikashi> well then yeah
[04:44:01] <OmarianVolcae> Just pick a shield with 100% block
[04:44:03] <Nikashi> I'll just upgrade endurance 
[04:44:04] <Nikashi> it does
[04:44:07] <OmarianVolcae> Okay
[04:44:11] <Nikashi> but my endurance is a little low
[04:44:14] <OmarianVolcae> I don't know why you're taking damage when you block.
[04:44:17] <Nikashi> so he still fucks the entire stamina bar
[04:44:19] <Nikashi> with that FIRST attack
[04:44:20] <OmarianVolcae> Oh.
[04:44:21] <OmarianVolcae> Okay.
[04:44:23] <Nikashi> the  one that knocks you down entirely
[04:44:30] <Nikashi> every other attack I can easily block and coutner
[04:44:37] <Nikashi> but the jumping one TRACKS
[04:44:49] <OmarianVolcae> Fatrolling is your issue.
[04:44:53] <Nikashi> I never do that
[04:44:58] <Nikashi> becaues I heard it's suicide :p
[04:45:00] <OmarianVolcae> Like seriously. Fatroll is suicide.
[04:45:03] <Nikashi> I  try to run aruond him to the right
[04:45:06] <Nikashi> then left up the stairs
[04:45:07] *** Quits: samonuh (Mibbit@Pony-3v42to.NATPOOL.NYU.EDU) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[04:45:20] <Nikashi> because if you go left RIGHT to the stairs
[04:45:22] <Nikashi> he just pwns you
[04:45:35] <OmarianVolcae> Not if you can lightroll.
[04:45:47] <OmarianVolcae> You can literally roll straight past him and the dogs.
[04:45:51] <OmarianVolcae> Because they all charge you.
[04:46:03] <Nikashi> I'd haev to change the build for that one boss that I've already almost beaten hhe
[04:46:04] <Nikashi> heeh
[04:46:09] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[04:46:11] <Nikashi> like seriously 5% lol
[04:46:16] <Nikashi> youv'e seen the videos I'm sure
[04:46:19] <OmarianVolcae> You're going to have way worse issues if you don't get used to rolling.
[04:46:23] <OmarianVolcae> Later
[04:46:27] <OmarianVolcae> With harder bosses.
[04:46:28] <Nikashi> well not every cahracter CAN roll
[04:46:39] <Nikashi> or I can just pump up my stats
[04:46:39] <OmarianVolcae> What armor are you using?
[04:46:40] <Nikashi> so I can light roll
[04:46:51] <Nikashi> um.... fuck sorry I don't memorize anything ><
[04:47:07] <Nikashi> I have so much extra rrmor though
[04:47:10] <Nikashi> becaues you can't SELL ANYTHING YET
[04:47:14] <Nikashi> so maybe I can experient
[04:47:17] <Nikashi> experiment*
[04:47:28] <OmarianVolcae> If you go get Havel's ring, and kill Lautrec for the ring of FAP, you'll be well off.
[04:47:45] <OmarianVolcae> You'll probably be able to do a decent roll with any medium armor.
[04:49:32] <Nikashi> Laurtrec?

[04:49:37] <Nikashi> lautec

[04:52:05] <OmarianVolcae> Erm.
[04:52:17] <OmarianVolcae> Solaire =/= Lautrec
[04:52:22] <OmarianVolcae> They're about polar opposites.
[04:52:36] <Squirrelly> I know lol
[04:52:38] <Squirrelly> :P
[04:52:55] <Nikashi> I will never kill Solaire

[21:52:36] <Nikashi> lots of them are shaped like that because of multiple extra additions
[21:52:37] <Nikashi> over the years
[21:52:41] <Nikashi> it wasn't built like that I guarantee
[21:53:04] <Nikashi> look one block to the left
[21:53:11] <Nikashi> you can see what it probably originally looked like
[21:53:14] <iamalion> this whole area is depressing

[22:58:24] <Frosty> Why do they split that rank? What's the purpose?
[22:58:46] <OmarianVolcae> Just one more level of abstraction between the rank and file and the chain of command.
[22:58:55] <Vulpixbrew> OmarianVolcae Ranger tab looks damn good when it promotion time
[22:59:07] <Frosty> Is one technically better?
[22:59:11] <OmarianVolcae> Easier for the youngest soldiers to interact with Corporals as opposed to a sergeant.
[22:59:18] <OmarianVolcae> A Corporal is an NCO.
[22:59:23] <OmarianVolcae> A Specialist is not.
[22:59:26] <Frosty> Ah

[22:59:46] <OmarianVolcae> Fuckin' Sergeants mang...
[23:00:03] <Frosty> I know a Sergeant.
[23:00:12] <Frosty> She's pretty cool. Has pink hair.
[23:00:16] <Frosty> Kills stuff
[23:00:44] <OmarianVolcae> The florida phase is the part that scares me about Ranger School.
[23:00:48] <OmarianVolcae> That shit looks miserable.

[23:01:48] <FlameCleaning> bwuahahahahaha someone on CL is selling an Nvidia "e-Geforce 6200 LE PCI express graphics card" for 15$...citing "69$ on the pricetag!"
[23:01:48] <Frosty> Actually, one of the guys in my shop went to Ranger School
[23:02:06] <OmarianVolcae> Now, I alwasy thought it was one long FTX.
[23:02:17] <OmarianVolcae> But apparently the longest exercises are around 10 days.
[23:02:19] <OmarianVolcae> Which isn't so bad.
