[01:13:48] <AppleDash> That's actually pretty good
[01:14:16] <JustAberrant> thanks 
[01:14:24] * JustAberrant finally trying to learn how to art
[01:15:08] <JustAberrant> like, that turned out fuggly and it took like half a day (whereas petirep (left) does it in like 10 minutes, and that's clowing down to explain what he's doing)..
[01:15:21] <AppleDash> I know that video, I tried to look for it again one day but I could never find it
[01:15:24] <AppleDash> Can I have a link?
[01:15:37] <JustAberrant> but I went from barely being able to use this tablet to being somewhat comfortable with it.. so.. progress :>
[01:15:40] <JustAberrant> and sure, one sec
[01:15:44] <AppleDash> Also, way better than my first art

[01:16:13] <JustAberrant> err, whoops.. meant to break that up ;p
[01:16:14] <JustAberrant> but yeah
[01:16:16] <AppleDash> lol
[01:16:53] <JustAberrant> and a shitty bamboo tablet.. like the $50 one.. I bought it a few years ago and never really took a serious crack at it
[01:17:01] <JustAberrant> partially because I couldn't get it working well in linux
[01:17:15] <AppleDash> Ahh
[01:17:25] <AppleDash> Are you using USB passthrough?
[01:17:37] <JustAberrant> I _still_ can't, but I'm at a point in my life where running windows and photoshop in a vm doesn't actually make me want to remove my own tonsils in self disgust :>
[01:17:40] <JustAberrant> and yeah
[01:17:50] <JustAberrant> I basically blacklisted the tablet and assigned it to the vm
[01:17:57] <AppleDash> Neat
[01:18:00] <AppleDash> I might do that
[01:18:05] <JustAberrant> though I also had to disable pointer integration to make it work properly
[01:18:19] <JustAberrant> and yeah, seems to work ok
[01:18:34] <JustAberrant> except every once in awhile it'll hang for a second, but I think that's more to do with my setup
[01:18:37] <AppleDash> Because one of my main issues right now is not being able to use my tablet (intuos5 medium, think they renamed it to intuos pro) under Linux
[01:18:52] <JustAberrant> my VMs are actually stored on my file server.. would probably be much faster if I moved them to my local machine
[01:19:07] <AppleDash> Probably
[01:19:19] <JustAberrant> and yeah, I gave up on getting the tablet to work in linux
[01:19:21] * AppleDash moves JustAberrant to his local machine
[01:19:28] <JustAberrant> my multi monitor setup just screws up all the things
[01:19:59] <AppleDash> Sadly I can't do anything right now because my GPU exploded
[01:19:59] <JustAberrant> also that's a nice looking tablet at intuos5

[01:24:55] <AppleDash> I still have not finalized it :(
[01:25:32] <AppleDash> the desk top is in 2 pieces and one of the pieces sticks out like 3/4" more than the other
[01:25:40] <AppleDash> I need to plane it or something at some point
[01:25:59] <JustAberrant> mm, planing that would take forever unless you've got an electric plane

[01:28:10] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: if it was me I'd fence it up and cut it with a jigsaw or something, but whatever ;p
[01:28:13] * AppleDash planes 3/4" off of one edge of JustAberrant
[01:28:21] <AppleDash> I don't have access to a jigsaw currently
[01:28:32] <JustAberrant> also I don't think I've ever planed plywood.. I can only imagine how fun that would be
[01:28:40] <AppleDash> It would work
[01:28:45] <AppleDash> It would be weird but it'd work
[01:29:02] <JustAberrant> or just accept the overhang into your life
[01:29:13] <AppleDash> But it looks weird
[01:29:15] <JustAberrant> maybe put a doily over it or something
