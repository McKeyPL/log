[02:26:15] * Vulpixbrew is willing tio stick thing up OmarianVolcae's butt
[02:26:40] <ponder> If OmarianVolcae's is not available, I volunteer mine.
[02:27:10] * OmarianVolcae pulls his tail between his legs and straps it to his belly, forming a barrier of fur between his cheeks.
[02:27:11] <Cantaloupe> you could pull your whole colon out and blow in it
[02:27:21] <Cantaloupe> fill it with air and tie the end

[02:37:25] <Squirrelly> I really kinda wanna get that 55 gallon drum of lube
[02:37:40] <Squirrelly> Cuz I wanna fill a bathtub with it and just bathe in lube.
[02:37:42] <Squirrelly> Is that weird?
[02:38:09] <ponder> That is kinda weird, yes.
[02:38:12] <OmarianVolcae> Seems like it'd be needlessly messy alone.
[02:38:12] <ponder> But good weird.

[02:45:02] <Rylee> 19:37:40       Squirrelly │ Cuz I wanna fill a bathtub with it and just bathe in lube.
[02:45:10] <Rylee> then you fall down the stairs, and you slide
[02:45:15] <Rylee> and just keep on sliding and don't stop
[02:45:31] <Rylee> and merge onto the highway, and next thing you know, you're in venezuala
[02:47:54] <cloppyhooves> Make sure you check your blind spots before mergining onto the highway while lube-sliding
[02:48:37] <Squirrelly> rofl
[02:48:41] <Squirrelly> This needs to be a sport
[02:48:54] <Squirrelly> I would be a fucking olympic athlete in it

[02:51:09] <Flame> lol
[02:52:00] <ponder> I wonder wether, if you coat your entire body in a thick layer of oil- or silicone-based lube, you can swim faster because of less friction with the water...
[02:52:02] <Squirrelly> Lol
[02:52:10] <Squirrelly> ponder
[02:52:14] <Squirrelly> I volunteer to test that
[02:52:21] <Squirrelly> If somebody gives me that much lube
[02:52:26] <ponder> we need more volunteers though.
[02:52:49] <Cantaloupe> you'd have to leave your legs and hands dry 
[02:52:59] <ponder> We can't generalize from the experience of just one person
[02:53:02] <Cantaloupe> to catch the water and build up a pace
[02:53:08] <ponder> A hundred test subjects, at least.
[02:53:57] <Cantaloupe> diving of course gives you a certain amount of speed for a relative time, depending on your streamline position and its endurance 
[02:54:19] <Squirrelly> Solution: replace showers at a pool with lube
[02:54:36] <Cantaloupe> RIP people walking on the banks
[02:55:20] <Cantaloupe> or just walking on the floor in general, shoes on or not
[02:55:52] <Squirrelly> lol

[03:41:53] <FlameAway> thaostra: unity needs to make their web plugin work for Linux >_>
[03:42:03] <FlameAway> we can play the games (I think?) but can't do web plugins
[03:43:15] <thaostra> What we really need is the Unity editor so that we can publish games for Linux ON Linux
[03:43:51] <thaostra> Btw, Unreal is going to give Unity a run for its money
[03:45:37] <Frosty> Unreal is free now.
[03:46:12] <thaostra> No more subscriptions, and the all of the source code is available
[03:46:39] <Frosty> You just owe royalties if you make money off it, right?
[03:46:54] <FlameAway> yeah.
[03:46:57] <thaostra> There's a 5% royalty you still need to pay, IF you're making over $3,000 per quarter per product
[03:47:19] <FlameAway> so: make opensource unreal4 game 
[03:47:20] <thaostra> So you only need to pay the money when you're actually making the money
[03:47:51] <Frosty> So If I make $38,000 in a quarter, I own them 2k?
[03:48:38] <thaostra> $1,900 more like it, but yeah
[03:48:57] <weisey> So, hold your checks so you make 2999 a quarter
[03:49:11] <Frosty> I adjusted for inflation and taxes.
[03:49:28] <expatriate> unity's totally redoing the webplayer, so it might work with linux when that's out
[03:49:41] <expatriate> I know it won't require a plugin
[03:49:55] <Frosty> I can't live off of 3Gs every three months
[03:49:55] <thaostra> That's more than fair considering there's no upfront financial commitment for getting all of the tools and source code to be able to get games running on basically every major platform

[07:44:32] <cloppyhooves> What does that mean? :o
[07:44:38] <Lumia> I was wondering what that was
[07:44:40] <Sleep> Colgate was coding stuff for atheme
[07:44:56] <Sleep> it's just making the channel persistent in the case all users leave
[07:45:51] <Evelina> I need to dust off my psp or vita again

[07:49:02] <Evelina> I got the itch to play Vanilla minecraft again
[07:49:13] <RubyPinch> nuuuuuu use mods
[07:49:16] <Evelina> Nope.
[07:49:23] <Evelina> Mods ruin the gamplay most of the time.
[07:49:23] <RubyPinch> D:
[07:49:35] <Evelina> Because I focus on getting the MOST out of a mod instead of enjoying the game for how it is
[07:49:43] * Flame sighs and lays down
[07:49:44] <Evelina> I think the only mods I enjoy are maps
[07:49:45] <Evelina> Or.

[08:21:50] <Nikashi> Evelina: watching :)
[08:21:54] <Nikashi> yay streaming
[08:22:26] <Nikashi> Is this PC
[08:22:48] <Evelina> yeap! It's PC!
[08:23:25] <Nikashi> what stream software
[08:23:46] <Evelina> OBS!
[08:24:11] <Nikashi> for encoding sake I'd drop to 30fps
[08:24:19] <Nikashi> 60fps is smooth but artifacting gets nuts
[08:25:06] <Evelina> Really, artificing meaning when I'm moving right?
[08:25:14] <Nikashi> yeah it checkerboards a bit
[08:25:23] <Nikashi> for streamwise, 30fps is usually fine
[08:25:35] <Nikashi> but I mean it's fine and watchable now
[08:25:36] <Nikashi> hehe
[08:25:43] <Evelina> Damn I love 60fps tho
[08:25:45] <Nikashi> I just like to offer advice since I worked on my settings for a LONG tie
[08:25:46] <Nikashi> yeah it's nice
[08:25:50] <Evelina> Could I drop it to like. 40
[08:25:56] <Evelina> or 45 instead of all the way to 30
[08:25:58] <Nikashi> 30
[08:26:06] <Nikashi> 30 is better
[08:26:12] <Nikashi> it's a matter of howthings are encoded
[08:26:21] <Nikashi> like right now
[08:26:28] <Nikashi> there's probably very few people who can watch your stream
[08:26:34] <Nikashi> it's very high rate
[08:26:46] <Nikashi> I need 2Mbps just to stream it
[08:26:47] <OnlyMe> it works fine for me, just looks low quality
[08:26:54] <Nikashi> yeah that's the artifacting
[08:26:57] <Nikashi> what encoding rate
[08:26:58] <Nikashi> as well
[08:27:00] <Evelina> Alright.. I'll try dropping to 30, give me 40 seconds
[08:27:01] <Nikashi> and what's your upload
[08:27:02] <Nikashi> haha
[08:27:02] <Nikashi> wait
[08:27:03] <Nikashi> wait
[08:27:07] <Nikashi> if you're gonna change settings
[08:27:09] <Flame> https://i.imgur.com/Lu4YrYQ.jpg hehehe
[08:27:11] <Nikashi> let's get your otehr parameters
[08:27:26] <Evelina> RubyPinch help me set everythign else
[08:27:28] <Nikashi> I need your ISPs upload rate, and your encoding rate (currentl)
[08:27:32] <Nikashi> your resolution is fine
[08:27:34] <Evelina> Trust me, I spend about an hour getting it up
[08:27:44] <Nikashi> hehe I just wanna help tweak now!
[08:27:46] <Evelina> With contacnt feedback from someone in australia
[08:27:50] <Nikashi> you've seen mine right?
[08:27:55] <Evelina> Nien
[08:27:56] <RubyPinch> I am in bed
[08:28:04] <OnlyMe> needs more jpeg Flame
[08:28:04] <Nikashi> well just let me know your upload and current encoding rate
[08:28:10] <Nikashi> das all
[08:28:12] <Evelina> Fuuuck fine
[08:28:15] <Nikashi> hahaha
[08:28:20] <Evelina> Let me stop my stream so i can test
[08:28:24] <Nikashi> okay
[08:28:39] <Nikashi> but you'd be topping out a lot of resi connections in the US
[08:28:55] <RubyPinch> Tops out mine ;-!
[08:29:14] <Nikashi> We'll try to go as friendly as we can for 1080p
[08:29:19] <Nikashi> since I doubt you wanna dop to  720 right?
[08:29:40] <Flame> https://www.reddit.com/r/ecchi/comments/2xqss8/where_can_i_find_more_like_this_where_girls_are/ human but hot ;-;
[08:29:54] <Evelina> 5 to 5.5 mg up
[08:29:57] <Nikashi> o_o
[08:29:59] <Nikashi> okay that's nuts
[08:30:03] <Nikashi> oh
[08:30:06] <Nikashi> you mean your actual ISP upload
[08:30:09] <Nikashi> okay that's the same as me
[08:30:11] <Evelina> I went to speedtest.net
[08:30:13] <Nikashi> and that explains a bit
[08:30:13] <Nikashi> yeah
[08:30:20] <Nikashi> sorry I thought that meant your encoding rate
[08:30:26] <Lumia> Hey is it possible to stream from a phone? 
[08:30:29] <Nikashi> Yes
[08:30:33] <Nikashi> but it would be super taxing
[08:30:34] <Lumia> How?

[08:31:01] <Nikashi> yaay
[08:31:02] <Nikashi> okay
[08:31:12] <Nikashi> you wanna set your max bitrate to 3500
[08:31:24] <Nikashi> same for buffer size
[08:31:28] <Evelina> We tried
[08:31:29] <Evelina> had problems
[08:31:35] <Nikashi> okay well
[08:31:41] <Flame> Evelina: I'm at 15mbps down adn 1.89mbps up o.o
[08:31:42] <Nikashi> 2000 isn't gonna support a 1080p stream
[08:31:43] <Evelina> I mean I'll test it
[08:31:51] <Evelina> hold please
[08:31:53] <Nikashi> ok
[08:32:06] <Evelina> Why would I ever put my buffer the same as my max
[08:32:16] <Nikashi> it's different values but they correnlate
[08:32:18] <Nikashi> correlate*
[08:32:27] <Evelina> Ok, next.

[08:32:32] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v Melon_Phone
[08:32:33] <Lumia> She's right eve, a larger buffer size will help exponentially
[08:32:50] <Nikashi> I've gone over a lot of guides, let's try this
[08:32:57] <Evelina> I just downgraded my buffer size lumia
[08:33:02] <Nikashi> now the actual window
[08:33:08] <Nikashi> should be 720 on your connection
[08:33:17] <Nikashi> unless you can push 10Mbps comfortably with overhead
[08:33:26] <Lumia> Wait, are we talking  audio out video? 
[08:33:28] <OnlyMe> Hey guys, what's that robot girl maid called from that "famous" anime where her on switch is her cooch?
[08:33:28] <Nikashi> even I can't do 720p
[08:33:28] <Evelina> I just speedtested, that was the max
[08:33:34] <Nikashi> yeah
[08:33:41] <Lumia> Or**
[08:33:43] <Nikashi> so 1280x720 for the OBS stream window sie
[08:33:45] <Nikashi> size
[08:33:49] <Evelina> ....
[08:33:51] <Nikashi> you can still scale the window
[08:33:59] * Melon_Phone cuddles lumia
[08:34:00] <Nikashi> don't have to change your game res
[08:34:04] <Nikashi> just scale it down
[08:34:21] <Evelina> 1280x720 sounds horrid
[08:34:22] <Nikashi> but that should do it
[08:34:23] <Nikashi> er
[08:34:25] <Nikashi> that's 720p
[08:34:26] <Nikashi> HD
[08:34:33] <Nikashi> and remember if someone has the chat window open
[08:34:35] <Nikashi> or the sidebar
[08:34:37] <Nikashi> it's running at that res anyways
[08:34:50] <Evelina> And if someone is watching fullscreen?
[08:34:54] <Nikashi> it's an HD straem
[08:35:07] <Nikashi> 720p is the standard for high def
[08:35:11] <Evelina> Ok
[08:35:13] <Nikashi> so that's fine )
[08:35:14] <Nikashi> :)
[08:35:20] <Evelina> Please uhm..
[08:35:26] <Nikashi> I will watch!
[08:35:28] <Nikashi> from my side
[08:35:32] <Evelina> can I ask not to put that smile when dealing with tech advice.
[08:35:35] <Nikashi> because it's hard to check using OBS/preview I know
[08:35:41] <Nikashi> er
[08:35:41] <Nikashi> ok
[08:35:43] <Nikashi> no smiles
[08:35:54] <Evelina> I have a supervisor that puts ;) after every snide and obvious suggestion he has
[08:36:03] <Evelina> And I want to throw him through a window.
[08:36:03] <Nikashi> I didn't ;) I :)
[08:36:06] <Nikashi> it was genuine lol
[08:36:10] <Evelina> I get it
[08:36:13] <Nikashi> haha but go
[08:36:14] <Evelina> It's just very similar
[08:36:15] <Nikashi> try those settings
[08:36:25] <Nikashi> I'll check
[08:36:36] <Nikashi> you can view the stream but it's ahrd to properly check from your own network

[08:36:40] <Nikashi> tjat
[08:36:42] <Nikashi> woah
[08:36:44] <Nikashi> that's waaaaaay better

[08:37:29] <Nikashi> Eve
[08:37:32] <Nikashi> it's still 60fps lol
[08:37:34] <Nikashi> but it works
[08:37:44] <Evelina> I know it's 60
[08:37:47] <Nikashi> just know you can double your encoding rate and quality by going to half hehe
[08:37:51] <Evelina> cause you said we were going to make it 60 fps friendly
[08:37:51] <Nikashi> but right now it's totally fine
[08:38:12] <Evelina> I just don't want the framerate to look horrid
[08:38:12] <Nikashi> I was gonna make it 'regular user' friendly, not 60fps, but 60fps IS working
[08:38:16] <Nikashi> 30 steady
[08:38:22] <Nikashi> from a higher framerate source
[08:38:23] <Nikashi> is fine
[08:38:33] <Evelina> Grrr... fine I'll test.
[08:38:37] <Nikashi> it's a PC encoding thing
[08:38:39] <Evelina> Have to stop the bloody stream
[08:38:41] <Nikashi> if you don't have a quad core
[08:38:43] <Nikashi> it's stutters
[08:38:47] <Nikashi> it*
[08:38:49] <Evelina> I doooo have a quad core
[08:39:08] <Evelina> This computer can run hard
[08:39:13] <Nikashi> well it DOES work at 60fps for me
[08:39:22] <Nikashi> you need someone with a dinkier PC to check
[08:39:23] <Nikashi> haha
[08:39:26] <Nikashi> I am still watching though
[08:39:26] * Evelina drops it to 30 dissapointingly
[08:39:29] <Nikashi> with graphs and everything
[08:39:46] <Nikashi> okay here it goes
[08:39:48] <Nikashi> loading
[08:39:58] <Nikashi> I'll tell you if it's okay or just go back to 60 lol
[08:40:41] <Nikashi> Eve this looks great
[08:40:49] <Nikashi> like super sharp too
[08:40:56] <Nikashi> I can see every detail
[08:41:09] <Nikashi> framerate is rock solid steady
[08:41:24] <Melon_Phone> so much text
[08:41:27] <Melon_Phone> so little time
[08:41:28] <Nikashi> can you read it all 
[08:41:33] <Nikashi> like how is the stream to you
[08:41:34] <Nikashi> tell her 
[08:41:35] <Nikashi> lol
[08:41:42] <Nikashi> I can READ the text now
[08:41:50] <Evelina> Oh.
[08:41:52] <Melon_Phone> I'm talking about this chat
[08:41:55] <Nikashi> oh ahah
[08:41:56] <Evelina> You should have told me it was unreadable
[08:42:01] <Melon_Phone> I popped away for 3 seconds
[08:42:02] <Nikashi> well that's what I meant, artifacting
[08:42:11] <Nikashi> it was just making everything a sea of blocks when you movd
[08:42:14] <Melon_Phone> and like 300 miles of text appeared
[08:42:19] <Nikashi> now it's SUPER sharp and awesome looking in every way
[08:42:34] <Nikashi> I can barely notice you chagned the FPS
[08:42:53] <Nikashi> So yeah this is perfect for reals
[08:43:19] <Nikashi> I have it full screen on my 24"
