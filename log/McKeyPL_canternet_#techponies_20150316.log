[03:57:37] <JustAberrant> mm
[03:57:46] <JustAberrant> my guess would be a cgi script?

[03:58:15] <Candice> suppose i could disable cgi
[03:58:25] <wolfyshy> something like htop or ps in tree mode should tell you what's spawning perl
[03:58:27] <wolfyshy> that might help
[03:58:35] <JustAberrant> ^
[03:58:39] <JustAberrant> just do ps aux | grep perl

[06:46:31] <TuxRug> Whewww... considering unlocking the bootloader on my phone and flashing a custom kernel. I love the stock ROM, but I'm willing to believe the hype on this kernel because some of the changes from stock make sense and it has great reviews.
[06:53:01] <init3> What does it claim to do?
[06:57:24] <TuxRug> (Nexus 5) Mainly stock kernel with a few config changes. For example, stock kernel boosts clock speed on any touch event even if not needed for 3 full seconds (presumably to make it "feel" faster). This kernel boosts the clock speed for a shorter duration, helping improve screen-on-time battery life when doing something where you touch the screen every few seconds.
[06:57:53] <TuxRug> Also merges generic non-hardware-specific optimizations from released kernel sources of similar devices.
[06:58:56] <TuxRug> I'm looking at Franco Kernel. I think it's one of the most popular ones for the Nexus 5, maybe the whole Nexus line?
[06:59:13] <init3> Got ya.
[06:59:38] <TuxRug> The part I'm apprehensive about is the factory reset. It's way better in Lollipop but I still don't care for it.
[06:59:56] <init3> Makes me a bit sad. I had a nice Nexus 7 tablet that some asswipe stole out of my laptop bag because I was nice enough to give him a ride home.
[07:00:44] <init3> And it was locked, but I had given him the password earlier like a dumbass to let him use it.
[07:00:50] <init3> while I was driving.
[07:01:33] <TuxRug> If the rumored Nexus 5 refresh comes true, that might be my next phone whenever this one bites the dust. I'm making googoo eyes at the G Flex 2, but I love having the stock OS without a ton of manufacturer fluff. Most of the Google fluff I actually do use.
[07:02:07] <init3> Yeah
[07:02:21] <TuxRug> I have the smart-lock on mine so I don't have to share my code. If my watch is in range, no lock. If it disconnects, locked.
[07:02:57] <TuxRug> And I've got the remote password-change-and-track-and-wipe from Android Device Manager.
[07:03:34] <TuxRug> I wonder if that works with unlocked bootloader though. I doubt it with custom recovery but I'd only really need that if I was switching roms, making nandroids, or kernel-hopping.
[07:04:22] <TuxRug> The best part of TWRP on my old phone was I /didn't/ have an easy way to return to a stock image without unrooting, unless I kept a nandroid of the (slightly modded) stock.
[07:04:26] <Kinsley> TuxRug: my experience? Android Device Manager still works with unlocked bootloaders and custom ROMs.
[07:04:36] <TuxRug> Even the remote wipe?
[07:04:41] <Kinsley> At least, it did with my Galaxy S4.
[07:04:43] <Kinsley> Never found out?
[07:04:55] <Kinsley> I figure it still would, since everything else did.
[07:05:09] <Kinsley> Might've been something to try, since I had to turn it in when I upgraded to the Note 4.
[07:05:21] <TuxRug> I knew root apps were able to reboot to TWRP and have it do something and reboot.
[07:05:23] <init3> Yeah, I had such a security thing on mine too. Problem was, he knew I was going to remoke lock it but that he has 20 minutes before I got home.
[07:06:00] <init3> And apparently had someone waiting at his house who knew how to wipe without a password.
[07:06:16] <init3> I think my other issue was I had several OSes on it.
[07:06:25] <init3> Ubuntu touch, stock, and CWM.
[07:06:33] <TuxRug> I had to keep my stock image around on my old phone because I was on Sprint and they loved changing the profile on their end for some reason and Data would goof up until I updated the profile on my phone. 
[07:07:12] <TuxRug> I jumped ship from Sense to Cyanogenmod but Cyanogenmod didn't have any mechanism of updating the phone's profile.
[07:07:46] <TuxRug> So if data bonkered up, I'd backup my current state, flash my backup of stock, update profile, then flash back to cyanogenmod.
[07:07:58] <TuxRug> Turned a 30-second process into about a 10 minute process.
[07:08:17] <TuxRug> Luckly now, SIM card. No need for profile updates.
[07:08:32] <init3> Err I meany cyanogen. not CWM
[07:09:29] <TuxRug> I don't even know if I want to flash TWRP, or the kernel, but I at least want to boot it.
[07:09:45] <TuxRug> You can just boot a kernel without flashing it right, just adb boot <image> right?
[07:10:03] <TuxRug> Then I can trial it out with only needing a reboot to revert, right?
[07:10:39] <init3> I wasn't aware of a way to do that. Not saying I know it can't be.
[07:11:41] <TuxRug> The two popular kernels for my phone are ElemenalX and Franco. ElementalX looks really advanced though, with user-side overclocking and voltage control....
[07:12:24] <TuxRug> Franco looks like a drop-in replacement for stock.
[07:12:25] *** Candice is now known as Candice|Away
[07:13:51] <TuxRug> I've done sideloads of OTA updates, this shouldn't be a problem.
[07:15:01] <TuxRug> Untarring the factory image because I wanted to flash it clean for giggles as well.
[07:21:42] <TuxRug> Here we go.... Nervous... I've only done this on one phone before...
[07:21:54] <TuxRug> fastboot oem unlock
[07:22:38] <TuxRug> And it is unlocked and erasing....
[07:23:07] <TuxRug> That ws fast.
[07:23:15] <TuxRug> Rebooting to test.
[07:23:22] <TuxRug> Ah, I have the wiggly android now.
[07:23:27] <TuxRug> I'm guessing that's the wipe.
[07:23:34] <TuxRug> Yep, it is.
[08:06:07] <TuxRug> http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2532422 Here's the info about that kernel.
[08:06:09] <PinkiePieBot> [ [FAQ] Franco Kernel & FKU APK Learner's … | Android Development and Hacking | XDA Forums ]
[08:06:46] <TuxRug> I just booted to it but didn't flash it. It only exists in memory on my phone right now and will go back to stock when I reboot. Great for just testing out for now.

[21:40:30] <Blackjack> Guys
[21:40:35] <Blackjack> People who know what they are doing
[21:40:36] <Blackjack> like wolfyshy
[21:40:43] <Blackjack> How do I make a tmux session with a command in it
[21:41:08] <Blackjack> Like, one command to create a tmux session, run a command in the first window, and return immediately (don't attach)
[21:42:57] <wolfyshy> # tmux new-session -d python3.4
[21:43:09] <wolfyshy> = make a new session with python's repl and don't attach to it
[21:45:06] <wolfyshy> Compu, mini vmac can run 7.5.5 now?
[21:45:48] <Compu> wolfyshy: it always could
[21:45:52] <Blackjack> Thanks, wolfyshy
[21:45:59] <wolfyshy> no problem, Blackjack =3
[21:46:39] <Compu> wolfyshy: i just never could find the files necessary to install 7.5.5, someone on the vintage apple subreddit helped me
[21:52:34] * JustAberrant provides Compu with 27 thousand meters of orange masonry leveling string
[21:55:32] * locodash11[server] gives JustAberrant two feet of blue

[22:05:02] <sniperfox> What's mini vmac?
[22:05:29] <sniperfox> Oh god.  Why would you want this?
[22:07:16] <Quindo> .......
[22:07:34] <Quindo> I wonder if we are going to see an encrypted streaming survice sometime soon...
[22:08:31] <Quindo> EG, the streamer creates a code and unless you have that code you can still view the stream, it is simply digital noise though.
[22:09:23] * locodash11[server] has encrypted video output on his DRAC...
[22:09:24] <locodash11[server]> heh
[22:10:10] <Quindo> The main benifit of it is the hosting company can actually be immune to DMCA's and such to a certain extent.
[22:10:53] <Quindo> Obviously, if a company wanted to track someone down their personal info would not be kept under lock and key.
[22:11:18] <Quindo> I am nust sure if having that type of service would be good or bad...

[22:54:00] <wolfyshy> Quindo: sounds like HDCP applied to the internet
[22:54:06] <wolfyshy> we see how well that worked for them :)
[22:55:12] <Phase4> HDCP used a weak cipher, and version 2 will be exactly as ineffectual for different reasons
[23:01:42] <Colgate> I don't see why you couldn't do that, I've seen services where the host doesn't have the key and what not
[23:01:50] <Colgate> usually with pastebins
[23:09:34] <wolfyshy> 0bin was a great one
[23:09:48] <wolfyshy> oh looks like they are back up!
[23:10:03] <wolfyshy> okay, 0bin *is* a great one =3
[23:16:36] *** Gigabit is now known as GigaWork
[23:35:18] <Phase4> Quindo, only problem is this service would need to sustain itselgf
[23:35:20] <Phase4> itself'
[23:35:23] <Phase4> which means money
[23:57:12] <Googie> Yeah, there's nothing stopping you from doing it. It's just... you'd have to find someone willing to relay it, and since it's difficult to sustain due to cost...
[23:58:11] <Googie> There'd be a money trail if you paid. (Bitcoins could maybe help with the anonymity there)
