[01:06:47] <Chrysalis> Um. Sure. At Walmart
[01:06:55] <wobniaR> This week was the siren's one then?
[01:06:55] <Angel_Bunny> See, when a boy pony and a girl pony have one too many ciders at the pub
[01:07:00] <NightmareMoon> Nightmare Moon's comic BETTER not be like the blasted Sirens one.
[01:07:05] <RandomNinja> having a life? that sounds like effort
[01:07:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> i could have a life. just im a bit awkward :P
[01:07:07] <Angel_Bunny> occasionally 11 months later you make a little colt or filly
[01:07:10] <NightmareMoon> Sombra was awesome. Tirek was alright.
[01:07:13] <wobniaR> Was the siren one bad?
[01:07:15] <NightmareMoon> Sirens was a frickin JOKE
[01:07:18] <wobniaR> The preview looked good
[01:07:43] <NightmareMoon> Literally. The entire thing was an exercise to see how silly and stupid they could make everything,.
[01:07:52] <Angel_Bunny> when is the NightmareMoon doing the bored slide around the moon for a thousand year comic coming out?
[01:07:53] <NightmareMoon> They turned Starswirl the bearded into a clown.
[01:08:07] <Angel_Bunny> or is that already out? lol
[01:08:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> hmm also according to the statistics RandomNinja doesn't sleep
[01:08:09] <wobniaR> He was a clown in the previous comics too though
[01:08:11] <Chrysalis> NightmareMoon: I wish for it to feel like 2012 again. That is my wish.
[01:08:19] <NightmareMoon> The Sirens themselves were also extremely unserious.
[01:08:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> and probably owns a fedora :P
[01:08:32] <NightmareMoon> THey felt like opposites of the ones in Rainbow Rocks.
[01:08:40] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr, tis true
[01:08:43] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah Starswirl being a goof doesn't seem much OOC
[01:08:44] <RandomNinja> sleep is for the weak
[01:08:50] <Angel_Bunny> But I'll have to read
[01:08:51] <Cloud_Zephyr> hue
[01:09:01] <wobniaR> He doesn't even have a tier 1 canon characterization
[01:09:04] <Cloud_Zephyr> hmm i should invest in an ironic fedora
[01:09:05] <Chrysalis> I only own 3 comics. The Nightmare Rarity arc. They are hard copies.
[01:09:12] <wobniaR> In the show he's just a magical excuse for anything they can't explain
[01:09:19] <RandomNinja> wait which one?
[01:09:23] <RandomNinja> the ones with the pets?
[01:09:34] <RandomNinja> or another one I haven't read yet?
[01:09:35] <wobniaR> And the time in human world probably changed the sirens

[02:38:06] <Cloud_Zephyr> or skrub coffee?
[02:38:10] <Sketchy_Sounds> I think he means ground coffee.

[02:40:10] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah, you can get a half kilo bag of beans from them for like seven quid.
[02:40:33] <MikeM> Nice
[02:40:38] <RandomNinja> uwot
[02:40:48] <RandomNinja> that's pretty much what I pay for pre-ground
[02:40:55] <RandomNinja> at the grocery store
[02:41:05] <Cloud_Zephyr> well apparently pre ground is skrubby
[02:41:10] <RandomNinja> not necessarily
[02:41:12] <Sketchy_Sounds> Then I guess you're shopping in the wrong place :p
[02:41:14] <RandomNinja> the cheap one is
[02:41:17] <Cloud_Zephyr> mkay
[02:41:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> They do also stock Blue Mountain and the like, but that stuff is expensive.
[02:41:50] <Cloud_Zephyr> well meh you can get grinders on amazon for less than £20
[02:41:54] <Sketchy_Sounds> Half a kilo of Blue Mountain is like forty quid D:
[02:41:59] <RandomNinja> wow
[02:42:12] <MikeM> Save up for a burr grinder. It's worth the time.
[02:42:39] <Sketchy_Sounds> Probably because it's hard to come by. And yes, burr grinders are the best. No sharp bean fragments.

[07:42:58] * Angel_Bunny doesn't know what Kelowna is
[07:44:59] <FruitNinja> So I was nerding about button input number the other day
[07:45:06] <Angel_Bunny> ?
[07:45:51] <FruitNinja> I thought x! was a sufficient operation to determine a number of button input combos possible
[07:45:55] <FruitNinja> I was wrong
[07:46:00] <Angel_Bunny> nope
[07:46:04] <FruitNinja> 2! = 2
[07:46:12] <Angel_Bunny> it'd be x^n
[07:46:25] <Angel_Bunny> or well
[07:46:28] <Angel_Bunny> n^x sorry
[07:46:38] <Angel_Bunny> (buttons)^(number of inputs)
[07:47:23] <Angel_Bunny> ! would give you how the order buttons could be input if you can't double press though
[07:47:35] <FruitNinja> But, you can press: 1."a" 2."b" 3."a->b" 4."b->a" 5."b+a"
[07:47:53] <FruitNinja> So 2 buttons give you !2+1 actually
[07:48:07] <Angel_Bunny> ?
[07:48:14] <FruitNinja> Because I have to add "pressed all simultaneously
[07:48:22] <Angel_Bunny> Ohhh
[07:48:28] <DinkyBot> !shoo
[07:48:28] * DerpyBot sways from side to side, quietly humming "shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo"
[07:48:29] <DinkyBot> What a silly song, momma!
[07:48:30] <Angel_Bunny> I get what you're going for
[07:48:32] <Angel_Bunny> Do you count open?
[07:48:38] <FruitNinja> No
[07:48:53] <FruitNinja> Open is always a non-condition
[07:49:16] <Angel_Bunny> Okay
[07:49:17] <FruitNinja> I mean no-input should not be counted
[07:49:29] <Angel_Bunny> Well the one issue though
[07:49:31] <Angel_Bunny> if you have three buttons
[07:50:07] <FruitNinja> So the 3-button-input becomes 19 variants then (unlike just !3)
[07:50:17] <DJMidli> Angel_Bunny tits a city in BC. Kelowna British columbia
[07:50:24] <Angel_Bunny> XD
[07:50:29] <DJMidli> its
[07:50:32] <Angel_Bunny> XDXD
[07:50:36] <Angel_Bunny> I like the first option
[07:50:42] <Angel_Bunny> But that's cool dude!
[07:52:24] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah that seems pretty intense FruitNinja if you're counting the 'slide' inputs
[07:54:09] <FruitNinja> In case of 3 buttons, you have 6 triple-combos + "all 3 pressed", then you need to add 3 varians of each double-button-combo, and then 3 single digit inputs; so together 6+1+2*3+3=19

[07:55:23] <Angel_Bunny> Hah
[07:55:25] <Angel_Bunny> Fun times
[07:55:41] <FruitNinja> I was figuring this out in terms of how many different signal combinations can 3 nerves produce for an amputee to control the artificial limb
[07:55:54] <Angel_Bunny> Ahh
[07:56:03] <Angel_Bunny> so you'd theoretically be able to get 19 actions out of three nerves
[07:56:11] <FruitNinja> Yes
[07:56:17] <Angel_Bunny> Is three nerves common?
[07:56:33] <Angel_Bunny> Since it seems like you'd get an exponential amount out of more nerves
[07:57:00] <FruitNinja> There is a method of splicing the muscle in parts and then reading muscle contractions from each part as an input
[07:57:06] <Angel_Bunny> since 5 > 19 > like 300
[07:57:11] <Angel_Bunny> Ah
[07:57:15] <FruitNinja> Because it's easier to measure than nerve potential
[07:57:23] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah I guess the more you split it the less dexterity someone would have
[07:58:04] <FruitNinja> I was thinking how many nerve endings would I need to have all the normal keyboard key entries
[07:58:08] <Angel_Bunny> ah
[07:58:21] <Angel_Bunny> 4, if you're counting a standard set
[08:01:34] <FruitNinja> So the formula is n!+1+((n-1)!+1)*n+...+n for all the sets

[21:02:56] <Sights> I don't thinks so
[21:03:13] <Scamper_Fr> What the hay is this?
[21:03:42] <ChordCatcher> Idioglossary, the act of having a language only you and another understand I think
[21:03:55] <Sights> I think the problem is I'm bad at mixing, so I mix it REALLY loud, then you play it, it compress the loud parts to be quieter, so when it goes from a loud part to a quiet part, it's actually going from the compressed part to a non-compressed part, making the quiet parts seem really loud X3

[21:04:24] <Lycan[LDB]live> Well, then that is a normalising issue on my end
