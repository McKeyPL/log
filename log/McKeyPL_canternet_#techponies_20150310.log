[14:17:23] <Moonlightning> Use a filesystem like btrfs that keeps checksums.
[14:17:40] <fiyahsparkle|work> and yes true, but both provide that but its not a backup method, so if you lose two disks then you lose the array, but if you lsot two disks on a raid six its heavlly degraded so using it at the same time is not smart

[15:40:06] <JockeTF> DataByte: Soon, very busy at the moment.
[15:41:05] <DataByte> alright, can chat when you're free ;)
[15:41:52] <DataByte> i'm just waiting on a file copy right now, anyway.. copying my fic cache to an external drive so i can transfer it to my sever.. 
[15:42:06] <DataByte> longest file copy i've ever sat through.. and for only 41GB
[15:42:16] <DataByte> nearly 900,000 files
[15:42:42] <Moonlightning> wut
[15:42:51] <Moonlightning> Why do you need to copy it to an external drive to upload it?
[15:42:56] <Moonlightning> Wouldn't that slow the upload down?
[15:46:05] <McKey> aptitude purge bash
[15:46:53] <DataByte> i can't tar it - not enough space on laptop - and uploading file by file would take longer
[15:49:57] <Moonlightning> Can't you pipe it?
[15:50:04] <DataByte> also, pretty sure not enough space on the server to tarball it, either, come think of it.. i used 80gb disks (RAID1)
[15:50:29] <Moonlightning> tar -c $fic_dir | ssh $server 'tar -x'
[15:51:04] <DataByte> wait.. you can send a file like that?
[15:51:16] <johnsey> or you just use rsync
[15:51:27] <johnsey> which is the better choice in many cases
[15:51:58] <DataByte> i'll need to get it for cygwin, i guess.. try that out
[15:52:32] <Moonlightning> Yeah, you can. Just make sure your connection is stable, heh.
[15:55:03] <DataByte> i'm on a lan, technically, so from here shouldn't be an issue
[15:55:57] <Moonlightning> Might have to specify `-f -` to both `tar`s, but I think it reads and writes to stdio by default
[15:58:03] <Moonlightning> Oh, might wanna add `-v`, too
[15:58:11] <Moonlightning> So you can see some semblance of progress
[16:00:02] <DataByte> for rsync.. do i need to do something on the server first?
[16:00:51] <Moonlightning> If SSH is set up, you should be good. Might want to double-check that it uses SSH, though; wouldn't do to have it use rsh or something

[16:05:13] *** Joins: WildSoft (WildSoft@Pony-hfh.2pc.101.213.IP)
[16:06:55] <johnsey> well, rsync should be intalled on the remote side
[16:08:02] <johnsey> recommended options: -avzPHAX 
[16:08:39] <DataByte> is that on the server or client sending to the server?
[16:09:03] <johnsey> you don't need to execute anything on the server, just have rsync installed
[16:09:44] <DataByte> trying to figure out the syntax for uploading via ssh from the man pages.. i think i should ask google xD
[16:10:10] <johnsey> careful with trailing slashes. rsync -avzPHAX foo user@host:bar creates a subfolder foo in bar on the remote side, rsync -avzPHAX foo/ user@host:bar dumps the content of foo into bar on the remote side
[16:10:54] <johnsey> ^that will use ssh
[16:12:38] <DataByte> ok, that was cool
[16:12:52] <DataByte> i'm going to try the whole directory now ^^
[16:13:24] <johnsey> (very old versions require -e ssh, else they'll use rsh. but that's really old)
[16:14:06] <johnsey> one advantage of using rsync is that the next time you run that command, it will copy only files that have changed in the meantime or have been added
[16:18:19] <DataByte> exactly what i needed :D
[16:18:43] <DataByte> i've known of rsync.. never used it before, though
[16:20:58] <DataByte> so.. if i were to want to download.. i just swap the order of the user@server and local directory, like a cp operation
[16:22:07] <johnsey> yup
[16:23:50] <DataByte> :)
[16:25:40] <johnsey> it even works great locally if you wanna ensure that extended attributes, links, etc are preserved. just no need for -z then (compression)
[16:28:38] <DataByte> 35,000 files up, 800,000 to go

[18:13:50] <DataByte> what's your favorite mane style?
[18:14:17] <DataByte> i just like the extra poofy xD
[18:14:24] <JockeTF> DataByte: Alpacas don't have manes. :P
[18:14:32] <JockeTF> DataByte: But... Fluffle Puff is best pony.
[18:14:37] <DataByte> ok. hair style. :P
[18:15:11] <DataByte> anyway, i was first wondering what your script does for fics that have been removed from fimfiction
[18:15:11] <JockeTF> DataByte: Well, I'd say fluffy is best.
[18:15:34] <JockeTF> DataByte: It restores them from the previous version of the archive.
[18:16:37] <DataByte> ok.. so i guess i'll need to figure out how to extract the html from the epubs, then
[18:16:57] <DataByte> 2nd: would you happen to have saved the plain txt for those?
[18:17:17] <JockeTF> DataByte: Nope, just EPUB. I have to do the reverse of what you want though. ;P
[18:17:21] <DataByte> i know i could extract it from the html.. but if you have it, i like lazy

[18:18:30] <DataByte> yep, saw that ;)
[18:18:33] <DataByte> i guess that will be my lunch break then.. scanning your archive for deleted fics to index, then extract the text
[18:19:10] <JockeTF> DataByte: It doesn't have all of them, but it does have plenty. :)
[18:20:15] <DataByte> i'm thinking of adding more stats, too, like text size, average word length, common words xD
[18:20:40] <DataByte> i am easily distracted by data, i find
[18:21:49] <DataByte> up to 280,000 of 737,000 files in cache uploaded -- nearly 40% done! xD
[18:22:28] <JockeTF> Great!

[20:01:42] <JockeTF> DataByte: clean_path_name is the main thing.
[20:02:15] <JockeTF> DataByte: For example, clean_path_name(info['title'], info['id'], 'epub')
[20:02:38] <JockeTF> DataByte: Should get you something like "forgiveness_pending-71311.epub"
[20:03:05] <JockeTF> DataByte: This thing takes a lot of crap in mind. There were some REALLY long tiles consisting of only special characters, for example.
[20:03:19] <JockeTF> DataByte: So long that ZIP refused to pack them. :P
[20:03:33] <JockeTF> Sorry for the lack of comments there.
[20:03:43] <DataByte> i code the same way ;P
[20:04:33] <JockeTF> I usually make sure to at least have one docstring per function, but for some reason I didn't add any there.
[20:05:51] <JockeTF> For "get_story_path(info)", info is just the 'story' object in the Fimfiction API (v1).
[20:06:05] <JockeTF> So that's how I build a path for one story.
[20:08:52] <DataByte> oh, i see - you manually replace all upper ascii to _
[20:09:14] <JockeTF> Nah, upper case is turned to lower case.
[20:09:27] <DataByte> no, not that
[20:09:29] <JockeTF> Non ASCII is turned to at most one _ though.
[20:09:39] <DataByte> as in, values > 128
[20:09:47] <JockeTF> Ah, yes.
[20:10:25] <DataByte> still doesn't explain one i ran across.. hm..
[20:10:44] <JockeTF> (If both the author and story contains only special characters it'll look like this:  "_/1234/5678.epub")
[20:11:28] <DataByte> there is one that was "something something 5 - down" but the file was "something_something_5_down" (no hyphen, no _ for it)
[20:12:15] <JockeTF> (Something like "höööörp" by "döööörp" would be... "h/d_rp-1234/d_rp-5678.epub")
[20:12:23] <JockeTF> DataByte: Yes, that's by design.
[20:12:52] <JockeTF> So that "Hello - - - - - - - - There" is turned into "hello_there".

[20:13:57] <DataByte> but i'm not seeing where your clean_path_name does that..
[20:14:17] <JockeTF> I'll check.
[20:15:11] <JockeTF> DataByte: Line 27.
[20:15:34] <JockeTF> DataByte: It only appends the separator once per illegal character.
[20:15:49] <JockeTF> So, if there already is a _, then it doesn't add another one.
[20:16:05] <DataByte> oh! i skipped over that last bit xD
[20:16:32] <DataByte> hm
[20:17:29] <DataByte> i guess i'll need two rexexes, then

[20:58:38] <DataByte> heh - bit amusing: your epub script makes all of the pages' titles "Test Book"
[20:59:42] <JockeTF> DataByte: Yes, because that's what Fimfiction does/did. :P
[20:59:49] <DataByte> xD
[21:01:06] <JockeTF> DataByte: I made sure the converter creates books that have identical content to Fimfiction's old EPUB exporter. The MD5 checksums match up. ;P
[21:01:20] <JockeTF> It felt very silly emulating the "Test Book" stuff though. :P
[21:02:07] <DataByte> i would like to know, though.. if you have the original html files, could i convince you to lzma them together for me?
[21:03:17] <JockeTF> DataByte: Certainly. I don't have all of them though since I only started using the HTML exporter once Fimfiction dropped the EPUB formatting.
[21:04:11] <JockeTF> DataByte: I can't do it today though since it requires a bit of work for me, and I need to go in a little bit.
