[00:53:29] <ponder> That makes sense.

[00:54:38] <weisey> Lycanthrope and werewolf are one and the same :o

[00:56:18] <ponder> of course, there are different types of werewolves in different media...
[00:56:43] <weisey> The lycanthropes can do it pretty much any time they want and they retain control of themselves
[00:58:46] <ponder> like, in Dresden Files, there are werewolves (people who can turn into wolves), hexenwolves (people who can turn into wolves through the use of magical talismans), Loup-garous (people who are forcibly changed into a bipedal wolf-demon by the full moon) and lycanthropes (people who are hosts to an evil beast spirit that makes them crazy but they don't change)
[01:00:14] <ponder> And following the greek naming scheme, a wererat could be called an arouraiothrope, and a werebear could be called a ferouthrope

[20:50:18] <iamalion> Very weird dream last night:
[20:50:18] <iamalion> Aparently I enrolled myself into a class to learn swedish. The lessons actually seemed realistic, so either my brain knows swedish or I wasb eing taught gibberish. The weird part was what happened after though:
[20:50:18] <iamalion> One of my classmates was a redneck guy who resembled larry the cableguy, extremely racist though. Another was a muslim named Muhammad. 
[20:50:18] <iamalion> Due to the time the class was, every day he would have to do his prayer in the middle of class. This made the redneck (Bob, from now on) very angry.
[20:50:18] <iamalion> Muhammad then went on a trip to the middle east to visit his family, so Bob launched a nuke at them out of anger... That nuke was so big that the initial blast wave somehow reached NYC.
[20:50:18] <iamalion> The rest of class and I were angry at Bob because obviously we were all going to die. So we all sat around waiting for the blast wave to reach us.
[20:50:18] <iamalion> Eventually it did, we all died. The end.
[20:55:03] <cloppyhooves> D:
[20:55:35] <Melon_Phone> that's Sweden for you
[21:00:48] <iamalion> yeah it was a bizzarre dream
[21:01:00] <iamalion> sucks because muhammad was pretty cool

[21:42:54] <weisey> That top comment though

[21:43:31] <RubyPinch> so you need to disable the intel intergrated graphics to run dues ex, because they just assume everyone has one videocard ;-;
[21:43:56] <cloppyhooves> Sonic Generations has that problem too D:
