[04:20:45] <DinkyBot> Anypony know how to history anymore .-.
[04:21:07] <StandingLeaf> Hum, I'm thinking about something. One recent feature on EFN I liked a lot was the filtering system. I know you guys have already a lot of stuff to handle and correct before thinking adding new features, but do you consider adding a filtering system too?
[04:21:30] <MikeM> What kind of filtering?
[04:21:57] <Regulus> Oh, yeah
[04:22:02] <Eywind> The filtering system seemed a bit silly
[04:22:03] <Araxnus> Injustrial 4 song playlist. Cause YOLO
[04:22:15] <Eywind> It just muted the song
[04:22:18] <Regulus> Nash's "No Equestria Girls plsthx" fix
[04:22:27] <Eywind> Yeah
[04:22:29] <StandingLeaf> Something on the online radio. There was a form below the radio where you can write what keyword will silence the radio.
[04:22:43] <Eywind> Yeah, I don't think that's really umm
[04:22:51] <Regulus> That's literally how it came about
[04:22:54] <Eywind> Relevant? Worth the effort right now with all that needs done?
[04:22:58] <Eywind> Exatly Regulus
[04:23:00] <Eywind> Exactly*
[04:23:03] <Araxnus> Regulus: Funny thing is he likes EqG now. lol. Well he accepts them.
[04:23:12] <StandingLeaf> Eywind It just muted, and it was good that way, IMHO
[04:23:20] <Regulus> He built it to stop hearing EQG music, added it as a function cuz people wanted it.
[04:23:23] <MikeM> But how many people used it?
[04:23:31] <Eywind> Not enough to merit the resources currently
[04:23:48] <MikeM> What other stations offer it?
[04:23:48] <StandingLeaf> I surely did.
[04:24:00] <Regulus> Again, it was a personal project he gave out
[04:24:23] <StandingLeaf> I'm happy my colleages didn't hear the beginning of "more than a chicken".
[04:24:24] <Regulus> The radio player was his baby
[04:24:32] <Eywind> StandingLeaf I don't disagree that having something like that, given infinite amount of programming resources, is a good idea
[04:24:37] <Araxnus> Regulus: I know. Nash <3
[04:24:52] <Eywind> Hey More than a Chicken is a nice song :P
[04:25:12] <Regulus> I saw about 90% of the tweaks he made to it put into action

[04:50:09] <MikeM> I have no idea. Station websites usually have that information.
[04:50:10] <Eywind> Regulus
[04:50:21] <Regulus> hm?
[04:50:21] <Eywind> Conventional spacing rules on dialogue
[04:50:27] <Eywind> Let's say something goes like
[04:50:43] <Eywind> "I say something."  Actions happen.  "I say more things".  More actions happen, maybe describing actions someone else is doing to/with me.
[04:50:46] <Eywind> How do you line break all that?

[04:51:28] *** Joins: luckyspirit (luckyspirit@pony.poni.pony)
[04:51:47] <Regulus> Typically, switching speakers or shifting narrative perspective focus is accompanied by a line break/new paragraph 
[04:52:02] <Araxnus> I wub bass, Just saying
[04:52:25] <Regulus> As in, if the actions are done by the speaker, then they resume talking, no line break
[04:52:34] <thereallynewmop12100_> MikeM:  and sadly. i can't listen to next week's show because of bedtime & i can't pay of it

[04:53:05] <Eywind> Okay, thanks Regulus
[04:53:07] <MikeM> Hmm.
[04:53:22] *** Teal is now known as Teal|League
[04:53:25] <Eywind> Sombra, doesn't look like you were that incorrect.  Maybe some points the perspective changes mid-dialogue but not anything that detracting
[04:53:29] <Regulus> If actions are being done by multiple parties as observed by an outside observer, or just being done outside of dialogue that are jarring, line break
[04:53:52] <Eywind> Sweet :)
[04:54:11] <Sombra> Who keeps putting "needs" somewhere... what does that mean?

[04:54:21] <Eywind> ?
[04:54:21] <Teal|League> !t Teal
[04:54:22] <Regulus> Rule of thumb is generally if the actions are done while speaking, same paragraph

[04:54:25] <thereallynewmop12100_> MikeM: Any ways to listen to it for free?

[04:55:45] <Regulus> gdocs is not a good format for editing unless you've got a few well trusted, competent editors 
[04:56:18] <Regulus> Even then, best to go 1 at a time
[04:56:24] <Eywind> Anywho the writing wasn't bad at all.  Good descriptions of what's going on from the perspective of the thief
[04:56:37] <Regulus> Otherwise they're just stepping on each other's feet

[04:58:17] <wobniaR> Yes

[05:01:36] *** Joins: luckyspirit (luckyspirit@pony.poni.pony)
[05:01:53] <Araxnus> Can I join the Solar Flare? Celestia5ever!
[05:02:14] <Eywind> Like the perspective of someone close to the star but not getting burned (yet) could be interesting
[05:02:21] <Araxnus> Shhh. Don't ever tell Trixie
[05:02:25] <Eywind> Obviously the resistance is going to be the most adventurey/fighting scenario
[05:02:42] <Eywind> Unless you wanted to go with like the Crystal Empire or the Griffons or Dragons or something fighting
[05:02:53] <Hamtramck> nnnn gotta do laundry
[05:03:01] <Sombra> Well, I was going to have it go like, The cult type ponies who worshiped solar flare are going to come back, after all these many many years and find CElestia.
[05:03:07] <Eywind> oh
[05:03:11] <Sombra> What would they do? I dunno, worship her some more? That doesn't sound very exciting.
[05:03:31] <Eywind> Well, you could take a page from Cult Solar from the Savage Skies series
[05:03:55] <Eywind> They worship Celestia and are creating some super weapon to destroy Luna right now
[05:04:20] <Eywind> and they also are attempting to kill a foal that has dragony eyes like Nightmare Moon had
[05:04:26] <Eywind> well he's more of a colt now
[05:04:34] <Eywind> not just like a little abby
[05:04:35] <Eywind> baby*
[05:04:47] <Sombra> .babby
[05:04:50] <Eywind> babby
[05:05:05] * Eywind forms babby
[05:05:12] <Sombra> I dunno, I figure they'd somehow thing Celestia was in peril or think she was weak, and try to get the original solare flare back.
[05:05:22] <Sombra> Main thing is make solar flare look really cool and badass.
[05:05:29] <Araxnus> Eywind: That sounds like a really bad fic that would sell well and have lots of fans. But Nightmare Moon fans would hate it :p
[05:05:33] <Eywind> Lol Araxnus
[05:05:37] <Araxnus> ^.^
[05:05:41] <Eywind> the story is pretty good
[05:05:47] <thereallynewmop12100_> MikeM: Whoa. The ITV Nightscreen's Soundtrack is also soothing too 
[05:05:57] <Eywind> like well written, actual straight shipping created properly with male OCs or canon characters
[05:06:00] <Sombra> I dunno.
[05:06:05] <MikeM> I'll have to check that out, mop
[05:06:21] <Eywind> Not that it has to be straight shipping with ponies, but it's nice to read something that's not Twidash or Flutterdash (my usual two favorite shippings)
[05:06:44] <Sombra> No no no nooooo no shipping, no one gets shipped.
[05:06:49] <Eywind> oh I know
[05:06:53] <Eywind> I was just describing the Savage Skies arc a bit
[05:06:53] <Sombra> No shipping, no OC's (well I guess solar flare is sort of an oc)
[05:07:01] <Sombra> But not really any one persons OC.
[05:09:19] <Araxnus> "Dear Princess Celestia. Today I learneddd-... Not this again" Wubs trap drop bass!!!
[05:09:20] <Araxnus> :p
[05:11:00] <Araxnus> I have a friend that is a DJ. They are a Lion that thinks they are a pony. They made that ;)

[05:13:57] <Eywind> lol mikem
[05:14:09] <Sombra> Because I mean, ya know, the moon is pretty cool and all.  But think about the moon, and what it is, then think about the sun.
[05:14:15] <Sombra> Huge nuclear reactor.

[06:07:19] <thereallynewmop12100_> ITV Nightscreen was well done!
[06:07:39] * Muffin_Spectacles sings the Star vs the Forces of Evil theme...is pretty sure he's part of the small fanbase for that show, which  luckily the ponydom hasn't fully taken away my thunder as of yet!
[06:07:55] <comicfan> i hope we get a new transformers show in the future but its on cybertron like war and fall of cybertron video games
[06:08:20] <Araxnus> Those are really good games
[06:08:28] <comicfan> i heard about that star show i watched some gravity falls
[06:09:11] <comicfan> i know but stupid high moon gave up on it i mean seriously you could made another game have the war move to earth and my favortie leve was jazz and grimlock 
[06:09:27] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Disney pulled a major wtf: 5 episodes, and the show is on hiatus now until June 15!
[06:09:44] <MikeM> Don't they do that regularly?
[06:09:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: I've got about 3 weeks to talk about the show until I can review episodes again.
[06:10:17] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Word is several other DisneyXD shows are on hiatus as well...I don't get it, as I assume maybe they did this since May is a busy month for kids getting out of school and whatnot.
[06:10:17] <comicfan> woah im sorry to hear that muffin steven is on hiatus to that bites man i hope they dont give the big thumbs down knock on wood
[06:10:27] * Flashy kemps bush
[06:10:42] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Well, the show is already working on its second season right now...yes, they ok'ed S2 before S1 even got underway.
[06:11:02] <comicfan> i know amythis in steven universe got a new outfit and then they went on hiatus 
[06:11:44] <comicfan> sweet steven universe is on season two season one ending was awesome and i cant wait to see what happens in gravity falls
[06:12:00] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Here's my review section of my blog where I cover all SvtFoE stuff: https://theentertainmentnut.wordpress.com/category/star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-2/
[06:12:27] <comicfan> honestly i dont like alot of show on cn and nick i mean bring back some old 90s shows like freakazoid and angry beavers 
[06:12:30] <Araxnus> Gravity Falls you say!
[06:12:38] <Araxnus> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xE5POukfZ_U
[06:12:40] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[06:12:40] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Supernatural (Cover by Forest Rain)
[06:12:43] <Araxnus> w00t
[06:12:59] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: They don't move fast enough for kids:P Though word of warning: don't go into the new Inspector Gadget expecting entertainment...BLEAH!!
[06:13:24] <comicfan> what about swat kats i mean EXPLOSHIONS
[06:13:24] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: even if Tara Strong is voicing Penny...it's not worth it with how they made it even more stupidly comical and not funny.
[06:13:37] <MikeM> I made it through half an episode of Inspector Gadget.
[06:13:46] <Flashy> http://tinyurl.com/mt2b5gp
[06:14:13] <comicfan> no i watched the original stuff i saw those disney short of mickey and goofy and i turned the tv off
[06:14:41] <Araxnus> Flashy: Dat Flutter what face :3
[06:14:41] <comicfan> but its kool i found a new favorite disney character and guess who it is 
[06:15:17] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: I watched all of S1 of Gadget for a proper season review...I can't tell which is worse for kids: Gadget, or that horrible live-action Richie Rich series Netflix has.
[06:15:22] <comicfan> oswald the lucky rabbit
[06:15:45] <MikeM> I'd be really skeptical of a live-action show based on a cartoon.
[06:15:45] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: So, you'v e seen the early Oswald stuff then?
[06:16:13] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Richie Rich is like someone tried to stick to those bad Disney Channel tween/teen formulas, and melded it with the comic book.
[06:16:16] <comicfan> yeah i found them on youtube one day and i like the character i went out and got em2 
[06:16:33] <Flashy> i want to go to discord realm
[06:16:41] <Flashy> *discords realm
[06:16:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> I don't get why a lot of people aren't digging Treehugger. I thought she was one of the best things about the latest ep.
[06:17:03] <Flashy> Tree hugger was awesome
[06:17:03] <comicfan> nah i mean i feel bad why dont they bring back house of mouse like cn bring back hannah barbara stuff i mean kids will watch 
[06:17:05] <Muffin_Spectacles> Nicole Olvier with her 'ohm-neigh' stuff was good.
[06:17:26] <Flashy> was Nicole high when she did the voice? XD
[06:17:38] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: I grew to really dislike H-B stuff from their olden days. They were like the cheapo storylines that were pretty dumb.
[06:17:44] <comicfan> trust me the early oswald stuff and even the later years i like them there isnt a bad cartoon 
[06:17:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flashy: You try to tweet her and ask. I'm too polite to do it.
[06:18:19] <Flashy> if she comes to bronycan i might ask her inperson XD
[06:18:20] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: The funny thing about Star vs the Forces of Evil, is they almost go back to the rubber-hose limb style, and try to do thing with simple shapes.
[06:18:26] <comicfan> ehh i like piffn stuff and banna splits i mean bring in whacy races and other cartoons 
[06:18:46] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Ah yes, Wacky Races where everyone is too stupid to know someone is trying to kill them.
[06:19:14] * Muffin_Spectacles secretly loved the Robot Chicken parody of Laugh-olympics tied with Spielberg's 'Munich' film.
[06:19:23] <comicfan> yeah but thats a point of a fun cartoon is to sit down and watch it you get a few lauphs and enjoy it 
[06:19:28] <Flashy> tho i think at the end of the episode, even tho i really like it. Fluttershy should have aplogized to Discord
[06:19:40] <Muffin_Spectacles> Scooby: "re's read!" *pulls off mask* "Rhe's a Rogg!?"
[06:20:10] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Then why can't I get that reaction with 'Cars2?' the world treats it like it's some horrible plague, but it really isn't!
[06:20:20] <comicfan> it like mlp some like the humor some love the love and tolerate stuff but as a whole its like kids old and young sitting down watching a good cartoon and killing time 
[06:20:43] <Flashy> Cars 2 isnt terrible at all
[06:21:09] <Flashy> i think people are more annyoed at it because there are so many better sequels that should have happend
[06:21:12] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flashy: THANK YOU! I really hate how every other person comes down on that film like they committed a crime against humanity!
[06:21:12] <Flashy> Incredables 2
[06:21:12] <comicfan> like mater and the respect they gave to paul newman who voiced doc i like the movie but as one of my favorite you may hate me but the incredibles that movie is good
[06:21:27] <Flashy> Incredables 2 should have happend sooner
[06:21:38] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flashy: To me, I could have been fine with no incredibles 2. The first film is great as it is, and shows great character development and action.
[06:21:57] <comicfan> i know i mean we got a sequel in video game form dang it
[06:22:06] <Flashy> the fact they did a spinoff from cars before incredables was meh
[06:22:14] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Well, I will admit, I find Up to be passable, but not the masterpiece people call it...and Merida does not get sympathy from me in Brave...which I find weaker than Cars 2.
[06:22:28] <Flashy> tho Planes did get really dark at one point
[06:22:30] *** Quits: MikeM (mike@watcher.in.the.water) (Quit: Good night.)
[06:22:31] <comicfan> who watched the penguines of madagascar movie 
[06:23:02] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flashy: I would like to remind you and everyone else here: Pixar did not make Planes. Disney's other division did that, but borrowed the look and feel of the Cars films.
[06:23:05] <comicfan> brave is well im not sure but the one movie i found a little annoying is frozen 
[06:23:17] <Flashy> i like that they put this in
[06:23:24] <Flashy> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_kw3hmCUU4
[06:23:31] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: You mean you don't love that Elsa speaks to every put-upon, downtrodden person who wants to let go?
[06:23:51] <Flashy> with that, planes took a real dark turn real fast
[06:23:51] <Araxnus> D_D
[06:23:56] <Araxnus> Elsa :)
[06:23:57] <Muffin_Spectacles> To me, the one film from Disney Feature Animation in the last decade that really was amazing, was Wreck-it-Ralph.
[06:24:06] <Flashy> i hated Frozen
[06:24:17] <Araxnus> I know ;)
[06:24:29] <Flashy> Wreak it Ra\lph was awesome
[06:24:30] <comicfan> i just cant get into it is not for me but the one or two movies are jungle book and robin hood yeah theres alot of singing in it but i think its good
[06:24:32] <Muffin_Spectacles> Araxnus: I do get tired how every other person just says that 'Elsa is just like me!' on the internet. I go: "what about Anna? She's got some great qualities too, and the story is largely about her growing up.
[06:25:11] <Araxnus> Idk. Ask keekle ;)
[06:25:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Jungle Book I can't really say is a great story: because it's like Alice in Wonderland-a bratty little snot wandering around saying' Ah doowutahwhant!'
[06:25:19] <Flashy> and i really like Big hero 6
[06:25:22] <comicfan> honestly i wouldnt be surprise if a what if series arise in marvel and she become a hero or something
[06:25:32] <Flashy> Frozen can go burn
[06:25:40] <Araxnus> I did not like Wall-E. Just saying. 
[06:25:54] <Muffin_Spectacles> Araxnus: Were you turned off when the story turned to the humans?
[06:26:00] <Flashy> wall-e could have done good if it was more subtle
[06:26:11] <Muffin_Spectacles> Big Hero 6 I was a little disappointe din, because the characters didn't get enough fleshing out like in Incredibles.
[06:26:20] <comicfan> welll its like the transformers movie i wish bubblebee would have steped on sam or punted him in the ocean the humans are the annoying part in transformers
[06:26:25] <Araxnus> No. I was waiting for the story to start. Wall-E was really slow,
[06:26:28] <Flashy> Mlp Movie Next year
[06:26:51] <Araxnus> The year after then came out with UP! so I forgot about it
[06:27:01] <Flashy> up was good
[06:27:04] <Araxnus> Flashy: I still want a EqG3
[06:27:07] <Flashy> the first 5 min of ZUp
[06:27:13] <comicfan> i like up but i mean it is sad the first twenty minutes
[06:27:18] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flashy: WEll, if you move beyond the carl Ellie part of the story...then, it becomes like swiss cheese.
[06:27:20] <Flashy> i want an actual Pony Movie first
[06:27:31] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flashy: So like Roots mixed with MLP?
[06:27:33] <Araxnus> First 5min of Up! We do not talk about :3

[06:27:54] <comicfan> i want the mlp transformers action figures but animated style

[06:28:47] <comicfan> i want the alpha flight movie tho i hope they make it instead of a spiderman movie if they do spiderman than go noir and hve the dude who  voiced him in the 90s
[06:29:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> I was joking how with those Amazing Spider-man films, by the time the third one came around, eveveryone Parker knew would be dead!
[06:29:30] <comicfan> you know i cant belive toy story 4 is being made i cant remeber but they said it was in production
[06:29:59] <comicfan> what about a spiderman 2099 movie now that would be awesome
[06:30:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> comicfan: Yep, it is. I hoped they wouldn't make it...though the fact that John Lasseter is on board as a co-director, I hope is a good sign. He did co-direct Cars 2 after all.
[06:30:29] <Muffin_Spectacles> I find it funny how people say the CArs sequels are Pixar selling out. To me, the seuqel to Finding Nemo is also a sign of them selling out.
[06:30:31] <comicfan> yeah i hope so to but why not give them a series later on

[06:31:30] <comicfan> true i remeber the toy story two video game

[11:17:49] <RandomNinja> which ones?
[11:18:04] <RandomNinja> oh the Timeline album
[11:18:44] <Unixkitty> Mmhm!
[11:18:57] <JockeTF> RandomNinja: Alpacas!
[11:18:58] <RandomNinja> Timeline is a compilation though, I do recommend listening to most of the albums in one go because linear story
[11:19:19] <RandomNinja> 01001101 being the main exception
[11:20:01] <Unixkitty> I thought timeline was basically how the story should have been, was it not?
[11:21:26] <RandomNinja> well the songs are mostly in order of release
[11:21:46] <RandomNinja> and there's a few songs from Actual Fantasy which has nothing to do with the main universe
[11:23:22] <Unixkitty> I don't know, I think I still like what I've listened to so far
[11:23:28] <RandomNinja> yeah it's still great
[11:23:49] <RandomNinja> just that the story isn't really that linear to begin with outside of each individual album
[11:24:53] <RandomNinja> but I feel like you miss out of some of the self-contained stories if you don't listen to the albums in their entity
[11:25:34] <Unixkitty> I probably will at some point anyway :P

[11:57:42] <RandomNinja> Yeah they haven't changed anything technical
[11:57:50] <Liarra_Sniffles> and I'll probably always call it that

[12:06:52] <Unixkitty> I don't believe publicly streaming copyrighted music could be "stream safe"
[12:07:03] <Liarra_Sniffles> XD
[12:07:22] <Liarra_Sniffles> I moved the steamstream after getting muted on twitch
[12:07:34] <Liarra_Sniffles> it will have finished by now, but I like pone music too much to go back yet
[12:07:56] <Liarra_Sniffles> although, nobody uses steam stream, so is hard
[12:08:15] <Liarra_Sniffles> that and im a boring c**t
[12:08:42] <Liarra_Sniffles> apparently being a girl gamer isnt enough anymore
[12:08:44] <Unixkitty> Please try to avoid swearing, censoring doesn't exactly count either
[12:08:52] <Liarra_Sniffles> aw thats ok
[12:09:09] <Liarra_Sniffles> I dont usually swear, but I dont know any other words that mean the same
[12:09:22] <Unixkitty> This is a PG room, swearing is not for it.
[12:11:04] <Liarra_Sniffles> ever since the T word equivilent became a swear I dont know how to describe myself in passing :C
[12:11:27] <Unixkitty> Also to the other notion, was it ever? I don't believe unless you're talking to other people for entertainment and jokes, as well as wearing at least mildly revealing clothing on stream you could really be considered particularly entertaining by casual audience.
[12:12:14] <Liarra_Sniffles> eh, it used to be enough to get people curious enough to click
[12:12:29] <Liarra_Sniffles> then I could actually get people who liked me to watch
[12:12:38] <Liarra_Sniffles> but now I need to have big boobs to do that effectivly
[12:12:40] <Liarra_Sniffles> and I dont
[12:12:43] <Liarra_Sniffles> :<
[12:13:02] <Unixkitty> Which is pretty much part of my point.
[12:13:57] <Liarra_Sniffles> getting people to click on streams is the hard bit
[12:14:12] <Liarra_Sniffles> wait, you callin me un-attractive?
[12:14:39] <Unixkitty> Why would I do that? I don't even know what you look like
[12:15:32] <Unixkitty> My point was about what this "general audience" looks for in streams nowadays, especially by female gamers, not your looks
[12:15:59] <Liarra_Sniffles> well, it is now more than ever
[12:16:22] <Liarra_Sniffles> but, they want pretty extreme cleavage now, whereas before it was like "omg a grill, lets watch"
[12:16:30] <Unixkitty> Indeed.
[12:16:33] <RandomNinja> Looks and/or boobs shouldn't be the attraction anyway
[12:16:43] <Liarra_Sniffles> if you aren't a contraversial girl gamer you dont get views
[12:16:46] <Unixkitty> Thank you captain obvious
[12:16:51] <RandomNinja> The game/commentary should be
[12:16:55] <Liarra_Sniffles> I'm not saying they are, and I haven't ever used them to
[12:17:10] <RandomNinja> Captain Obvious away!
[12:17:11] <Liarra_Sniffles> but now its like I get lumped in with gamer gurls

[12:18:00] <Liarra_Sniffles> get kinda annoyed about people constantly saying "you aren't has hot as X"
[12:18:07] <Liarra_Sniffles> cause its fun
[12:18:10] <Unixkitty> You don't sound like you really enjoy the thing itself though
[12:18:20] <Liarra_Sniffles> I like having conversations with people watchin me play vidya games
[12:18:40] <Liarra_Sniffles> I would love to have more viewers who just like watching me play and chatting with me
[12:18:57] <Liarra_Sniffles> I think the gamer girl fiasco was a bit too recent atm
[12:19:18] <Liarra_Sniffles> too many people have crazy wrong expectations of me that I cant/dont want to live up to
[12:19:21] <Unixkitty> Relatively recent I suppose.
[12:19:47] <Liarra_Sniffles> and I live in nz, so 90% of any live audience I have is not even english XD

[12:20:44] <Liarra_Sniffles> also sorry for my spelling, my first language is dyslexic
[12:21:23] <RandomNinja> Brazilians and Finns? You need to play more power metal :P
[12:21:32] <Unixkitty> Um... it's okay I guess, typoes are not exactly an uncommon occurrence on the internet especially
[12:21:43] <Liarra_Sniffles> the ones I do have really love this radio though
[12:21:52] <Liarra_Sniffles> a lot of them haven't even heard of mlp
[12:21:55] <Liarra_Sniffles> like, not even in passing
[12:22:03] <Liarra_Sniffles> not sure why not
[12:22:12] <Unixkitty> More like power metal on an ukulele or something, RandomNinja :P
[12:22:44] <Unixkitty> Also Liarra_Sniffles, would you mind trying to group your messages a little more? Splitting becomes somewhat obnoxious and even has a term for it.
[12:23:13] <Liarra_Sniffles> uh, what do you mean splitting?
[12:23:34] <Liarra_Sniffles> im using the steam overlay for this window, it's basically just a big  text box on my end
[12:23:37] <Unixkitty> Splitting one thought or sentence into multiple lines, basically
[12:24:06] <Unixkitty> Or if you like, presses of "Send" key
[12:24:48] <Liarra_Sniffles> how do I make multiple lines in this box
[12:24:56] <Liarra_Sniffles> when I press enter it just sends
[12:25:31] <Unixkitty> And every time you do, it becomes a separate line in the chat http://i.unixkitty.net/GrCmsSeN.png
[12:26:23] <Liarra_Sniffles> no I know that, I mean how do I make a "next line" instead of sending when I press enter, since I find it hard to write and read super long sentances in large blocks like this
[12:27:27] <Unixkitty> You don't really, use periods or commas like normally? It's simply more convenient for other people to read, especially when there's multiple people chatting at the same time
[12:27:34] <RandomNinja> You don't, it's a limitation of IRC
[12:27:58] <RandomNinja> Unixkitty for some reason power metal is huge in brazil :P
[12:28:09] <Unixkitty> Is it?
[12:28:15] <Liarra_Sniffles> really?
[12:28:25] <Unixkitty> I would honestly never have guessed

[12:38:01] <Unixkitty> I think the point is to not make your text look like a monologue, basically
[12:39:56] <Liarra_Sniffles> how does a monologue relate to an irc, surely a million word long line would look more script like that multiple lines?
[12:42:14] <Unixkitty> There is a limit to how long of a line you can send, and a finished thought in one long sentence wouldn't quite occupy quite as much of space visually speaking
[12:42:32] <Unixkitty> Mostly visually at least
[12:45:52] <RandomNinja> There's also the small thing that users are informed whenever someone writes
[12:47:01] <RandomNinja> Which isn't a huge issue in this chat but in like tech support and stuff you don't want people putting out 6 lines when it could be 1 when you're waiting for replies
[12:48:36] <Liarra_Sniffles> you could put that in the rools

[16:21:57] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[16:21:58] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Symphony X - Candlelight Fantasia
[16:22:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> also apparently my college course requires going to university after as u need a fancy degree (nuuu tuition fees)
[16:22:46] <BerryPunch> Well most of my opinion of them these days will be based off the album they're putting out this year. Cause the past two albums, as a whole, have been a big improvement over the previous
[16:22:54] <BerryPunch> So if that trend keeps up

[16:26:20] * DinkyBot fusses and frowns, but hugs her momma and shakes her mane out when she finishes. "Mooommmaaa! Staaaahp! Hhehe!"
[16:27:17] <BerryPunch> How have they not been improvements? Black Clouds was sloppy and sounded like a bunch of super talented individuals wanting to do their own thing. It was like Portnoy's OCD just taking a massive diarrhea dump on music. Dramatic Turn was relatively safe but they were centered and sounded like a band again DT took that and the started to innovate and explore
[16:27:17] <BerryPunch> again
[16:29:44] <RandomNinja> I can't really pinpoint why I didn't like ADTOE
[16:29:50] <RandomNinja> sound design maybe

[23:20:05] <RandomNinja> nu
[23:20:16] <bikey> why not? I mean, if you plan on mixing it, there's no point in buying the expensive ones
[23:20:26] <RandomNinja> yeah but I don't mix my drinks
[23:20:46] <RandomNinja> it's a sure way to drink way too much and regret everything in the morning
[23:21:01] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja http://derpy.me/opasc

[23:22:15] <RandomNinja> visit belgium, get drunk on amazing beer for a year without drinking the same one twice
[23:24:31] <bikey> so the point against mixing drinks is..? :3
[23:24:39] <StrykerVylon> Inucroft[NLR]: Im well aware of the age limits in other countries. :P
[23:25:24] <RandomNinja> I don't know about you, but I like remembering what happened, not throwing up repeatedly and not spending the entire next day hugging the toilet
[23:26:16] <bikey> your choice I guess
[23:26:36] <Unixkitty> That sounds very properly responsible, in more than one way.
