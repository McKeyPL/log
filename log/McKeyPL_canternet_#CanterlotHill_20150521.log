[17:48:55] <Trildar> The more I look at what graphics card to get the more I'm convincing myself to go for the more expensive models. :P

[17:50:16] <Twilight__> I I just booped you random I'm sorry
[17:50:18] <Cloud_Zephyr> if only i chose a battle station the first time over a macbook
[17:50:24] <Trildar> Of course I'm not looking at the more expensive models solely for price. And I mean different graphics cards, not different variations of the same one.
[17:50:48] <Trildar> Cloud_Zephyr: ye u pleb :V
[17:51:18] <Seoson> ;-)
[17:51:19] <RandomNinja> Trildar, 970 is the endgame of price/performance
[17:51:27] <Cloud_Zephyr> i should probably do some measurements to check whether i can squeeze all the monitors on the desk
[17:51:33] <Trildar> That is too high. :P
[17:51:40] <RandomNinja> 750 Ti for midrange :P
[17:51:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> and maybe check if there is space for a third monitor in the future

[17:53:10] <Trildar> Unfortunately I'm not sure those prices apply here.
