[03:20:15] <Colgate> yes
[03:20:25] <Colgate> you just add them to the group locally
[03:21:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> they are in the group
[03:21:20] <ShivalPonyWolf> but they still cant install updates
[03:21:30] <Colgate> have they logged out and back in?
[03:21:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> yep
[03:21:51] <Colgate> hmm, should work
[03:21:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> that what i thought
[03:22:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> but the windows update pannel just has the message about updates being looked after by the administrator
[03:22:20] <Colgate> oh, that's different
[03:22:35] <Colgate> you have a group/local policy that is setting that

[04:54:33] <AppleDash> lol
[04:54:54] <AppleDash> They have, JustAberrant
[04:55:13] <JustAberrant> it probably would be if I was actually looking for a challenge
[04:55:18] <Phase4> JustAberrant, what do you mean by Ic2 treatment?
[04:55:51] <JustAberrant> turning it from something that takes the tedium out of the game to something that requires just as much tedium as the things it automates :D
[04:56:15] <JustAberrant> and again, I get the value in that

[04:58:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol at the uptime chart
[04:58:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> (Uptime seems to increase steadily throughout the day... )
[04:58:40] <JustAberrant> :D
[04:58:50] <AppleDash> lol
[04:59:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> who would have thought
[04:59:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> must now setup uptime graphs on all the servers i look after
[04:59:42] <AppleDash> xD
[04:59:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> and have them alarm when it gets to high
[04:59:52] <Phase4> "Uptime seems to increase steadily throughout the day..."
[05:00:14] <JustAberrant> also, when you said copy the design, I guess you really meant it :D
[05:00:17] <Phase4> JustAberrant, you mean in terms of crafting or having to find the presses
[05:00:18] <AppleDash> Yes
[05:00:25] <JustAberrant> Phase4: both
[05:00:30] <ShivalPonyWolf> the presses for AE2 are a bitch
[05:00:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> i actually like the channel system
[05:00:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> and the new auto crafters
[05:00:39] <Phase4> ^
[05:00:45] <AppleDash> I didn't copy the index though
[05:00:47] <JustAberrant> Phase4: looks like they've added a bunch of new game mechanics and random "thing you need for everything that's insanely hard to find"
[05:01:00] <AppleDash> because I have nothing to put there except like the exact text you have
[05:01:01] <AppleDash> lol
[05:01:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> i spawned in the presses
[05:01:04] <JustAberrant> kinda like ic2 did
[05:01:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> to save the massive pointless chunk generation
[05:01:25] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: hehe, feel free to copy anything ;p
[05:01:28] <AppleDash> Once one of your friends has the presses you can copy them though
[05:01:30] <Phase4> JustAberrant, asside from the presses, everything else isn't *too* different and actually ends up needing fewer resources
[05:01:31] <AppleDash> I do and so does Lapsus
[05:01:35] <AppleDash> on my server]
[05:01:42] <Phase4> while the world gen hasn't changed, far as i know anyway
[05:01:53] <ShivalPonyWolf> i like how you can create dedicated auto crafters for 1 item
[05:01:55] <Phase4> sans meteores and charged quartz
[05:02:15] <JustAberrant> just feels like a bunch of intermediary steps to make life more difficult

[05:10:52] <Phase4> <tiwake> Phase4: what needs to change with this business card? << no idea
[05:12:59] <Phase4> JustAberrant, i'm liking channels, the need to plan capacity has made my ae system much more organized
[05:13:48] <Phase4> with ae1 you could just run a cable and hang an entire base off the end, with 2 you can access a system like that but can't extend infinitely
[05:14:33] <Phase4> i mean, with p2p tunnels you can but it certainly discourages it

[05:15:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase4: yeah i would still like the idea of a hub/router though
[05:16:39] <Phase4> though it is a bit silly that you can pack 4 dense cables through 1 regular with p2p tunnels
[05:16:56] <Phase4> and then stick another 64 dense cables down those if you so chose
[05:18:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase4: you cant nest p2p
[05:18:55] <Phase4> you can't?
[05:19:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah i remember reading something about it
[05:19:17] <ShivalPonyWolf> you can nest differnt types of p2p
[05:19:28] <JustAberrant> Phase4: well, that's what I did @ hang my whole base off one cable ;p
[05:19:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> so you can do a power over a p2p over a p2p
[05:19:33] <JustAberrant> and it was pretty well organized :D
[05:19:53] <Phase4> JustAberrant, yeah but i've seen your base, you're insane
[05:20:04] <JustAberrant> aw :D
[05:20:08] <Phase4> well organized, but insane
[05:20:27] <JustAberrant> funny thing is, it was actually pretty easy on the server

[05:31:10] <JustAberrant> between work and trying to buy a house, I don't really have a lot of time to pour into minecraft anyway.. so I'll probably just be on once in awhile :(
[05:31:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: same here with my playing. i get maybe the weekends. 
[05:32:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> i just started again becuase i had to take a week off work

[05:32:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> stupid forced time off
[05:33:09] <JustAberrant> vacation cap? :(
[05:33:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: yeah
[05:33:42] * JustAberrant gets hit by that next year
[05:34:04] <JustAberrant> though I'm hoping they just offer to pay out the time
[05:34:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> where i work you get flagged to your manager having over 4 weeks leave available, at 6 weeks you go to your bossses boss, and at 8 weeks you go to the local GM
[05:34:20] <AppleDash> JustAberrant, I'll sell you my house
[05:34:30] <ShivalPonyWolf> i was at 4 1/2 weeks
[05:34:43] <JustAberrant> here we have a 10 week hard cap (400 hours)
[05:34:51] <JustAberrant> once you hit that, it stops accumulating
[05:35:03] <ShivalPonyWolf> ours doesnt stop accumulating
[05:35:05] <JustAberrant> and yeah, I'm gonna hit that sometime next year :(
[05:35:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> but when you have to go talk to the GM about why your not taking leave
[05:35:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> its bad for everyone involved
[05:35:38] <JustAberrant> mm, crazy
[05:36:02] * JustAberrant would be like.. "ok, see you in 10 weeks" :>
[05:36:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> so direct line managers try and stop before it hapepns
[05:36:20] <JustAberrant> I'd love to take the time.. but schedules and such don't exactly work out for me taking much time off
[05:36:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> same
[05:36:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> too much to do not enough time for time off
[05:37:11] <JustAberrant> in my case though, it's management that wants people to stick around, I have a very hard time picturing them berating someone for not taking enough time off
[05:37:28] <JustAberrant> your more likely to get berated for only putting in 40 hours a week

[05:49:55] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: That's way too reasonable; that doesn't sound corporate at all.
[05:50:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> LSL = long service leave
[05:50:21] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, I know that.
[05:50:25] <JustAberrant> I almost never use mine.. because the rules around it are kinda weird with regards to overtime

[05:59:09] <JustAberrant> sure

[06:37:27] <AppleDash> Hey guys, I'm looking to make a honepot server. Do you think it'd be a good idea to have it connect to a VPN somewhere and have the real sshd and stuff listening on the VPN interface so that the public-facing interface ONLY has honeypot services listening on it?
[06:37:42] <AppleDash> I would have console access to the machine if network connectivity ever broke, so I could recover it
[06:39:13] <RazorSharpFang> I don't understand why it's not working... >.>
[06:39:31] <RazorSharpFang> I also dislike the default windows RDP client.
[06:39:41] <RazorSharpFang> Why does it not scale the display to fit the window?
[06:40:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> all the honeypot systems i manage are virtual servers
[06:40:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> no regular network access
[06:40:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> access console via esx interface
[06:40:57] <AppleDash> This is an Internet honeypot
[06:40:59] <AppleDash> not LAN
[06:41:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah so are these
[06:41:19] <AppleDash> then uhh, how do they work if they have no network access?
[06:41:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> sorry no regular network access to the rest of the netwrok
[06:41:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> the VM is bound to an interface with net access
[06:41:45] <AppleDash> Ah
[06:41:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> managment is bound to esx directly to the managment network channel
[06:42:05] <AppleDash> I couldn't manage purely over an ESXi console or something
[06:42:07] <AppleDash> Too laggy
[06:42:23] <RazorSharpFang> Which version of Ubuntu is the latest for long-term support?
[06:42:28] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive never had a lag issue with esx
[06:42:38] <AppleDash> My servers are in France
[06:42:39] <AppleDash> so yeah
[06:42:45] <AppleDash> And I'm in Canada
[06:43:03] <Phase4> RazorSharpFang, 14.04, 15.04 will be out soon-ish though
[06:43:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> hmmm
[06:43:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah that would be an issue
[06:43:35] <RazorSharpFang> Oh, how do I check if I've got a 64-bit machine or a 32-bit machine on the linux CLI?
[06:43:54] <AppleDash> I'll just do the VPN thing
[06:43:56] <ShivalPonyWolf> 2nd interface on the honeypot that binds to another machien you only power up when you need access to the honeypot vm
[06:44:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> RazorSharpFang: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[06:44:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> check the cpu type if its 64bit
[06:44:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> or uname -a
[06:44:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> and look at runnign kernel
[06:45:02] <RazorSharpFang> i686 i386?
[06:46:03] <ShivalPonyWolf> i686 is 32bit
[06:46:40] <RazorSharpFang> Ah okay.
[06:46:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> it would say x86_64 if it was 64bit
[06:46:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> or similar
[06:47:13] <Phase4> or just run arch
[06:47:21] <Kinsley> It's worth noting that 64 bit processors are perfectly happy* running 32 bit OSes
[06:47:26] <RazorSharpFang> I tried, and I couldn't install it.
[06:47:43] <Phase4> RazorSharpFang, i mean run the command 'arch', it prints out just the architecture
[06:47:50] <Kinsley> * Intel had a server grade processor years ago that was strictly 64 bit, bu any modern processor since like, 2006 has supported 64 bit.
[06:48:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase4: thats not default on everythign is it?
[06:48:19] <Phase4> i have no idea
[06:48:28] <RazorSharpFang> Phase4: That works great. XD
[06:48:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> checking /proc/cpuinfo is good to see if your proccess is a 64bit proccessor though
[06:48:59] <Phase4> it's on debian, and i assume he's on ubuntu
[06:49:07] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not
[06:49:16] <RazorSharpFang> Running ElementaryOS.
[06:49:17] <Phase4> cpuinfo gives you a lot more detail
[06:49:22] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: :(
[06:49:29] <Phase4> meh, still debian-ish
[06:49:40] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: I'm switching to ubuntu. : /
[06:50:08] <JustAberrant> :<
[06:50:56] <RazorSharpFang> So, quick question. Would this machine be able to install windows XP? I've found XP has issues with some newer machines, but this one might be 'old' enough for it to work.
[06:51:29] <RazorSharpFang> Are there 'features' or lack of features that cause issues with an XP install?
[06:51:44] <AppleDash> What are the specs?
[06:51:59] <JustAberrant> isn't XP no longer supported?
[06:52:09] <AppleDash> It isn't
[06:52:10] <RazorSharpFang> It's not.
[06:52:17] <AppleDash> Doesn't mean it doesn't work, though
[06:52:42] <RazorSharpFang> It's got an Intel Pentium CPU
[06:52:48] <JustAberrant> :(
[06:53:14] <RazorSharpFang> What's the linux equivalent of dxdiag?
[06:53:31] <JustAberrant> linux doesn't have directx at all
[06:53:41] <RazorSharpFang> I mean, to list all system specs
[06:53:42] <Googie> XP will work on pretty much any modern machine, just a matter of if drivers exist for various hardware
[06:53:49] <JustAberrant> if you just want system specs in general.. various things in /proc
[06:54:08] <JustAberrant> cpuinfo for cpu stuff
[06:54:08] <JustAberrant> etc
[06:54:21] <JustAberrant> meminfo for mem stuff
[06:54:31] <JustAberrant> buddyinfo for .. uh.. buddy stuff?
[06:54:41] <AppleDash> lol
[06:54:57] <JustAberrant> you can also find out all about your slab with /proc/slabinfo
[06:55:11] <JustAberrant> I don't know how windows accesses slab information.. but yeah.. thast's how you do it on linux :D
[06:55:12] <Googie> lspci
[06:55:16] <RazorSharpFang> 2.4GHz, 4CPUs should be more than enough for XP.
[06:55:29] <JustAberrant> and yeah
[06:55:32] <JustAberrant> lspci, lsusb etc
[06:55:35] <Googie> More likely a single, quad core CPU
[06:55:36] <JustAberrant> hwinfo for some stuff
[06:55:43] <Googie> XP will run on pretty much anything post 1998
[06:55:51] <Googie> (Well, x86)
[06:55:55] * AppleDash installs Windows XP on Googie
[06:56:04] <RazorSharpFang> It's an x86, which is good.
[06:56:07] <JustAberrant> I'm sure there's some tool that pulls it all together in a windows-y way, but most of the time you're looking for something specific, you go to whatever tool/whatver is for it ;p
[06:56:08] <RazorSharpFang> 1.5GB
[06:56:13] <RazorSharpFang> ram, that is.
[06:56:15] <Googie> I suppose if something was UEFI only that might cause issues, but I've not seen much of that for most desktops.
[06:56:32] <Googie> RazorSharpFang: XP runs on 64MB of ram, with a 500Mhz Pentium 3.
[06:56:39] <RazorSharpFang> UEFI? Would that be why it didn't install on my laptop?
