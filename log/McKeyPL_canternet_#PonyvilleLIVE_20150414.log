[08:34:40] * MirSar boops Electron "morning you"
[08:34:43] <Electron> good morning my imaginary friends
[08:34:47] <Electron> :3
[08:35:00] <Electron> how's the weather, MirSar?
[08:36:03] <Electron> have you seen the ep1, 2 and 3, MirSar?
[08:36:23] <Electron> how are the things in general, MirSar?
[08:43:01] <MirSar> sup with "20 questions"? o.o
[08:43:27] <Electron> you've been silent for like eternity
[08:43:48] <MirSar> 1. it's snowing (AGAIN!! <.<)
[08:43:48] <MirSar> 2. yes, yes, no
[08:43:48] <MirSar> 3. pretty decent, not too great and not bad either
[08:44:31] <Electron> I wish here was snow too ( ._.)
[08:44:47] <MirSar> you can have all mine! I want it to stop!
[08:45:06] <Electron> do you want to live in the village of Starlight?
[08:45:44] <MirSar> I wanna live in the city of "NotEverSnowing"
[08:46:07] <Electron> move to Africa then (:
[08:46:58] <Electron> +30 — +50ºC whole year
[08:48:05] <Electron> did you watch the opener live, MirSar?
[08:48:13] <MirSar> I think Germany or Spain would be better options, mostly because I can speak English to those people and be understood :P
[08:48:34] <MirSar> yupp, at the LAN party I was at, with 15 other Bronies ^^
[08:49:06] <MirSar> It was a bit awkward since we all where pretty shy xD
[08:49:12] <Electron> 15 bronies? like living people?
[08:49:19] <Electron> o_o
[08:49:48] <MirSar> yeah, closest thing to a Brony gathering I've been at :P
[08:49:58] * Electron has never seen a brony alive
[08:50:13] * Electron maybe it's a good thing actually
[08:51:18] <Electron> the show is pretty active now
[08:51:41] <Electron> maybe I should go somewhere to some BronyCon
[08:51:54] <Electron> if I had money of course
[08:52:03] <MirSar> you should! I would if there where anything like that in Norway :P
[08:52:22] <Electron> I dunno, I am shy too
[08:52:22] <MirSar> And I know for sure there are a lot of Ruskie Bronies
[08:52:43] <Electron> well was shy, can't say it is true now or not
[08:53:08] <MirSar> Most Bronies are, if you just meet some and start talking, you will probbobly end upp not stopp talking :P
[08:53:20] <Electron> but I don't want to meet with Ruskes :|
[08:53:45] <Electron> hehe
[08:54:55] <Electron> ideally it should be a solo trip to a BronyCon
[08:55:35] <Electron> an adveture to obscurity
[08:56:10] <Electron> did you talk like that with those 15 bronies, MirSar?
[08:57:37] <MirSar> Not a lot, like I said, we all where pretty shy.. We talked for a long while afterwards in an IRC channel though :P
[08:58:07] <Electron> lol
[08:58:23] <Electron> you were standing near to each other quetly?
[08:58:34] <Electron> and then talked online?

[09:18:41] <StarStream> hmm.. good question 
[09:18:53] <StarStream> when u say pay that would depend on the quality 
[09:18:55] <StarStream> the material 
[09:18:58] <StarStream> the complexity 
[09:19:29] <Electron> I know, that's why I'm asking
[09:20:06] <StarStream> its a very elaborate question 
[09:20:09] <StarStream> but the plushie wise
[09:20:19] <StarStream> i would love to have a larger version of my cinnamon swirl bunny :3 
[09:20:25] <StarStream> cause yea she is my plush gf 
[09:20:47] <Electron> can I have a picture of her?
[09:21:01] <StarStream> very easy to find

[09:23:27] <Electron> to now the demand
[09:23:29] <StarStream> this is the picture 
[09:23:32] <Electron> *know
[09:23:52] <StarStream> and the size wise i hope it can be 30 inch and above
[09:24:04] <StarStream> cause that way she can do a huge hug 
[09:24:19] <StarStream> tho would love it if it is 40 inch 
[09:24:20] <Electron> 30*2.5 = 75cm?
[09:24:31] <StarStream> 2.54*
[09:25:03] <StarStream> so yea ur in a sense correct but if u want it to be more accurate
[09:25:09] <Electron> 40*2.54 = 101,6cm
[09:25:17] <StarStream> yea
[09:25:21] <Electron> okay
[09:25:31] <StarStream> but do remember tho at that size it take ages to make 
[09:25:37] <StarStream> and would cost like well 500+
[09:25:38] <StarStream> usd 
[09:25:45] <Electron> wow
[09:25:56] <StarStream> and i am super picky on how she look like 
[09:26:32] <StarStream> tbh its really my wish that i can own a huge build a bear plush 
[09:26:37] <StarStream> super soft and cuddly 
[09:26:47] <StarStream> that way can hug me completely and can play easily
[09:27:37] <Electron> well yeah, I foreseen that

[09:31:47] <StarStream> as in hard to pinpoint into the exact material
[09:31:57] <Electron> as I said earlier, to know the demand

[09:35:31] <StarStream> i am very specific with my plush
