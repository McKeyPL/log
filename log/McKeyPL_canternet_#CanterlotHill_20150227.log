[02:33:13] <LunaticHell> Basch: but do ever mind following: alcohol is a thing to consumed and not to be consumed by.
[02:33:33] <baschfire> Trogdor I'm still not fully shure why it does that

[02:36:35] <baschfire> ok i am going to take a very quick break to the bathroom, brb
[02:36:41] <Rune_Blad3[NLR]> Ello
[02:37:11] <Eywind> See
[02:37:14] <Eywind> if I would have waited until now
[02:37:17] <Eywind> I'd have been right about delta brony
[02:37:45] <baschfire> I return
[02:37:49] <baschfire> and yes
[02:38:04] <Eywind> Rainbow Road always reminds me about infidelity now lol
[02:38:05] <baschfire> he's kind of the absolute authority in the pony community when it comes to games x ponies
[02:38:44] <wobniaR> Delta brony makes video game x pony remixes like every week
[02:39:36] <baschfire> is it every week?
[02:39:49] <baschfire> i know he's done a ton
[02:39:53] <baschfire> and they're impressive
[02:40:01] <Eywind> Just in case people aren't familiar:  There was a couple that did a 400+ hour Mario Kart 8 stream on twitch (8 subs = extra hour) and the girl would always sing along with the Rainbow Road song.  They got so popular they got invited to one of the speed run marathon things, and she proceeded to cheat on him with one (or more?) people there.
[02:40:01] <wobniaR> I usually see a new song by him often in my youtube feed
[02:40:12] <Eywind> So now I always think about that when I hear the rainbow road song lol
[02:40:22] <baschfire> well then
[02:40:39] <Eywind> Yeah my friend subbed to them and was looking up why they weren't doing the smash stream they promised when the 3ds game came out
[02:40:44] <Eywind> turns out that's what happened 
[02:40:52] <wobniaR> rekt
[02:41:02] <baschfire> well damn
[02:41:26] <Eywind> yeah it sucks
[02:41:26] <baschfire> not sure is that's pg but wow
[02:41:36] <Eywind> Eh there's nothing non-PG about it
[02:41:45] <baschfire> hah
[02:42:07] <baschfire> also i am amazed that i'm keeping myself to 1 mistake so far

[02:53:12] <baschfire> the artist goes by ParagonX9, and is one of my favorite people to listen to
[02:53:19] <baschfire> so go listen to him here: http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/464352

[02:54:11] <Eywind> he's an old newgrounders
[02:54:14] <Eywind> er*
[02:54:21] <baschfire> well they were writing music before 06
[02:54:32] <baschfire> so their music was before youtube even existed\
[02:54:39] <Eywind> only song I have by him in my music folder is his mario remix lol
[02:54:46] <baschfire> which one?
[02:54:54] <Eywind> alternate route? 
[02:55:05] <baschfire> hmm, haven't heard that one yet

[02:55:25] <Eywind> I redownloaded the ocremix torrents because I wanted a throwback
[02:55:57] <baschfire> i want to get more of those
[02:56:17] <baschfire> OCR is really good
[02:56:29] <Eywind> Yeah, too bad the quality is still 2004 quality lol
[02:56:53] <baschfire> and hamtramck: can you tell us the other color choices?
[02:57:47] <baschfire> well, there can still be good mixing
[02:57:56] <baschfire> but back in those days it wasn't quite as good
[02:58:25] <Eywind> Yeah
[02:59:32] <Eywind> baschfire you want a dropbox link to the songs I pulled out for my "video game" folder?
[02:59:54] <Eywind> A lot are just songs I remembered from when I was 12 and listened to them all the time, but some are still good
[02:59:58] <baschfire> I'm fairly picky with what i listen to, so i'll pass
[03:00:17] <baschfire> plus right now i have no tim to listen to other music, beyond what i'm working on
[03:00:22] <Eywind> That's fine
[03:00:42] <baschfire> i'll be playing at a con in chicago in a few weeks, so i have to prepare
[03:00:45] <Rune_Blad3[NLR]> Is this bloody song on loop. 8I
[03:00:48] <Eywind> Just figured since you said you wanted to get more of them I'd offer lol
[03:01:23] <baschfire> this is my own remix
[03:02:01] <baschfire> but yes kinda
[03:02:17] <baschfire> there are multiple themes in here~

[18:45:14] * StrawberryDitz explodes into milk.
[18:45:39] <StrawberryDitz> I find it amusing that from following NASA's tweeter that them losing a bunch of funding seems to have spurred them on to working more.
[18:45:49] * RandomNinja records the ordeal for evidence
[18:47:31] *** Joins: Featherdust (kehogcndnqd@Pony-qdiojh.fios.verizon.net)
[18:47:53] <StrawberryDitz> Apparently most of NASA's stuff is now commercially funded. Cool.
[18:48:48] <Flurshy> not sure if that is good or bad
[18:49:13] <Flurshy> on one hand, it makes space exploration less vulnerable to political $%^#
[18:49:36] <Flurshy> on the other hand, it gives more power to corporate interests to decide whether or not to fund a particular project
[18:50:10] <RandomNinja> ^
[18:50:21] <StrawberryDitz> Apparently people were asking them what it meant that one commercial employee would be going up in their latest crewed ship, and they said that really there's only one and it's likely to make it even safer. 
[18:51:07] <StrawberryDitz> If I recall the President pushed to have their funding be cut drastically and they were scrambling to sustain themselves. I like that they found a solution, and one that might lead to more rapid space development.
[18:52:56] <Flurshy> mhm, a world without space exploration is a doomed one, in the long run
[18:53:22] <StrawberryDitz> When you have corporate sponsors they want things or they'll withdraw so it's a sort of negative reinforment. You know "We might go broke if we don't do this." and as I mentioned a day or two ago, there has been very good documentation of negative reinforcement being a powerful motivator in the science game, especially the aerodynamics field.
[18:54:08] <Flurshy> any idea if they are still working on the inertial field stuff?

[18:55:30] <StrawberryDitz> It's likely it's a back project though. Right now their main concern seems to be getting the new rocket into low-orbit.

[19:03:40] <StrawberryDitz> I'd love to see what would happen in the space game if NASA started giving it's research to it's corporate backers for them to pursue corporate research and creating a viable space exploration competition such as the one from the Cold War. It was the only motivation at the time and there was numerous advances in the space of just a few years. 
[19:04:15] <Flurshy> indeed
[19:04:51] <Flurshy> if we could simply have a mars space-race like with getting a human in space
[19:05:07] <Flurshy> maybe then it would actually happen
[19:05:07] <StrawberryDitz> I'd like to see space colonies myself. 
[19:05:14] <Flurshy> and we could watch it in glorious 4K
[19:06:39] <StrawberryDitz> I said a day or two ago, in an old article in Natural History Neil Degrasse Tyson out-lined the fact that he thinks the reason space exploration stagnated was because there was such blatant optimism that we would accomplish so many goals and when they weren't met within a few years those attempting them simply gave-up.

[19:08:00] <StrawberryDitz> Competition is a negative motivator,, so it was kind of what made us progress so quickly.
[19:08:21] <StrawberryDitz> He also said that the president at the time, after we won the Space Race, had all the tules used to build the launching rocket destroyed.
[19:09:31] <StrawberryDitz> The main focus of the article was actually that at the time we were still using the exact same rocket to launch shuttles and satellites that we were using during the space race. We probably still are.

[19:14:14] <StrawberryDitz> Sadly a few of them seemed to have unfriended me when I posted that I felt my chemistry teacher was the greatest teacher I'd ever had. I was failing her class because I never did homework and she let me use the last week of school where seniors like myself didn't have to come in order to copy down labs from a book to up my grade in her class by .5 each lab, and it really helped me because I...
[19:14:16] <StrawberryDitz> ...found out they stopped counting one of my other sciences as a science and I actually needed her class.
[19:15:34] <Flurshy> I remember I could have chosen to simply never work in my senior math class, I had eneough math credits
[19:15:42] <StrawberryDitz> She was also the only teacher I ever had that actually believed me (this was honest truth too) that the heat was making me fall asleep. So when the A/C went out in the classes on that hall during the summer she would wake me up any time I just suddenly fell asleep. My other teacher on the same hall tended to just leave me there and I developed a habit of being sleepy during her class.
[19:16:33] <StrawberryDitz> The way my sciences were supposed to work was that all my agriculture classes (horticulture, animal science) were also supposed to count in, so I actually would have finished my sciences sophomore year but for some reason one of them stopped being counted.
[19:16:36] <Flurshy> ouch, no A/C in the summer?
[19:16:49] <StrawberryDitz> It had broken and it took them two weeks to fix it then it broke again.
