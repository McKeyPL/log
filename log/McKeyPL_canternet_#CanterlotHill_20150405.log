[04:31:46] <Flashy> i think so
[04:31:50] <Faith> The Tirek Episode was so baller
[04:31:54] <Hamtramck> Wait I thought we were still in the spoiler episode
[04:31:59] <MikeM> Nope.
[04:32:02] <Hamtramck> o ok
[04:32:05] <Flashy> we are past that
[04:32:18] <Hamtramck> I dug it but I imagine individuals in the stated target audience would've been freaked out by it :3
[04:32:25] <Hamtramck> Unless they've aged up the target audience now idk.
[04:32:40] <Flashy> just the nature of what was going on made it dark
[04:32:40] <MikeM> That's why it's important for parents to talk to kids about the show.
[04:33:49] <Flashy> still rated Y7?
[04:34:07] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t y7 
[04:34:31] <Hamtramck> The bit in the basement made me feel really uncomfortable (in a good way)
[04:34:32] <MikeM> Y7 doesn't mean babysitter.
[04:34:45] <Flashy> i know season 1 was rates ei
[04:34:47] <Flashy> *rated
[04:34:58] <Flashy> then seson 2 promptly upit to Y7

[04:36:18] <Flashy> MLP is censored in Canada
[04:36:29] <Faith> interesting
[04:36:40] <MikeM> How is it censored?
[04:36:50] <Dunky> damn

[04:37:02] <MikeM> Which ones?
[04:37:03] <Flashy> and some episdoes just art aird at all
[04:37:11] <Dunky> what words would be bleeped?
[04:37:25] <Faith> "I just don't know what went wrong" :P
[04:37:26] <Flashy> the first  Trixie one had bleeped out words
[04:37:31] <MikeM> Far out. Esp. since the VA's are mostly from Canada.
[04:37:50] <Hamtramck> Australia used to do weird censorship on Adventure Time

[04:39:35] <Hamtramck> I don't think the censors would've let something like S5 opener be in S1.

[07:54:07] <Angel_Bunny> so... s5 premiere
[07:54:23] <Flashy> did you see it?
[07:54:26] <Angel_Bunny> yea
[07:54:37] <Flashy> goosestepping cultist ponies
[07:54:51] <Angel_Bunny> It was a very different premiere
[07:55:03] * DerpyBot sits down with DinkyBot to go through her homework with her
[07:55:03] <DinkyBot> Momma, this is hard stuff! Can I have a muffin, pwease?
[07:55:04] <Angel_Bunny> there was no mythical evil
[07:55:05] <Flashy> ive seen goose steeping hyenas before
[07:55:22] <Flashy> but never goosestepping culist ponies
[07:55:27] <Angel_Bunny> XD
[07:55:42] <Angel_Bunny> idk there's those derpy comics
[07:55:49] <Angel_Bunny> where she's got the super huge grin that's not realistic
[07:56:25] <Angel_Bunny> but IDK, I though the episode was interesting and unique, but I didn't quite feel like I understood where they were really going with the moral
[07:56:26] <Flashy> also the line "You can't have a nightmare if you never dream!"
[07:56:33] <Angel_Bunny> XD
[07:56:40] <Flashy> creepyest line in all 5 seaosns of MLP as of yet
[07:56:44] <Angel_Bunny> yep
[07:57:10] <Angel_Bunny> I feel like it'd have been more impactful if it wasn't led by glimmer or whoever
[07:57:12] <Flashy> probally the darkest episode
[07:57:16] <Angel_Bunny> or well like
[07:57:20] <Angel_Bunny> led by the fake leader
[07:58:07] <Flashy> well the most normal looking people can turn out to be evil
[07:58:13] <Angel_Bunny> Well yeah, but I mean
[07:58:19] <Angel_Bunny> it seemed like a cop-out resolution
[07:58:32] <Hamtramck> Moral: Don't join weird desert cults.
[07:58:41] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah that doesn't seem very relevant
[07:58:53] <Angel_Bunny> I get the whole "celebrate your differences" but I didn't feel like that really taught that moral
[07:59:11] <Angel_Bunny> Except for "world without differences is sterilized", which obviously is something
[07:59:20] <Hamtramck> The moral was don't join weird desert cults.
[07:59:28] <Angel_Bunny> what about cults not in the desert?
[07:59:39] <Flashy> there is equal and then there is "equal"
[07:59:42] <Angel_Bunny> Like there's some building with high ceilings and a plus sign on the roof
[07:59:43] <Hamtramck> Especially if they're led by weird magicians that have the lance of longinus from NGE for no apparent reason.
[07:59:53] <Angel_Bunny> Should I join that cult?
[07:59:59] <Hamtramck> No.
[08:00:04] <Angel_Bunny> ok
[08:00:08] <Hamtramck> The plus sign probably means it's some weird math cult.
[08:00:14] <Angel_Bunny> XD
[08:00:19] <Angel_Bunny> !t math
[08:00:20] <DinkyBot> The math behind flailing about
[08:00:21] <Hamtramck> Do you have any idea how any people math kills a /day/
[08:00:26] <Angel_Bunny> all of them
[08:00:34] <Hamtramck> Math: Not Even Once
[08:01:13] <Angel_Bunny> but meh it was nice seeing them have trouble with a normal pony
[08:01:40] <Hamtramck> (Actually kind of wondering if staff is going to end up being something and not just random desert wood)
[08:01:46] <Flashy> there was flim/flam
[08:01:49] <Angel_Bunny> it's just random wood
[08:01:55] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah but they could have just zapped them
[08:02:02] <Flashy> thats true
[08:02:07] <Angel_Bunny> flim and flam didn't put them in life-or-death peril
[08:02:13] <Flashy> this is true
[08:02:19] <Angel_Bunny> Trixie kinda but she had some magical amulet
[08:02:31] <Angel_Bunny> the other villains didn't have more power than the mane 6
[08:02:45] <Angel_Bunny> except the 2 parters
[08:02:49] <Hamtramck> Discord did but he's not really evil anyway.
[08:02:50] <Flashy> what kind of magic screws with cutiemarks like this one did?
[08:02:57] <Angel_Bunny> cutie pox
[08:03:02] <Angel_Bunny> that's a magical disease
[08:03:03] <Hamtramck> Also that spell Twilight fixed.

[08:03:59] <Hamtramck> Naming scheme, powerful magic, possibly had access to /starswirl spell thing/
[08:04:09] <Angel_Bunny> magic didn't seem that powerful
[08:04:14] <Angel_Bunny> one specific spell
[08:04:27] <Angel_Bunny> She couldn't even teleport well
[08:04:28] <Hamtramck> She could blow things up.
[08:04:31] <Angel_Bunny> (or at all?)
[08:04:45] <Flashy> i am curious about these eastren unicorns twilight mentiond
[08:04:51] <Angel_Bunny> I feel like energy blasts is probably the easiest magic spell for unicorns aside from like telekinesis
[08:05:02] <Angel_Bunny> since it's probably just an upwelling of magic shot in a general direction
[08:05:20] <Angel_Bunny> maybe even easier than telekinesis but not taught as well
[08:05:22] <Hamtramck> I was going to binge on Saturn games
[08:05:44] <Angel_Bunny> yeah Flashy, continuously expanding the universe
[08:05:54] <Hamtramck> they probably don't teach /blowing people up/ in horse school. Just you know /saying/
[08:06:02] <Flashy> the 8 relics and stuff
[08:06:10] <Angel_Bunny> but the 8 relics didn't sound like they were missing
[08:06:11] <Flashy> i hope they expand on that
[08:06:16] <Angel_Bunny> just some extra lore
[08:06:45] <Flashy> so much lore i want to see explored
[08:07:03] <Hamtramck> idk I'm betting that comes up again
[08:07:23] <Flashy> Equestria is turing into a Tolkien'esq sytle world
[08:07:49] <Hamtramck> Maybe they'll make the alicorn amulet one of them.
[08:07:58] <Flashy> that would be cool
[08:08:01] <Angel_Bunny> we'll find out in the next 3-4 episodes
[08:08:08] <Angel_Bunny> when they get another pager buzz from the map and go somewhere
[08:08:13] <Angel_Bunny> we can see what the map goal was
[08:08:24] <Hamtramck> Man.
[08:08:31] <Hamtramck> I bet they won't finish all the map goals in time
[08:08:40] <Angel_Bunny> ;p;
[08:08:41] <Hamtramck> and will get stuck with some lame /pencil carrier/ as a consolation prize.
[08:08:42] <Flashy> 26 episodes
[08:08:43] <Angel_Bunny> XD
[08:08:50] <Hamtramck> Chief just be all "Too bad, gumshoes! Maybe next time!"
[08:08:53] <Flashy> +movie
[08:08:57] <Angel_Bunny> + s6
[08:09:02] <Angel_Bunny> just do a season crossover
[08:09:10] <Flashy> s6 been talkied about at all?
[08:09:13] <Angel_Bunny> no
[08:09:15] <Angel_Bunny> but confirmed
[08:09:22] <Hamtramck> And then Gleaming Glert's still out there.
[08:09:24] <Flashy> confirmed where?
[08:09:31] <Angel_Bunny> was in press releases
[08:09:31] <Hamtramck> Probably going to convert a whole dang horse armada.
[08:09:44] <Angel_Bunny> Meh Hamtramck IDK
[08:10:13] <Angel_Bunny> Out of the 2-parter villains, only two have showed up again in the series
[08:10:28] <Flashy> discord and NNM?
[08:10:29] <Angel_Bunny> Discord and Nightmare Moon
[08:10:30] <Angel_Bunny> yea
[08:10:40] <Angel_Bunny> Chrysalis, Sombra, Tirek haven't been seen again yet
[08:10:46] <Flashy> i really want to see Chryshalis agian
[08:10:50] <Hamtramck> Yeah but Sombra's ostensibly dead, Tirek's back in hell, and Chrysalis was soundly defeated.
[08:11:14] <Hamtramck> Glitter Greeble just wandered off somewhere quickly.
[08:11:18] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah, but how many years did she spend building that cult?
[08:11:23] <Flashy> thats another thing, the underwold is canon in this
[08:11:24] <Angel_Bunny> You think she'll be ready for a rematch in like 3 months?
[08:11:42] <Angel_Bunny> obviously she has a lot weaker magic
[08:12:03] <Flashy> she did have the element of surpirse in this place too
[08:12:07] <Angel_Bunny> Plus, it's not like Twilight would let that go without getting in the media

[08:25:00] <Angel_Bunny> Villain has a crappy talent, wants to make it not as bad as others I guess
[08:26:47] <Angel_Bunny> I didn't particularly care about her or about the town ponies

[21:06:45] <Angel_Bunny> hopefully not
[21:06:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> Think of it, if it's revealed that Celestia's pupils all had names regarding light at the end of the day...I'd think the Princess was really going for some mentally-disturbed favoritism.
