[00:16:48] <MikeM> There was a trailer?

[00:17:22] <MikeM> Nah, I'm trying to stay spoiler-free.
[00:17:29] <keekle> its not that different from what was shown during SDCC i think
[00:17:38] <wobniaR> Release date is still spring 2015 that's all you need to know

[00:18:43] <keekle> wobniaR: and this seems to be mostly tied to one episode too, as opposed to an actual season trailer

[00:19:06] <wobniaR> Yep cause they aren't even done animating the season lol
