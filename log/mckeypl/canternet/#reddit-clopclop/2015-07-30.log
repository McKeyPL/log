[00:34:45] <weisey> xD
[00:35:19] <Katiepony> They can both be found in the freezer section of Tescos.
[00:35:27] <iamalion> They both come in gallons.
[00:35:28] <iamalion> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[00:35:42] <Katiepony> Ice cream comes in gallons? o:
[00:35:48] <iamalion> in freedomland it does
[00:35:50] <Giggles> It does indeed
[00:35:51] <cloppyhooves> Oh gosh Katiepony 
[00:35:52] <iamalion> <eagle noise>
[00:35:58] <Giggles> That's the usual size.
[00:36:39] <Katiepony> Really? D: That's like... so much
[00:36:47] <Katiepony> 4.5 litres?
[00:37:58] <Giggles> Yeah, one gallon is like the standard ice cream size
[00:38:12] <Katiepony> Ours is usually a pint o:
[00:38:39] <Katiepony> Aaaand, it's 8 pints to a gallon? o:
[00:38:44] <Katiepony> That's a lot of ice cream.
[00:38:44] <Giggles> Yeah that's what you get if you just want ice cream for yourself though.
[00:38:54] <Katiepony> Why would you want to share ice cream? o:
[00:39:11] <Giggles> cause you bought a gallon
[00:39:40] <Katiepony> o:
[00:39:43] <Katiepony> I have nerds :3
[00:39:50] <Katiepony> They're imported from the US ^^

[00:41:01] <iamalion> fuckin love nerds
[00:41:27] <Giggles> Oh, I've been corrected by my sister (much more knowledgeable about ice cream) that apparently the standrad size is half a gallon)
[00:41:41] <Katiepony> I guess that makes more sense o:
[00:41:53] <Katiepony> I could eat 4 pints
[00:42:53] <Giggles> I an barely eat a pint

[00:55:44] <Katiepony> Pokémon Snap was the first game I had that made me jaded towards the games industry o:
[00:56:04] <Katiepony> Never before had I completed a game I bought, the day I bought it.

[00:57:49] <Giggles> well I guess that got rid of that guy.
[00:58:36] <Katiepony> I mean, I guess I enjoyed it in the moment, but I was shocked that it was over so soon o:
[00:58:47] <Katiepony> Especially since I was awful at games back then, and often never completed them
[00:59:06] <Katiepony> Or it would take months to finish.
[01:02:06] <Giggles> It's length never really bothered me. I thought it was a clever idea and it's really fun.
[01:02:28] <Katiepony> Also it didn't even have all the pokémon in it D:
[01:03:21] <Giggles> This is also true
[01:03:39] <Giggles> I've always said they needed to make a sequel on the DS. It would make such a good DS game.
[01:04:15] <Katiepony> That makes sense
[01:04:28] <Katiepony> I think they would struggle to sell it as a full price game these days, though
[01:04:37] <Katiepony> But what do I know? They sold the fucking 3d pokédex.

[01:07:25] <Giggles> I don't think so. I mean it was years ago they could improve the concept a lot. and DS games are typially half a game anyway
