[00:28:36] <Vulpixbrew> which is only multiplayer and I suck horribly at MP
[00:29:03] <Katiepony> Might be one of the beginner hero packs you can buy for heroes.
[00:30:09] <Katiepony> Anyway, the closed beta invites only started going out a couple of hours ago. Apparently they're still flagging accounts for a few more hours.
[00:30:22] <Vulpixbrew> hopefully
