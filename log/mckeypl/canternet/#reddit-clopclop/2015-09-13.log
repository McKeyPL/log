[06:16:17] <weisey> and a good father
[06:16:19] <weisey> and works out
[06:16:27] <Princesssluttershy> If I ever win the lottery bit I'm gonna buy a couple Dragon Lores
[06:16:39] <weisey> and works so hard to support his family
[06:17:20] <Princesssluttershy> I have so much respect for pasha
[06:17:42] <weisey> he even auctioned his personal dragon lore to help a friend(close relitive?) cover medical costs
[06:17:56] <weisey> Guy is a fucking legend
[06:18:22] <weisey> plus when he is on point, he is a CS GOD
[06:18:48] <Princesssluttershy> I also like motar2k
[06:19:22] <weisey> Motar is legit
[06:19:41] <weisey> I can understand why he stays pretty anonymous though 
[06:19:52] <Princesssluttershy> He donated like 35k to pasha
[06:19:58] <Princesssluttershy> I love watching that reaction
[06:20:14] <Princesssluttershy> when pasha get's his kid and wife on stream
[06:20:44] <weisey> He cried too
[06:21:14] <Princesssluttershy> I'd cry if someone game me that much money
[06:21:15] <weisey> 35k is a yearly income for some people in the US
[06:21:34] <weisey> 35k usd in POLAND is a fucking fortune
[06:22:15] <Princesssluttershy> It's $46k canadian
[06:22:36] <weisey> 129890.25 zloty
[06:23:51] <plushie_pegasus> I'm back!!! :)
[06:24:11] <Plums> KURWA
[06:24:27] <plushie_pegasus> GRRR I make 25K a year :(
[06:24:49] <Plums> Poor plushie
[06:24:50] <Plums> *hugs*
[06:25:09] <Princesssluttershy> My dad used to make like 60-70k a year I think
[06:25:25] <Princesssluttershy> but he was so far in debt that he never saw most of it
[06:25:32] <Giggles> I'm pretty sure my dad makes like 100k or something
[06:25:39] <weisey> average polish income is around 10k usd/ year
[06:25:54] <Princesssluttershy> weisey, that's crazy low
[06:26:06] <weisey> well their cost of living is also kinda low too
[06:26:08] <plushie_pegasus> Giggles dad is bying drinks tonight then XD
[06:26:09] <weisey> but still 
[06:26:27] <Plums> Expensive as hell to live here
[06:26:38] <Giggles> WEll he supports a family of 7 in middle class America, so we're in debt. :P
[06:26:57] <Plums> Family of 7 0.0
[06:27:32] <Giggles> mom, dad, me, sister, sister, niece, nephew.
[06:27:37] <Princesssluttershy> In alberta it costs about 110k to buy a mini home
[06:27:49] <Frosty> Giggles has a hot sister
[06:27:57] <plushie_pegasus> Cost of living not too bad in Arizona
[06:28:08] <Plums> Here in NZ a four to three bedroom house can cost anywhere between 200k and 800k
[06:28:28] <Giggles> Shut up Frosty
[06:28:44] <Frosty> It's trufax, tho
[06:29:30] <Plums> The costs of living here (particuarly for imported goods) are quite high
[06:30:21] <Plums> A big mac last i checked costs like $6.50
[06:30:32] <Plums> and thats not including drinks and fries 
[06:31:07] <Plums> How much do they cost in america?
[06:31:57] *** Joins: Lumia (Mibbit@Pony-381.m3b.78.76.IP)
[06:32:22] <plushie_pegasus> you can get a double cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $2.50
[06:32:22] <Giggles> 4.50 or so
[06:32:22] <weisey> about the same
[06:32:42] <Giggles> No, Big Macs are between 4-5.
[06:33:09] <Lumia> rawr~!
[06:33:11] <Plums> Double cheeseburger combo here costs like 8.60
[06:33:30] <Giggles> Yeah, Big Macs are 4. the meals are about 6
[06:33:34] <weisey> what fucking fantasy land are you living in giggles
[06:33:45] <Giggles> Murica :O
[06:34:02] <weisey> bigmac alone is like 5.70
[06:34:09] <weisey> meal is like 8.50
[06:34:31] <Princesssluttershy> big macs are $3.99
[06:34:45] <Giggles> I would never buy a Big Mac because they are too expensive. 4 dollars. O_O
[06:35:27] <weisey> yeah, go to taco time and get a plate of nachos for 4$ instead
[06:35:53] <Giggles> Yeah Big Macs are absurdly overpriced.
[06:36:24] <Lumia> McDonalds in general is insanely overpriced xD
[06:36:30] <Plums> Or i could go to KFC and get a six peice chicken meal for like 12 bucks
[06:36:51] <Giggles> Nah, I find McD to be cheap. but I only buy dollar sandwiches.
[06:36:51] <Plums> Wait is it.
[06:36:53] <Plums> One sec
[06:37:49] <Plums> a 'value meal' here of 6 peices of chicken, a large potato and gravy, plus a large fries is 20 bucks

[06:40:26] <Giggles> but you know what isn't overpriced? Coca-Cola! History's greatest beverage.
[06:40:38] <Plums> Alright. The main reason why it costs so much here is one inflation (although that's been level at about 2% for a while now) and 2 food companies have to compete with export buyers (overseas sector) directly
[06:41:12] <plushie_pegasus> $5 fill up, 2 peices of chicken, potatoes and gravy, biscuit, and drink for $5

[06:42:25] <Giggles> Why aren't I there right now?!
[06:42:27] <Plums> You meaning 10 litre bottles? 
[06:42:37] <Giggles> no, it's 5 2 litres.
[06:42:42] <Plums> oh
[06:42:43] <Plums> good
[06:43:03] <Giggles> ONly store brand makes bottles larger than 2 litres
[06:43:28] <Plums> Why would you need more than 2 litres in a single bottle though?
[06:43:37] * plushie_pegasus drinks generic cola for 89 cents
[06:43:47] <Giggles> because people drink a lot of soda! :O
[06:44:11] <Plums> Dear lord
[06:44:11] <Giggles> cheap soda brands are like $1 for 3 litres.

[06:45:28] <Plums> America really is the supersized nation
[06:46:00] <Giggles> kinda
[06:46:17] <iamalion> rawr rr 
[06:46:28] <Giggles> It's misleading because not many people buy 3 leader bottles, they're really only used to feed large parties of shitty children.
[06:46:33] <Giggles> They just exist.
[06:46:57] <Plums> all your stuff is just so cheap
[06:47:19] <Plums> well mass produced goods
[06:48:23] <Giggles> Yeah, different things are expensive. Like any food that isn't poisoning your body is too expensive for anyone below middle class.
[06:48:27] <Giggles> but poison is really cheap.
[06:49:07] <Plums> True
[06:49:17] <Plums> NZ meat is best meat
[06:49:32] <Plums> American meat in the same price range seems a little more bland
[06:49:49] <iamalion> I want some nz meat rawr rawr
[06:50:03] <Giggles> It almost certainly is lower quality.
[06:50:25] <Giggles> Good meat here is a little hard to come by.
[06:52:17] <Plums> Outside of imported meat everything here is good quality
[06:53:31] <Plums> guess its also food standards :/

[16:21:35] <thaostra> Good morning
[16:22:56] <RubyPinch> hihi
[16:28:06] <thaostra> I'm currently at a hotel with my girlfriend, and I can say that our first night of sex was pretty good. I got serious performance anxiety and my condom was killing my ability to stay hard, but I made her cum seven times before stopping due to her being sore and sensitive
[16:28:09] * Vulpixbrew floats in
[16:30:10] <thaostra> I didn't get to cum, but knowing I was able to make her cum is enough for me to be satisfied
[16:32:41] *** Quits: calatalee (Mibbit@Pony-4f1u7j.nj.comcast.net) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[16:32:44] <Vulpixbrew> thats awesome thaostra
[16:37:12] <thaostra> It didn't take me long to find the right spots to hit either. Like we'd be fucking while on our sides, and I'd just be holding onto her shoulders to push myself as deep as I could go and keep myself from falling out to leave her shaking with orgasms in rapid succession
[16:38:21] <thaostra> Luckily there was very little pain, instead she only got sore after the fact that her boyfriend managed to make her cum more times than she's used to by herself :3
[16:42:59] <Vulpixbrew> kinky]
