[01:12:56] <Vulpixbrew> yeah
[01:13:02] <princess_sad> I don't think I'm ready
[01:13:11] <princess_sad> I want us to just be friends again D:
[01:13:36] <Melon_Phone> it's ok to take your time to get comfy in a relationship
[01:14:05] <RNGsus> princess_sad? Why is your name princess_sad
[01:14:31] <princess_sad> I just said... I don't know what to do 
[01:15:09] <RNGsus> You name was that before you said it, i just joined. Sorry
[01:15:28] <princess_sad> I've been thinking about it for a while
[01:15:34] <princess_sad> It's been making me sad all day
[01:17:20] <Melon_Phone> I'd tell her. relationships are built on trust and honesty
[01:17:23] *** iamalion is now known as iam[a]lion
[01:17:46] <Melon_Phone> besides, I take it is your first relationship of this kind? 
[01:17:54] <princess_sad> Yeah
[01:18:41] <Melon_Phone> then she'll definitely understand 
[01:18:52] <princess_sad> It's her first one too
[01:22:13] <Melon_Phone> then she'll get a little upset aswell but a relationship where one half feels uncomfortable about the whole thing is just a waste of time better used to strengthen it 
[01:23:25] <Melon_Phone> I'd tell her how you feel, then you can discuss the next steps together 
[01:23:53] <princess_sad> ok

[13:15:14] <sparklesbright> Yuuup. Not big into the pokemon  thing myself (though I did watch the shows - the original, at least, not the countless revisions etc) . The Eeveelutions are just plain cute, though.

[13:18:12] <sparklesbright> MLP probably comes closest to that, and I'm somewhat detached from the fandom as a whole (though I'll admit to being an utter shipfic tragic. Never would have picked that going into it.
[13:22:27] <RubyPinch> :o
[13:28:10] <sparklesbright> Yeah. Never really went for the romantic stuff as much before. Really, didn't go for fanfics that much before now.

[14:23:34] <sparklesbright> How's things? life treating you well?
[14:25:51] <Luvbi> 13Decently. Graduating soon, then moving on to college, so scary stuff ahead. But otherwise things have been good
[14:33:17] <sparklesbright> I always wonder about the age of people on here when they mention school. Especially given it ends at age 18 (or most do) over here.
[14:34:32] <Luvbi> 13Same here XD You know (or at least knew) my age though. I'm 19 now, I'm only still in high school because when I transfered schools there was something wrong with the credits (previous school required less or something) so I had to take a few classes this year
[14:35:05] <sparklesbright> Ah, yes, dumb paperwork.
[14:35:59] <sparklesbright> That's gotta be suuuuper annoying, though.
[14:37:50] <Luvbi> 13Not really. I barely feel ready to move on now. Last year I was so thankful that I could stay in high school another year

[20:32:21] <Squirrelly> Some friends in college got me into it

[20:33:07] <Squirrelly> lol how so?
[20:33:12] <Cel> I once had so many cards... gave them all to a friend, so I don't fall back into buying more

[20:38:35] <Connor> Wow
[20:38:37] <Cel> I don't even know what my cards were worth... I pretty sure a couple of thousands... I had a few beta cards, but that never really mattered to me
