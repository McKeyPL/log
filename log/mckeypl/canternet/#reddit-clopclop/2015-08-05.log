[09:19:09] <Compu> Squirrelly: theres supposed to be a blacklist for the tags it lists that brings the list it gives down to a reasonable level, for some reason on of the latest updates from the bot creator made the black list stop working and i have no idea why and no idea how to make it work again
[09:19:51] <Compu> i have no idea if the tag list it gets is in a string format or a list format
[09:20:10] <RubyPinch> string format
[09:20:15] <Compu> i have no idea how to limit the number of tags in either format
[09:20:22] <RubyPinch> blacklists can not bring it down to a reasonable level
[09:20:41] <Compu> RubyPinch: ok how would i have it limit the number of tags without having it cut off one of the tags in the middle?

[09:21:24] <IceFlurries> Probably could talk to quite a few interesting employees
[09:22:03] <Compu> RubyPinch: but if its already in a string format then it wouldnt take the list in a list format, i tried that and it just goofs when trying to convert a list to a string
[09:22:04] <RubyPinch> can also textwrap.wrap(tags)[0]
[09:22:34] <RubyPinch> its because you are not doing the right things at the right part
[09:22:54] <Compu> and i have no idea what the right things r or where the right part is
[09:23:41] <Compu> and no one will tell me because the either throw docs at me and expect me to instantly learn everything and have it fixed 5 minutes ago or they tell me i shouldnt have a bot ever
[09:24:06] <RubyPinch> I was working on it up to the point where you started agressing me
[09:24:16] <Compu> yes well i was upset
[09:24:23] <Compu> and stressed
[09:24:39] <Compu> and on the brink of going absolutely insane
[09:24:54] <Squirrelly> That's not exactly a good reason for taking it out on the person trying to help you...
[09:25:17] <RubyPinch> and now I need to afk for important irl reasons
[09:25:34] <Compu> Squirrelly: the point is i had no control because i could barely think through all the stress and insanity

[18:12:34] <cloppyhooves> I know that feel D:
[18:12:44] <cloppyhooves> I'm sleep deprived but have somewhere to be at 10 D:
[18:13:46] * Vulpixbrew gives weisey and cloppyhooves lots of coffees
[18:14:02] <Vulpixbrew> I have 4 hours last night
[18:16:17] <cloppyhooves> I'm drinking some right now c:
[18:18:25] <weisey> Coffee makes me sick without food :c
[18:18:35] <Frosty> You should take a few shots. That'll put you to sleep.
[18:19:32] <cloppyhooves> Coffee also makes me sick without food!
[18:19:43] <cloppyhooves> But this is like a chocolate cappucino thing
[18:19:50] <cloppyhooves> So it's got plenty of milk in it, which helps
[18:19:57] <cloppyhooves> (I still get a little sick, though)
[18:27:14] <Vulpixbrew> aye Im starting to think im addicted to coffee

[18:28:39] <felina> Vulpixbrew: I'll pass that on when cel is around.
[18:28:45] <Vulpixbrew> tyhank you cloppyhooves
[18:30:01] <Cel> it does all the time, that's why I use the site
[18:30:01] <felina> Cel: 1 min 22 sec ago <Vulpixbrew> tell cel the price of the toekn dropped by 10,000k gold this morning, time of day I guess, gonna hae to watch the nmarket if I intend to keep doing this
[18:31:06] <Cel> I haven't bought a single token yet, I'm still trying to figure out when^^
[18:34:27] <Vulpixbrew> spo far morning time seems to be the best way
[18:34:31] <Vulpixbrew> time*
[18:36:21] <Cel> midnight seems to be a good time over here
[18:38:05] <Vulpixbrew> Im beigging to hate it
[18:38:17] <Cel> ?
[18:38:19] <Vulpixbrew> I could have brought a couple of mounts fior the gold
[18:38:24] <Vulpixbrew> begining*
[18:39:40] <Cel> :D
[18:42:28] <Cel> I was considering buying the yak thingy... but it's just too ugly for 120k... I don't even like the mammoth, but it'S only 20k and has similar usefulness
[18:42:47] <Vulpixbrew> oh welll hopefully I have a source of income by next time my toekn is up and I can use the gold for other things
[18:46:21] <Cel> you should level more alts, you can gain more gold in less time^^
[18:49:01] <Vulpixbrew> two level 100s a 81 DK and just behind that is a bear tank
[18:49:11] <Cel> I get 1-3k from logging in, clicking garrison stuff and opening salvage crates alone... takes me about 20min per day
[18:50:18] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[18:50:20] <Cel> I'm waiting for the 6.2.1 then I'm gonna finish the rest

[19:00:20] <Cel> oh I get it... because I accidentally killed one boss on normal... great
[19:02:39] <Cel> I don't even know why it was set to normal... I haven't entered a normal since... many moons
[19:04:40] <Vulpixbrew> nromal?
[19:04:54] <Cel> non heroic
[19:07:41] <Vulpixbrew> yeah what raid/dungeon?
[19:07:57] <Vulpixbrew> also would you say since two moons? as in shrine?
[19:08:52] <Cel> firelands... and yes, but many of those shrines
[19:10:33] <Vulpixbrew> I won non HC on my warrior hc on my pally just cause my pally has a much much nicer GS
[19:11:58] <Cel> before the jungle opened my priest had so much better gear than every other char of mine... and she didn't even leave the garrison... but I got one highmaul chest after another... very generous followers she has
[19:13:13] <Vulpixbrew> and real quick cause I'm frustrated, Get out of pandaland and into WoD only way your ever gonna learn to play your class is challange yourself in level approite ways
[19:14:37] <Cel> since I always played hunter and warlock first I never had level appropriate stuff^^ the second time around is never as hard, even when leveling as diszi priest or resto druid
[19:16:05] <Vulpixbrew> My pally was the worst running through things, due to the dungoens and the baleful acountbound gear my priest druid anmd my warrior are all set for gear
[19:17:48] <Cel> :D
[19:18:41] <Cel> I still can't decide what I like better... loot island, or wait for spawn jungle... the jungle takes more time to get good gear, but is less running circles
[19:19:40] <Vulpixbrew> loot island?
[19:19:51] <Cel> timeless isle
[19:20:09] <Vulpixbrew> so much grininding there....
[19:20:26] <Cel> didn't even take an hour to get full epic on loot island... 2 o 3 pieces upgraded in one more hour
[19:20:51] <Vulpixbrew> still only half way to honored with the panda king
[19:22:18] <Cel> I'm at 10k of 12k... but haven't been there for a while
[19:23:33] <Vulpixbrew> I was there the other night with the mobs that drpped rep, gather kill,gather kill wait for respawn repeat
[19:24:24] <Cel> yea... I tried that... fell asleep... woke up with a dead hulon in my face^^
[19:26:11] <Cel> I want that thing... though I would never ride it... it'S like the nethersquid... the camera is so awkward
[19:27:08] <Vulpixbrew> for some reason the dragons from panda land make me kinda sick seeing them fly
[19:27:44] <Cel> that's a good reason not to fly em^^
[19:28:41] <Vulpixbrew> I prefer protos for flying, the albino drake models have a nice walk
[19:31:03] <Cel> I don't have a preference in it self... for me every mount has to fit the story of my character... but most of my chars use hippogryphs... my paladin the fire one... my hunter the war thing... and my priest the argent
[19:31:30] <Vulpixbrew> (I mainly like the albino models due to the booty shake they do when the walk)
[19:31:48] <Cel> booty shake... well^^
[19:32:26] <Cel> In that case I want to ride a blood elf... in every way imaginable
[19:34:15] <Cel> or a draenai... as horde that would be a better mount
[19:35:09] <Vulpixbrew> lols
[19:36:08] <Vulpixbrew> draenai are cute, belf female models are nice, red pandas are just huggable
[19:36:19] <Vulpixbrew> but gotta have the dairy queens
[19:36:29] <Cel> can't ride a panda... they start rolling and you fall off^^
[19:39:03] <Vulpixbrew> I still find the fact they made worgens able to be druids funny, you dawg I heard you like shape shifting
[19:41:24] <Cel> we once tried to figure out what flightform each race had if they were able to be a druid... we only had silly ideas
[19:41:35] <Cel> like manaworm for bloodelves
[19:42:56] <Vulpixbrew> Goblin bear tank that is all
