[00:16:29] <cloppyhooves> I only have the one computer in my house right now :o
[00:17:07] <Giggles> I should do that with the server I have just lying around. :\

[00:18:53] <Giggles> Yeeah, I rally should. But I don't know how and it sounds like a bunch of work. :\
[00:18:57] <iamalion> I have 11 servers i am trying to find a home for

[00:19:25] <iamalion> i want to make a cluste with them, but i cannot figure out how to get them to boot from a CD as hdd
[00:19:27] <Flame> iamalion: :o rare how?
[00:19:33] <cloppyhooves> I don't have any hopes for expanding 'cause I dunno what that would do for me :o

[20:45:10] <Drago> What's weird?
[20:46:01] <Giggles> Some weirdness that happened before you were here
[20:46:33] <Giggles> Omg, I'm reading this thread about this guy who set up a neural net AI to generate Magic the Gathering cards. It's so awesome

[20:48:59] <weisey> And he forgot he left it running for like 4 years
[20:49:03] <Giggles> I think I'm actually going to set this thing up on my server. He provides instructions on hot to do it.
[20:49:05] <Drago> whoa
[20:49:26] <weisey> And each bot ended up having a half gig of data
[20:49:40] <Giggles> Holy crap
