[04:02:55] <Evelina> We had a friendly fox in illinois that looked like this https://mytraveltale.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/fox-walk.jpg
[04:03:08] <Evelina> It's name was tippy, and it was really nice, like, you could pet it and feed it and stuff
[04:03:41] <Evelina> One day she dissapeared, supposively someone in a truck came and took her when her "owner" (our neighbor) wasn't home
[04:03:57] <Wolfy> wood is very good for canines and vulpines
