[03:25:16] <weisey> looks like some external grease got into the mold
[03:25:49] <y007ghg7> still, $60 for a toy that would cost $120 normally is worth it
[03:25:58] <weisey> oh hell yeah
[03:26:01] <y007ghg7> oh, and since it was a flop take 15% off of that $60
[03:26:36] <weisey> Pisses me off when i have to scrap parts because i accidentally touch the inside of the mold and get grease on it
[03:26:53] <y007ghg7> molds of?

[05:56:19] <diny> yeah, fighting to to death is no big deal
[05:56:56] <Santa-Claws> p much yes
[05:57:00] <expatriate> it really isn't
[05:57:05] <expatriate> cause if you win, you won
[05:57:07] <expatriate> go you
[05:57:15] <expatriate> and if you die, you don't really care
[05:57:17] <expatriate> cause you're dead
[05:58:09] <diny> well, I mean sure you live, but its likely that you have been injured in the process

[06:05:23] <expatriate> does anyone have any pictures like this, https://derpicdn.net/img/2015/10/24/1008596/large.jpeg , where a cock is just barely inserted?
[06:05:23] <FineLine> [ https://derpiboo.ru/1008596 ]
[06:05:41] <expatriate> I'm drawing something similar and I need more ref
[06:07:37] <diny> hmm, I cant recall seeing any recently that would make a valid drawing reference \
[06:08:27] <diny> however, how humanistic are you drawing them? 
[06:08:57] <expatriate> horse cock on human vagina
[06:09:21] <expatriate> human-style, I should say, it's an anthro picture
[06:12:10] <diny> I cant help you with he horse part, and Im sure you have plenty of references for a nice, warm inviting vagina..... sorry, I got a little carried away
