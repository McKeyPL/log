[06:24:43] <Araiya> It's not one of the godawful ones that you would expect, though: I have a chance to take a Legendary (orange) item, feed it a bunch of Arkforge, and possibly turn it into a Supreme (the new fapfapfap weapon tier).
[06:24:46] <Vulpixbrew> (of cousre I also have been negelcting guild wars two)

[06:26:02] <Araiya> The other reroll feature that was added also takes 50 Arkforge, but this is one of those cases where I'd be happy to feed it 50 to get rid of a bonus that doesn't make sense.
