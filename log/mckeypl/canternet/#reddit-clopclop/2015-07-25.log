[11:03:03] <Squirrelly> ROFL dammit cloppy
[11:05:54] <Connor> Hi squirrelly! I'm in that land too
[11:06:54] <cloppyhooves> Hi Squirrelly c:
[11:07:50] <Giggles> So much not sleeping.
[11:07:57] <Giggles> My eyeballs hurt really bad. :3
[11:09:35] <cloppyhooves> D:
[11:11:08] <Connor> Eep...  My eve subscription expires in 3 days, think I can earn a billion isk by then? 
[11:23:14] <Squirrelly> MRW I decided to stay up to work on my paper: http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m84b5txkNh1r76lino1_250.gif
[11:23:51] <Squirrelly> I'm far more tired than i thought I'd be
[11:24:25] <Giggles> I hate when that happens, I'm sooo tired.
[11:24:53] * Connor hands the  squirrel a cup of coffee 
[11:25:04] <cloppyhooves> Can I have some snuggles? :o
[11:25:09] <Squirrelly> I honestly should just go to bed now, and work on it tomorrow
[11:25:28] * Giggles smothers Cloppyhooves in snuggles.
[11:25:32] * Connor pounces cloppyhooves 
[11:25:34] <Squirrelly> Then the highest grade I can get on it is a B
[11:25:40] * Connor snuggles all over 
[11:25:57] <Squirrelly> which, given that I have a B in the class already and just need a C to graduate, isn't bad
[11:26:12] <Connor> How close are you to done and how much do you have to do today? 
[11:26:18] <Squirrelly> I have none of it done
[11:26:32] <Squirrelly> It would have to be done by like 1 PM, so about 8 hours from now
[11:26:50] <Squirrelly> It's like a 7 page research paper, complete with MLA citations and whatnot
[11:27:24] <Squirrelly> And even then, I'd be going through hell just for a few extra points
[11:28:09] * cloppyhooves snuggles Giggles and Connor 
[11:28:12] <Squirrelly> I think I'll just go to bed and then wake up after a good night's rest, and ACTUALLY work on it. Who knows, maybe my teacher will be really awesome to me?

[23:58:30] <Flame> that's good :o

[23:59:46] <Flame> o.o
[23:59:46] <ponder> That should be "effects", unless the paper is about what starts the bullying.
