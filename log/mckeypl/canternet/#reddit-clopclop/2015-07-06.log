[04:03:35] <Giggles> Really? It's been awhile since I've Minecrafted. I hear there's been alot of updates
[04:03:57] <Lumia> Rawr~!
[04:04:04] <princesssluttershy> I don't use most of the items that have been added 
[04:04:09] <ponder> I haven't played for a while either. I stopped liking the game and just... meh
[04:04:52] <princesssluttershy> I started playing again a couple days ago
[04:05:16] <princesssluttershy> I've been having fun with it
[04:05:35] <Giggles> Yeah I've been meaning to play a little again

[07:28:17] <Quinn> so I have a steam friend
[07:28:33] <Quinn> he's 18, bright kid and fun to play games with
[07:29:03] <Quinn> and he came to me just an hour and told me he was struggling with an addiction
[07:29:12] <Quinn> it took like 20 min to convince him to tell me what it was
[07:29:26] <Quinn> poor kid is so shy he called it "a pleasure addiction"
[07:29:47] <Quinn> apparently he thought that  masturbating 1-2 times a day was an addiction
[07:30:27] <Quinn> and he was like "I lied about not looking at nsfw stuff"
[07:30:45] <Quinn> "I have a FA, DA, e621, inkbunny, and SoFurry account"
[07:30:54] <Quinn> he was sooo guilty for starting to look at yiff
[07:31:01] <Quinn> I feel really bad for him :c
[07:32:03] <Giggles> that's crazy
[07:32:06] <Quinn> he still isnt convinced that it's perfectly normal to look at yiff and he shouldn't be worried
[07:32:11] <IceFlurries> yeah...though to admit I also feel very guilty over that type of stuff too :/
[07:32:31] <IceFlurries> and to a lot of people 2-3 times a day does feel like an addiction :/
[07:32:43] <Quinn> he was saying once per day, with rare exceptions
[07:32:49] <Quinn> apparently he's only started masturbating in the past year
[07:32:57] <IceFlurries> same here though...meant...idk...sleepy sorry
[07:33:02] <IceFlurries> dang
[07:33:06] <IceFlurries> that;s...late
[07:33:06] <IceFlurries> lol
[07:33:09] <Quinn> yea
[07:33:14] <Quinn> feel bad for him :c
[07:33:50] <Quinn> but we talked about it a lot and he went to bed but he said he felt better about the whole thing
[07:33:52] <Quinn> so that's good
[07:34:13] <Giggles> yeah
[07:34:30] <Quinn> we never ever talk about anything sexual 
[07:34:37] <Quinn> so it was definitely a surprise
[07:34:51] <Quinn> he was feeling really guilty about it :c
[07:35:21] <Quinn> aside from this he's really mature for his age, so idunno
[07:36:15] <Quinn> I was a lot like him though
[07:36:23] <Quinn> but I was 21-22
[07:37:26] <IceFlurries> when you started masturbating? O_o
[07:37:29] <Quinn> oh no
[07:37:33] <Quinn> but I felt guilty about all of it
[07:37:37] <IceFlurries> ahh
[07:37:43] <Quinn> I started masturbating when I was like 11 :s
[07:38:12] <cloppyhooves> I started when I was 15 :o
[07:38:14] <IceFlurries> lol guess that's normal...for me it was around...idk...14? can't remember...possibly 16ish
[07:38:31] <Quinn> yea it always amazes me that people didnt start until high school
[07:38:42] <Quinn> I was masturbating before I knew how sex worked 
[07:38:43] <Quinn> lol
[07:38:50] <Giggles> ^
[07:38:57] <Giggles> I think 12
[07:39:07] <Giggles> Although I really don't knwo
[07:39:17] <Quinn> I didnt know what I was doing, but I knew it felt good
[07:39:57] <Quinn> like I wasnt looking at porn or thinking sexual thoughts
[07:40:05] <Quinn> I literally just did it cause it felt good lol
[07:40:30] <Giggles> yep^
[07:40:38] <Quinn> and when i did start looking at porn, I only looked at straight stuff until I was like 16
[07:40:54] <Quinn> I swear one day I woke up and realized I wasn't so straight anymore
[07:41:04] <Quinn> something just clicked
[07:41:11] <cloppyhooves> I looked at porn for like 3 years before I started masturbating >.>
[07:41:18] <Quinn> wait how does that work D:
[07:41:31] <cloppyhooves> I was just curious and googled stuff and found fchan
[07:41:38] <cloppyhooves> And I just kinda looked at it and I guess got horny?
[07:41:42] <cloppyhooves> But didn't actually doa nything with it
[07:42:25] <Quinn> weird :P
[07:42:40] <Quinn> I discovered furry porn when I was like 17
[07:43:41] <cloppyhooves> I was looking at furry porn in like 8th grade >.>
[07:43:46] <Quinn> e621 existed but I dunno if I went to it 
[07:43:50] <princesssluttershy> I started looking at porn when I was like 10 but didn't do anything with it until I was like 12 or 13
[07:44:21] <Quinn> I got into it by looking  up Redwall porn >~<
[07:45:09] <Quinn> I had a big crush on Matthias :P
[07:45:46] <Lumia> Redwall?
[07:45:56] <Quinn> the books? 
[07:45:59] <Quinn> you've never read them? D:
[07:46:20] <Lumia> Nope :/
[07:46:26] <Lumia> Should I have?
[07:46:28] <Quinn> yes

[23:09:02] <Katiepony> What's wrong with Doritos, Giggles?
[23:09:16] <Katiepony> You can't handle them?
[23:09:39] <Wolfie> it's dorito, not dontrito
[23:09:51] <Giggles> Apparently not the cheese ones. :C
[23:10:03] <Wolfie> cool american ftw
[23:10:23] <Wolfie> or /cool ranch/ as you bums say
[23:10:33] <Katiepony> We call it Cool original :3
[23:10:39] <Katiepony> Since Ranch isn't really a thing over here.
[23:10:53] <Wolfie> neither here
[23:11:02] <Wolfie> but Americans are apparently cool

[23:11:35] <weisey> RANCH
[23:11:42] <Katiepony> o:
[23:11:46] <weisey> ranch is pretty disgustinf
[23:11:52] <Katiepony> I don't even know what it is
[23:11:58] <weisey> Except on pepperoni pizza
[23:12:08] <Wolfie> same at kt
[23:12:10] <Katiepony> It's some kind of white condiment, right?
[23:12:20] <weisey> Yes
[23:12:22] <Katiepony> You put it on salads or something?
[23:12:30] <weisey> Its a salad dressing/dipping sauce
[23:12:33] <Wolfie> hillbilly jackoff
[23:12:39] <Giggles> Yeah, It comes from ranch dressing.
[23:12:41] <Katiepony> o:
[23:12:48] <Giggles> I call the doritos blue though.
[23:12:50] <weisey> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch_dressing
[23:13:00] <Giggles> Yeah, it's that shit.
[23:13:24] <Wolfie> I don't like the chilli Doritos 
[23:13:28] <Katiepony> I like all Doritos ¦3
[23:13:35] <Katiepony> Well, at least, all 3 flavors we have here.
[23:13:45] <Katiepony> Actually, we have a 4th that's lame. 'Lightly Salted'
[23:13:50] <weisey> What's your version of Lays?
[23:13:53] <Katiepony> Walkers.
[23:13:55] <weisey> Is it Walkers?
[23:13:59] <Katiepony> It's Walkers.
[23:14:12] <Wolfie> some Norwegian brand
[23:14:27] <Wolfie> has more flavour imo than lays
[23:15:20] <Katiepony> I wouldn't say Walkers is the pinnacle of flavor o:
[23:15:33] <Katiepony> It's like... the default, that all others are weighed against.
[23:15:50] <Wolfie> it's like a salt shaker jizzed on your chips
[23:16:04] <Giggles> Wow, you have 4 flavors of doritos? That's crazy
[23:16:15] <Giggles> We get 2. ._.
[23:16:21] <Katiepony> We still have salt and shake crisps :3
[23:16:42] <Katiepony> http://i.imgur.com/YH6eUcr.png
[23:16:56] <Giggles> Well they are the best ever
[23:16:57] <Wolfie> I think we have 4 aswell, chilli and bbq
[23:17:07] <Giggles> nope, we only get red and blue
[23:17:17] <Wolfie> aw
[23:17:19] <Katiepony> You don't have orange? o:
[23:17:21] <Wolfie> those are the best anyway
[23:17:42] <Giggles> No Katie, no orange.
[23:17:58] <Giggles> I wouldn't buy hili and bbq anyway so that's ok with me.
[23:18:11] <Wolfie> chilli isn't good Ono
[23:18:14] <Wolfie> imo
[23:18:28] <Katiepony> We have Cool Original, Tangy Cheese and Chili Heatwave o:
[23:18:35] <Katiepony> And then some weird flavors
[23:18:43] <Katiepony> Some bags with two flavors mixed.
[23:19:03] <Katiepony> http://i.imgur.com/1Gt1VeW.jpg Like, wtf is this shit?
[23:19:04] <Wolfie> cool american, nacho cheese, chilli and bbq
[23:19:14] <Wolfie> terribly original on the last 2
[23:19:33] <Wolfie> when two dorites collide
[23:21:12] <Giggles> Oh, I think I have seen those collisions things, but they were gone pretty fast. Just nacho cheese and cool ranch over here.

[23:22:18] <Katiepony> Now I'm hungry for crisps ._.
[23:22:20] <Giggles> Althought the back of this bag does have an ad for Doritos "Jacked" jalepeno pepperjack flavor and Doritos "Dinimita", so I guess that's a thing.
[23:23:37] <Wolfie> I should buy a bag since In gonna have a tortilla night tomorrow
