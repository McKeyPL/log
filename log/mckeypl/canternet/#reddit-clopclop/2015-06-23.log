[02:55:33] <princesssluttershy> are you new? I don't think I recognize your name?
[02:57:21] <Inuria> It's been awhile since I've been on here regularly
[02:57:25] <Inuria> 'Bout 10 months~
[02:57:49] <princesssluttershy> Oh ok ^-^
[03:00:19] <Inuria> Hehe
[03:01:19] <princesssluttershy> I'm thinking of building a new computer soon
[03:01:58] <Inuria> I thought you were working on one back then
[03:02:06] <Inuria> White NZXT Case? 
[03:02:08] <princesssluttershy> I was
[03:02:10] <princesssluttershy> yes
[03:02:35] <princesssluttershy> and I did build it

[03:02:41] <princesssluttershy> I'm using it right now
[03:02:45] <princesssluttershy> and it's pretty good
[03:02:45] <Inuria> So this is an additional rig? 
[03:02:48] <Inuria> Or upgrade?

[03:03:29] <princesssluttershy> I built this one as a cheap alternative until I had a job that I could keep to get a better rig
[03:03:47] <Inuria> Ahh okay
[03:04:04] <princesssluttershy> I'm planning on turning this one into either a dedicated streaming PC or a server
[03:04:27] <princesssluttershy> it can also be used as a spare if I have friends over
[03:04:27] <Inuria>  Oooh, What kind of server? 
[03:04:38] <princesssluttershy> TF2 or Minecraft probably
[03:05:08] <Inuria> Ahh, okay. Game server :P  
[03:05:18] <princesssluttershy> Yeah

[06:52:05] <Drago> I can't decide to RP or not. I don't really want to give the effort writing a big ass RP and I refuse to prvide half assed RP's lol
[06:52:33] <Quinn> ^ this is a dilemma I often face D:
[06:52:44] <Quinn> I wanna RP but usually it takes me like a damn hour
[06:52:45] <Vulpixbrew> +yeah......
[06:53:07] <Drago> Dunno what either of you mean, Vulpixbrew and RNGsus, but sorry to hear that if it's effecting you negatively D:

[06:55:31] <Quinn> but... it's no fun if the other person doesn't cum D:
[06:55:33] <Toxotis> I some times RP for up to 3 hours...
[06:55:39] <Drago> It doesn't
[06:56:03] <Quinn> usually I end up cumming before it ends

[06:56:10] <iam[a]lion> csgo
[06:56:13] <Drago> Yeah, 3 hours is a good RP
[06:56:30] <Vulpixbrew> Quinn it can be fun espically if you leve them in a whining squirmiong begging rto cum mess
[06:56:35] <Drago> I usually don't cum.
[06:56:48] <Drago> Rarely
[06:57:06] <Drago> Actually I don't cum during RP's anymore.
[06:57:06] <Quinn> I can cum off imagination really easily :o
[06:57:25] <plushie_pegasus> if it's a hot enough RP I can pre-cum without even touching myself
[06:57:44] <Drago> I can too. I'm just doing diferent things I dunno lol
[06:58:03] <Drago> I can't do that tho. plushie_pegasus, heh
[06:58:30] <PinkPetals> me too Quinn, lol
[06:58:56] <Toxotis> I can usually hold off till the end of the RP
[06:59:02] <Toxotis> Not always tho
[06:59:05] <Quinn> fantasy is kinda my thing~
[06:59:33] <PinkPetals> like a bored housewife and a pool cleaning guy
[06:59:36] <Quinn> and romance, just bodies doesn't do much for me anymore :/
[06:59:48] <PinkPetals> I love drama and romance :3
[06:59:52] <Quinn> sex is fun don't get me wrong
[07:00:00] <Quinn> but when it's with someone you really care about it's 10000x better
[07:00:05] <Vulpixbrew> is this the real life or is this fantasy, caught in a orgy no escape from the penises
[07:00:07] <PinkPetals> but you want everything
[07:00:07] <Quinn> and a completely different experience
[07:00:17] <Vulpixbrew> I agree Quinn
[07:01:01] <Quinn> that's what I want nowadays, my super  horny lusty days are over, I think
[07:01:27] <PinkPetals> yeah being a giggly mess all the time gets boring, then you want emotional fufillment
[07:01:32] <PinkPetals> and a connection and junk
[07:01:33] <PinkPetals> xD
[07:02:06] <Quinn> yea :P

[07:04:34] <Futashy> toooo meeeee.....
[07:05:20] <Vulpixbrew> Quinn I must be odd but I almost never enjoyed the yiffy lusty randonm sex, I look at grindr like ewww
[07:05:36] <Quinn> well
[07:05:46] <Quinn> when I was younger, I really wanted sex, and I don't think I cared where or how
[07:05:53] <Quinn> but I've calmed down a lot since then
[07:06:07] <Quinn> I've never really had random crazy sex, so I guess I'll never know though 
[07:06:41] <Quinn> I can count on 1 hand the amount of people who've ever had any kind of sexual interaction with me 
[07:06:55] <Vulpixbrew> same
[07:07:20] <Quinn> sex has kinda become a sidethought for me honestly
[07:07:25] <Quinn> I enjoy it dont get me wrong
[07:07:29] <Quinn> but I barely think about it anymore
[07:07:30] <IceFlurries> Quinn: I'm...almost in that type of stage...my body is "sexually frustrated" a lot...

[16:46:37] <mib_d3lcq4> to actually LIVE
[16:46:41] <Melon_Phone> nah mate
[16:46:48] <mib_d3lcq4> you can't just sit inside, looking at the same pixels on a screen, 24/7 
[16:46:58] <mib_d3lcq4> and expect to live productively and have a "good" life to the fullest that you could
[16:47:06] <Melon_Phone> actually, I've made it this far, haven't I? 
[16:47:15] <mib_d3lcq4> yeah, but think - couldn't it be better?
[16:47:22] <mib_d3lcq4> trust me. I was the same as you guys. 3 years ago
[16:47:30] <mib_d3lcq4> and being a "normie" is way way more fun
[16:47:38] <Melon_Phone> well I could try real horses...
[16:47:44] <Melon_Phone> I guess you're right 
[16:47:47] <mib_d3lcq4> tbh that would be better than pixels
[16:47:54] <mib_d3lcq4> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
[16:48:06] <mib_d3lcq4> idc what you're into 
[16:48:11] <mib_d3lcq4> but it can't be imagination
[16:48:16] <mib_d3lcq4> that's just kinda fucked
[16:48:17] <mib_d3lcq4> lol
[16:49:17] <Melon_Phone> sure man, you live your fantasy and I live mine
[16:49:39] <mib_d3lcq4> I just don't understand why you guys have gotten into this niche
[16:49:59] <mib_d3lcq4> there has to be some statistics around the mental sanity of this community
[16:50:26] <mib_d3lcq4> suicide rates? lgbtq rates? physical attractiveness?
[16:50:51] <mib_d3lcq4> i wanna know what turns you into someone in their room masturbating to and drawing porn based off horses in a childrens' show
[16:51:03] <Melon_Phone> what about personal preference don't you understand
[16:51:15] <mib_d3lcq4> well mostly that this isn't biologically productive at all
[16:51:25] <mib_d3lcq4> idk what overrides the instinct to find a human mate for u guys
[16:51:39] <Melon_Phone> then why did you come here? 
[16:51:43] <mib_d3lcq4> to talk
[16:51:48] <mib_d3lcq4> which.. we're doing?
[16:53:18] <mib_d3lcq4> and now we're not
[16:54:37] <Melon_Phone> I just don't like talking to you 
[16:54:40] <mib_d3lcq4> why not?
[16:56:04] <Melon_Phone> I can't explain it, like I can't explain why I find the things I find attractive attractive 
[16:56:40] <Melon_Phone> it's different for you as it is for me 
[16:56:59] <mib_d3lcq4> idk
[16:57:06] <mib_d3lcq4> call me intolerant but I don't understand it 
[16:57:21] <mib_d3lcq4> viewing from a purely instinctual and biological standpoint
[16:57:40] <mib_d3lcq4> what drives humans to be transgender, gay, or attracted to nonhuman objects or animals
[16:58:11] <mib_d3lcq4> effectively voiding any possibility of reproduction and passing on dna
[16:58:19] <mib_d3lcq4> which is the only purpose we have 
[16:58:52] <mib_d3lcq4> so I am forced to come to the conclusions: you're either a) mentally unstable, which I don't think is true or b) looking for attention
[16:59:13] <mib_d3lcq4> c) is what I think most people in the mlp/lgbtq community are
[16:59:32] <mib_d3lcq4> c) is when you start off looking for attention, but then basically lie to yourself long enough that you believe the lies
[16:59:50] <mib_d3lcq4> and your entire identity is changed to the point where you truly believe yourself gay, or liking ponies, or whatever
[17:00:15] <mib_d3lcq4> now i'm not denying that straight people are mentally messed up or looking for attention
[17:00:27] <mib_d3lcq4> but they do it in other ways: weird fetishes, being slutty, being pure, etc
[17:00:40] <mib_d3lcq4> i'm just mainly fascinated by this community and lgbtq
[17:02:05] *** Joins: JustBrowsing_ (quassel@Pony-4jfl6m.res.bhn.net)
[17:02:37] <Melon_Phone> so you're saying that sexuality, aside from heterosexuality, is attention seeking/imagination?

[17:04:06] <mib_d3lcq4> hmm
[17:04:08] <mib_d3lcq4> a bold claim
[17:04:12] <mib_d3lcq4> but I'd say, for the most part, yes
[17:04:21] <mib_d3lcq4> not denying that you can be gay biologically
[17:05:00] <mib_d3lcq4> but it's true that a large portion of gay people are not truly gay at birth and instead, through a series of events and decisions in their lives, or maybe because they were not accepted socially as straight, have made the decision to be gay
[17:05:20] <mib_d3lcq4> which I support, I don't care if you're identifying as gay or if you like MLP, really 
[17:05:44] <mib_d3lcq4> it's just so strange how it deviates from the most "logical" way of sexuality - e.g. heterosexuality
[17:06:10] <mib_d3lcq4> I'm saying that you can convince yourself to become gay, yes 
[17:07:57] <Melon_Phone> so are you saying that the love I feel for my boyfriend is attention seeking gone so far that I believe it myself? 
[17:08:11] <Melon_Phone> implying that it was attention seeking at first 
[17:08:37] <mib_d3lcq4> if it was attention seeking at first, then yeah 
[17:08:44] <Melon_Phone> which it wasn't 
[17:08:45] <mib_d3lcq4> but you could be biologically gay, that has been documented in animal populations
[17:09:16] <mib_d3lcq4> everyone has different chromosomal mutations that affect how they were born - I for one have blue eyes, a mutation 
[17:09:26] <mib_d3lcq4> you could very well be gay because of a similar mutation
[17:09:31] <mib_d3lcq4> I don't know how prevalent it is
[17:09:46] <mib_d3lcq4> it hasn't been documented very well
