[04:22:37] <Flame> You have 3 major languages in East Asia: Korean, Japanese, Chinese. Those should help you in Asia. In Europe, you mostly have English predominance, but French/German helps a lot, too. In eastern Europe, Russian gets you into most countries (including the -stans).

[09:43:01] <RNGsus> They have to pay a certain amount to own it, and dont have to have it
[09:43:15] <RNGsus> And if a meteor hits their plot they get money like a lottery

[09:51:08] <RNGsus> Meteorites? Im not sure the right word

[14:48:59] <Vulpixbew> rainy day 
[14:49:10] <Vulpixbew> good day for *sunglasses* wow
[14:51:18] <Vulpixbew> oooo two new achievements
[14:54:11] <Cel> that reminds me... I have to do the achievements... I wanna fly in dreanor
[15:00:22] <Vulpixbew> wait their flying in dreanor?
[15:06:11] <Vulpixbew> huh I have a freeredbox movie
[15:26:13] <Cel> to fly you need to get a bunch of achievements... possible since the last patch... eg. collect 100 treasures... complete 12 apexis dailies
[15:26:44] <Cel> the reputation ones are as always most annoying... should take about 2-3 weeks of daily grind
[15:41:52] <Vulpixbew> well crap http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14881728845
[15:41:53] <CompuBot> [ Alizabal - Baradin Hold - not stat squished - Forums - World of Warcraft ]
[15:50:42] <Cel> really? I remember going in, but I don't know what happend after
[15:51:30] <Vulpixbew> she is the same as dshe was in cata
[15:51:35] <Vulpixbew> ard to beat
[15:51:40] <Vulpixbew> doable solo but damn
[15:53:19] <Cel> gotta try that next time I log in... I can't do most of the MoP raids, but everything else I remeber clearing
[15:53:34] * Connor nibbles 
[15:55:21] <Cel> except blackwing descent... undead onyxia got me... but I tried that only once, since there's nothing I want^^
[15:56:02] <Vulpixbew> heading there now
[15:56:38] <Cel> the reason I went there was the hydra boss... I got it as pet now^^
[15:58:52] <Vulpixbew> that raid unlocks tomorrow though http://i.imgur.com/OCTonlQ.jpg
[16:00:41] <Cel> your bags are misaligned^^
[16:02:45] <Vulpixbew> Its the addon I uyse
[16:03:41] <Vulpixbew> bartender
[16:04:05] <Cel> I remember that... haven't used it since wotlk
[16:04:43] <Cel> I have massive amounts of addons installed... none of them for the action bar... in the past... only action bar^^
[16:06:15] <Vulpixbew> ooo thats right cant soloblack ring
[16:06:39] <Cel> ?
[16:06:49] <Vulpixbew> blackwing*
[16:06:56] <Vulpixbew> the first part of the eggs
[16:07:09] * Cel thinks hard
[16:07:12] <Cel> eggs?
[16:07:25] <Cel> oh razorgore?
[16:08:43] <Cel> but why? I did it with my pally and she's severely underequipped (I wanted the T2 stuff)... just throw the healing hammer every once in a while on the raz
[16:09:38] * Vulpixbew shrugs
[16:09:45] <Vulpixbew> Ill try it in a bit
[16:09:57] <Vulpixbew> right now I want descent and not lair
[16:11:17] <Cel> in descent the thing with the gong annoyed me^^ the dwarfs
[16:11:43] <Cel> or after the dwarfs? can't remember
[16:12:25] <Vulpixbew> all i remmeber is last time I did it was prestat squish and two pallies one ret one prot cleared it
[16:12:36] <Vulpixbew> level 90 with raid gear
[16:17:38] <Vulpixbew> wait why is this on tem man
[16:19:55] <Cel> I usually go 10... 25 just to prove I can do it^^
[16:20:34] <Vulpixbew> 25 just cause loot is better
[16:22:11] <Cel> isn't the loot the same? the amount was different, but they changed that for legacy
[16:23:42] <Vulpixbew> more of it
[16:23:51] <Cel> was
[16:24:26] <Cel> I didn't go anywhere but firelands in recent history, but I got the same amount of stuff and gold no matter what size
[16:25:25] <Cel> (go 25 with my hunter because it's too easy on 10, but 10 with every other char)
[16:25:53] <Vulpixbew> wiith the amount of dragons im fighting I wish my skinner was higher
[16:26:21] <Cel> :D yea that'S always great
[16:26:42] <Cel> when skinning a boss I sometimes say "you gonna be boots now"
[16:26:56] <Cel> but I sell to NPC... because lazy
[16:30:06] <Vulpixbew> aye I could get this boss if he didnt dso air launches
[16:30:45] * Cel thinks
[16:30:54] <Vulpixbew> ojh well drop it to ten
[16:31:04] <Cel> me no remember who does that^^
[16:31:22] <Vulpixbew> maloriak
[16:31:39] <Vulpixbew> below 25% health jhard to migrate fall damage
[16:33:32] <Cel> oh
[16:40:56] <Vulpixbew> well thats descent on cooldown
[16:41:20] <Cel> what a decent cooldown
[16:41:57] <Vulpixbew> 14208 g

[16:45:41] <Vulpixbew> the sad thing if I can make it in a week
[16:45:57] <Vulpixbew> think about a month Ill never have to pay for wow again
[16:47:18] <Vulpixbew> espically if I get my dk and druid up to max level
[16:47:37] <Cel> that should be no problem... the question is if it's worth it
[16:47:50] * Vulpixbew shrugs
[16:47:54] <Cel> if you go into those raids anyways, yes
[16:48:00] <Cel> but just for gold... meh
[16:48:16] <Vulpixbew> I know theres people on eve who spend part of the month mining to buy the game token
[16:48:34] <Vulpixbew> a lot of transmogs and mounts
[16:48:39] <Cel> I have 62k in my pocket and another 80k in the guildbank... but I still don't want to buy a token
[16:49:55] <Vulpixbew> grrr wintergrasp just started
[16:50:27] <Cel> I still don't know if this is good or bad for you^^
[16:51:30] <Vulpixbew> considering it closes off the raid 
[16:52:15] <Cel> I'm on a server with only 2% representation of the horde... guess how great that works
[16:52:26] <Cel> it's a bit better since the crossover thingy... but not enough
[16:52:42] <Vulpixbew> and I just set the market on frostweave
[16:53:02] <Cel> someone call the government!
[16:55:20] <Vulpixbew> I talked to Vol'jin he was cool with it
[16:56:20] <Cel> I pledge allegiance only to my queen

[17:08:26] <Connor> I have a level 85 but I never really did anything past the missions for 85
[17:08:44] <Cel> I never tried, but I think you just have to add -servername to the charname in the mail... try sending a silver or something^^
