[05:27:28] <Wolfie> but they just need hay right? 
[05:27:45] <Wolfie> plenty of gay hay outside
[05:28:44] <plushie_pegasus> LOL I wish they ate hay
[05:29:11] <plushie_pegasus> They do eat apples tho
[05:29:38] <Wolfie> and they're like 3 bits a basket right? 
[05:29:46] <Wolfie> or has the price gone up? 
[05:31:14] <plushie_pegasus> I wonder what the conversion rate is from USD to bits?
[05:31:22] <Wolfie> hmm
[05:31:37] <Wolfie> wasn't a tankard of cider 5 bits? 
[05:31:47] <plushie_pegasus> I think so 
[05:31:48] <Wolfie> from the cider squeezy episode? 
[05:32:11] <plushie_pegasus> ..To the internet BRB 
[05:32:32] <Wolfie> how much is a glass of beverage at country faires? 
[05:32:51] <expatriate> varies wildly
[05:33:06] <expatriate> anywhere from $2-$10
[05:33:34] <plushie_pegasus> 4 Bits = $2.00 Nets you a bushel of apples (40-42 apples)
[05:33:34] <plushie_pegasus> 1 Bit = $0.50 cents Nets you 10-10.5 apples
[05:33:34] <plushie_pegasus> 0.08-0.10 Bits =  $0.04 7/10 - $0.05  Gets you a single apple

[05:34:09] <Wolfie> well he was a sellout wasn't he? 
[05:34:25] <plushie_pegasus> lol
[05:34:26] <Wolfie> so he priced everything sky high compared to normal price 
[05:34:37] <expatriate> no no, at the beginning
[05:34:43] <expatriate> when Fluttershy was shopping
[05:34:54] <expatriate> she got charged like 5 bits for a carrot or some shit
[05:35:12] <expatriate> and of course, when Spike took care of the pets he was paying everyone in gems
[05:35:23] <Wolfie> oh yeah
[05:35:25] <expatriate> so currency is kinda just fucked in equestria
[05:35:31] <Wolfie> according to that 
[05:35:40] <Wolfie> a carrot is 2.5$ 
[05:35:46] <Wolfie> which is...
[05:35:53] <expatriate> maybe they're bitcoins, so the price has enormous fluctuations
[05:36:05] <Wolfie> that makes more sense
[05:37:09] <Wolfie> that means doge should be there somewhere

[12:06:13] <Katiepony> On an unrelated note, I was playing GTA V online a couple of days ago
[12:06:21] <Katiepony> And people in the chat were calling each other noobs
[12:06:25] <Katiepony> unironically
[12:06:30] <Katiepony> I'm amazed people still say that word o:
[12:06:37] <Vulpixbrew> noobs
[12:06:41] <Katiepony> I stopped being offended by that like 12 years ago.
[12:07:00] <Serene_Flow> I thought scrub replaced the word noob.
[12:07:17] <Vulpixbrew> I've been talking to a guiuld called show me your noobs about hitting raids
[12:07:21] <Katiepony> Apparently some people didn't get the memo
[12:07:42] <Katiepony> Are you raiding yet, Vulpy?
[12:08:18] <Vulpixbrew> yes, mostly lfr to start to learn the fights but I have a coupkle of normal tiered gear peices
[12:08:40] <Katiepony> For HFC?
[12:08:47] <Vulpixbrew> eeyup
[12:08:55] <Katiepony> Are you still tanking? :3
[12:09:02] <cloppyhooves> Before I go to bed, I need someoen to talk to for a bit :o
[12:09:11] <Katiepony> Talk at Katie
[12:09:17] <Katiepony> Talk at her ears :3
[12:09:35] <Serene_Flow> I'm willing to listen as well.
[12:09:46] <Vulpixbrew> mix of tanking/DPSing
[12:11:11] <Katiepony> Still paladin, right? :3
[12:12:44] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[12:13:02] <Katiepony> Are you managing to get into any normal raids through the group finder?
[12:13:07] <Vulpixbrew> finally getting the rotation down trying to learn a fury warriors roattion
[12:13:31] <Vulpixbrew> sadly no the raids I got into I know the peeps running them
[12:14:43] <Cel> I haven't set foot into a raid (except solo) since wotlk... which was also the last time I had a real guild^^
[12:16:36] <Vulpixbrew> this is the first expansion since wrath I've given a crap about raiding
[12:17:16] <Katiepony> The raids are the best thing about this expansion.
[12:17:22] <Katiepony> Which isn't saying much, I guess. But they're good.
[12:17:51] <Vulpixbrew> I recernlt discovered I can solo Panda dungoens
[12:18:05] <Vulpixbrew> I had forgoteen how much fun the brewery is
[12:18:12] <Cel> I would go, but I can't without people I can trust... I'm too much of an elitist... I don't expect perfect runs, but I can't handle randoms^^
[12:18:59] <Cel> I want to do the panda raids... but some of the mechanics are just arse^^
[12:19:02] <Vulpixbrew> I expect to wipe a couple of times
[12:19:20] <Vulpixbrew> arse mechanics?
[12:19:47] <Cel> like the dogs you have to keep seperate or you can't kill them
[12:20:00] <Cel> there are 4... I can keep 3 seperate
[12:20:16] <Vulpixbrew> anything lkike deathwings Ima throw the whole raid off cause one idiot was standing in the wrong spot?
[12:20:46] <Cel> nah that'S no problem.. since it only hits the wrong one when everyone else notices he'll roll
[12:22:58] <Vulpixbrew> at least it's not my old guild
[12:23:06] <Cel> or the first boss in the orgrimmar raid... the elemental... you have to kill 100 slimes before he goes berserk... which is easy with 2-3 people... but solo... meh
[12:23:16] <Katiepony> Spine of Deathwing is super annoying to solo :P
[12:23:26] <Vulpixbrew> its easy to solo
[12:23:32] <Katiepony> I mean, it's not exactly difficult, but you have to keep running side to side.
[12:23:39] <Cel> :D
[12:23:46] <Vulpixbrew> fust run back and forth listening to DBM going beware every 2 seconds
[12:24:19] <Katiepony> Pretty much :P
[12:25:10] <Vulpixbrew> no check this my old guild never beat ICC due to the lich king fight due to people not wanting to listen about the mechinacs of the fight (wel that and the girls kept wanting to be on thier on vent channel mid fight)
[12:25:38] <Cel> uuh... those people would be raidblocked for a month^^
[12:25:53] <Cel> you drop your keyboard and pull a boss... kick and replace
[12:26:37] <Cel> we did have fun, but no tolerance for stupid
[12:26:40] <Katiepony> Only thing I'm dissapointed about is the 20 person Mythic requirement. Our guild is pretty much like 15 people.
[12:27:33] <Vulpixbrew> Raidbliocked nothing I raged kicked them from guild and blocked them completely on wow
[12:27:51] <Cel> we had 155 in our best day... I was raidleader for the second string... then bc came out and we split into 6 guilds >.< 
[12:28:06] <Vulpixbrew> 7 level 85's should have cleared Lich King easy
[12:29:17] <Vulpixbrew> (the main reason I raged was the excuse of why they werent in the vent channel and I quote Because you all were not letting us have a convvo with your game talk)
[12:29:49] <Cel> 7 85s?... yea... we did it with 7 80s^^... on purpose... it was either that or skip the raid for the week^^
[12:30:53] <Cel> 10man of course... I wish we could have done 25 with 7^^
[12:30:59] <Vulpixbrew> well that and tank wanted to run in when he was doing the blizzard thing
[12:31:19] <Vulpixbrew> 25? I clear 25 heroic solo now
[12:31:38] <Cel> yea not at 85^^
[12:33:05] <Cel> at 100 everything below cata is afk... I mean the airship in 25 hero drops before the fight starts^^ that really doesn't count anymore^^
[12:35:04] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[12:35:30] <Cel> also... I always forget to loot the chest for the airship battle
[12:35:37] <Cel> I think I only picked it up once
[12:35:38] <Vulpixbrew> cata 10 mans are cake walks
[12:36:42] <Cel> 10man is fun when you want to be fast and get reasonable money... 10sec per boss and a little bit of trash in between... 800-1k in less then 5min
[12:37:23] <Cel> druid is great for that... activate starfall and run everywhere
[12:38:38] <Katiepony> Don't cata 25s offer way more gold per boss? o:
[12:38:54] <Cel> a bit... but it takes more time
[12:39:08] <Cel> I can just do 5 10s and gain much more^^
[12:39:25] <Katiepony> The only thing I can't do on all my basic geared alts is Ultraxion, I think.
[12:39:34] <Katiepony> Can't meet the dps timer with my shitty gear, on them.
[12:39:34] <Cel> I have 11 90+ chars... soooo
[12:40:46] <Vulpixbrew> aye I can't hit him is 25
[12:41:17] <Katiepony> I can manage on my main, but the others don't come close.
[12:41:20] <Cel> ultraxion was... deathwing boss on the tower?
[12:41:28] <Katiepony> The purple dragon, yes.
[12:41:51] <Cel> oh ok... I never tried that with anything but my main
[12:42:08] <Cel> too much running around for nothing... I mostly go firelands
[12:43:55] <Vulpixbrew> Im trying to get handmainden to drop and Ultraxion drps a rare mount
[12:45:11] <Cel> I just wanted the handmaiden, since then I've never again been there^^
[12:45:21] <Cel> that's probably also the reason I go firelands... I still need both mounts
[12:45:25] <Katiepony> I got that last week.
[12:45:37] <Katiepony> The Handmaiden, that is.
[12:45:46] <Katiepony> Got the mount from Alysrazor the week before.
[12:45:54] <Katiepony> Or maybe 2 weeks ago.
[12:46:09] <Cel> yay^^
[12:46:27] <Vulpixbrew> last week i ground out the nether rays
[12:46:30] <Cel> I kinda want ANY mount drop... my last one was half a year ago... but then again, I don't really try anymore
[12:46:56] <Katiepony> I just hit my 200 mount achievement on wednesday :3
[12:47:01] <Vulpixbrew> my last drop was ashes
[12:47:02] <Cel> I have 6 different netherdrakes
[12:47:28] <Cel> or 5
[12:47:40] <Katiepony> There are 6 netherdrakes from the vendor.
[12:47:45] <Vulpixbrew> 119 atm Katiepony
[12:47:50] <Cel> yea then I have 5
[12:48:04] <Cel> I quested to exalted one time less then there are dragons
[12:48:15] <Katiepony> I remember seeing people with the 250 mount firehawk, the patch before WoD released
[12:48:23] <Vulpixbrew> in all reality I have 136
[12:48:30] <Katiepony> I don't understand how x.x
[12:48:36] <Katiepony> Unless they have all the store mount
[12:48:38] <Katiepony> mounts*
[12:48:42] <Vulpixbrew> working on the argent stuff now though
[12:48:46] <Katiepony> Which shouldn't count towards the achievement imo.
[12:49:01] <Cel> I don't even know how many I have... since I want them for vanity... maybe I should buy out every faction mount^^
[12:49:10] <Vulpixbrew> tears of noobs is what we called the celestial steed
[12:49:36] <Cel> "that retarded horse" (sorry cloppy, but that's how it's called)^^
[12:49:47] <Cel> TRH has arrived
[12:50:28] <Katiepony> I have the celestial steed ._.
[12:50:42] <Katiepony> It came out a day or two before my birthday, husbandhorse bought it for me
[12:50:52] <Katiepony> Then I logged in to see literally everyone had it
[12:50:58] <Katiepony> And suddenly it didn't look so pretty.
[12:50:59] <Vulpixbrew> you have 200+ mounts so you are fine
[12:51:06] <Cel> :D
[12:51:25] <Katiepony> I believe I have every single BC mount
[12:51:30] <Vulpixbrew> I still need to get vail of sands
[12:51:34] <Katiepony> Excluding TCG ones
[12:51:46] <Cel> I pretend to be a collector when I ride my lion
[12:51:54] <Cel> "what you paid for a mount?"
[12:51:59] <Cel> "yea, I'm a collector"
[12:52:30] <Cel> I always wanted the friggin love rocket
[12:52:36] <Vulpixbrew> I have the ImperialQuilen for the Mop Collector edition never used it once
[12:52:39] <Katiepony> That's BoE right?
[12:52:46] <Katiepony> The love rocket
[12:53:16] <Cel> hmm... I don't know
[12:53:23] <Vulpixbrew> I still want headless horseman to drop his mount
[12:53:38] <Katiepony> Man, I finally got that after 3 years of doing it on 5 characters.
[12:53:39] <Cel> the quilen is not attraktive
[12:54:11] <Cel> I haven't fought the horseman since vanilla
[12:54:31] <Cel> I chose not to take part in world events^^
[12:54:48] <Katiepony> It's just a dungeon queue o:
[12:55:13] <Cel> that's the problem^^
[12:56:09] <Vulpixbrew> Im missing brew of the year by four brews and disturbing the piece for brewfest t. Hallo9ws end is completely done
[12:56:17] <Cel> I watched a friend do it once... that thing is so easy and still the blatant incompetence shines above all randoms... I know not all are that bad, but I'm just lucky to only get those
[12:56:47] <Katiepony> I don't think it's even possible to fail it.
[12:57:22] <Cel> it isn't... but people still complain during the whole fight
[12:57:29] <Vulpixbrew> it 's
[12:57:29] <Katiepony> I refuse to buy the two engineering mounts that can drop from Blingtron, in the hopes I get it one day for free :P
[12:57:53] <Cel> I built the golem
[12:58:05] <cloppyhooves> Good night, you sexy ponies!
[12:58:07] <Cel> but I'm not interested in the world spinner thingy
[12:58:08] <Katiepony> I have the golem, but not getting the other two
[12:58:11] <Katiepony> Night cloppy :3
[12:58:16] <Cel> gn8
[12:58:53] <Serene_Flow> Laters Cloppy.
[13:01:28] <Vulpixbrew> I still need the golem world spinner and chopper
[13:01:37] <Vulpixbrew> also this level 1 mount
[13:01:50] <Vulpixbrew> made me kind rage first time I saw it
[13:01:50] <Cel> I went into ashran yesterday... showing of my old main char... silly me forgot that she's on a server full of grand marshals... nothing to show of as mere marshal^^
[13:02:16] <Cel> the chauffeur thingy is great^^
[13:02:55] <Vulpixbrew> 35 heirlooms needed
[13:03:03] <Vulpixbrew> I have 21
[13:03:04] <Cel> I just bought all of them^^
[13:03:33] <Vulpixbrew> oooo I just started the Argent Tourney stuff
[13:03:49] <Cel> now every char that is not 100 wears heirloom
[13:05:41] <Cel> when I logged in on my old main she still had the lance equipped... easy guess what she did when I stopped playing^^
[13:07:40] <Vulpixbrew> nice
[13:08:35] <Vulpixbrew> I still in all my wow career havent gotten Hrids Piltons Sack
[13:09:00] <Cel> I'm opposed to buying that... but I considered many times^^
[13:09:16] <Vulpixbrew> its what 1.2k fir the achievement?
[13:09:18] <Katiepony> I remember it being stupidly expensive. But, I was probably poor back then.
[13:09:52] <Cel> I don't mind spending money... but I mind spending money for... that^^
[13:10:15] <Vulpixbrew> consideirng all my current bags come from raids
[13:10:29] <Cel> my bank char hat 2x the 100g ring... with level 60^^
[13:10:35] <Cel> had*
[13:10:54] <Vulpixbrew> Sun touched satchel Pitlords, Onxyia Backpack and Dragon Hidebag
[13:11:30] <Katiepony> The hexweave bags are pretty cheap
[13:11:31] <Cel> I tailored most of them... many bags per expansion... most were 18s till mop
[13:12:05] <Katiepony> Well, on my server it's cheap, but mine has a super high pop.
[13:12:26] <Cel> I haven'T checked... making one takes time... I have 2 so far
[13:12:44] <Vulpixbrew> My serevers AH is so fubared
[13:12:51] <Katiepony> I think they're under 2k each on the AH so I just bought enough to fill all my bank and bags.
[13:12:59] <Vulpixbrew> cloth is stupid expensive one week stupiod cheap the next
[13:13:28] <Cel> I rarely buy in the ah, it's a place where I dump overstock^^
[13:13:55] <Vulpixbrew> I just sell things in trade
[13:14:07] <Katiepony> I buy everything on the AH, don't see the point in wasting time gathering stuff myself.
[13:14:54] <Cel> no gathering has been done since wotlk... it's just regular income while doing stuff... I stop when I see something on my path
[13:14:59] <Vulpixbrew> OMG YES
[13:15:17] <Vulpixbrew> South Wind drake just dropped
[13:15:23] * Cel cheers
[13:15:27] <Katiepony> Which is that? o:
[13:15:37] <Cel> one of the crystal things... the yellow one?
[13:15:37] <Vulpixbrew> 10 man herioc throne of the four winds
[13:15:45] <Katiepony> Oh nice :3
[13:15:48] <Katiepony> I don't have that yet
[13:15:57] <Katiepony> I always forget to do that dungeon
[13:16:04] <Katiepony> raid, rather
[13:16:33] <Vulpixbrew> it's easy to forget no one wants to go to uldum
[13:16:51] <Vulpixbrew> I spent way to much time there trying to get sands of time drake
[13:16:58] <Cel> uldum is a big pile of nothing... but I like the harrison jones questline
[13:17:00] <Vulpixbrew> freaking recipe
[13:18:41] <Cel> the only archeology mount I have is the bone raptor
[13:19:35] <Vulpixbrew> it matches my gear set C: http://i.imgur.com/3AhhXBU.jpg
[13:19:50] <Cel> :D
[13:20:45] <Cel> the fire hippogryph matches my paladin's equip... everything fire on her... everything else is just headcanon... doesn't make sense without backstory
[13:21:12] <Cel> my priest rides a frostwyrm while being diszipline
[13:21:25] * Vulpixbrew knows a few hunters hes wanted to make on fire
[13:21:51] <Vulpixbrew> turn blitting growl of you pet 
[13:22:18] <Cel> always keep growl on... makes tanks pay attention

[13:22:50] <Cel> I left it on in MC during trash bashing... it had a personal healer^^
[13:23:23] <Cel> once even two... the head of druids and the vice priest... they thought it was funny^^
[13:24:52] <Vulpixbrew> I miss WOtlk
[13:25:09] <Vulpixbrew> Shadow priest cloud outheal holy and unholy DKs could tank
[13:26:16] <Cel> we went with a new tank botanica and he just was too slow, so I pulled an let my pet tank... he complained and stopped tanking... whe just moved forward (our healer was already T6)
[13:26:40] <Cel> result... he failed his application
[13:27:25] <Vulpixbrew> other day running through bc raids had a dk hunter my bear druid and a shammy eals all in full heirlooms we were pulling half the dungoen at once
[13:27:36] <Vulpixbrew> ran together from 60 to 66
[13:27:58] <Vulpixbrew> hell I realIded him as a friend
[13:28:01] <Vulpixbrew> the healer
[13:28:43] <Cel> that how it should go... sadly it usually doesn't
[13:29:28] <Vulpixbrew> dk had to poof and hunter went to sleep everyone else who got in with us started complaining
[13:29:37] <Vulpixbrew> and m like naw this healer is epic
[13:29:42] <Cel> ^^
[13:30:19] <Cel> I once met a tank was too good for... everything... bear... he soloed (almost) shattered halls
[13:30:43] <Cel> I healed a little bit (as shadow)
[13:31:42] <Cel> rest of the group entered the dungeon and complained that half of the bosses are already down
[13:32:00] <Cel> we just walked out and resetted^^
[13:33:05] <Vulpixbrew> I have a love hate realionship with grimrail
[13:33:31] <Cel> never did it^^
[13:34:12] <Vulpixbrew> First boss can be tricky and need to kill goblins first on mobs
[13:34:27] <Vulpixbrew> or at least keep interrrupts flowing
[13:34:39] <Vulpixbrew> other then that the cutscenes are awesome
[13:38:19] <Cel> I like almost all cutscenes in that game... wrathgate was my favorite since I pledged allegiance to the forsaken only (in headcanon)
[13:40:01] <Cel> "did you think we had forgotten? did you think we had forgiven? behold now, the terrible vengence of the forsaken!... death to the scourge and death to the living!"
[13:42:51] <Katiepony> Forsaken is the only playable faction I care about.
[13:42:59] <Katiepony> I don't really like their models much, thoug
[13:43:02] <Katiepony> though*
[13:43:15] <Katiepony> Sylvanas is my fave tho :3
[13:43:16] <Cel> true
[13:43:20] <Cel> also true
[13:43:59] <Vulpixbrew> Lady Sylvanas is my Waifu
[13:44:12] * Cel waves fist
[13:44:28] <Katiepony> Sylvanas is everyone's waifu
[13:44:33] <Cel> :D
[13:44:48] <Katiepony> I play on Sylvanas-EU :3
[13:44:49] <Cel> and that's why you don't see her anymore
[13:45:17] <Cel> I play on antonidas-EU, but that wasn't my choice^^
[13:45:22] <Katiepony> She pays the upkeep on that server
[13:45:29] <Katiepony> She's probably mad that it's 70% alliance.
[13:45:35] <Vulpixbrew> Shu-halo NA
[13:45:39] <Cel> antonidas does nothing... at all
[13:45:49] <Katiepony> More humans on our realm than horde combined.
[13:45:53] <Cel> 100 horde vs 12000 alliance on the server
[13:46:13] <Cel> well
[13:47:02] <Vulpixbrew> horde to alliance ratio is decent here just no one can bg worht a damn
[13:47:17] <Vulpixbrew> reason i didnt get my cloak was the pvp portion
[13:47:21] <Cel> alliance always complains how bad they are... still they always win
[13:47:29] <Cel> how bad are we then >.<
[13:48:10] <Cel> (I play alliance on alextraza-EU, which is in the same battlegroup)
[13:48:31] <Vulpixbrew> did basin the other day my rogue led the charge on farm, stables twice, mill, had the highest HKs and KBs and we still lost
[13:49:34] <Cel> arathi is my home... I spent 20h/day in that thing during my grind to marshal back in 2005
[13:49:51] <Cel> I can't do it today, because everyone just fucks up with every step
[13:50:14] <Vulpixbrew> warsonmg was it for me
[13:50:47] <Cel> we couldn't do warsong... we hat 15 regulars
[13:50:53] <Katiepony> I don't really pvp.
[13:51:24] <Vulpixbrew> of course I had a claim to fame in it playing a Holy pallie Dk with 4 levels on me kept pulling me and dropping every time he did
[13:52:25] <Cel> I ranked up from nothing to officer rank in one week because I joined a group with 2 rank 13, 2 12 and 4 11
[13:52:55] <Cel> :D
[13:53:33] <Vulpixbrew> nice
[13:53:44] <Vulpixbrew> Katiepony I'm just getting back into it
[13:53:48] <Cel> sometimes winning was default... enemy saw rank 13... left bg
[13:55:32] <Vulpixbrew> I had a friend who wrote a macro to scream mary had a little lamb that brought an alterac to a stop with hrodies just dying laughin
[13:55:59] <Cel> that's an option^^
[13:56:28] <Cel> I miss the 11 hour alteracs we had every day... ashran is just not right
[13:57:29] <Cel> ashran is too much movement for nothing... the events should happen on the main road, not somewhere far out so everyone can just run around it
[13:57:59] <Vulpixbrew> I have still yet to successfully to an eye or winterhold
[13:58:07] <Vulpixbrew> wintergrasp*
[13:58:21] <Cel> eye?
[13:58:38] <Vulpixbrew> Eye of the Storm
[13:58:50] * Cel thinks
[13:59:10] <Cel> oh the bg with the thing in the middle?
[13:59:27] <Cel> I don't like that... everyone running circles

[14:22:22] <Vulpixbrew> anyone esle remmeber weapon skill level?
[14:22:27] <Cel> I may have lured a friend back into playing wow again... I told him he can play for free if he manages to make 50k in a month... he said he'll make 100k and pay mine if I get him to 100 in one weekend... (which is a joke since he already is 90)
[14:22:32] <Cel> of course^^
[14:22:55] <Vulpixbrew> and the fact that you had and achievement if you got unarmed axed
[14:22:57] <Cel> hitting rabbits with a two-hander and missing, was great
[14:23:02] <Vulpixbrew> I was running dungoen with my fist
[14:23:16] <Frosty> I used to play, but I didn't have any friends to play with so I got bored and stopped playing.
[14:24:36] <Cel> if you're not like me, you can easily make new friends... I watch people making friends all the time^^
[14:25:22] <Vulpixbrew> how to make friends on wow, be good at tyour class, be super friendly,
[14:25:36] <Vulpixbrew> which I normally am
[14:25:55] <Cel> see I fail at point 2 and brag about point 1^^
[14:26:06] <Frosty> Oh, I mean like IRL friends. I don't really care about internet friends that much. Too impersonal. It's rare I find one I really connect with.
[14:26:16] <Vulpixbrew> except to beggers, oh hey Im 95 can someone give me 1000 gold
[14:26:49] <Cel> someone asked me for 1g23s to pay his transit at the flightmaster... I gave him 100^^
[14:28:10] <Cel> he sent me a gift wrapped rose^^
[14:29:34] <Vulpixbrew> see Im the type of person who calls out in trade anyone need x pet or thermal anvils or netherweave cloth and just send it to them withn a message saying happy/merry whatever

[14:36:33] <Cel> :D
[14:38:00] <Cel> soon I'll go back to ashran... maybe... just maybe people won't run away from fights... or run into fights one after another
[14:39:00] <Vulpixbrew> so basicaly depending on people not being idios
[14:39:29] <Cel> as always
[14:40:02] <Cel> I'm a healer, I can't do anything alone... but I also can't heal someone who runs solo into 10
[14:40:14] <Vulpixbrew> ^this
[14:40:22] <Vulpixbrew> and then they yellheals suck
[14:40:30] <Cel> they do
[14:41:04] <Cel> except yesterday... everyone complained about not being able to kill anything... well at least that's not my problem^^
[14:41:45] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[14:42:42] <Vulpixbrew> Is it bad im hoping we dont get anymore levels
[14:42:54] <Vulpixbrew> just newxt xpac we get better gear
[14:43:03] <Vulpixbrew> more content and raids
[14:43:04] <Cel> I hope so too, it's completely unnecessary
[14:43:49] <Cel> just think about the way you gain flying... do it like that, put story behind it, and people will do it... no more level necessary
[14:44:08] <Vulpixbrew> people will complain though my levels
[14:44:21] <Vulpixbrew> I wanna solo SOO heroic

[14:44:58] <Cel> that too
[14:45:08] <Cel> I don't have any space left on my hunter
[14:45:13] <Cel> my druid is almost empty
[14:45:19] <Cel> (in comparison)
[14:45:28] <Vulpixbrew> fury warrior rotation is complacated as it is
[14:45:47] <Cel> never tried... I'm always def or weapon^^
[14:46:07] <Vulpixbrew> I just want to carry two hellreavers on my back
[14:46:29] <Cel> I would, too... but it goes against the lore of my char^^
[14:47:14] <Cel> it also pains me all the time my rogue has to equip an axe just because I don't have a better dagger
[14:47:57] <Cel> hunter was awful for a very long time... she needs a gun... best weapons were... not guns
[14:48:09] <Cel> then transmog came along... good, very good
[14:48:29] <Vulpixbrew> and then my void storage filled up instantly
[14:48:34] <Cel> yes
[14:48:43] <Vulpixbrew> give us 3 more tabs of it please bblizzard
[14:49:02] <Cel> I was able to sell half after they removed one weapon set
[14:49:08] <Cel> yea
[14:49:42] <Cel> but I kinda want to equip a close combat weapon to my hunter even if I don't need it
[14:49:48] <Vulpixbrew> I have 4 tiered sets a bunch of weapons, a lot of shields
[14:50:03] <Rylee> hi

[15:07:49] <Cel> I miss raid nights^^
[15:10:31] <Katiepony> It's mostly just 'cause my guild is all my best friends from high school.
[15:10:46] <Katiepony> Raids are an excuse for us to schedule time together

[15:17:47] <Katiepony> Flame Corgi is totes adorbs
[15:18:03] <Cel> flame corgi + fel pup + pug
[15:18:04] <Katiepony> I have a snail called Sticky Fingers.
[15:18:05] <Cel> best team^^
[15:18:56] <Vulpixbrew> I have onyxian welping and Mr Chiuklly which were anniversy pets
[15:19:10] <Katiepony> I have the penguin I think
[15:19:33] <Vulpixbrew> I ahve everything out of Naxx
[15:19:36] <Cel> I have all the murlocs (except the first two)
[15:19:54] <Vulpixbrew> I wnat the space marine one so badly
[15:20:11] <Katiepony> I really don't like that promotional and premium mounts and pets count towards achievements :c
[15:20:17] <Cel> that one, thor and the mini fel reaver are my main pvp team^^
[15:20:26] <Vulpixbrew> Lil Bad Wolf out of Kar
[15:20:45] <Cel> i have that three times... I just want that damn rifle
[15:21:00] <Vulpixbrew> Ive seen thatrifle so many times
[15:21:07] <Cel> not even once T_T
[15:21:17] <Cel> and I only need it once >.<
[15:21:39] <Katiepony> I stopped doing karazhan after I got the fiery warhorse 
[15:21:47] * Vulpixbrew falls over
[15:21:54] <Vulpixbrew> I cant get that to drop
[15:21:58] <Vulpixbrew> speaking of which
[15:22:17] <Cel> I don't want that thing... just the rifle... I'd trade that horse if it were possible^^
[15:22:25] <Vulpixbrew> I got two toons to run that real quick
[15:22:33] <Katiepony> What's so special about the rifle? o:
[15:22:37] <Katiepony> Hunter transmog/
[15:22:51] <Cel> yea
[15:23:08] <Katiepony> Ah
[15:23:31] <Cel> no other gun even comes close to that design
[15:24:20] <Cel> there are other guns I like... like the gorian gun, which looks like an axe... but I would definitely use the worghunter
[15:25:32] <Cel> has anyone seen a black quirai mount (recently)?
[15:25:53] <Cel> I think everyone who has one already stopped playing
[15:26:52] <Vulpixbrew> wait wasnt that the one with the stupidd bell thing that  lot of people got screwed over with
[15:26:56] <Katiepony> Didn't people get them when they opened new servers?
[15:26:58] <Katiepony> Before cata
[15:27:09] <Cel> yea
[15:27:15] <Cel> one per server
[15:27:33] <Cel> mal'ganis had two, because GM couldn't decide who hit the bell first
[15:27:43] <Katiepony> Was it actually one per server? I heard once the quest was completed, people could still hand it in for up to an hour
[15:28:14] <Cel> the amount of work for one scepter was too great for more than one... so maybe one per faction
[15:28:48] <Vulpixbrew> I thought it waas anyone who did it with in the 10 hour windows of the first banging
[15:29:11] <Cel> on our server 400 people worked for a month to get the resources needed for one scepter
[15:29:53] <Cel> and then yes, everyone who turned that in... but noone would have the resources
[15:30:08] <Cel> but that was after the inital opening... where it worked only once
[15:30:12] <Vulpixbrew> I vote they bring bit back as a rare drop
[15:30:21] <Vulpixbrew> along with the SOO wolf
[15:30:29] <Vulpixbrew> something like 1%
[15:30:59] <Cel> they could at least put it on the black market... huge money drain^^
[15:31:09] <Vulpixbrew> that to
[15:31:17] <Katiepony> Yeah, definitely could be on the black market
[15:31:23] <Cel> also, the red amani bear
[15:31:30] <Katiepony> I think all the unattainable mounts and pets should be available on there
[15:31:43] <Cel> I don't like the pink one... it looks like someone let it out in the sun for too long
[15:31:56] <Cel> yea
[15:32:15] <Katiepony> Kinda sad that I started playing WoW after they stopped removing mounts.
[15:32:31] <Katiepony> So, even though I got some super rare stuff at the time, anyone can go back and get everything I have.
[15:32:55] <Katiepony> We were the first guild on our server to get the corrupted firehawk
[15:33:06] <Cel> that's exactly why I still wear my priest staff and my hunter bow (on the alliance hunter)^^
[15:33:52] <Vulpixbrew> I never want to go for world first anything
[15:34:14] <Cel> the server first achievements are silly... I tried once... leather working... about 10min befor I got it... bing... fuck
[15:34:31] <Vulpixbrew> to many guilds get banned 
[15:34:40] <Katiepony> Yeah, I don't really see the point in those o:
[15:34:52] <Katiepony> We were in the top 5 guilds at the time, Firelands
[15:34:59] <Katiepony> On our server
[15:35:00] <Katiepony> I mean
[15:35:01] <Katiepony> :3
[15:35:23] <Katiepony> And we noticed nobody had done that achievement on the server yet, so we decided to go for it.
[15:35:25] <Cel> we were the top guild on our server... that said, we were the only guild that was doing any raiding at the time
[15:35:29] <Vulpixbrew> worlds first ICC 25 man heroic
[15:35:38] <Cel> :D
[15:35:54] <Vulpixbrew> not mine, just the guiold that did it got banned
[15:36:09] <Cel> oh
[15:36:11] <Cel> well
[15:37:38] <Vulpixbrew> rogue engineer was using gernades and apperantly they respanwbned the platforms
[15:38:04] <Cel> exploits, exploits everywhere
[15:39:08] <Cel> that said... we did use exploits, too... blamed blizz for it... "it's possible, your fault"
[15:39:35] <Cel> no one got banned, but they told us to stop^^
[15:42:36] <Vulpixbrew> I think it was more the fact they didnt want worlds first going to a team that used exploits
[15:43:09] <Cel> probably
[15:44:13] <Vulpixbrew> buyt oh well
[15:44:29] <Vulpixbrew> the sad thing is they would have kept it if there hadnt been a video posted
[15:44:32] <Cel> are the ship fights really completely useless?... all I get are xp rewards and all my ships are epic
[15:44:48] <Cel> oh, that's just stupid
[15:44:55] <Cel> I heard about the ban, but not about the video
[15:45:09] <Katiepony> You can get HFC gear from the treasure missions.
[15:46:06] <Cel> haven't seen one... do I have to have carriers unlocked? (I'm up to submarine)
[15:46:33] <Katiepony> Uhhh
[15:46:42] <Katiepony> Do you have rank 2 ship yard?
[15:46:44] <Cel> the best I got was BoA gear
[15:46:53] <Cel> don't know^^
[15:47:34] <Vulpixbrew> I do
[15:47:41] <Katiepony> It's like
[15:47:48] <Katiepony> ... lemme check
[15:47:56] <Vulpixbrew> no carrier yet
[15:48:12] <Vulpixbrew> ooo as a pally i want ashbringer
[15:48:27] <Cel> I was soo close to ashbringer... then they changed the quest >.<
[15:48:28] <Vulpixbrew> as a pally only transmog
[15:48:39] <Katiepony> I wanna say battleships? Do you have those?
[15:48:44] <Vulpixbrew> Yes
[15:48:44] <Cel> yes
[15:48:46] <Katiepony> Or is it destroyers?
[15:48:57] <Vulpixbrew> it's subs when you unlock teir 2
[15:48:58] <Cel> destroyers are the second type of ship you get
[15:49:06] <Cel> I have subs
[15:49:24] <Katiepony> Well, I have no idea.
[15:49:32] <Cel> everything epic... never seen anything besides xp, blue BoA and a bit of apexis
[15:49:33] <Katiepony> My first HFC treasure mission showed up today.
[15:50:13] <Vulpixbrew> keyrings I just remmeberred having keyrings
[15:50:15] <Cel> it's pretty stupid to send my fully leveled ships on a xp mission^^
[15:50:29] <Cel> I remember not having keyrings^^
[15:50:37] <Cel> do that... own 12 keys... in your bag
[15:51:06] <Cel> or... "fuck I forgot the key on the bank"
[15:52:29] <Vulpixbrew> does anyone ahve the selfie cam yet?
[15:52:43] <Cel> mage and warlock... the most useful team to transport people to their bank to get the key
[15:52:46] <Cel> yes
[15:53:04] <Cel> the chars make silly faces^^
[15:53:06] <Vulpixbrew> I have yet to see it
[15:53:19] <Vulpixbrew> the garrison mission pop up
[15:56:32] <Vulpixbrew> that moment you ar4 tempted to tranfer a toon
[15:56:44] <Cel> too many moments^^
[15:57:08] <Vulpixbrew> level 92 Shammy main thing is herblist/Alchamey
[15:58:19] <Vulpixbrew> stupic expensive salvage blood
[15:59:34] <Cel> what are you using that for?
[15:59:57] <Vulpixbrew> nothing really
[16:00:18] <Cel> http://i.imgur.com/24wESyn.jpg selfie^^
[16:02:00] <Vulpixbrew> peepee
[16:02:11] <Vulpixbrew> or what ever hes called
[16:02:19] <Cel> yea^^
[16:07:55] <Vulpixbrew> Id wish they do timewalking raid
[16:08:01] <Vulpixbrew> Molten core was fun to run
[16:08:50] <Cel> I guess they will at some point
[16:09:02] <Vulpixbrew> a 40 man lfr
[16:09:18] <Cel> it was hilarious to watch people getting rekt at lucifron... the memories^^
[16:10:05] <Katiepony> I'm making a bis gear set for timewalkers
[16:11:28] <Cel> the only way I would attend to a new MC run would be in full PvP gear, and rolling on everything I can wear not matter what stats
[16:11:31] <Vulpixbrew> draenor is next
[16:12:56] <Cel> the reasoning was so great... "it's a dagger, I can wear a dagger!" *roll "but it has int on it" "but it's a dagger!"
[16:13:18] <Katiepony> Speaking of which
[16:13:25] <Katiepony> There's a 2h int mace in HFC
[16:13:41] <Cel> druid
[16:13:45] <Katiepony> First time I've ever been able to wear a 2h as a holy paladin
[16:13:55] <Katiepony> But it has the same dps on it as the strength mace
[16:13:57] <Cel> holy without shield?
[16:14:01] <Katiepony> Ya! :3
[16:14:04] <Cel> :D
[16:14:19] <Katiepony> I'm curious what my dps would be like with the int mace
[16:14:27] <Cel> try^^
[16:15:03] <Katiepony> I probably will :3
[16:16:06] <Cel> I did close combat hunter just to prove I need a 100DKP polearm^^

[16:27:31] <Cel> I have that problem with the monk... I boosted it from 1 to 90... no clue what to do^^... and no intention to learn it^^
[16:27:39] <Katiepony> I have that problem with every alt.
[16:27:43] <Vulpixbrew> what spec?
[16:28:09] <Katiepony> The only reason I have alts is to farm mounts for my main :P
[16:28:13] <Vulpixbrew> shammy is easy laval/lightning/totem
[16:28:18] <Cel> uh... the non tank non healer thing
[16:28:25] <Vulpixbrew> oooo
[16:28:27] <Vulpixbrew> facerool
[16:28:38] <Katiepony> Windwalker
[16:29:45] <Cel> I can kill things... but it seems too hard in comparison to literally everything else
[16:32:06] <Cel> until they changed mana to unlimited, druid and mage were hardest for me, just because I was too lazy to reg^^
[16:33:06] <Vulpixbrew> I need to make a brewmaster monk on the server I just dont wanna go trhough panda starting area again
[16:34:05] <Katiepony> The Red Pandas are so hot o:
[16:34:11] <Cel> why does it have to be a panda
[16:34:22] <Vulpixbrew> cause I want it to be
[16:34:43] <Cel> someone who likes pandas! (in the game)
[16:34:50] <Vulpixbrew> even though with new Heirloom tab it would be easier
[16:34:56] <Vulpixbrew> adn i agree Katiepony
[16:36:10] <Cel> I still want to level a char on a RP server... I just don't know what class
[16:36:36] <Vulpixbrew> I did a alliance toon on an rp server
[16:36:43] <Vulpixbrew> goldshire is a dirty dirty lace
[16:38:41] <Vulpixbrew> of course thats coming from someone in a clop chatroom
[16:38:44] <Cel> I still haven't seen any interesting action in goldshire... I level a bit, go there, and find nothing... a couple nudelves... some humping druids... but the conversation is very... flat
[16:39:30] <Vulpixbrew> yiffing druids
[16:40:11] <Cel> someone was flirting with my murloc I had out for some reason... that was the best action I got... which is sad^^
[16:40:49] <Vulpixbrew> well I just confirmed you can use boas in panda starting area
[16:41:18] <Katiepony> The quests are grey by the end of it.
[16:41:21] <Katiepony> If you use heirlooms.
