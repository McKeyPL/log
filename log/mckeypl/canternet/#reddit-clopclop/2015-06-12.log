[01:14:44] <divination> those mini vinyl's are kind of cool :)
[01:16:45] <TheRedOne> they never hit the market
[01:18:25] <TheRedOne> similar to the bluray, the CD had a much higher market penetration wrt developers building players for them, while vinyl got kind of a bad rep.
[01:19:17] <TheRedOne> since records actually had contact, so they'd be scratchy, and you had to be careful with them and bleh hifi digital is the future

[13:07:32] <TheRedOne> I'm not exactly sure what that means, I figured canternet would've had valid ones in general?
[13:07:54] <Compu> maybe they expired again, talk to Colgate or another IRCop
[13:08:31] <TheRedOne> but only for this one client?
[13:08:48] <Compu> not all clients validate certificates
[13:08:55] <Compu> i know quassel doesnt
[13:09:11] <Compu> or may hexchat is being weird
[13:09:26] <TheRedOne> the one on compu didn't, mibbit apparently didn't, simpleirc didn't
[13:09:27] <TheRedOne> wait
[13:09:32] <TheRedOne> I never checked my tablet
[13:09:56] <Compu> webclients dont do SSL
