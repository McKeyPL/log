[00:03:19] <Katiepony> I don't believe that fox is qualified.
[00:05:29] <wolfy> well im ded
[00:05:38] <wolfy> made 3 large pizzas
[00:05:40] <wolfy> finished one
[00:05:42] <wolfy> rip 
[00:06:32] <Katiepony> Why did you make 3? o:
[00:06:40] <wolfy> for the week ahea
[00:06:41] <wolfy> d
[00:06:50] <wolfy> leftover pizza is next best pizza
[00:07:16] <Katiepony> Oh, I see :3
[00:07:18] <Katiepony> I hear that a lot
[00:07:25] <Katiepony> I actually really dislike leftover pizza.
[00:07:39] <wolfy> :(
[00:07:51] <wolfy> well then  i guess more pizza for me and the other people
[00:07:55] <Katiepony> Which is weird, since everyone else seems to love it o:
[00:08:02] <weisey> Katiepony: only because the highest quality pizza you lot have is dominos :o
[00:08:36] <wolfy>  tru
[00:08:41] <wolfy> i am a witness
[00:08:41] <weisey> If that's all I had I'd hate leftover pizza too :o
[00:08:59] <Katiepony> I guess that makes sense o:
[00:09:42] <weisey> When I went to the UK my friend was like "wanna have pizza? Its great"
[00:09:43] <weisey> I was like "What kind?"
[00:09:43] <weisey> "Dominos" 
[00:10:06] <weisey> "Fuck off"
[00:10:22] <cloppyhooves> Leftover pizza is okay if you oven it :o
[00:10:24] <weisey> "You serious?"
[00:10:25] <weisey> "Yeah dominos, its amazing"
[00:11:11] <wolfy> leftover pizza is next best however you like it
[00:12:28] <Vulpixbrew> someone close rhat ium downwind of is rilling steaks
[00:12:31] <wolfy> bottom line: pizza is best
[00:13:30] <Vulpixbrew> and Im sitting here listening to my stomach growl
[00:13:52] * wolfy teases Vulpixbrew with an especially stringy slice of pizza
[00:14:29] * Vulpixbrew leaps at it
[00:15:03] * wolfy pulls it back, smirking
[00:15:18] * Vulpixbrew lands on his snout and starts whining
[00:15:53] * wolfy lays the slice by Vulpixbrew's snout

[00:29:38] <Katiepony> See, I knew it wasn't qualified.
[00:30:06] <iamalion> well see there is also no stopper in the overflow tube
[00:30:09] <iamalion> the stopperi s in the drain
[00:30:17] <iamalion> 2/10 cute fox tho
[00:30:52] <Katiepony> That fox is not a pipe doctor.
[00:32:03] <wolfy>  the fox is a fraud
[00:32:49] <wolfy> scamming money from the poor victim
[00:34:14] <cloppyhooves> That fox may be a fraud
[00:34:21] <cloppyhooves> But if anyone needs this fox to lay some pipe

[00:40:39] <Katiepony> Maybe that's why they're so scared o:
[00:41:12] <Katiepony> http://i.imgur.com/lJC5lxu.gif Something like that. Is that a seal?
[00:41:36] <weisey> Walrus?
[00:41:42] <wolfy> its a walrus
[00:42:57] <Katiepony> I thought walrusi had tusks o:
[00:43:08] <wolfy> not this one apparently
[00:43:47] <Katiepony> Apparently it is an Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) o:
[00:43:54] <Katiepony> Doesn't look like an Gazelle I ever saw.

[02:08:19] <Giggles> aside from pepperoni and mayo sandwiches.
[02:08:23] <wolfy> pizza
[02:08:35] <wolfy> i made pepperoni pizza just now :3
[02:08:39] <Giggles> oh right, and pizza.
[02:09:03] <Giggles> Yeah i'm finding it difficult to come up with an idea that doesn't involve some form of bread
[02:09:09] <Giggles> and we don't have flour right now.
[02:09:25] <wolfy> eat as is?
[02:09:31] <Giggles> I mean I could
[02:09:45] <Giggles> but I might as well just have a pepperoni and mayo sandwich then
[02:09:59] <Giggles> Maybe in eggs
[02:10:14] <Katiepony> Omlette o:

[02:15:44] <Giggles> Wait, what if instead of doing anything reasonable I eschew all sanity and sneak out of the house at 10 pm to buy canned pillsbury biscuits to make a ring of pizaa puffs?
[02:16:17] <Katiepony> Hmm
[02:16:36] <Katiepony> Why do that when you could just go out and buy some actual food? o:
[02:16:55] <Giggles> cause it uses my pepperoni

[16:04:18] <Frosty> Sadly. I'll be moving out soon.
[16:04:37] <RubyPinch> D:
[16:04:38] <Katiepony> When are you moving out of the dorm? o:
[16:04:57] <Frosty> With any luck, within these next two weeks.
[16:05:12] <Katiepony> Fair enough o:
[16:05:42] <Frosty> Lol, I'm not sure what you expect from me. I honestly don't know. I'm still looking for a place.
[16:07:45] <Katiepony> I just didn't know what's wrong with a dorm o:
[16:08:04] <Katiepony> But if you're only staying for a few weeks it's kinda just inconvenient. 
[16:08:09] <Frosty> You have no idea how hard it is to find a place for one person that isn't also $850+ for rent.
[16:08:19] <Frosty> here, that is
[16:08:47] <RubyPinch> https://youtu.be/u3FO46D1dqs : Everything Everything - Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread 
[16:08:53] <Katiepony> Finding any place for one person is pretty difficult.
[16:09:05] <Katiepony> Why not just stay in dorms tho? o: Do you have to share a room?
[16:09:32] <Frosty> No, but I rpomoted in June. They're looking at me to get out soon becuase I'm now of rank. 
[16:12:05] <Frosty> No one past SrA is allowed to be in the dorms.
[16:12:47] <RubyPinch> that does seem like a tough situation to be put in to >_<
[16:13:31] <Frosty> No. It's finding one beofre they kick me out that's difficult and stressful, though.
[16:15:04] <Katiepony> Run away from civilization and live in the woods :3
[16:15:20] <Frosty> It's gonna be a cold winter if I did that.
[16:16:44] <Katiepony> Burn the woods down :3
[16:16:55] <Frosty> Oh, also there are no woods.
[16:17:03] <Frosty> We have 6 trees here.
[16:17:03] <Katiepony> Hmm, that's a problem I guess o:
[16:17:54] <RubyPinch> are they big trees though?
[16:18:02] <Frosty> Pffftthahaha
[16:18:47] <Frosty> No
[16:23:25] <Frosty> Five of those trees are scattered thoughout base.
[16:24:15] <RubyPinch> darn, so no treehouses?
[16:24:31] <Frosty> No.
[16:24:47] <Frosty> But we do have more lumber than trees. How does that happen?
[16:25:17] <RubyPinch> by resulting in the no trees :p
[16:25:28] <Frosty> But we keep getting lumber.
[16:28:02] <Frosty> That shit doesn't just grow on trees, you know.
[16:29:08] <Katiepony> Heh

[16:29:45] <Katiepony> I think going over there would cost me more than lunch would.
[16:30:06] <Frosty> Well yeah, becuase your lucnh wouldn't cost you anything
[16:30:12] <RubyPinch> come over here then! :o
