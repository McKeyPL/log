[08:33:59] <PlumsNThings> Im a fat, video game playing D&D player who calls all his freinds fags (In a banter way). 
[08:34:17] <cloppyhooves> You should avoid that word here, though c:
[08:34:22] <PlumsNThings> I know
[08:34:50] <Giggles> Heey that sounds like me Plums. ^_^
[08:34:57] <IceFlurries> Wana see my desktop? :D
[08:34:57] <PlumsNThings> I only call my best freinds that and thats because i know them in real life and do it when we all know its banter
[08:35:01] <PlumsNThings> Sure
[08:35:05] <IceFlurries> https://waa.ai/v0Hk
[08:35:22] <IceFlurries> wanted to try the Akari url shortener :3
[08:35:42] <Giggles> Except lately racial slurs have been in style instead of homophobia. :O
[08:35:50] <PlumsNThings> I thought i was the only guy Giggles
[08:36:23] <IceFlurries> anyone like my desktop? :3
[08:36:28] <PlumsNThings> Yes plox
[08:36:50] <Giggles> WEll ok, I admit I'm not fat. But I play video games, D&D and call my friends terrible things.
[08:37:13] <Giggles> Is it that mountain Icey?  It's pretty nice
[08:37:16] <PlumsNThings> Well i've lost 10 kgs so far this year
[08:38:06] <IceFlurries> Giggles: :3
[08:38:16] <PlumsNThings> also gained that much in musscle as well (The gym i go to is run by physiology students, funded by the local collage)
[08:39:41] <PlumsNThings> still healthier
[08:40:27] <PlumsNThings> and i've now been told i have to eat more because my energy usage is way more than my intake
[08:40:30] <Frosty> Giggles and I give each other shit all the time. While I has back home, he taught me how to knit, and then I kept calling him bad things, he called me some, reffered to each other as "knitters", it was great.
[08:40:35] * IceFlurries wants to be healthier...
[08:40:55] <Giggles> Dude, being healthier is hard
[08:42:02] <PlumsNThings> it takes a while but im sleeping better
[08:42:07] <Frosty> Gigglesd, for you it would start with eating more food. THEN transitioning into healthy foods.
[08:43:12] <PlumsNThings> Use a little more than you put in. Thats the name of the game
[08:43:56] <PlumsNThings> And dont go crazy with workouts. Excersize one day (If you have an intense workout) and take it slower the next.
[08:50:26] <PlumsNThings> Little bits stack up
[08:51:39] <Giggles> That's why important to play games a couple hours every day. :O

[14:31:10] <Vulpixbrew> yes
[14:31:15] <Vulpixbrew> with a lot of dakka
[14:31:28] <Cel> that's quite modern of you
[14:32:15] <Vulpixbrew> rogues can use guns
[14:33:27] <Cel> they can also wear pink dresses and skirts... not that I'm against it... but imagine an assasin sneaking into a castle looking like a tropical bird
[14:35:58] <Vulpixbrew> to be fair there are different kinds of rogues, had a dnd player played a roguue one time, nasty combatant but gave himself an 18 chirisma
[14:36:13] <Vulpixbrew> could walk among the high class and royality
[14:37:56] <Vulpixbrew> was an interesting  campain to say the least
[14:44:52] <Cel> that wasn what I meant, my point was the sneaking bit... you wouldn't go sneaking into a castle looking flashy when noone else is... and sneaking while fireing a gun isn't helping either
[14:46:43] <Cel> (my rogue is dressed like that, that's why I made the comparison... and she has a bird on her head that whistles all the time^^)
[14:46:55] <Cel> makes no sense but I like it^^

[22:46:41] <Princesssluttershy> So I talked to that pretty cashier at my work today ^-^
[22:47:09] <RNGsus> How did that work out
[22:48:07] <Princesssluttershy> We said hi to eachother than I said "That will be 99 cents" and "would you like a bag?"
[22:48:20] <Princesssluttershy> then she said "no" and "thank you"
[22:49:23] <RNGsus> the cashier was buying something?
[22:49:30] <Princesssluttershy> Yeah
[22:49:34] <Princesssluttershy> she was going on her break
[22:49:56] <Princesssluttershy> and she came to electronics to pay because the store was really busy

[23:08:51] <Wolfie> it's quite cool, watched Jurassic park 3, now watching love actually, next it batman forever
[23:09:14] <Wolfie> kings cross and neighbourhood is complicated 
[23:09:49] <Wolfie> haven't found a single electronics shop though
[23:09:54] <Katiepony> Batman Forever is a British cult classic.
[23:10:08] <Wolfie> just ads of ones
[23:10:13] <Wolfie> ah. figures
[23:10:23] <Katiepony> Ye Olde Gothingham
[23:11:46] <Wolfie> kings cross station building looks like something batlad would hang about in 
[23:12:23] <Wolfie> everyone talks with a fucking weird accent though 
[23:12:39] <Katiepony> Probably a British accent.
[23:12:49] <Wolfie> I was expecting brittish but it's like a melting pot of every dialect ever
[23:13:10] <Wolfie> at one point a cashier just screamed like a banshee 
[23:13:23] <Wolfie> no one batted an eye 
[23:13:53] <Wolfie> got a 600ml bottle though which was super cool
