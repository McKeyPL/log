[04:12:59] <samonuh> Golfed today
[04:14:09] <iamalion> hooray got a kudos!
[04:14:43] <iamalion> cx spoke to a supervisor about me:
[04:14:43] <iamalion> UDO- iamalion-- CX was surprised ?at how good the service. iamalion worked hard to get to an answer. As a former sales manager cx was impressed with iamalion's customer service. If CC had more people like iamalion then everyone would move to CC.
[04:14:45] <Araiya> Oh, positive survey?
[04:14:53] <Araiya> Nice. :D
[04:15:03] <iamalion> not just a survey thing, i get htose all the time
[04:15:48] <Araiya> Mm. We get surveys frequently where I'm at (chat support queue). Sometimes there's a comment added in.
[04:16:15] <iamalion> ah yeah comcast has the little callback surveys that customers can do. the rate 1-5 things. i ace those 
[04:16:21] <iamalion> every once in a while one wants to talk to my supervisor
[04:16:34] <iamalion> ive heard 3 times today that i am the best/nicest person someone has spoken to at comcast O_o
[04:16:42] <Araiya> 0-10 for us. They count, but the NPS ones are the ones I really want.
[04:16:59] <iamalion> ours might be 0-10, i just see a % lol
[04:17:00] <iamalion> whats nps
[04:17:35] <Araiya> Net Promoter Score. Basically, the "Would you recommend $companyname to a friend or business associate?" question.
[04:17:44] *** Quits: samonuh (Mibbit@Pony-jgsbsa.sm.ptd.net) (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[04:18:14] <Araiya> For us, that question appears on about 5% of the offered surveys.
[04:19:35] <iamalion> ah
[04:20:08] <Araiya> Our survey is rather short. Two or three questions, and a fill in the blank bit.
[04:20:42] <iamalion> my problem is that sometimes the customers think the servey also applies to hte 4 other people they talked to -_-
[04:20:45] <iamalion> either way, off work afk
[04:20:51] <Araiya> If it has the third question, that survey has an NPS score loaded in.
[04:21:00] <Araiya> Totally understand that. See ya in a bit.
[04:33:27] <weisey> i always hate that you cant seperate your experience with an employee from your experience with the company
[04:33:58] <Araiya> Our survey does a fairly decent job of that.
[04:34:00] <weisey> "Your company is shit and you should be ashamed, but X was great, and helped me the best he could given your shitty company policies"
[04:34:21] <weisey> surveys never let you do that
[04:34:25] <weisey> and it saddens me
[04:34:41] <weisey> because i dont want to shit on an employee's performance if it was good
[04:35:39] <Futashy> ohmg
[04:35:44] <Futashy> i forgot i had this open!
[04:35:47] <Futashy> :/
[04:35:49] <Araiya> Maybe I've just had a decent run of customers who read the survey, though as much as I like and want NPS, I don't want it if the customer's all kinds of pissed off with the company, even if they loved me.

[04:38:33] <plushie_pegasus> Hello Everypony
[04:38:41] <Araiya> That's the only thing that blows: I can impress the everloving fuck out of a customer, make them all kinds of happy with me, do everything they expected and more, but if they get the NPS after having a bad run of reps before me, I'm going to get survey-punched there: 10/10/8 is bad, and 10/10/6 or lower is FML.
[04:39:05] * Futashy waves to plushie_pegasus 
[04:40:32] <Araiya> That said, I've had impressive surveys from people who raged at me for the entire chat, acting as impossible as they can, and still gave me 10/10 on a non-NPS survey.

[07:12:22] <Vulpixbrew> I wish theyed nerf half the stuff to be able to solo I missing so many just due to the fact it takes two to six people

[07:37:32] <plushie_pegasus> Hi scrunchface
[07:38:22] <plushie_pegasus> Coffee eh? You are not supposed to clop near the keyboard LOL
[07:38:50] <scrunchface> yeah I wish it were fucking semen because even if I blew my load all over my keyboard it wouldn't nearly have this bad an effect
[07:39:10] <plushie_pegasus> :(
[07:39:13] <scrunchface> Great, gotta buy a new one in 3 days
[07:39:18] <scrunchface> simply don't have the money right now
[07:39:29] <scrunchface> I'll just get a cheap $10 one
[07:39:38] <plushie_pegasus> You can get a good USB keyboard at goodwill for $3
[07:40:38] <scrunchface> Not that cheap
[07:40:53] <scrunchface> there are some features I need that I can get for $10
[07:41:03] <scrunchface> and i'm not so broke I need to buy one for a mere $3
[07:41:19] <scrunchface> most of the keyboards found in goodwill are the super old ps2 ones
[07:41:22] * plushie_pegasus types hard , as i learned how to type on a manual typewriter , so i go thru keyboards about one every 3 months
[07:41:29] <scrunchface> or one's with a small backspace key, something I can't stand
[07:41:41] <scrunchface> I can type 105 wpm with 100% accuracy
[07:42:03] <plushie_pegasus> i can go about 35 WPM 
[07:42:15] <plushie_pegasus> With two fingers
[07:42:22] <Vulpixbrew> LK is a push over on non heroic
[07:42:24] <scrunchface> two hands?

[07:42:47] <weisey> Jesus scrunchface what are you
[07:42:53] <weisey> A court reporter?
[07:43:04] <scrunchface> Huge nerd.
[07:43:23] <scrunchface> 10 years of experience with computers
[07:43:39] <scrunchface> I started out doing typing learning programs in middle school
[07:43:45] <scrunchface> and it was so fun that I just kept practicing
[07:43:49] <scrunchface> until I reached about 70
[07:43:51] <scrunchface> now i'm up to 105
[07:43:55] <scrunchface> that's my limit though
[07:44:42] <scrunchface> I still lul and ppl that need to look at they keyboard while typing or who don't type with two hands.
[07:45:05] <scrunchface> at* the*
[07:45:58] * plushie_pegasus has to look at the keyboard to type
[07:46:10] <scrunchface> I'm sure I would make an excellent court reporter or receptionist
[07:46:21] <scrunchface> plushie_pegasus you should practice
[07:46:30] <scrunchface> go online and find a typing test site
[07:46:42] <scrunchface> having to look at they keys will typing will really slow you down
[07:46:47] <scrunchface> you should memorize them

[17:32:09] <Vulpixbrew> deathclaws, I have a plan for,mainly stack highest levels on the door and rooms behind the door and lots of stimpacks, with a dash of praying
[17:32:33] <Cel> ^^ they get bored pretty fast... they stay about 5sec per room
[17:33:38] <Cel> my people were equally armed for the first 4 floors... still managed to kill everyone down to floor 7
[17:33:52] <Vulpixbrew> aye
[17:33:58] <Cel> (my highest level people were out wasteland though)
[17:34:17] <Vulpixbrew> See I only send one person out at a time
[17:34:28] * RubyPinch squeezes Vulpixbrew's butt
[17:34:58] <Wolfy> I stayed overnight at a horse sex house

[17:37:40] <Vulpixbrew> Cyberman and Daleks are easy, 
[17:38:07] <Cel> cybermen are good people
[17:38:13] <Vulpixbrew> Angels and VAshta Nerada are scary

[17:38:46] <Frosty> Vashta Nerada?

[17:40:06] <Cel> my favorite is demons run... there are many parts that are very bad, but I like the context
[17:41:09] <Frosty> Demons run. Is that the one with the space station kept from a black hole by Satan?
[17:42:02] <Vulpixbrew> Nooo that was when they took amy and the Doctor went to get her back (I love Rory dealing with cyber people in that episode)
