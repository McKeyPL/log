[00:22:58] <ponder> I like that.
[00:25:57] <weisey> i hate it when the bundle has like
[00:25:59] <weisey> 3 games you want
[00:26:05] <weisey> and 6 that you already have
[00:26:21] <weisey> so you feel bad buying it because you already have the 6 games
[00:26:29] <weisey> but the price for the other 3 is too good

[01:10:34] <TheRedOne> what I find interesting is
[01:11:33] <TheRedOne> a lot of the more "classic" western audience deem japanese hentai (to pick an example) as too weird
[01:12:10] <TheRedOne> and some of them seem really put off by whatever they're shown
[01:12:59] <TheRedOne> I wonder why, to be honest. you could argue the general idea works mostly the same across all cultures
[01:23:23] <Vulpixbrew> whats a japaness SOD video?
[01:23:31] <Vulpixbrew> Im not sure I want to google it
