[07:46:43] <mib_l64te7> Is this a chat where people clop together?
[07:48:15] <Serene_Flow> It can be, yes.
[07:48:51] <Luvbi> 13Short answer: Yes. Long answer: We do a lot more than that, such as talk about how great mozzarella sticks are
[07:49:02] <Luvbi> 13Cause I mean, who doesn't love mozzarella sticks?
[07:50:10] <expatriate> we get off topic a lot, but the idea is to chat about clop, share images and stuff, etc
