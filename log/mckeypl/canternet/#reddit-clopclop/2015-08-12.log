[03:37:47] <weisey> Yep
[03:38:21] <weisey> I'd hate to be the guy doing chrono trigger 100% though 
[03:38:23] <weisey> 5 hours
[03:38:26] <weisey> No bathroom
[03:38:41] <Princesssluttershy> that's like Skyward Sword... that run is insane
[03:38:56] <Princesssluttershy> also super mario galaxy 2 is like 6 hours I think
[03:39:28] <weisey> They didn't do that this year did they :o?
[03:39:48] <Princesssluttershy> I don't know
[03:39:58] <Princesssluttershy> I think they did it as agdq
[03:40:08] <weisey> Ah
[03:40:42] <Vulpixbrew> no bathroonm breaks?
[03:40:49] <Vulpixbrew> jesus
[03:40:57] <weisey> Its a speedrun
[03:41:01] <weisey> Of course not
[03:41:17] <weisey> A live speedrun at that :o
[03:41:26] <Princesssluttershy> The wii version of TP takes like 12 hours to run XD
[03:41:37] <Princesssluttershy> no one does it though
[03:42:06] <Princesssluttershy> It's basically a 100% run with no LJAs
[03:42:57] <weisey> So that's why they were using the GC version
[03:43:03] <Princesssluttershy> Yeah
[03:43:11] <Princesssluttershy> literally no one runs the wii version XD
[03:44:00] <Princesssluttershy> LJAs look so cool
[03:44:01] <weisey> I was wondering why
[03:44:24] <Princesssluttershy> you can't do LJAs in the wii version
[03:46:14] <Princesssluttershy> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw93t0-0S-0 weisey this run has some really good commentary in it
[03:46:22] <Princesssluttershy> he explains a lot of stuff ^-^
[03:46:46] <Princesssluttershy> Mofat is great ^-^
[03:50:14] <Princesssluttershy> weisey, I think I ask you this like every week but do you play csgo?
[03:52:16] <weisey> Yeah
[03:52:20] <weisey> I kinda quit though
[03:52:25] <weisey> Can't break out of nova 4
[03:53:17] <Princesssluttershy> Oh I'm nova 3 ^-^
[03:55:41] <cloppyhooves> There were two runners doing Chrono Trigger :o
[03:56:31] <weisey> Princesssluttershy: let me tell you
[03:56:37] <weisey> The Nova 4 fuckery
[03:56:42] <weisey> Will make you quit 
[03:57:04] <Princesssluttershy> How many wins did you have when you wuit?
[03:58:10] <weisey> 108 
[03:58:18] <weisey> Got to mg1 after 108
[03:58:19] <Princesssluttershy> I only have 50 wins
[03:58:28] <weisey> Oh yeah
[03:58:43] <weisey> I got to nova 4 in like 30
[03:58:50] <weisey> I was silver 1 for like 50
[03:58:56] <weisey> Fixed my mouse sens
[03:59:10] <weisey> Shot up to nova 4 by like 75
[03:59:15] <Princesssluttershy> I was only in silver for like 20 wins or so
[03:59:24] <weisey> Then cant get past it
[03:59:39] <weisey> I would drop 30 and 40 and 50 bombs
[03:59:53] <weisey> But I couldn't clutch with my super high sens and mouse accell
[04:01:13] <Princesssluttershy> My mouse sense is fairly high but I don't use acceleration
[04:02:11] <weisey> What's your send?
[04:02:17] <weisey> Sens?
[04:02:45] <Princesssluttershy> my mouse is at 800dpi and my in game is 2.25 I think
[04:02:50] <weisey> Wooooah
[04:02:53] <weisey> That's high
[04:02:57] <weisey> Turn that down a little
[04:03:00] <Princesssluttershy> can
[04:03:02] <Princesssluttershy> can't
[04:03:09] <weisey> That's higher than most pros
[04:03:14] <Princesssluttershy> I don't have enough room to do a 180 if I do
[04:03:20] <weisey> Only a few use the 4.5 equivalent 
[04:03:30] <weisey> Even less
[04:03:35] <weisey> I think the highest is 4.1
[04:03:45] <Princesssluttershy> this sense has given me a 50% hs ratio
[04:03:48] <weisey> (Or 800 2.05)
[04:03:52] <Princesssluttershy> so I'm happy with that
[04:05:22] <weisey> Yeah but what's your accuracy percentage 
[04:05:55] <Princesssluttershy> Probably bad
[04:06:03] <Princesssluttershy> I'm not good at the game
[04:07:50] <Princesssluttershy> Where do I actually go to check stats like that?
[04:08:22] <weisey> Options > something 
[04:08:24] <weisey> I think
[04:08:30] <weisey> Or maybe its Awards
[04:08:36] <weisey> Is there an awards tab?
[04:08:39] <Princesssluttershy> I should proably turn my game off pirate mode :/
[04:12:48] <weisey> Haha
[04:13:12] <Princesssluttershy> I can't navigate any of the menus because they're all different
[04:13:43] <cloppyhooves> There's a MLP Subreddit Simulator bot
[04:13:46] <cloppyhooves> It knows how to use emotes
[04:13:48] <Princesssluttershy> I'm gonna play a game or two of cs
[04:14:32] <weisey> I would play with you
[04:14:38] <weisey> But I'm not at home rn
[04:14:51] <Princesssluttershy> We should sometime ^-^
[04:14:54] <Princesssluttershy> that would be fun ^-^
[04:24:08] <Princesssluttershy> Oh shit my hs % is only 38 D:
[04:24:22] <Princesssluttershy> and my accuracy is 26% D:
[04:25:22] <Princesssluttershy> I've played Dust2 1253 times :/
[04:26:02] <weisey> Keep in mind that tracks from everything 
[04:26:21] <weisey> Comp, casual, armsrace, and community
[04:26:25] <Princesssluttershy> yeah all those bot games I played when I first got the game
[04:26:57] <Princesssluttershy> my win % is 60% though
[04:27:02] <Princesssluttershy> that's not too terrible

[05:56:00] <iamalion> i mean i deal with comcast customers all day :^D
[05:56:10] <Flame> I guess it's the "rest of the shift" thing that resonates
[05:56:16] <iamalion> true
[05:56:38] <Flame> since then it sounds like "I know what it's like, and I actually care" rather than "oh, idk you, i don't REALLY care either, so bye!"
[05:56:47] <Flame> sorta like "hi how are you?" greeting
[05:56:51] <iamalion> ah
[05:56:57] <iamalion> yeah THAT Really unbutters my crumpet oh my god
[05:57:04] <Flame> which I theorize is because other languages have a "formal" greeting that "hello" doesn't suffice, so we say that
[05:57:41] <iamalion> customer answers "yes hi im Richard Hardings how are you today?" "im good ho-" "my wifi isnt working today"
[05:57:58] <iamalion> "oh ok well im iamalion here with comcast blah blah

[17:18:20] <RubyPinch> <RubyPinch> in completely unrelated news, CSS is pretty fun
[17:19:17] <Compu> RubyPinch: i like the css theme in my subreddit http://www.reddit.com/r/compu

[17:27:01] <Compu> oh god i love this intro theme in ponies the anthology 5

[17:29:03] <Compu> yeah

[17:32:49] <Compu> Princesssluttershy: i tries to untag those things, it wont let me
[17:33:00] <Compu> it has nothing to do with the css either
[17:33:06] <Princesssluttershy> I don't know how reddit works
[17:33:10] <Compu> it wouldnt let me before i added the css
[17:33:12] <Princesssluttershy> it was just an observation
[17:33:27] <Princesssluttershy> also your reddit is tageed as 18+
[17:33:42] <Compu> Princesssluttershy: they have a thing to unnsfw posts but i do that and it says it did it but on refresh its still nsfw

[18:06:07] <Wolfy> well I did at some point like years ago
[18:06:15] <Wolfy> when it was on TV
[18:06:28] <Katiepony> Dr Who has always been stupid.
[18:06:32] <Frosty> Giggles.
[18:07:08] <Giggles> Well it continually gets stupider katie
[18:07:11] <Giggles> Hi Frosty
[18:07:26] <Katiepony> I love Dr Who. The stupidity is part of the charm :3
[18:07:26] <Frosty> How are the interviews going?
[18:08:06] <Katiepony> I'm surprised anyone outside the UK was able to embrace it o:
[18:08:34] <Frosty> Dr. Who?
[18:08:53] <Katiepony> Mhm
[18:09:21] <Frosty> I like it, but I also started at Tennant.
[18:09:42] <Vulpixbrew> I agree Katiepony. the sheer cheeseball of the episodes
[18:09:49] <Wolfy> i don't like tennant
[18:09:56] <Giggles> Tennant is like, ok.
[18:10:00] <Frosty> Get out
[18:10:04] <Giggles> I like old guy so far.
[18:10:08] <Frosty> Both of you
[18:10:41] <Katiepony> Tennant was my favorite doctor, but I felt like the quality of the show really went up with Matt Smith :3
[18:11:07] <Frosty> I didn't like Smith because he took Tennant away from me.
[18:11:09] <Wolfy> yeah Matt was awesome up until like the second last season
[18:11:19] <Frosty> He grew on my, tho
[18:11:24] <Wolfy> then it just became random for the sake of random
[18:11:33] <Katiepony> Yeah, a lot of people get mad when a new doctor comes about o:
[18:11:43] <Wolfy> ppl don't like change
[18:11:47] <Wolfy> I'll keep it tho
[18:11:56] <Wolfy> I like notes better tbh
[18:12:00] <Katiepony> I'm always happy, I love seeing different actors' versions of the doctor.
[18:12:41] <Katiepony> I like Capaldi, but the writing for that season was awful.
[18:13:29] <Frosty> Who is Capaldi? the new guy?
[18:13:38] <Katiepony> Mhm
[18:14:03] * Connor is completely lost 
[18:14:09] <Frosty> Ah. I haven't actually seen any of the new stuff with him. I still think I have a season of Matt left.
[18:14:22] <Giggles> It's better than the last season so far.
[18:14:30] <Wolfy> I also stopped watching Sherlock after Moffat started co directing 
[18:14:40] <Wolfy> it just visibly became trash
[18:14:42] <Giggles> but I'm sure they'll ruin it and make it suck.
[18:14:55] <Giggles> Yeah I hate Moffat. He is evil.
[18:15:02] <Frosty> Why?
[18:16:05] <Wolfy> imo he just made everything so random and quirky
[18:16:46] <Frosty> Didn't he write the Weeping Angels and the Library one?
[18:16:55] <Frosty> Those are like, my two favorite episodes
[18:17:28] <Wolfy> he's directed most of Dr who but it's just become such trash lately
[18:17:40] <Wolfy> imo of course 
[18:18:21] <Katiepony> There were a couple of good episodes from the latest season
[18:18:32] <Katiepony> But overall, most of them were poorly written.
[18:18:37] <Frosty> The latest being Cap or matt?
[18:18:42] <Katiepony> Cap
[18:18:49] <Frosty> Is that Season done?
[18:18:50] <Giggles> He also wrote the Angels Take Manhattan, so that basically undoes anything good he's ever given the world.
[18:19:14] <Frosty> Which one is that?
[18:19:33] <Giggles> The one where the Statue of Liberty is a weeping angel.
[18:19:40] <Katiepony> You may not have seen that one.
[18:19:46] <Frosty> WTAF.
[18:19:49] <Frosty> No.
[18:19:50] <Giggles> It was abysmal.

[18:38:58] <Princesssluttershy> exactly
[18:39:17] <Princesssluttershy> so $675k isn't all that much

[18:40:21] <Princesssluttershy> I though you were commenting like it was a lot
