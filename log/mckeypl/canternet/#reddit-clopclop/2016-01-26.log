[21:39:24] <Wikkit> !
[21:39:34] <cloppyhooves> Hi PuppyGirl c:
[21:41:57] <LuckyRoll> Puppygirl, as your internet owner, I give you permission.
[21:42:00] <Vulpixbrew> heya PuppyGirl Wikkit Chiv
[21:42:02] <Vulpixbrew> hello cloppyhooves
[21:43:41] <Vulpixbrew> that moment your spamming someone on facebook with fox pictures
[21:45:55] <PuppyGirl> But Wolfy's my owner!
[21:46:05] <PuppyGirl> Also Nigiri...and especially Miss Evelina
[21:46:14] <PuppyGirl> also brb
[21:47:41] * Wolfy gives Lucky a paper of joined ownership and a pen to sign it
[21:49:36] * Nigiri eats the paper 
[21:51:10] * Wolfy puts a gag on Nigiri and prints another
[21:51:16] * LuckyRoll steals the paper out of his mouth, and signs it, then puts it inside of a pocket.
[21:52:12] * Chiv puts on his legal glasses for a moment.
[21:52:48] <Chiv> I believe for the addition of a joint owner, a majority portion of the current owners must sign the doccument assenting to another partner for the document to be legally binding
[21:53:01] * LuckyRoll gives Chiv a pair of magical glasses that allow anyone to speak Legalese!
[21:53:02] * Chiv pushes his glasses up on his nose and looks all prim and proper horse
[21:53:25] <LuckyRoll> "So.... do we round up?"
[21:53:50] <Chiv> Meaning you most likely need to discuss such ownership with Miss Evelina at the current time.
[21:54:15] <Chiv> As I believe she also holds the initial claim upon the puppy in question, unless i am mistaken?
[21:54:27] * LuckyRoll copies Nigiri's handwriting, and forges a signature.
[21:54:33] <Chiv> >:|
[21:54:36] <Chiv> No forgery!
[21:54:57] <LuckyRoll> What forgery, this is a shared pen of using others signitures!
[21:55:11] <Chiv> WHich counts as magical forgery by equestrian law!
[21:55:43] * LuckyRoll takes back the glasses, and is suddenly in a suit, "I object to that statement!"
[21:56:18] <Chiv> ...you can't object to a statement >_>
[21:56:20] * Wolfy puts a pen in Nigiris paw and writes a Yes on the paper with it
[21:56:33] * LuckyRoll Looks like female, furry Phoenix Wright.
[21:57:24] <PuppyGirl> Back!
[21:57:43] <LuckyRoll> "I'm sorry, but also in accordance, this pen is soulbound to Nigiri, so it carries out his wishes!"
[21:57:49] * RubyPinch snugs PuppyGirl 
[21:57:56] * Wolfy puts PuppyGirl into a cage
[21:57:59] * Chiv glances at Nigiri to see if this is actually true
[21:58:31] * Nigiri has been paying no attention to What's going on, he bought a burrito though so everything is OK! 
[21:58:45] <PuppyGirl> ACK!
[21:58:52] * PuppyGirl whines and tries to escape the cage
[21:59:29] <LuckyRoll> "Case closed, now please let Puppy out of the cage, that is reserved for when she refuses to take a bath!
[21:59:49] <PuppyGirl> But....but....
[21:59:56] <PuppyGirl> I don't even know you yet!
[22:00:34] <LuckyRoll> "Of course you do! You've been to my place, we've established punishments."
[22:00:36] <Chiv> Hm, well, maybe not case closed. I believe the fine print does state that the property herself must validate any final ownership additions
[22:01:03] <Chiv> Right at the bottom, "Consent is sexy"
[22:02:01] <LuckyRoll> "Yes, but you have to also look at legislation number 72379261 H.E.L.L, in which, on the day of darkness, when empress Lucky Roll graces you with her presence, I can abolish any law!"
[22:02:21] <LuckyRoll> "And I abolish that one!"
[22:02:23] * Chiv points to the IRC title bar. Universal law.
[22:03:02] * LuckyRoll looks up, and curses about her lies being foiled again!
[22:03:09] <Wolfy> PuppyGirl, me and lucky are your co-owners!
[22:03:14] * Fleur coughs politely
[22:03:18] <LuckyRoll> "I abolish the Irc Title?"
[22:03:23] <Fleur> Onto a different subject
[22:03:29] <Fleur> Anybody else here play warframe?
[22:03:36] <LuckyRoll> Nope!
[22:04:24] <RubyPinch> i pla wf a ha ha ha
[22:04:32] * Fleur was hoping to discuss people's thoughts on the new event
[22:04:48] <RubyPinch> seems bad i dont like it
[22:05:00] <Fleur> >:P
[22:05:25] <Fleur> Did you see the news on what the next phase involves?
[22:05:27] * LuckyRoll Takes off her glasses, and the suit, which honestly she was pulling off amazingly, disapears, leaving her in her average clothes.
[22:05:48] <RubyPinch> is it beer, pls say its beer
[22:06:25] <Fleur> Yes, it involves Fosters, obviously
[22:07:49] <RubyPinch> it seems off, since they seem to encorage people to farm on the 2nd stage

[22:08:33] <Fleur> I think that is how they are encouraging people to do more than simply the 10 runs required, and then quit
[22:08:40] <Fleur> so that the health actually gets taken down.
[22:09:45] <RubyPinch> mm
[22:10:33] <Chiv> I like the whole alert aspect, too, where it's actually a hunt for them <,<
[22:11:33] <iamalion> doot doot
[22:12:06] <RubyPinch> I wish it'd notify you when new thing hapen
[22:12:49] <Chiv> Unrelated, you see this article rruby? https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/42s46g/til_in_2001_it_at_unc_decided_to_do_a_server/
[22:13:28] <RubyPinch> already knew of it
[22:15:15] <Vulpixbrew> paypal is doing a class action settlement
[22:15:24] <Chiv> https://fat.gfycat.com/SkeletalQueasyJaguarundi.webm
[22:15:28] <Chiv> Oooh really? What for?
[22:16:12] *** Joins: Nigiri (AndChat2442@Pony-2aomjp.res.rr.com)
[22:18:55] * Nigiri flops 
[22:19:06] <LuckyRoll> Hi Nigiri.
[22:19:09] <Fleur> Welcome back, monsieur
[22:21:07] * Nigiri hands out burritos
[22:21:23] * Wolfy pokes Nigiri with his burrito
[22:21:40] * Nigiri nibbles the burrito 
[22:21:53] * LuckyRoll Steal two more, then eats them nonchalantly.
[22:22:19] <Chiv> ...dang it now I want to go out and get chipotle >.>
[22:24:02] <Vulpixbrew>  if you had a hold or reserve placed on your account and/or your account was closed or suspended by PayPal between April 19, 2006 and November 5, 2015.
[22:24:14] <Vulpixbrew> aka sellers who have gotten screwed
[22:25:06] <RubyPinch> that sounds like it'd be a hard-to-win case for the people
[22:25:39] <Chiv> ooooh
[22:25:56] <Chiv> that's probably for all those cases where paypal basically just locked up funds and was like "yeah this is your money but nah you can't have it"
[22:26:09] <Vulpixbrew> yeah....
[22:26:36] <Chiv> That's good, though. I know a lot of artists who got shafted by that shit.
[22:28:06] <RubyPinch> it makes sense in the capacity of payment processing though, hold money until its obvious the customer is satisfied.
[22:28:33] <Chiv> That's not what was happening though. This was paypal holding ALL of the money in the account
[22:28:49] <Chiv> meaning if someone disputed a $10 payment
[22:29:03] <Chiv> you could have $2000 suddenly unreachable for a month
[22:29:48] <RubyPinch> oki ye that is a bit over the top
[22:30:06] <Chiv> mhm. Thus the lawsuit
[22:30:21] <RubyPinch> but like, as an opposing view
[22:30:54] <RubyPinch> giv moment need 2 find linkaroo
[22:31:46] <RubyPinch> https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/42ikdm/my_stream_was_hacked/
[22:35:22] <Vulpixbrew> ChivI had a 300 claim one time cause the person said that they didnt recieve the package despite tracking and a required sigunature
[22:36:35] <Vulpixbrew> another time dude didn't read the discription and opened a claim
[22:37:29] <Vulpixbrew> lasttime I tried paypal they decided to hold my funds for no other reason then because we can
[22:39:07] <Chiv> yuuup
[22:39:49] <Chiv> And that was someone substituting their paypal account link in, socii, which is kinda different
[22:46:22] <Vulpixbrew> great foir shopping, shit for selling unless your a huge business
