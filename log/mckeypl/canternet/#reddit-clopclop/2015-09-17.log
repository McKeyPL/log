[03:21:27] <Princesssluttershy> no response from steam support yet D:
[03:21:41] <weisey> they are notoriously slow unfortunately
[03:22:17] <weisey> did you provide proof of ownership, eg paypal reciept/picture of a retail key that you used on steam?
[03:23:14] <Princesssluttershy> They said I should be able to use my credit card to verify so I used that
[03:25:42] <Flame> o.o
[03:25:43] <Flame> horny
[03:26:06] <Princesssluttershy> like the people who stole my account left it in family view mode
[03:26:20] <Princesssluttershy> and I can't change it because they changed the email associated with my steam account
[03:26:35] <Princesssluttershy> but steam should have sent me a text
[03:27:29] <Princesssluttershy> I set up my phone thing literally last night
[03:27:45] <Princesssluttershy> and it sent me one confirm thing but never told me anything about changing my email address
[03:28:05] <Princesssluttershy> now I can't even verify that they haven't changed the phone number
[03:28:13] <Princesssluttershy> again because it's in family view
[03:30:23] <Princesssluttershy> I did lock my account though as soon as I found out they changed my confirmation email address
[03:32:13] <iamalion> whats family view
[03:32:36] <Princesssluttershy> I dunno but it only lets you see some games and you can't go to the store or your friends list
