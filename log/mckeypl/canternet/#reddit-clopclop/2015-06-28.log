[23:14:41] <Flame> I probably won't do this, but if I were to learn two more languages for the world I'd learn Chinese and Russian...
[23:15:08] <Flame> Since Russian gets you quite far in Eastern Europe, and Chinese...well, look where the world's goin!
[23:20:16] <Flame> One thing I really got into at one point was Nintendo Asia distribution for the NES/Famicom. It's a convoluted mess, really. The Famicom was released in Hong Kong as a "HK" version (along with the Disk Drive, though it appears to be a rebrand, opposed to the Famicom which had its own model number)
[23:21:03] <Flame> Also the NES was released in a "Hong Kong" and "Asia" versions, which are nearly indistinguishable. I hypothesize that this move was to counter the "NES10 chip"-less Famicom and to "combat piracy" which was rampandt.
[23:21:30] <Flame> Also, the Famicom saw a VERY limited Taiwan release, with its own version with "Nintendo" in Chinese/Taiwanese right above the english Nintendo logo.
[23:21:36] <Flame> as shown here: http://scanlines16.com/en/blog-3/retro-gaming/nintendo-nes-famicom/famicom-from-taiwan-et-autres-histoires-sur-la-distribution-asiatique/
