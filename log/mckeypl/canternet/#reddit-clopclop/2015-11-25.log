[16:13:47] <Compu> i found my mom's old droid razr maxx, everything on it still works perfectly
[16:14:53] <Compu> newest android OS it will go to is 4.1.2
[16:16:45] <Compu> anyways, i wiped it and got the OS up to to date and gave it to my friend to use as basically the android equivalent of an ipod touch, with google maps' new fully offline feature he can even use it with GPS
[16:18:02] <Compu> also it will probably last longer on battery with no sim card since it should turn off the cellular antenna
[16:19:47] <Serene_Flow> Sounds like a great find.
[16:20:22] <Compu> yeah its the phone she had before she got an s4, now she has an s6
[16:21:12] <Compu> weirdly enough it has an app storage partition and an internal storage partition instead of 1 combined partition for both
[16:21:21] <Compu> 16 GB internal total
[16:23:15] <Compu> oh also it has micro hdmi and micro usb on the top oddly enough

[21:44:00] <cloppyhooves> It was lying on the ground and I was about to pick it up
[21:44:03] <cloppyhooves> Then it got up
[21:44:07] <cloppyhooves> And I apologized for not feeding it
[21:44:15] <cloppyhooves> But it said it was okay 'cause it had eaten bugs off my windowsill
[21:44:26] <cloppyhooves> Then I held it on my finger and let it nibble on my thumbnail to hone its beak
