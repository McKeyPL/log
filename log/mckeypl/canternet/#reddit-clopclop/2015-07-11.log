[00:25:06] <Connor> Impossible 
[00:25:17] <Vulpixbew> thats only 2800 a day
[00:25:26] <Vulpixbew> thats extremely doable
[00:25:41] <Connor> That's like 2800 more than I make a day 
[00:26:54] <Katiepony> 20k isn't difficult to make in a week.
[00:28:21] <Katiepony> Doing all the old cata raids on 25hc nets around 7k alone, in a few hours
