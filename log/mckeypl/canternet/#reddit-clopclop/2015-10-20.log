[16:12:17] <RubyPinch> more like a weekend-at-a-time kinda thing
[16:12:51] <RubyPinch> only things allowed to be brought in are a knife, and clothes, so no cheatin

[16:17:18] <Cel> I imagined living in a special village for 3 years... taking care of only corn and chickens^^
[16:17:40] <RubyPinch> I'd be a bit more industrious
[16:18:05] <RubyPinch> the main questions then though, are how the fuck do I get enough ore to make some metal?
[16:19:25] <Cel> that's where the trading part comes in... I'd sell eggs and corn and electricity (It wouldn't be an amish village... we'd have solar, wind and water power)
[16:23:58] <Cel> also, I always wanted to build a solar forge
[16:24:23] <RubyPinch> metal kinda precludes a bit of that
[16:26:47] <Cel> how? like I said, trading... I'm not gonna construct a mine, but you could get scrap and recycle it
[16:27:29] <RubyPinch> ah, see I was more thinking like, anti-modern structure with my idea
[16:27:44] <RubyPinch> so for example, scrap would be cheatin
[16:29:49] <Cel> yea but you can't go olden times... surface ore is almost depleted, even if you want to do mining... without industry machinery you couldn't get it out of the earth in a sufficient amount
[16:30:14] <Cel> so I wouldn't call it cheating since you don't just buy bars
[16:30:49] <Cel> it's ore... just not rock ore, it's old car ore^^
[16:33:07] <RubyPinch> mmm, mayb
[16:35:21] <Vulpixbrew> Ive been listening to what dpoe4s the fox say for like 30 minutes now
[16:35:46] <RubyPinch> hmm, maybe a sort of, people who contribute to sellable goods (e.g. bowls, cutlery, etc etc etc), can build up the land-livers funds, and there can also be a shopping list as well
