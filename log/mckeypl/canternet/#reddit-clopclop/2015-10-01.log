[21:10:35] <RubyPinch>  unpopular opinion puffing: the only reason why C:SL is popular in any form is because EA stuffed up
[21:11:33] <Araiya> EA has no input on my opinion: They're on the no buy list until I get closure from the original Mirror's Edge. Cities XL is a Montecristo/Focus Home Entertainment blunder.
[21:11:41] <Wolfy> I like ea
[21:12:16] <Araiya> And I do mean blunder. SecuROM, which they finally did away with, but every Cities XL release has been the same damned game with the same damned bugs, and no new features. :)
[21:12:29] <RubyPinch> Araiya: much of the C:SL campaigning was directly in the wake of EA's Sim City stuffups, I mean
[21:13:28] <Araiya> Heh. I'm sure a good chunk of it was targeted at CXL, though. I'm only trying it because I need a city tinkering game that doesn't puke when I lay a bus line.
[21:14:15] <Araiya> Now that I can get refunds on things on Steam if I don't like 'em, it's a reasonable test.
