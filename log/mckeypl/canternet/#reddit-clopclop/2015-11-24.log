[16:28:46] <Serene_Flow> I've only been here for some months now.

[16:37:56] <Serene_Flow> So what are your pets like?
[16:38:54] <Setzertrancer> Very kinky, into BDSM. I like to watch them hurt themselves.
[16:39:23] <Serene_Flow> They have pet names?

[17:07:18] <Setzertrancer> That was a shame, I invested a lot of time and work into that.
[17:07:42] <Setzertrancer> Hmm? What's this zootopia about?
[17:07:46] <Wolfie> I say it needs to be restarted. I remember playing a lot on it
[17:07:51] <Wolfie> it's disneys new film

[17:08:12] <Wolfie> with animals in it! 
[17:08:40] <Serene_Flow> Furry, the movie.

[17:17:58] <Setzertrancer> Interesting.
[17:18:25] <Setzertrancer> So i'm now negotiating how much control I have over my new pet's penis.
[17:18:42] <Setzertrancer> I'm a big fan of tease and denial,
[17:19:05] <thaostra> I wonder what I should do when I reach 100,000 karma. I could probably post a guide on how I work with images
[17:20:13] <Setzertrancer> Ah yeah, this chatroom is the only reason I ever go on reddit. I suppose you have been invested for many years now Ostra.
[17:21:22] <thaostra> Mhm
[17:22:03] <thaostra> My Reddit account will officially reach its 4th year in May, and by then I might have enough karma from all of the posts I made in the sub
[17:22:26] <Serene_Flow> I don't really go to Reddit. I'm kinda a 4chan guy.
[17:22:45] <RNGsus> 4chan's layout confuses me
[17:23:12] <Serene_Flow> Weird. That's who I feel about Reddit.
[17:23:18] <Serene_Flow> *how
[17:24:18] <RNGsus> Whenever i go to a new page on 4chan it shows some of the same posts
[17:25:04] <Serene_Flow> Yeah, cause it's updating. ANd some of those post got knock back a page.
[17:25:37] <RNGsus> Yeah that is silly to me
[17:25:58] <thaostra> Reddit is nice if you're someone like me who wants those sweet internet points
[17:26:16] <Setzertrancer> Epeen!
[17:26:30] <thaostra> Clearly I'm compensating for something
[17:26:36] <Setzertrancer> I earned a fair amount of Epeen on Youtube and Fimfiction :)
[17:31:07] <thaostra> I got almost 75k. Is my epeen big enough?
[17:31:16] <Serene_Flow> I never do anything big, so I don't try to grow any epeen.
[17:31:56] <RNGsus> i have tiny epeen

[18:54:13] <Wolfie> lool
[18:56:55] <Setzertrancer> Well, looks like the one I favoured finds my lack of interest in RP a turn off anyway :(
[18:57:27] <Wolfie> rp is awesome
[18:57:49] <Setzertrancer> Yeah, but it's kinda losing it's charm for me after 6 years.
[18:58:18] <Setzertrancer> I mean once I've already RPed my ultimate fantasy, it's all kinda boring from then on.
[18:58:57] <Wolfie> pff
[18:59:35] <Setzertrancer> Well that's the way I see it.
[19:00:23] <Setzertrancer> Someone wants me to rp now and sometime I go along with it and they just repeat scenes I already played out 4 years ago and I yawn.
[19:00:55] <Setzertrancer> Then I make an excuse, 'Oh um, I realized I have an appointment'.
[19:01:40] <RNGsus> I just dont like rping in general
[19:01:48] <RNGsus> and that sucks so hard
[19:03:07] <iamalion> i do it every once in a while with a few select people
[19:04:23] <Setzertrancer> Apparently I'm really good at it.
[19:04:47] <iamalion> ^
[19:04:48] <RNGsus> man /r/stallionstuffers needs so much more content
[19:05:05] <Setzertrancer> I really upset a RP partner of mine when I kept knocking back his invitations to continue our Fillyshy X human RP.
[19:06:21] <iamalion> eh see i dont get into it that much
[19:06:24] <iamalion> just first person
[19:07:04] <Setzertrancer> Mmmm can't really top underage fluttershy BDSM Yum :)
[19:08:10] <iamalion> ¯\(°_o)/¯
[19:08:29] <Setzertrancer> Yeah I'm a pervert.
[19:08:41] <iamalion> whatever gives your vessel buoyancy
[19:08:49] <Setzertrancer> Mine if I share some human porn? Or is that not allowed?
[19:09:27] <iamalion> uhh its shared every once in a while, it really depends
[19:09:31] <iamalion> cloppyhooves or weisey could clarify
[19:09:33] <iamalion> ¯\(°_o)/¯
[19:09:45] <RNGsus> Usually whenever its not pone porn i just tag it as [human]
[19:09:50] <Wolfie> according to rules it's ok when it's tagged
[19:09:54] <Setzertrancer> It's pretty tame. I'll just go ahead

[19:17:06] <Wolfie> pet play is fun
[19:20:42] <iamalion> tumblr users: how do i message someone on tumblr?
[19:22:12] <thaostra> Follow them for a while
[19:22:38] <thaostra> Or send them an ask and hope they understand you mean it like a PM
[19:23:54] <Wolfie> sounds like it takes a while
[19:23:57] <Setzertrancer> Well this new pet has convinced me to RP with him.
