[10:15:17] <Wolfie> what's up
[10:15:23] <PlumsNThings> Cloppy. The first thing that made me sexually active is when I found an image of pinkie with a strap on. I live in the kink
[10:16:01] <PlumsNThings> I forgot to book mark it because its dear to my heart
[10:16:49] <Serene_Flow> I'm not upset that I think I'm a loser for not having sex yet. It's just something I wouldn't mind doing just so I can do it and hopefully enjoy it a bit.
[10:17:04] <Squirrelly> Heh
[10:17:16] <Squirrelly> I mean, I did plenty of sex-related things back in high school
[10:17:29] <PlumsNThings> *shrugs* I will agree with you Serene 
[10:17:41] <Squirrelly> But I didn't actually get a penis into my vajayjay until college

[13:34:32] <Amber> screwbots are alright o-o not that into that one though
[13:35:35] <AstralMouse> for context, i haven't actually played much o.o i failed miserably on the golf one, but my roommate is pretty good at it, so i watched her some. she did some levels facing away from the tv
[13:35:50] <AstralMouse> so, i just mean the music itself :3
[13:36:36] <Amber> I was talking about the music, myself :p
[13:36:55] <Amber> But yeah some levels like Flock Step are way easier when you just dont look at the game 
[13:37:05] <AstralMouse> ah :3
[13:37:18] <AstralMouse> the end of flock step is so cruel o.o
