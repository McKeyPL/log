[08:55:46] <Vulpixbrew> dont forget skooma addict
[08:56:20] <Moka> uuuuuu I don't want to get my clothes back on and go to sleep, but I must D:
[08:56:34] <expatriate> clothes are dumb
[08:56:41] <Nigiri> Why do you need clothes to sleep? 
[08:56:52] <RubyPinch> https://i.imgur.com/VfbmE1N.jpg nosebaby
[08:58:28] <expatriate> you know
[08:58:44] <expatriate> I was pretty sure I didn't want to click on a picture tagged "nosebaby"
[08:58:53] <expatriate> but I decided to risk it
[08:59:13] <expatriate> and I'm thinking I should have gone with my gut
[08:59:37] <RubyPinch> I can't stop laughing at the baby in the nose though
[09:00:31] <RubyPinch> he looks so fed up
[09:01:33] <PuppyGirl> That's horrifying
[09:03:03] <RubyPinch> :<
[09:04:45] <Vulpixbrew> anyone see the new superman vs batman trailer?
[09:05:18] <expatriate> is there a new new one, or just the same one that's playing in front of The Force Awakens?
[09:05:49] <Vulpixbrew> that one
[09:05:54] <expatriate> yes
[09:05:57] <Vulpixbrew> the one with Doomsday
[09:07:17] <expatriate> it's the first one that has made me want to see the movie
[09:07:43] <Vulpixbrew> meh I'm thinking they will have two much happening in it
[09:08:23] <expatriate> well it's Zack Snyder so that's kind of a given
[09:09:17] <Vulpixbrew> Spiderman 3 and Fanstic four 2 had the same issues
[09:09:24] <PuppyGirl> Yeah
[09:09:46] <PuppyGirl> I like Wonder Woman, but I don't feel like she needs to be there...
[09:10:27] <expatriate> I think the Batman v Superman to Dawn of Justice ratio is going to be heavily skewed to the latter
[09:10:45] <expatriate> like, they'll be friends by the midpoint of the movie
[09:11:39] <expatriate> and the rest of it will be them fighting doomsday, setting up uhhhhh shit jesse eisenberg's character as a villain, and forming the justice league
[09:12:06] <expatriate> and probably other JL members will show up "unexpectedly"
[09:12:34] <Vulpixbrew> problaly
[09:12:47] <Vulpixbrew> not gonna see it till the dvd drops anyways
[09:13:51] <expatriate> I just really don't care about superman or the justice league in general
[09:14:09] <Vulpixbrew> Superman is boring
[09:14:17] <expatriate> I don't even really like batman much outside of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight
[09:14:53] <Vulpixbrew> I'm more looking forward to Civil War
[09:15:05] <expatriate> fuck yeah 
[09:15:59] <Vulpixbrew> I really hope they skip World War Hulk though
[09:16:08] <expatriate> hahahaha my friend wants to write that
[09:16:28] <expatriate> I don't have any faith at all that it would be good
[09:16:34] <expatriate> and even if it was good, no one would see it
