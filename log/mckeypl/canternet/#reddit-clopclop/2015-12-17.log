[00:02:25] <ponder> I am a fan of a nice big throbbing kek
[00:02:49] <Wolfy> I bought a poster today
[00:03:09] <weisey> What of, Wolfy ?
[00:03:10] <ponder> I read that as "paster", and though "when did Wolfy become southern?"
[00:03:20] <Wolfy> Think this office needs a bit of livening since all the plants are dead
[00:03:26] <weisey> XD
[00:03:32] <Psi> I didn't realize you could buy one...even in the south
[00:03:34] <Wolfy> Classic Star Wars IV one
[00:03:34] <ponder> You should get some plastic plants
[00:03:47] <weisey> Nice!
[00:03:50] <ponder> paster as in "pasta" with a southern accent
[00:03:54] <weisey> Movie poster?
[00:03:56] <Wolfy> I had minty and a couple of cactuses but they managed to die for some reason

[00:04:37] <Wolfy> I don't think it was even shown here
[00:04:43] <Psi> haha oh...my mistake...
[00:04:46] <ponder> There are very few, if any, posters in icelandic, if the source material isn't icelandic itself.
[00:05:16] <ponder> Iceland seems very anti-dub for anything other than children's stuff
[00:05:17] <Wolfy> Empire was shown I think since my science teacher told us about seeing it as a kid in the 80s
[00:05:21] <Wolfy> Oh yeah
[00:05:22] <ponder> Which I am ok with
[00:05:30] <Wolfy> Definitely
[00:05:38] <Wolfy> There's the usual Disney dubs
[00:05:53] <ponder> Yu-gi-oh was shown in english when it aired on TV here.
[00:05:57] <ponder> Just had icelandic subtitles
[00:05:59] <Wolfy> And Dreamworks Wubs
[00:07:33] <Wolfy> I just remember the horse cartoon thing where it was very unfortunately dubbed
[00:07:54] <ponder> A cartoon about horses? The fuck you talking about?
[00:09:09] <Wolfy> Where a guy was about to tame a horse  "I'm going to ride you" and it comes out as "I'm going to fuck you"
[00:09:20] <Psi> lol!
[00:09:38] <Wolfy> The "N√∫ √¶tla √©g a√∞ r√≠√∞a √æ√©r"

[00:12:57] <weisey> I have no idea 
[00:13:22] <ponder> √≠ is pronounced as "ee" and √∞ is pronounced as "th"
[00:13:27] <Wolfy> √ê is just a softer √æ which is basically a th

[00:13:40] <ponder> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqBmR1FcucM
[00:15:02] <Wolfy> Then there's √° which is ow

[00:18:16] <weisey> Most coins are in the bin Wolfy 
[00:18:45] <weisey> Only bit, lite, name, and feather ever held any perm value
[00:18:47] <Wolfy> It was hilarious when it started
[00:19:10] <ponder> I never got into all that stuff
[00:19:10] <Wolfy> Everyone got a set amount of coins here and then it just slowly died

[05:58:52] <HentaiClop> Hi ^^
[05:59:10] <HentaiClop> Hey Futashy ,what are u doing ?
[06:01:04] <Futashy> just finished some cs:go, relaxing now :3
[06:01:13] <HentaiClop> Cool ^^
[06:01:19] <Frosty> Okami for lofe
[06:01:34] <Princesssluttershy> Hello Yoshimi 
[06:02:16] <HentaiClop> Hey Futashy , what's your nick on Steam ?
[06:02:41] <Yoshimi> I just realized something. Shouldn't all the rats at the begining of fallout 1 be dead? Like what have they just been living in that cave for the past 100 or so years eating nothing? Has nothing found them and eaten them yet in 100 years?
[06:03:15] <Katiepony> They've been eating radiation
[06:03:17] <Katiepony> :3
[06:03:28] <Yoshimi> ah that makes sense
[06:03:52] <Futashy> i spend all my fallout time just building houses and decorating
[06:03:55] <Futashy> its kinda sad :P
[06:04:38] <Katiepony> I met the dog in fallout 4, let him follow me for 30 seconds before I got tired of his footstep noises
[06:04:45] <Katiepony> Then opened the console and deleted him
[06:05:00] <Yoshimi> I decided to not buy fallout 4. I couldn't afford a pc and my dad got a xbox one so I could have gotten it but it seems it's getting a lot of mixed reviews.
[06:05:04] <Katiepony> Then found out he's required for a later quest.
[06:06:46] <HentaiClop> Well... i live on Brazill and here the price of consoles it's very high
[06:08:03] <Futashy> poor brazil :(
[06:08:43] <HentaiClop> Yeah :c
[06:08:59] <HentaiClop> But... i still can have fun with my PC
[06:10:18] <Yoshimi> I'm still having lots of fun with the classic games.
[06:10:49] <Futashy> i only use my console for kinect at this point lol
[06:11:04] <HentaiClop> lol , cool xD
[06:12:11] <Futashy> dance central is too fun to give up :/
[06:12:41] <HentaiClop> I think Dance Central it's the only game who i liked on Kinect
[06:12:47] <Yoshimi> can you gamble in fallout 4?
[06:14:32] <Yoshimi> I can't wait til oculus porn games are perfected
[06:16:22] <Yoshimi> http://i.imgur.com/2CVDTsk.jpg 
[06:17:41] <Futashy> um, what?
[06:17:50] <Futashy> is that your... biggest fan?
[06:17:58] <HentaiClop> Oh my hahaha xD
