[03:10:17] <Connor> What's those things? 
[03:12:35] <Araiya> Well, writing a thought I have about how hard it is to pay people without PayPal, and then Skyforge is a new MMO. Supposedly Sci-Fi, but there's a lot of high fantasy blended in.
[03:13:17] <Connor> Ooh is it free? 
[03:14:06] <Araiya> Yeah, it is. It's interesting, so far. Combat system is starting to grow on me -- less managing it than when I play Anarchy Online.

[09:00:11] <Plums> so like a peer to peer thing?
[09:00:19] <weisey> If one gets disconnected from the others
[09:00:38] <weisey> All the users connected to that server, will appear to have quit
