[07:39:10] * Wolfy clumsily curls around the cup but kinda lays on his back with his legs in thevairc
[07:40:11] * Wolfy snoozes for a couple more minutes
[07:46:13] <Moka> Chiv, yes indeed
[07:47:24] * Moka scritchyscratches down Chiv's mane and upper back ^^
[07:48:26] * Chiv shivers. God that's nice.

[07:50:11] <Chiv> I'd offer to reciprocate, buuut i'm not sure hooves would be better than your paws at this ~w~
[07:50:37] * Chiv would still give it a shot, though!
[07:51:08] <Moka> Snuggles are pretty great c:
[07:51:18] * Moka giggles and continues, laying against Chiv's side happily ^^
[07:51:44] <Chiv> Then as soon as your done, prepare for the snuggalocalypse!
[07:51:51] * Chiv had to stretch for that one.
[07:53:04] * Moka giggles and foxpurrs happily ^^
[07:58:22] * Chiv for now rolls for easier back access.
[08:01:11] * Wolfy tosses his alarm clock across the room

[08:09:55] * Chiv stretches said wings out wide almost automatically. He might literally melt into the floor at this rate.
[08:10:42] <Moka> :3c
[08:10:50] <Chiv> ~ω~
[08:10:56] * Moka giggles and continues, happily taking in the sight of an extremely adorable pegasus! ^^

[08:14:15] <Cyan_Spark> Hey there!
[08:14:16] * Chiv lightly waves, not wishing to disrupt Moka's work.
[08:15:26] <Moka> :3c
[08:15:36] * Moka wiggles happily, continues kneading and scritching Chiv
[08:17:05] <Chiv> You seem to be pretty practiced at this, Moka. Should start a company
[08:17:27] <Moka> Not practiced! Just persistent!
[08:17:51] <Chiv> Mmm, either way, consistent good results!

[08:22:25] <Chiv> but...once they're in ya, ya can't see the gloaw anyways, can ya? :P
[08:22:54] <Moka> but Chiv! glow in the dark is awesome!
[08:23:04] <Moka> i wanted my nails to be glow-in-the-dark for the rave I'm going to
[08:24:16] <Chiv> But you can SEE those. Can't see a glowy dick in your butt
[08:24:18] <Chiv> unless it's like
[08:24:20] <Chiv> super glowy
[08:24:24] <Chiv> and shows through your abdomen
[08:24:27] <Chiv> which would be neat
[08:25:06] <expatriate> though slightly disconcerting
[08:25:38] <Chiv> still cool though!
[08:25:42] <expatriate> new from Bad Dragon: "Glowing One"
[08:25:56] <Vulpixbrew> it should be noted fun sex is pushing somebody against the wall, attacking their neck, going down pulling down pants and or lifting up skirt, hands play with naughty bits followed by a good rousing bit of oral then a nice good pounding till orgasm
[08:26:04] * Chiv wishes he had a glow-dick like some of those dragon chaps do
[08:26:10] <expatriate> have you spent so long in the wasteland that ghouls give you a hardon? just the toy for you
[08:26:25] <Chiv> also where'd that come from vulpix o.o
[08:26:47] <y007ghg7> Chiv, my bd toy can light up my room when there is a UV light near it
[08:26:52] <y007ghg7> it gets so bright
[08:26:56] <Moka> Vulpixbrew that does sound like fun
[08:28:20] <Chiv> so
[08:28:22] <Chiv> if it's in you
[08:28:29] <Chiv> and you put a UV light by the base
[08:28:35] <Chiv> could you see it? o.o

[08:39:04] <expatriate> moka
[08:39:09] <expatriate> if we put you in a hot tub
[08:39:12] <Chiv> Fun fact: Apples are a great, non-caffeinated way to get yourself awake in the morning :D
[08:39:13] <expatriate> does it become coffee?
[08:39:24] * Chiv figures apple taste should work, too.
[08:40:22] <Moka> yes, expatriate 
[08:40:26] <Moka> but you can just skip all that
[08:40:28] <Moka> and lick me :3
[08:40:32] <expatriate> follow up question
[08:40:34] * Moka is delicious!
[08:40:42] <expatriate> is that how Wolfy is currently preparing his coffee?
[08:40:49] <Chiv> Moka is a spirit of coffee incarnate

[08:45:23] * Wolfy squints
[08:45:48] * Chiv totally has another wing availableeeee~
[08:46:25] <Wolfy> I just make my coffee with fine ass coffee grounds
[08:47:11] <expatriate> PegasusPerk #467: 6 limbs allows for more possibilities for snuggling positions
[08:48:02] <Chiv> Correct! Though Moka has been proving the versatility of paws with claws for back scratching purposes
[08:48:09] <Chiv> It's a very strong case.
[08:49:08] <expatriate> oh, you shouldn't underestimate what a clever pony can do with their hoof
[08:49:22] <expatriate> maybe I'll show you sometime ;)
[08:49:42] <Chiv> I mean, if you think you can scratch a back better than Moka can...
[08:50:21] * Moka giggles and wags her tail happily
[08:51:36] <Cyan_Spark> Pegasus? :o
[08:52:18] <expatriate> I don't fully understand the question
[08:52:44] <Chiv> Feel free to demonstrate!
[08:52:59] * Chiv will certainly not turn down a second round of back scratching!
[08:53:25] <expatriate> no I meant Cyan

[08:54:29] <cloppyhooves> Hoofs are a close second place!
[08:54:33] <cloppyhooves> Feets are less good D:
[08:54:51] <Chiv> I claim hooves as superior for deep tissue massages, at least!
[08:55:11] * Cyan_Spark catches expatriate before they touch the ground and rolls under them, hugging from beneath!
[08:55:13] <expatriate> it's not a real massage if you can walk after it
[08:55:29] <Chiv> but yes toe beans are cute
[08:55:36] <Moka> Paws are great :D
[08:55:45] <Chiv> Just like little foxes!

[08:57:58] <Chiv> Oh, uh, sorry vulpix >.<
[08:58:13] * expatriate is apologetic but is currently on substances that would impair his ability to safely give pony massages

[18:56:00] <Fleur> I am glad that meets with approval, monsieur!
[18:56:43] * Fleur does, in fact, taste like mint all over. The smell itself seems to be the only thing limited to her hair.
[18:57:07] <Fleur> Affectionate, are you not?
[18:57:53] * Fleur tentatively reaches out to give the wolf a behind the ear scratch too.
[18:58:04] <Wolfy> Very, mint is my favouriteeeaaahh...
[18:58:25] * Wolfy melts a little and leans his head a bit to the side, lulling his tongue out
[18:59:11] * Fleur giggles again.
[18:59:18] <Fleur> I am glad I meet with such hearty approval, then!
[19:00:10] * Fleur scritches under his chin next. She would be surprised if she met a canine that *didn't* love that spot getting scratched.
[19:01:09] <Wolfy> Aaahh.. no surprises here..
[19:01:37] * Wolfy nuzzles into Fleur's soft and minty fur

[19:05:06] <Fleur> Well then, if you have any other itches, just point me to them and I shall take care of them summarily!
