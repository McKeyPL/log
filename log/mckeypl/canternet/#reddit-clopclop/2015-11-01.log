[00:27:28] <wolfie> 3 yrs
[00:29:53] <RubyPinch> and 23 days, 6 hours, and 52 minutes
[00:30:04] <ShelDawG> Holy crap, It was like my first time on /r/mlp, all they post is images and comments to those images. I was like "Why aren't they just posting on /mlp/?" Was weird.
[00:30:31] <SenorOso> It has to do with the fact that le reddit hates the community.
[00:30:48] <SenorOso> "You guys are bullies"
[00:31:27] <ShelDawG> Not even just reddit, it's tons of other places. It's no hidden fact that lots of people in this fandom have thin skin
[00:31:39] <SenorOso> That's the same with anything.
[00:31:50] <SenorOso> I had a LONG discussion with my boss about this today.
[00:31:57] <SenorOso> Why be offended by anything?
[00:32:02] <ShelDawG> In what context?
[00:32:09] <SenorOso> Anything.
[00:32:18] <SenorOso> Why should anything anyone says offend you.
[00:32:36] <ShelDawG> Ah, so just in general. Yeah it's all a choice, you can't blame anybody for being offended but themselves.
[00:32:38] <weisey> >inb4 terrible trolling attempt ban
[00:32:43] <SenorOso> Offend meaning to disgust or hurt your feelings rather than violate something.
[00:33:04] <ShelDawG> That doesn't excuse malicious behavior, but regardless, you do have a part to play in the matter.
[00:33:08] <SenorOso> I get called a faggot an uncountable amount of times a day.
[00:33:12] <SenorOso> Do I care? 
[00:33:31] <SenorOso> If they want to be negative let them be, they'll get their own in time.
[00:33:39] <ShelDawG> That would be unfortunate if I got banned. Perhaps I should have read the rules prior to posting. I did read them though, and plan to follow them.
[00:33:51] <SenorOso> >reading rules
[00:33:57] <SenorOso> I cant read.
[00:34:11] <ShelDawG> i wish I couldent, I hate reading.

[20:17:58] <thaostra> iamalion, For a new RAID it's definitely worth considering. btrfs has a lot of useful features like integrated RAID and multi-device management, snapshots, subvolumes, compression, and incremental backups which work nicely for systems with multiple storage devices
[20:18:54] <iamalion> I dont need any of that though, all I need is a way to combine multiple disks into one big one. with mdadm thats easy. This is my backup server, so all my machines back up to this box

[20:19:58] <iamalion> /dev/md1  5.5T  4.7T    486G  91%    /media/storage
[20:20:35] <thaostra> With btrfs it's even easier because all of the backup and RAID features are at the filesystem level, as well as more efficient
[20:23:00] <thaostra> It's also more robust than ext4 in a lot of situations. There are plenty of anecdotes where users found that numerous sectors on their disk were corrupted, yet btrfs was able to automatically handle them to avoid file corruption
[20:25:21] <iamalion> hmmm the setup looks easier for sure

[20:28:22] <thaostra> The systemd project is looking to utilizing btrfs subvolumes for packages because instead of sending a tarball with traditional debs, your OS receives a snapshot which is basically a diff from your current version to the latest upstream version, therefore using less bandwidth. It also has the advantage of seamless rollbacks if the version you receive doesn't work correctly
[20:36:26] <iamalion> meh that doesnt worry me at all

[22:16:49] <thaostra> It makes sense to use the best backup utility available for each OS, in this case on Linux it'd be btrfs snapshots where you could do hourly or bi-hourly backups that take <1min each. There's nothing stopping you from continuing to use rsync on OSs that have inferior backup features
[22:17:06] <iamalion> ah yeah
[22:17:38] <iamalion> well thing is the only linux boxes I run are the camera server, which I just keep a disk image of / around incase it explodes, and the actual backup server itself, which i also have a disk image of.
[22:17:48] <iamalion> all my other linux boxes run virtually on my server 2012 machines

[23:08:55] <cloppyhooves> How many of y'all would call yourself natural bottoms?
[23:11:41] <Wolfie> Elaborate?
[23:12:20] <cloppyhooves> For people who like to bottom and it's really easy for them
[23:12:27] <cloppyhooves> Like doesn't take much prep or isn't too hard to get ready
[23:12:51] <Wolfie> Aah. I was gonna say my bottom is completely natural
[23:12:59] <Wolfie> But I'm a natural subway
[23:13:06] <Wolfie> No damn
[23:13:09] <Wolfie> Dominos
[23:14:01] <Wolfie> I'm an apex bedator
[23:17:09] <iamalion> ughghghghh
[23:17:13] <iamalion> my dog is so damn sturbborn
[23:17:18] <iamalion> she hasnt pooped in two days now
[23:21:54] * Wolfie nudges a slice towards cloppyhooves
[23:22:34] <Cel> after a while of consideration... I'm a part time natural bottom^^
[23:22:36] * cloppyhooves gives a gracious yip, and noms it happily with a waggy tail c:
[23:24:44] <Wolfie> I consider myself a switch but leaning on dom
[23:24:57] <Wolfie> Gotta get some variation every now and then
[23:27:18] <Cel> I'm a switch too, but I part time during bottom... I might just suddenly stop^^
[23:29:49] <Wolfie> Ooo yeah
[23:31:13] <cloppyhooves> I'm a switch and I like bottoming
[23:31:18] <cloppyhooves> But it's really hard for me and takes a lot of prep D:
[23:31:34] <Wolfie> Awwh :(
[23:31:39] <cloppyhooves> By which I mean specifically being penetrated
[23:31:48] <Rylee> i tried to bottom earlier today and failed >.>
[23:31:58] <Rylee> if you have tips plz inform me
[23:32:23] <Wolfie> I got A tip :D
[23:32:31] <Cel> it's a solid one
[23:33:15] * Wolfie lightly scritches cloppy behind the ear
[23:33:32] <Cel> I prefer the easy things. being a doormat and such^^ not much work to do
[23:33:33] * cloppyhooves foxpurrs and wags her tail

[23:34:15] <HeartLinda> that dick just looks so out of place
[23:34:20] <Rylee> jesus christ dick
[23:34:50] <Wolfie> :D
[23:35:13] <Wolfie> Knot's looking good
[23:36:05] <Wolfie> That wolf's face is like "I feel faint from the lack of blood to my head"
[23:36:41] <iamalion> that looks so stupid
[23:37:23] <Wolfie> I dunno. I like it :P
[23:37:31] <Wolfie> It's abstract from the norm
[23:39:39] <Wolfie> Either way, I like domming and subbing occasionally and I dunno, it comes pretty easy so far
[23:40:04] <Wolfie> But you know what I like more than domming or subbing?
[23:40:11] <Vulpixbrew> wat if thats the Wolfie
[23:40:25] * Vulpixbrew wags his tail at the wolf giving him bedroom eyes
[23:40:56] <Wolfie> That is an irl pic of me although it's just a shade darker than my fur
[23:41:13] * Wolfie lightly nibbles on Vulpix
[23:42:45] * Cel swayes
[23:42:58] <Wolfie> But what I do like is having fun, and sleeping but that's irrelevant
[23:43:55] * Wolfie curls around Vulpix
[23:45:19] <Cel> you like having fun? how dare you!
[23:45:55] <Wolfie> I like having fun! And I'm gonna have fun and I'm gonna like it!
[23:46:26] <Wolfie> Look! I'm having so much fun!
[23:46:38] <Cel> nuuu

[23:53:00] * Wolfie bounces to try to nip at the butterflies
[23:54:59] <Cel> don't, butterflies are dangerous! much more dangerous than fun!
[23:55:51] <Wolfie> But they're tasty :c
[23:56:36] <Cel> but... hurricanes and time vortexes and a sack of rice falling over!... rice!
[23:57:43] <Wolfie> D: not the rice!
