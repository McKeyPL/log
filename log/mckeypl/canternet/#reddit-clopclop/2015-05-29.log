[06:42:24] <princesssluttershy> He gave me $60 in csgo weapon skins
[06:43:22] <princesssluttershy> and the day after tomorrow the streamer I was playing me with is going to give me a $15 (I think) M4A1 stattrak basilisk

[06:50:20] <princesssluttershy> Connor, how is it confusing?
[06:50:25] <princesssluttershy> you run around shooting people
[06:50:35] <princesssluttershy> sometimes planting or defusing a bomb
[06:50:53] <Connor> I don't understand why anyone would pay that much for a cosmetic
[06:51:09] <princesssluttershy> because it's fun
[06:51:13] <Squirrelly> I mean
[06:51:16] <princesssluttershy> you don't have to buy cosmetics
[06:51:20] <Squirrelly> I've bought TONS of skins in League of Legends
[06:52:09] <Connor> Yes but at least league comes with new particles and textures and isn't usually expensive
[06:52:32] <Connor> plus league is free and csgo is a paid game
[06:52:58] <Squirrelly> Eh
[06:53:01] <Squirrelly> It's not that expensive
[06:53:07] <Squirrelly> It's like $5 sometimes with steam sales
[06:53:18] <Squirrelly> I think I got it for less than that
[06:54:55] <princesssluttershy> Connor, you get free ones sometimes when you play
[06:55:06] <princesssluttershy> plus you get crates all the time
[06:55:13] <princesssluttershy> which you can either open or sell
[06:56:02] <princesssluttershy> if you sell enough cases you can get enough money to buy skins
[06:56:20] <princesssluttershy> Liek I've only actually bought like $5 worth of stuff in csgo
[06:56:36] <princesssluttershy> I sell stuff for profit and buy cooler stuff

[20:27:08] <princesssluttershy> He gave someone else on my team an M4A1 nitro field tested
[20:27:31] <princesssluttershy> and someone else a fire serpant
[20:28:16] <weisey> Provably gonna get vacced
[20:28:25] <weisey> Or was a smurf with moneys
[20:28:35] <princesssluttershy> He was playing on his smurf account
[20:28:39] <weisey> Who actually wants to help the community
[20:29:01] <princesssluttershy> He sells and buys tons of weapons on his main acocunt
[20:29:17] <princesssluttershy> He moved like 25 AWP asiimovs last week apparently
[20:30:27] <princesssluttershy> He also gave the other guy an AWP Man o War
[20:34:25] <Connor> I don't know what those are but I want them
[20:35:16] <weisey> I don't like the assimov
[20:35:27] <weisey> Or the vulcan
[20:35:36] <weisey> Sure they were cool
[20:35:37] <princesssluttershy> I like the fac new AWP one or the battlescarred p90 one
[20:35:39] <Connor> I like the ass I move :3
[20:35:47] <princesssluttershy> I prefer the Cartel to the Vulcan
[20:36:07] <weisey> But so many cooler skins are out there for the awp noe
[20:36:25] <weisey> Even non red skins 
[20:36:43] <princesssluttershy> The Asiimov is the only skin I really like for the AWP besides Redline
[20:36:58] <weisey> And the Vulcan is just gross
[20:37:17] <princesssluttershy> Yeah I really liked the Vulcan when it first came out
[20:37:28] <princesssluttershy> but now looking at them makes me want to puke
[20:37:36] <weisey> Worm god, hyperbeast, man o war 
[20:37:53] <weisey> Dragon lore
[20:37:59] <princesssluttershy> The Hyper Beast is good
[20:38:00] <weisey> All better than asiimov
[20:38:11] <princesssluttershy> I don't lik ethe man o war or dragon lore though
[20:38:27] <weisey> Have you ever played with a dragon lore?
[20:38:29] <princesssluttershy> The Worm God is alright I guess
[20:38:46] <princesssluttershy> No but I've seen them
[20:38:51] <weisey> I got an ace with a dragon lore
[20:38:55] <weisey> I felt so amazing
[20:39:06] <princesssluttershy> I hate the way the scope looks on it

[20:39:50] <princesssluttershy> If they left the scope default I would probably like it more
[20:39:51] <cloppyhooves> That response xD

[21:04:16] <princesssluttershy> It's so weird living here... two of my friends don't won computers
[21:04:32] <princesssluttershy> and like 5 of them don't have internet connections aside from at school
[21:05:19] <PegasusPrime> you're lucky... I know loads of people without pc... but everyone has an iphone... even the 8yo
[21:05:44] <princesssluttershy> I've never had friends without computers
[21:05:45] <princesssluttershy> ever
[21:06:02] <Connor> I've never had friends
[21:06:30] <princesssluttershy> Like one of my friends... his parents own 3 Ford F-250s right
[21:06:42] <princesssluttershy> he doesn't have a computer
[21:06:52] <princesssluttershy> and the only gaming console he has is a gamecube
[21:07:06] <princesssluttershy> his parents won't buy and never have bought him anything
[21:07:32] <princesssluttershy> they're one if the richest families in town and he owns like 3 shirts
[21:07:36] <PegasusPrime> one of my friends' dad drives a 911, and they have all the gaming consoles since 1980... no pc either
[21:07:46] <princesssluttershy> and he does all and I mean all of the house work at his house
[21:08:05] <PegasusPrime> rich people seem not to need pcs
[21:08:31] <princesssluttershy> His parents make this kid fix electrical problems around the house
[21:08:35] <princesssluttershy> witout any help
[21:09:24] <princesssluttershy> last week his parents made him fix one of their garage door openers
[21:09:38] <PegasusPrime> well, that's something
[21:09:44] <princesssluttershy> and if he wasn't done before they got home he would get in trouble
[21:10:17] <princesssluttershy> anyway
[21:10:23] <princesssluttershy> he fell off the ladder
[21:10:30] <princesssluttershy> sprained his wrist and got in trouble
[21:11:04] <princesssluttershy> I feel really bad for him
[21:11:12] <PegasusPrime> very strange
[21:11:35] <princesssluttershy> he can't find a job because he's autistic and has trouble talking to people
[21:12:03] <princesssluttershy> I don't know I worry about him
