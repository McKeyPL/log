[06:57:12] <Cyan_Spark> What toy? :o
[06:57:17] <y007ghg7> a flop Roland
[06:57:26] <Cyan_Spark> Mmm~
[06:57:48] <y007ghg7> heh expatriate ordered a chance after I mentioned flops
[06:57:59] <expatriate> :D

[06:58:14] <Cyan_Spark> Cool
[06:58:29] <Cyan_Spark> What's the flop?
[06:58:31] <y007ghg7> and the reason it was $60 instead of $120 https://bad-dragon.com/images/inventorytoys/a6be0777c89d12316ccc4c0ba985543a.JPG
[06:58:35] <y007ghg7> that little speck
[06:59:09] <Cyan_Spark> Woah, half off
[06:59:11] <y007ghg7> sadly it is in firm hardness, would have preferred medium
[06:59:16] <y007ghg7> but oh well
[06:59:46] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ooo~
[07:00:06] <Cyan_Spark> Hm, everyone's all into insertables and all... 
[07:00:12] <y007ghg7> expatriate's flop reason is even smaller
[07:00:20] <y007ghg7> his is a little white speck on the top
[07:00:23] <Cyan_Spark> Does anyone own penetrables? o.o
[07:00:27] <y007ghg7> thought it was dust on my screen at first
[07:00:29] <y007ghg7> a friend does
[07:00:31] <y007ghg7> he loves it
[07:00:36] <expatriate> yeah I own a mary
[07:00:51] <y007ghg7> heh, my friend has his Mary in the color of his OC
[07:00:57] <Cyan_Spark> Ah
[07:01:00] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> hot
[07:01:08] <y007ghg7> he recently ordered a 4 foot tall plushie of his OC too
[07:01:09] <y007ghg7> lol
[07:01:20] <y007ghg7> I asked him if it had a specially placed hole in it
[07:01:22] <y007ghg7> he said no
[07:01:30] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[07:01:37] <Cyan_Spark> :P
[07:01:50] <expatriate> easy enough to put in
[07:02:03] <y007ghg7> true, he did order the plushie unstuffed so shipping was cheaper
[07:02:11] <y007ghg7> so it has to have a hole somewhere
[07:03:05] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> hehe
[07:03:13] <Cyan_Spark> Ohh?
[07:04:22] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ffs >.< the lights behind engineering just blew, afk gotta check it out
[07:04:44] <expatriate> I literally built my plushie around my mary

[07:05:28] <expatriate> nah
[07:05:45] <expatriate> I was too worried someone would recognize it or something
[07:05:52] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> so you've got a "rideable" plushy?
[07:06:21] <expatriate> paranoid I know but I would like to write for cartoons someday, if this name was ever associated with my real name I would be fucked
[07:07:05] <expatriate> and I don't have the plushie anymore, was living with my parents for a bit and there was no possible way to hide it
[07:07:19] <expatriate> but it was fantastic
[07:07:40] <expatriate> once I live alone again...
