[05:20:34] <thaostra> Yes, please elaborate
[05:22:40] <thaostra> Cyan_Spark, What are you trying to accomplish for Imgur optimization
[05:23:21] <Cyan_Spark> I dunno, I heard you mention it once 
[05:23:35] <Cyan_Spark> Woah, yiffy, Evelina
[05:23:57] <Cyan_Spark> I saw the one with his underwear on x3
[05:24:36] <thaostra> Alright, well Imgur has a 5MB limit for PNGs and JPEGs that keeps them from getting re-encoded. Usually you can get them to fit within that file size by using lossless optimization
[05:25:08] <Evelina> He's so fuckin cute
[05:25:16] <thaostra> Optimizing JPEG is simple, but PNG takes several steps and is expensive

[05:26:35] <thaostra> Yes, depending on the size of the file it can take up to an hour, and even then you'll usually see 15%-25% savings at most

[22:39:48] <Flame> hiyo
[22:47:01] <Flame> oi, cities skylines uses ~5-6GB of ram for me...but it shows ~11GB being used total...and running very little else (no firefox or anything besides skype, which has ~200MB or something) :S
[22:48:52] <Cel> the rest is probably in the nonpaged pool
[22:51:08] <Flame> probably...now using 13GB
[22:51:17] <Flame> and when i close the game, it stays at ~5GB
[22:52:43] <Cel> ^^
[22:53:32] <Cel> usually it shouldn't be that big... maybe you got a leaking driver
[22:55:15] <Flame> perhaps
[22:55:42] <Flame> it may also be I have a crap tonne of assets/mods (only using 5 mods, but a lot of assets, namely trains and parks
[22:56:05] <Flame> luckily i have ~15.6GB
[22:56:07] <Cel> I thought you closed the game
[23:00:36] <Flame> when I do close it...
[23:00:43] <Flame> and 15.6GB is how much i have
[23:03:07] <Cel> yea but it stays at 5 when you close the game, so the mods shouldn't be an issue
[23:06:32] *** Quits: Cel (Cel@Silver.Horizon) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:08:57] <Flame> yeah, down to 5.6 atm
[23:09:04] <Flame> using...irssi, and basic gnome things
[23:09:09] *** Joins: Cel (Cel@Silver.Horizon)
[23:09:36] <Flame> highest ram usage: steam at 392MB and Gnome shell at 134mb
[23:12:30] * Cel shrugs
[23:12:45] <Cel> I only had something like that when I had a leaking app on my apache
[23:13:13] <Cel> the sub process didn't show and apache was on 50MB
[23:14:06] <Cel> (it didn't show because I wasn't it's user... it did show as root)
[23:23:10] <Flame> yeah :/
[23:23:11] <Flame> sorry
