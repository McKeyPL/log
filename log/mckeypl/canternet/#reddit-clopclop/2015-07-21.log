[05:57:05] <expatriate> source doesn't overwrite that

[06:00:20] <thaostra> Seems like everyone's using SFM because it's convenient even though Blender would be more powerful
[06:01:14] <Serene_Flow_> Convenient and maybe more known.
[06:02:13] <thaostra> More known for people who are already familiar with the Source engine, sure, but Blender has been around for much longer and is quite popular among the video editing community

[08:28:38] <weisey> Nah its a cool style
[08:36:54] <Flame> :3
[08:38:04] <plushie_pegasus> Flame, The tag "Herm" may be offensive to some ponies, a better tag would be "Futa" 
[08:38:30] <Flame> I was told futa would be offensive :( and the tag was put on the post itself
[08:38:47] <Flame> Sorry if I did offend
[08:39:32] <plushie_pegasus> Didn't offend me, but i know it has offended others in the past
[08:39:32] <Serene_Flow_> I hear both futa and herm are offensive.
[08:39:43] <weisey> plushie_pegasus: actually not true
[08:39:50] <weisey> Eh
[08:39:53] <weisey> Not really
[08:40:05] <thaostra> Herm is perfectly fine, but 3,3dickgirl on the other hand isn't
[08:40:06] <weisey> Futa is boobs and a dick but no vag
[08:40:15] <weisey> Herm is boobs + dick + vag
[08:40:30] <weisey> And dickgirl is incredibly offensive, yes
[08:40:59] <Squirrelly> Yeah, herm is just hermaphroditic, which is a scientific term.
[08:41:13] <weisey> This is true
[08:41:28] <Squirrelly> Granted, sometimes scientific stuff is turned into hateful speech, and becomes offensive
[08:42:25] <Squirrelly> Take "retarted" for example. It just literally means "slow", and was actually used as a more politically correct term than "idiot" or "moron", but it now has a severely offensive connotation
[08:42:38] <Squirrelly> *retarded
[08:42:43] <Squirrelly> Dammit I swear I can spell
[08:42:59] <weisey> Yeah this isn't where I meant this to go
[08:43:03] <Squirrelly> Sorry
[08:43:05] <Squirrelly> I'll hush
[08:43:22] <Squirrelly> Just wanted to make the point that political correctness is a weird thing, and changes over time.
[08:43:52] <weisey> True
[08:43:52] <Flame> x_x
[08:43:54] <Flame> :P
[08:44:28] <weisey> But tl;dr, futa and herm are fine here in reference to art
[08:44:36] <Squirrelly> Yeah
[08:45:45] <plushie_pegasus> A lot of it is the context it is used in , for example Autistic. it can be used to describe someone autistic, but can also be used as an insult. 
[08:47:05] <plushie_pegasus> For example Good: I am autistic. Bad:That guy is so autistic.
[08:47:23] <weisey> plushie...
[08:47:29] <weisey> What did I just say...

[17:00:56] <Vulpixbrew> that first part made me lol so hard
[17:05:25] <Cel> the music mafia doesn't want me to watch that^^
[17:05:45] <Vulpixbrew> ?
[17:05:55] <Cel> the video is blocked by GEMA
[17:06:11] <Vulpixbrew> wait why? its a fanmade wow video
[17:06:18] <Cel> they don't care
[17:06:25] <Cel> much original pony music is also blocked
[17:06:38] <Vulpixbrew> well shit
[17:06:47] <Cel> the video probably used a "copyrighted tune"
[17:09:23] <Vulpixbrew> thats not a good resaon
[17:10:17] <Cel> other funny things they do: special tax for each storage device because you WILL without doubt at some point record music with it... and they forbid arists to quit the contract (you can cancel the contract, but everything you make will still belong to them)
[17:10:41] <Vulpixbrew> sounds like a mafia
[17:10:46] <Cel> they are
[17:11:42] <Cel> probably because of their history
[17:12:06] <weisey> It uses a bustarhymes backing track
[17:13:18] <weisey> I thinkp
[17:14:41] <Cel> the organisation was created in 1933 for the reichsmusikkammer and called STAGMA until after the war... where it was renamed to GEMA, while keeping the management till 1989... this could explain their behaviour
[17:15:20] <Vulpixbrew> horribly behind the times and no understanidng of how the internet works?
[17:15:34] <Cel> this and "everything is ours"

[17:24:39] <weisey> It doesn't matter if you arent even german
[17:24:48] <Connor> , %
[17:24:52] <Cel> of course not... they just take everything
[17:25:06] <weisey> Unless you specifically mark your music as public domain, they assume you want them to collect fees for you 
[17:25:15] <Cel> yes

[17:27:00] <Cel> only if you want germans to view it on youtube... we are the ones who are the criminals when not paying for your music, that you don't even get money for
[17:37:07] <Cel> we have another funny organization like that... until recently they collected money for every single device that THEORETICALLY COULD BE used to recieve public broadcasts... now they just collect money for every household no matter how many devices (which is for many much more than before)
