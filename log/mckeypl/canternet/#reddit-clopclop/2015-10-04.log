[07:37:42] <Rekniller> I've got this sequence where Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash talk about their fastest orgasms, and I'm definitely out of my element here. I mean I'm pretty out of my element for the whole thing but still.
[07:37:54] <Rekniller> What's, like... a time that's realistic but embarassingly quick?
[07:38:03] <Rekniller> Can it even ever BE embarassingly quick?
[07:38:18] <Katiepony> My fastest orgasms have been after seconds... :<
[07:38:21] <plushie_pegasus> 10 seconds flat LOL
[07:38:21] <Rekniller> Or would it just be "Fuck yeah awesome"
[07:38:59] <Rekniller> I have it at twenty seconds now...
[07:40:07] <Katiepony> Well I've never been embarrassed by it. But, I'm way less sensitive than I used to be, and it takes aaaages now. I miss the convenience.
[07:40:23] <Rekniller> Is that not fast enough, then, to be "Tee-hee didn't last long didja?"
[07:40:39] <Katiepony> Pretty sure 20 seconds is fine :P
[07:40:59] <Rekniller> I really don't want to actually do a 'ten seconds flat' joke. Could do 15, though.
[07:41:48] <Rekniller> This is actually going to be the TITLE OF THE FIC so I can't really change it after, hah. Like I can, but then it's a different name and that's lame.
[07:42:14] <plushie_pegasus> The meds i take make it difficult for me to Cum, takes 15-30 min. I get right on the edge, drives me crazy(er) but the plushies love it
[07:43:50] <Rekniller> 'Fifteen Seconds' sounds like a better title than 'Twenty Seconds' I think, so, hey. Fifteen it is, I guess.

[18:06:31] <iamalion> ...
[18:06:46] <iamalion> but that defeats the purpose of using wifi
[18:06:58] <Compu> oh no it still only uses wifi
[18:07:07] <Compu> it uses data for the advanced calling
[18:07:27] <Compu> tho that doesnt mean calls get added to ur data plan
[18:07:37] <Compu> it just means theyre supposed to sound better and stuff
[18:08:17] <iamalion> but its still keeping hte data connection going
[18:08:19] <iamalion> which hurts battery
[18:08:25] <Compu> apparently it never turns the data off even if u have advanced calling off, it just keeps it on and doesnt use it
[18:08:27] <Compu> yep
[18:08:33] <Compu> but what can i do about it?
[18:08:45] <Compu> anyways when im connected to wifi im usually plugged in
[18:09:00] <Compu> cuz i like to charge my phone whenever i can
[18:09:13] <iamalion> i only charge me phone when I am sleeping
[18:10:36] <Compu> well i like to always have as much battery as possible
[18:10:55] <Compu> even if my battery lasts just fine on its own during a day
[18:11:20] <Compu> besides things like skype calls and 3D games will run any battery into the ground
[18:12:13] <Compu> also keeping that beautiful quadHD 5 inch AMOLED display on will also suck away battery

[18:12:55] <iamalion> i installed skype on my phone
[18:12:57] <iamalion> cnat see video
[18:13:10] <iamalion> and it synced my 400+ skype contacts even though i backed out of that page
[18:13:14] <iamalion> i hate skype for android
[18:16:21] <Compu> iamalion: thats why i have 2 skype accounts, my rp one and my personal one, i only do calls on my personal one and it only has maybe 20 contacts
[18:16:45] <Compu> iamalion: my personal one has more like 492 contacts
[18:17:19] <Compu> if people absolutely need to contact me while im out and about they should use telegram
[18:17:25] <iamalion> thats too much trouble for me
[18:17:27] <Compu> iamalion: telegram is an awesome app by the way
[18:17:33] <iamalion> im just irritated that it synced with my phones contacts
[18:17:43] <iamalion> meh i prefer texting
[18:17:46] <Compu> iamalion: u can turn that off in settings
[18:17:58] <iamalion> yeah but it is too late now
[18:18:02] <iamalion> its all synced and fucked
[18:18:45] <Compu> it will remove all the skype contacts from ur contact list when u turn it off
[18:19:00] <Compu> so it will unfuck
[18:23:22] <iamalion> oh really?

[18:29:34] <iamalion> well ill givei t time to erase
[18:29:53] <Compu> just like theres contacts that come from skype in ur contact list theres contacts that come from ur google account (indicated by the blue google logo), the difference is u can also save contacts to ur google account and even set that as default, only contacts u manually create/save r put in ur google account, u can still also save contacts directly to ur phone and those wont be synced
