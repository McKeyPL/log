[00:01:01] <Wolfie> papa trump knows best
[00:01:27] <RubyPinch> iamalion: bar graph for that, not line graph
[00:01:41] <iamalion> ew why 
[00:01:43] <RubyPinch> you don't have 23.6 calls in between days for example
[00:02:51] <iamalion> still skips dates between
[00:03:32] <weisey> set the scale to show every day
[00:05:04] <iamalion> oh yes let me just change that setting -__
[00:05:34] <weisey> No seriously
[00:05:35] <weisey> It is
[00:05:52] <iamalion> it isnt there, ive checked before, found tutorials, doesnt show
[00:05:57] <iamalion> i know which setting you mean
[00:07:23] <iamalion> its the number of things its graphing
[00:07:28] <Frosty> Will admit, tho, Natalie Portman is pretty hot in this one.
[00:07:35] <iamalion> if i shortene it to only graph the first 20 or so it shows all the dates
[00:07:58] <iamalion> excel cant handle more than a few hundred thingso n the X axis
[00:08:11] <RubyPinch> matplotlib?

[01:35:32] <mib_LunaLover> Hello Cloppers
[01:35:40] <Frosty> Hiya
[01:36:36] <diny> hi mib_LunaLover 
[01:36:42] <mib_LunaLover> How is every little thing?
[01:37:11] <Frosty> fine, I suppose
[01:37:18] <diny> you want descriptive detail? 
[01:38:36] <diny> "well this morning I woke up, had breakfast then we..... "
[01:38:40] <Wolfie> very little
[01:39:02] <mib_LunaLover> very little?
[01:39:32] <diny> mhm, little things are normally quite little
[01:40:09] <mib_LunaLover> indeed...
[01:40:17] <Wolfie> mines pretty big tho
[01:40:28] <Wolfie> not to brag
[01:40:37] <diny> ^I second that statement
[01:41:05] <diny> and confirm it
[01:42:04] <mib_LunaLover> Not mine, good and small!
[01:43:18] <mib_LunaLover> Luna would probably hate it if I'm honest with myself
[01:43:28] <mib_LunaLover> maybe young Luna...
[01:43:40] <diny> Its about how you use it
[01:43:56] <diny> not how long it is
[01:44:02] <Frosty> It's not the size of the boat, but the motion of the ocean
[01:44:07] <mib_LunaLover> I would use it in her vagina.
[01:44:58] <diny> I would think doing it on a boat in strong swell would be quite interesting
[01:45:22] <diny> mib_LunaLover: most of us her would
[01:45:52] <diny> here
[01:48:37] <mib_LunaLover> With Luna? No, no, she is but only mine.
[01:49:26] * diny faints dramatically 
[01:51:06] <diny> come to think of it its been a while since I have seen much luna porn
[01:51:21] <Wolfie> cuz mib_LunaLover has kidnapped her
[01:52:00] <diny> heh
[01:54:30] <mib_LunaLover> in my defense she only struggled a little
[01:55:01] <Wolfie> lovely struggle snuggles
[01:55:16] <mib_LunaLover> and yes, for being so sexy she does have surprisingly little fap material
[01:55:38] <mib_LunaLover> god she looks good in lingerie though
[01:56:00] <diny> mhm
[01:57:10] <diny> cadence doesnt have much either
[01:57:59] <mib_LunaLover> plenty of celestia though, which is weird cause I dont think she is all that sexy
[01:58:12] <diny> neither
[02:01:14] <mib_LunaLover> she gives off a motherly vibe, beautiful but not sexy
[02:01:39] <Wolfie> cadence is best 
[02:01:43] <diny> agreed
[02:03:19] <diny> its sad though that I can only find a handful of (rule 34) pictures of her
[02:03:46] <Wolfie> I found a bunch on e621 
[02:03:57] <diny> feel free to link
[02:04:40] <mib_LunaLover> cadence is too sweet to realistically get dirty
[02:05:02] <mib_LunaLover> Luna flat out tried to destroy daytime.
[02:05:02] <diny> lol, what about fluttershy
[02:05:21] <diny> she has piles oof porn
[02:05:23] <mib_LunaLover> Futashy? She needs it.
[02:05:45] <mib_LunaLover> Also, popular rape subject
[02:06:00] <Wolfie> pfff
[02:06:09] <Wolfie> cadence is the princess of love
[02:06:17] <Wolfie> you know she gets super dirty in bed
[02:06:45] <diny> lol, true dat, then again the way I perceive the personalities in this context is completely different and independent to the show
[02:06:49] <mib_LunaLover> lovemaking, not nasty kinky fucking
[02:07:17] <Wolfie> she's definitely pegging her husband
[02:07:36] <mib_LunaLover> Luna has those sexy eyes sometimes that flat out say- imma do fucked up stuff to you
[02:08:11] <Wolfie> more like give you nightmares
[02:08:36] <diny> yeah, out of all the characters luna would be the naughtiest in my mind 
[02:08:42] <mib_LunaLover> that was past luna
[02:08:46] <mib_LunaLover> she is better now
[02:09:13] <mib_LunaLover> the torture is just playful
[02:10:52] <diny> and if she can see into your dreams she would know exactly what you liked
[02:12:01] <mib_LunaLover> and be able to literally do any of it

[02:39:30] <Frosty> No. The Third one
[02:40:01] <diny> when is the new one meant to be set?
[02:40:28] <Frosty> 30 years after the VI, I believe
[02:40:41] <Frosty> The latest, chronologically
[02:42:12] <diny> mhm, the entirety of my starwars knowledge pretty much comes from Family Guy parodies 
[02:42:50] <Frosty> Mine comes from Lego Star Wars games, and now the Saga
[02:43:24] <diny> do you think I'll be able to follow the new movie on what I know?
[02:44:05] <Frosty> Apparently all you need is the knowledge from movies 4, 5, and 6.
[02:44:57] <diny> mhm, thats only like 6 hours of viewing

[02:47:24] <Nigiri> I think you could follow the new movie without having seen any of them
[02:49:17] <diny> cool, because TBH I'd rather spend 6 hours clopping over the period of week than watch them
[02:49:30] <LunaLover> lol
[02:49:37] <LunaLover> star wars?
[02:49:44] <diny> yeah
[02:49:58] <LunaLover> new one is def god, im probably gonna see it again
[02:50:12] <LunaLover> I saw it opening night, IMAX Dome
[02:50:28] <diny> ooo fancy
[02:50:57] <Nigiri> Yes "good" and not the same junk the JJ Abrams does every single movie but with nostalgic starwars stuff tacked on 
[02:51:45] <Frosty> I heard it was either pretty good or the best thing since the second coming of Jesus. Except one guy I know. He hated it
[02:52:08] <diny> theres always one person like that
[02:54:02] <Nigiri> It's a 6/6.5 out of 10, it passes but just barely 
[02:54:26] <Frosty> Passes as what?
[02:54:37] <LunaLover> a star wars movie that doesnt suck
[02:55:05] <LunaLover> there are def issues but none that make a star wars fan upset

[03:45:30] <DDEEFF> sorry if i'm being a total cringelord, idc 
[03:45:38] <Wolfy> I managed to sneak a family of Mexicans over the border in it
[03:45:50] <diny> oO
[03:46:05] <diny> that must have been really intimate 
[03:46:13] <Wolfy> What papa trump doesn't know, doesn't hurt him
[03:46:58] <DDEEFF> i might do more drawings now, i've learned a lo from this one
[03:47:21] <Wolfy> You should draw rainbow doing something lewd with a turtle
[03:47:46] <DDEEFF> that could be a good idea
[03:48:04] <DDEEFF> i'll be back with some more horse pussy, but probably not rd :p
[03:48:12] <Wolfy> Yay!
[03:48:19] <diny> yay

[03:48:26] <Wolfy> Pony porn is amazing in any form!
[03:48:41] <Wolfy> Unless it has Luna in it
[03:48:44] <DDEEFF> also, if you have suggestions on the drawing, feel free to criticize
[03:48:46] <Wolfy> Then it's alright
[03:49:32] <DDEEFF> i'm always trying to improve, so i'll take any advice :p
[03:50:05] <Wolfy> I've yet to see your stuff
[03:50:12] <DDEEFF> well

[03:54:36] <Wolfy> On Windows you can make an invisible folder on desktop
[03:54:43] <diny> I keep mine on a thumb drive
[03:55:09] <DDEEFF> invisible folders stilll stays on the "recently opened" paths, and are indexed
[03:55:31] <Wolfy> Ooooh
[03:55:36] <Wolfy> Hmmm
[03:55:40] <DDEEFF> tough stuff
[03:55:45] <diny> yeah, thats why I have a thumb drive
[03:55:51] <diny> and number my images

[04:00:33] <DDEEFF> well now i do, 1 images to be precise
[04:00:43] <diny> oh, dont forget cloud storage
[04:00:52] <DDEEFF> ooh that might be a good idea
[04:01:14] <diny> you can have a password and everything
[04:01:19] <DDEEFF> it'll be a pain to work with, but hey, at least i'm not storing anything on my computer
[04:01:23] <diny> however it means you will be downloading
[04:01:42] <diny> so you will have all that history generated
[04:01:44] <Wolfy> Just a thought but I doubt people are  looking for stuff you clop to
[04:01:51] <DDEEFF> is dropbox still any good? or are there alternatives ?
[04:02:00] <Wolfy> Google drive!
[04:02:14] <Wolfy> Make a separate email and get 15gigs free
