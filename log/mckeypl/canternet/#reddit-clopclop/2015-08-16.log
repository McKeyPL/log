[03:12:47] <iamalion> just frustrating call as usual -_- 
[03:13:11] <Frosty> I want to call iamalion just so I can hassle him with stupid shit just like everyone that calls him.
[03:13:31] <iamalion> haha a lot of people do
[03:13:36] <Katiepony> Maybe you already do, he wouldn't know o:
[03:13:44] <Princesssluttershy> I had a guy yell at me for 15 minutes straight today because my store doesn't have any PS4 games "for anyone under 16"
[03:14:12] <iamalion> yeah im still annoyed at the whole hanging up is an instant termination
[03:14:17] <RubyPinch> if I owned a place, I'd allow my employees to yell back
[03:14:26] <iamalion> luckily being tier 2 i dont get angry customers
[03:14:39] <Princesssluttershy> then he took me to the childrens movies and said the same
[03:14:44] <Princesssluttershy> and I'm like dude
[03:14:51] <Princesssluttershy> we have like 15 Dora DVDs
[03:15:10] <iamalion> "What brand of laptop is that?"
[03:15:10] <iamalion> "It's a laptop"
[03:15:10] <iamalion> "....uhuh"
[03:15:42] <Frosty> I don't even know what company lion works for, so I wouldn't even know what number to call.
[03:15:47] <iamalion> i work for comcast
[03:15:49] <iamalion> :D
[03:15:55] <Katiepony> We were told as soon as someone starts being abusive we were allowed to hang up o:
[03:15:59] <Frosty> My condolences
[03:16:04] <iamalion> i love it
[03:16:08] <iamalion> we used to be able to Katiepony
[03:16:19] <Princesssluttershy> I could barely keep myself from laughing at this guy though... not only did he say that loony toons is only for kids 16+ he also kept stuttering and tripping over his words
[03:17:09] <Princesssluttershy> he also kept bumping in to shit
[03:17:14] <Princesssluttershy> it was amazing
[03:17:20] <Katiepony> wat
[03:17:29] <Frosty> Hyperdimension Neptunia is for people under 16.
[03:17:35] <Katiepony> How was he justifying that?
[03:17:40] <Frosty> Also, you actually like working for comcast?
[03:17:46] <iamalion> yeah
[03:17:48] <iamalion> tier 2 is nice
[03:17:58] <Katiepony> I work for number one ¦3
[03:17:59] <Princesssluttershy> Katiepony, he just said that he wouldn't let anyone under 16 watch it
[03:18:01] <Frosty> How do I get to teir two?
[03:18:25] <Princesssluttershy> he also said that Minecraft wasn't appropriate for any kids under 16
[03:18:35] <Katiepony> Eh, to be fair, I pretty much consider anything between a month old and 16 years old to be about the same.
[03:18:48] <iamalion> Frosty in terms of being a customer? Simple, have a wifi problem 
[03:19:53] <Frosty> I'll call and complain my Comcast doesn't work, and the trick is I don't have comcast
[03:20:13] * Vulpixbrew sirs

[03:57:42] <KinkyFrog> Hmm
[03:58:22] <KinkyFrog> So why the hell does everybody feel the need to put dicks on the female horses?
[03:58:28] <KinkyFrog> Ponies
[03:59:01] <Plums> Hello.
[03:59:27] <KinkyFrog> Hello
[04:01:31] <Princesssluttershy> because dicks are good
[04:01:35] <Princesssluttershy> and boobs are good
[04:02:12] <Princesssluttershy> so naturally putting them together is really good
[04:04:43] <Plums> Yep
[04:05:11] <KinkyFrog> But why would you want to look at a dick when it could be a vagina?
[04:05:27] <Plums> Because Bi
[04:06:52] <KinkyFrog> Well that makes sense for bisexual or homosexual people, but I'm assuming heterosexual people are the majority.  But it seems like most clop I've seen, especially on this subreddit, has needless dicks.  Are most clop artists bi or homosexual?
[04:07:30] <Katiepony> That's quite the assumption to make.
[04:09:22] <KinkyFrog> How so?  I know there are a lot of bisexual and homosexual people, but the majority of people certainly are heterosexual.
[04:09:38] <Katiepony> The majority of people also don't fap to horses.
[04:10:57] <KinkyFrog> Good point.  But I can't think of anything that would draw homosexuals or bisexuals to this deviance more so than heterosexual people.  Now that it's established, somewhat, since it seems like dicks everywhere, but not when it was still on the rise.
[04:12:42] <Katiepony> Well, the majority of people who have joined this chat have been bisexual by a fairly large margin. But this still isn't a fair representation of the entire community.
[04:12:58] <Katiepony> Furries aren't much different. They have dicks everywhere too.
[04:13:11] <iamalion> i dont get it as well really. I wish furry porn didnt have so many paninis .-.
[04:15:51] <KinkyFrog> Huh.  I just really don't get it or why it became this way.  One dick makes sense, just about have to have a dildo or dick, but just making gay porn of two females with dicks doesn't really seem like it'd appeal to a large audience, since typically straight people don't like gay porn.  I don't even like seeing one dick, honestly, although I don't mind dildos.
[04:16:07] <iamalion> yeah
[04:16:23] <KinkyFrog> I'm not at all prejudiced or anything, I've gone to gay pride/marriage rallies and all that, I just don't want to see dick when I'm whackin' mine.
[04:16:27] <iamalion> I mean I love dick, but not with clop or yiff art... its too idk exaggerated i think
[04:16:31] <iamalion> plus I dont get the whole futa thing
[04:17:35] <KinkyFrog> Exactly.  Like last night I was browsing the animated things on the sidebar, and each of the videos had like 6 dicks in it, including on Fluttershy who was usually on the receiving end of all them.
[04:18:12] <KinkyFrog> They were crappy videos anyway, probably could have been made better with something as simple as Garry's Mod, but they'd have been decent if not for that.
[04:18:14] <Princesssluttershy> I love Futashy
[04:18:37] <KinkyFrog> I do too.  I'm into BDSM and Fluttershy is a perfect submissive.
[04:19:31] <KinkyFrog> I wish there was more BDSM clop too.  Hard to find.  There was one really good piece I found a while ago of Pinkie Pie pegging a rabbit.  There's a Flash version of it too but I only found that once.  Wish I could find it again.
[04:19:55] <Princesssluttershy> https://e621.net/post?tags=mlp+bdsm&searchDefault=Search
[04:21:02] <KinkyFrog> Ooh, interesting
[04:22:54] <Katiepony> Places like e621 and derpibooru get the majority of clop art around posted onto them. But, I think the subreddit is more likely to be the same smaller group of people posting stuff, over time.
[04:23:07] <Katiepony> And those people might like cocks a bit more than average.
[04:23:11] <iamalion> fffffffffffffff didnt draw that call out long enough now i need to take another call 4 minutes to end of shift ffff
[04:23:39] <iamalion> Katiepony it happens with /r/yiff as well. so many paninis
[04:24:23] <Katiepony> I don't really think reddit is a good place to find clop or yiff. Not when sites like e621 exist.
[04:25:12] <KinkyFrog> e621 is harder to navigate though, and reddit has some gems if you use search or browse by top
[04:25:35] <Katiepony> You can sort e621 by score.
[04:25:44] <Katiepony> by searching order:score
[04:25:55] <Katiepony> Also the search function on reddit is the worst thing about that site.
[04:26:29] <KinkyFrog> Yeah, but if you use vague searches it works okay for finding a general type of clop.  For instance, I just searched "tied" and found some good stuff.
[04:27:13] <Katiepony> Why would you want vague tags when places like e621 have really specific tags, though..?
[04:27:44] <iamalion> yeah e621 needs to be hella specific
[04:28:05] <KinkyFrog> Do e621's tags really work though?  It seems like every picture is a slew of tags that really don't have much to do with the image or flash.
[04:28:58] <Katiepony> Usually, unless people are lazy, they apply every tag that fits to it.
[04:29:17] <Katiepony> And since you can search by multiple tags, it makes it pretty easy to find specific pictures.
[04:29:34] <iamalion> well yeah a lot of them have terrible tags
[04:29:35] <Katiepony> And you can exclude tags

[04:31:51] <KinkyFrog> Whaaaat
[04:32:31] <KinkyFrog> Wow
[04:33:02] <Katiepony> Sometimes it's better to change the 'feral' tag for '-anthro' since feral isn't always tagged.
[04:33:06] <Katiepony> Unless you want to see anthro too.
[04:33:31] <KinkyFrog> What does feral mean in this context?
[04:33:48] <Katiepony> show accurate horses
[04:33:58] <Katiepony> Rather than humanised or anthro
[04:34:09] <KinkyFrog> Oh.  Yeah I prefer feral.
[04:34:29] <Katiepony> For the most part, at least.
[04:38:02] <Katiepony> There's also this extremely outdated imgur album: http://katieponyfs.imgur.com/
