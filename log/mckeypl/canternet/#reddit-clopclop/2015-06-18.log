[03:08:47] <Inuria> Yeah, LED light bulbs are really gonna start taking over
[03:08:49] <Connor> Check the wattage, most are actually about half of what's advertised 
[03:08:57] <Connor> If they come from China 
[03:09:31] <Inuria> 60W would be blistering hot for an A19 LED Lightbulb
[03:09:59] <thaostra> They should be comparing lumins

[03:11:21] *** Quits: Giggles (Giggles@Pony-5tjcae.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:11:36] <Inuria> Especially its use in enclosed fixtures
[03:12:05] <Flame> I wana switch to LED from Flourescent :3
[03:12:05] <Connor> Plus a bunch of Chinese stuff isn't actually grounded 
[03:12:11] <Inuria> 3M has some of the only UL Certified stuff out on the market right now for enclosed fixtures
[03:12:41] <Inuria> Put a non-UL certified bulb in an enclosed fixture and the house burns down, insurance company finds non-UL bulb
[03:12:45] <Inuria> You'd be screwed 
[03:14:46] <thaostra> http://www.amazon.com/Efficient-Evobrite-Equivalent-Satisfaction-Guaranteed/dp/B00P9QXN9U <- I would've bought these, but I'm not quite willing to drop $9/bulb, so I got what was cheap yet has consistently good reviews
[03:16:58] <thaostra> Having a rated lifespan of /only/ 18.3 years isn't that bad either, especially when that leaves plenty of time for prices to stop without having to replace the bulbs in the meantime
[03:17:06] <iamalion> honestly thao
[03:17:09] <iamalion> if you want the best led bulb
[03:17:10] <iamalion> get these

[03:17:58] <cloppyhooves> Do you like LEDs?
[03:18:08] <cloppyhooves> Then maybe you should try LEDeez Nuts :3
[03:18:12] <Connor> I love them, I have so many 
[03:18:19] <iamalion> thaostra we have 18 of these bulbs

[03:18:50] <iamalion> n
[03:18:55] <Vulpixbrew> ok ten minutes into the stiklc of truth and I have been rolling
[03:18:56] <iamalion> did a lot of research
[03:18:57] <Inuria> LifX are pretty deece as well, I run two of them in my "Rig Room"
[03:21:21] <cloppyhooves> :3
[03:21:31] <thaostra> iamalion, Okay, and what kind of benefits would this one have over other models?
[03:22:12] <thaostra> Just wondering since $15/bulb is pretty pricey
[03:22:18] <iamalion> its got electrolytes
[03:25:12] <thaostra> The EvoBrite bulb is cheaper at $9/bulb, and is rated at 9 watts/110 volts vs the Philips $15/bulb and 12 watts/120 volts
[03:26:00] <thaostra> Also much lighter at 3.2oz vs 8.5oz. I guess the EvoBrite is just a newer design

[19:40:48] <Vulpixbrew> what was broken?>
[19:41:47] <Compu> pfft
[19:42:10] <Compu> ok so this guy who used to live with the current owners of the router used to run a minecraft server
[19:42:18] <Compu> so he had to do port forwarding
[19:42:53] <Compu> well he eventually messed something up with the router and didnt know how to fix it so he declared it broken rather than admitting what happened
[19:43:37] <Compu> now a few years later the people who have the router had their current router's web interface stop working even after a factory reset
[19:43:50] <Compu> so i factory reset the old router and it works fine
[19:44:46] <Vulpixbrew> niceeeee
[19:45:12] <Compu> and guess what the owner decided to set as the SSID
