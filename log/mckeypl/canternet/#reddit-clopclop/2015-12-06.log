[08:19:46] <expatriate> yeah it's pretty terrible
[08:20:17] <expatriate> protip: if you're going to make your own, use this pattern: https://www.etsy.com/transaction/262264605
[08:20:18] <FineLine> [ Pony Plush Sewing Pattern with Unicorn Horn and by valleyviolet ]
[08:20:55] <expatriate> works super well, the body is pretty much show accurate
[08:21:09] <expatriate> my head didn't turn out exactly how I wanted but still way better than most of the plushies I see
[08:23:24] <hoofsies> hmm
[08:23:29] <hoofsies> so if you just scale that up 
[08:23:36] <hoofsies> you can make that pony as big as you want?
[08:24:20] <expatriate> yup
[08:24:24] <hoofsies> nice
[08:24:36] <iamalion> https://i.imgur.com/0TUagwk.png
[08:24:36] <expatriate> I made mine about 3 feet tall
[08:25:02] <hoofsies> yeah if i'm gonna order a pony.. the quality needs to be.. at least.. lets see.. example http://img11.deviantart.net/7d44/i/2012/338/d/a/large_fluttershy_plush_by_bladespark-d5n38vl.jpg not teh best face but looks like she has a nice butt.
[08:25:02] <FineLine> [ https://fav.me/d5n38vl ]
[08:25:02] <expatriate> pretty much the minimum size to fit a Mary in the back
[08:25:35] <hoofsies> good haunches to grab :3
[08:25:58] <hoofsies> thanks for the pattern link
[08:26:16] <hoofsies> i'm planning on getting an even more expensive pony in 2016
[08:26:20] <hoofsies> but i may try making my own for fun
[08:26:23] <hoofsies> now that i have that!
[08:26:45] <expatriate> np
[08:27:06] <expatriate> sewing is pretty easy
[08:27:15] <expatriate> just practice first if you've never done it before
[08:27:20] <hoofsies> sleeves like the one i linked tho, they are so much less bulky than BD
[08:27:27] <hoofsies> i think thats why i prefer them
[08:27:38] <expatriate> yeah and even BD's new MLP one is WAY smaller than Mary
[08:27:49] <hoofsies> stretchy and effective
[08:27:54] <hoofsies> should try one sometime !
[08:28:06] <expatriate> I will definitely consider it
[08:28:13] <expatriate> seems like a good choice for a mouth
[08:28:22] <hoofsies> heheh.. oh man i am a sewing noob, it'll probably take me so long
[08:28:52] <expatriate> yeah, can't disagree with that
[08:29:08] <expatriate> I made mine by hand because I don't have a machine
[08:29:26] <expatriate> I rewatched Parks and Rec while sewing it and I got through pretty much the whole show
[08:29:31] <hoofsies> actually i would scale the head down a bit if i did that
[08:29:59] <hoofsies> personal experience, with lifesize pony.. i think show accuracy is not the most versatile... slightly smaller head like the flutter has
[08:30:01] <hoofsies> seems to be good
[08:31:31] <hoofsies> at least, when it comes to 'special uses'  not just for display
[08:34:07] <expatriate> I would really love to try to make a fully silicone pony
[08:34:16] <expatriate> a "RealPony" if you will
[08:34:24] <expatriate> would cost SO much money though
[08:34:27] <hoofsies> that would be sooooo heavy XD
[08:34:41] <diny> I guess you could just cover the whole thing in lube though
[08:34:54] <expatriate> lolwat
[08:35:02] <hoofsies> no no i dont think thats what he meant
[08:35:09] <hoofsies> silicone for body texture
[08:35:10] <diny> no have to worry about getting anything on the fur
[08:35:11] <hoofsies> with fur over it
[08:35:17] <diny> oh
[08:35:22] <expatriate> yes
[08:35:22] <hoofsies> so when you touch it, its like skin
[08:35:43] <expatriate> well, it's like flesh
[08:35:50] <hoofsies> mental image tho
[08:35:52] <diny> yeah, that would be heavy
[08:35:58] <hoofsies> of this giant, slippery silicone pony x3
[08:36:11] <diny> yeah, I was a little confused too
[08:36:14] <hoofsies> sounds dangerous
[08:36:15] <hoofsies> heheh
[08:37:20] <hoofsies> any of ya cloppers play dark souls?
[08:37:25] <expatriate> oh man it would get SO DIRTY
[08:37:33] <expatriate> and I don't mean that in the sexual way
[08:37:50] <expatriate> I mean in the bad dragon toys are fucking lint magnets way
[08:38:16] <hoofsies> thats why i put my sleeves in thier protective cases when not in use
[08:38:40] <hoofsies> those expensive BD's dont come with a case huh
[08:42:14] <expatriate> no, they come with a resealable bag
[08:42:20] <expatriate> that I, being an idiot, threw out
[08:42:30] <expatriate> I have a clean box for it instead
[08:42:58] <expatriate> I'ma go do some drugs brb

[08:58:35] <hoofsies> well i was just horny and decided to explore, i rarely go to nsfw chats
[09:00:48] <diny> I like the idea of having a zip on the back of that one, help keep it a little innocent when your not horny
[09:01:28] <hoofsies> idunno heheh.. when i look at Twilight's plot.. it sometimes gets me in the mood, and then i'm so glad it did
[09:01:34] <hoofsies> but its a cool feature
[09:01:38] <expatriate> I was going to do that, but I was worried about the zipper damaging the toy
[09:01:47] <hoofsies> woudlnt want the feeling of it tho
