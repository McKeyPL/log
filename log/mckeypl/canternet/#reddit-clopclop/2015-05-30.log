[11:30:39] <Michael> its pretty cute
[11:32:03] <Michael> men are honest and true about their desires, with guys I assume you can get laid as long as you are in the market for each other
[11:33:32] <Michael> but women are more adverse to getting laid with just anyone
[11:33:53] <bad_rooster> yea no wonder
[11:34:02] <Michael> I've only done 4 girls in all the 26 years of my life

[11:35:32] <bad_rooster> Michael: I see
[11:36:08] <bad_rooster> Michael: I am not an avid fan of gettin laid with just anypony tbh
[11:36:27] <Michael> i'm a little bit of a slut

[12:02:58] <bad_rooster> Ill help!
[12:03:27] <TheRedOne> k
[12:03:43] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: what seems to be the problem?
[12:04:57] <TheRedOne> device turns off after splash screen, does not do a system check, no trace of bios. that puts it in power supply, main board, CPU and RAM territory
[12:05:26] <TheRedOne> any ideas on how I can narrow it down?
[12:06:07] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: lemme think
[12:06:17] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: measure the battery
[12:06:41] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: as in the bios backup one
[12:06:52] <Vulpixbrew> either use a power supply tester, or do you have a spare PSU you can test?
[12:07:17] <TheRedOne> I don't have any parts in here, I'd have to buy any replacements
[12:07:26] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: do you have a voltmeter?
[12:08:02] <TheRedOne> nope this is a pleb household with no electric engineering beyond perhaps a soldering iron
[12:08:22] <Vulpixbrew> wait no if it powers to spalsh screen that means it has power...hmmm
[12:08:35] <TheRedOne> well thats what I'm thinking
[12:08:38] <TheRedOne> but then
[12:08:44] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: as I said, it might be the battery
[12:08:52] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: the bios fails to keep its data
[12:08:55] <TheRedOne> well it might short out after awhile
[12:08:57] <bad_rooster> once the battery is dead
[12:08:58] <bad_rooster> yea
[12:09:08] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: replace the battery and see
[12:09:12] <TheRedOne> So I'm not ruling out power supply
[12:09:20] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: well don't
[12:09:25] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: but rule out rams
[12:11:04] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: does the fan on the supply stop spinning?
