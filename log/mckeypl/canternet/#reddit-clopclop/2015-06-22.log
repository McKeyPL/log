[14:17:25] <TheRedOne> Hey there
[14:17:45] <TheRedOne> can rain - or weather at all - be a fetish?
[14:19:19] <Cel> does ombrophilia count?
[14:19:30] <TheRedOne> never heard the term
[14:19:44] <Cel> it's the love of rain^^
[14:19:54] <TheRedOne> ah :D
[14:19:58] <TheRedOne> well not sure
[14:20:45] <TheRedOne> because yes I am aware that people really like, for instance, the sound rain, or the smell
[14:21:27] <TheRedOne> but I wouldn't know if people actually got aroused from it
[14:23:37] <Cel> I just assume that everything can be a fetish until someone proves otherwise... which hasn't happened yet^^
[14:24:45] <TheRedOne> I suppose, but I was hoping for a slightly more definitive answer ^^'
[14:26:18] <TheRedOne> basically, when writing a clop scene in the rain, what to add to make the most of the setup.
[14:26:51] <TheRedOne> because I'm not convinced I just invented a new fetish
[14:27:58] <Cel> I only know that some people get off of clouds, because of the shape... and lightning because of the intimidating effect... but that's about it
[14:28:41] <TheRedOne> hmmm

[20:44:52] <cloppyhooves> Whcih it then proceeded to lose
