[03:19:00] <weisey> i love cumlube
[03:19:12] <weisey> except for how stringy it is

[03:19:48] <weisey> seriously
[03:19:59] <weisey> y007ghg7, have you played around with it yet?
[03:20:00] <y007ghg7> that is such an accurate description

[03:20:04] <weisey> yeah
[03:20:06] <y007ghg7> I already owned a bottle

[03:20:09] <y007ghg7> it is so messy~
[03:20:42] <weisey> I love how well it lubes, plus its one of the few lubes that doesnt burn :o
[03:20:47] <Cyan_Spark> Mmm

[03:21:08] <y007ghg7> but yeah expatriate, I also got my fox ear hat~

[03:21:25] <y007ghg7> weisey, they have the clear lube too
[03:21:27] <weisey> which tablet?
[03:21:32] <expatriate> normally I would make a joke about it being christmas
[03:21:38] <weisey> is the clear lube not stringy?
[03:21:45] <y007ghg7> don't think so
[03:21:51] <weisey> hmm
[03:22:02] <weisey> but the question is, is it as viscous

[03:22:56] <y007ghg7> it went up in price so fucking much in 3 days
[03:23:56] <weisey> huion makes the osu!Tablet right?
[03:24:05] <y007ghg7> I think so
[03:24:11] <y007ghg7> they make a ton of tablets
[03:25:02] <weisey> i really want a tablet that is large enough to draw on but that i can also use for osu
[03:25:13] <weisey> so like, that sadly is none of them
[03:25:46] <expatriate> I tried using my tablet with osu and it didn't work at all
[03:26:32] <expatriate> and I can't really play it with my mouse because I use a trackball :D
[03:26:35] <expatriate> it's so hard
[03:26:37] <weisey> did you turn off raw input and set sensitivity to 1.0?
[03:26:43] <weisey> cause that would cause it to not work
[03:26:46] <expatriate> noppe
[03:27:35] <expatriate> maybe I'll try that at some point

[06:34:08] <expatriate> then, once you get back to your show (have fun if it's at the end of the list like Treme or The Wire), it still doesn't go where you left off
[06:34:29] <expatriate> and not only that, but it goes in REVERSE chronological order
[06:34:36] <expatriate> so the last episode is first
[06:34:54] <expatriate> so if there are spoilers for the show in the episode titles or descriptions or thumbnails, haha fuck you
[06:35:53] <expatriate> how hard is it to just straight up copy Netflix's interface?
[06:37:49] <expatriate> plus it crashes for me every time I leave fullscreen, which I'm somewhat willing to forgive even though it's super annoying because hardware/os/browser/flash version combinations can be super tricky
