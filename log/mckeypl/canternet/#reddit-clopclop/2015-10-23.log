[12:39:14] <RubyPinch> cel what will we name the nationnnnnn
[12:43:30] <Cel> what would be the one thing outsiders would notice first?
[12:44:15] <RubyPinch> sense of community? lots of wood? a 2-person dictatorship?
[12:46:31] <Cel> anything that is obvious... I was thinking if anyone could wear anything this could be noticable on the first glimpse, but then again, not everyone would dress like me^^
[12:48:27] <Cel> I'd have the name distract from the obvious, which means it wouldn't be called "hooker style"
[12:48:28] <RubyPinch> :o
[12:48:56] <RubyPinch> well i dunno, we do need at least something to organise and work out who is doing what on what day or whatever
[12:50:08] <Cel> of course
[12:51:42] <RubyPinch> I wanna say armbands but I don't think that would be a good choice considering...
[12:51:45] * RubyPinch stares at cel
[12:52:14] <Cel> heh
[12:52:19] <Cel> just make it blue
[12:53:36] <RubyPinch> mm
[12:55:16] <Cel> the blu society
[12:55:16] <RubyPinch> hmmmm
[12:55:16] <Cel> I thought of green, but I'm not an environmentalist... if I can build industry myself, I would
[12:55:54] <RubyPinch> how about like, bandanna instead of band?
[12:56:13] <RubyPinch> aligned to point down along the outside of the arm
[12:56:33] <Cel> I've seen that somewhere before
[12:57:10] <RubyPinch> http://media.cdnws.com/_i/9010/5433/2255/37/bandana-noir-at-00555-f16.jpeg p much like this, except skipping the knot, custom clothing bandans
[12:57:44] <Cel> now I remember... phillipine rebel groups
[12:57:49] <RubyPinch> bugger
[12:58:27] <RubyPinch> well was it bandana bands, or bandana scarfs?
[13:00:22] <Cel> both... those who use guns wear it around their necks... the one's doing the martial arts around their weaker arm
[13:00:35] <RubyPinch> also im upset at the lack of triangle bandanna on arm pics
[13:02:39] <RubyPinch> okay, left shoulder top, up to the neckline, and just over the corner of the shoulder (ending in a V), a colored patch
[13:02:53] <RubyPinch> enough militaries have done thing-on-shoulder 
[13:03:01] <RubyPinch> that we don't be saying "we are like X"
[13:03:07] <Cel> yea, sounds good^^
[13:03:27] <Cel> do we have a symbol or just color?
[13:03:49] <RubyPinch> I figure static symbol, white background, changing color depending on either rank or role
[13:05:38] <Cel> yea, so everyone can see from far what the person can or should do
[13:05:48] * RubyPinch nod nod
[13:07:37] <Cel> we need a third person... 2 in lead is bad
[13:07:39] <RubyPinch> hmm
[13:08:00] <RubyPinch> do we know anyone else that would wanna play IRL minecraft/rust?
[13:08:06] <Cel> we don't want one being banished to the moon at some point^^
[13:08:59] * Cel shrugs
[13:09:05] <RubyPinch> hmm
[13:09:17] <RubyPinch> maybe vulbeau?
[13:12:03] * Cel nods
[13:17:53] <RubyPinch> http://i.imgur.com/waWspco.png
[13:19:40] <RubyPinch> in b4 we constantly have to revise colors to avoid any specific ones
[13:20:53] <Cel> :D that'd always happen... we should just avoid the obvious ones
[13:21:27] <Cel> also it would only matter to outsiders
[13:21:34] <RubyPinch> mm
[13:22:05] <Cel> put a disclaimer on the state border^^
[13:22:33] <RubyPinch> thats also another thing, trying to delimit the village, also trying to prevent vandals n' stuff
[13:23:45] <Cel> we could have a wall around the core... wouldn't protect our fields, but at least the storage is safe
[13:26:20] <RubyPinch> while valid, that miiight be a bit too close to gamifying it x-x
[13:28:52] <RubyPinch> huh
[13:28:59] <RubyPinch> frozen came out 2 years ago
[13:33:43] <RubyPinch> we need a subredit for collating ideas
[13:45:27] <Cel> we should gamify everything... we can think about things that probably won't work when we come to it
[13:45:40] <RubyPinch> O_O
[13:51:24] <Cel> most of the things are games anyway... the result is more serious and there are no respawn points, but essentially you can play your life^^
[13:51:24] <RubyPinch> friend sent me this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJKd0rkKss
[13:51:52] <RubyPinch> I figure gamification should be avoided at the core of the experience, but heavy gamification along the edge
[13:52:30] <RubyPinch> like, set up rules so tourists can't unbalance, econ with externals is respected, etc
[13:54:37] <Cel> oh no I didn't mean real gamification as in scoreboards and colorful resource counters^^ just the factual thing as in strategic placement of buildings that in case of a fire not everything burns down and such
[13:54:51] <RubyPinch> oh yeah that is fine
[13:56:29] <RubyPinch> honestly, once both of us have enough money to make this realistic: best option I think, would be to become park maintainers, / park rangers? if I'm using the right term
[13:57:25] <RubyPinch> it'll teach us what balances we need to be aware of (in terms of tree usage, fishing, hunting (?), etc etc)
[13:57:25] <Cel> close... but it would more be like a warden in a prison... since our rules are less strict on the environment and more on the people
[13:57:56] <Cel> like we can fell a tree, but not with a chainsaw^^ (except if we built it ourselves)
[13:58:25] <Cel> that too, yes
[13:58:46] <RubyPinch> gosh this vidio is actually kinda cool

[22:10:41] <Wolfy> I broke the arm on my glasses today 
[22:11:02] <Cel> how rude
[22:11:31] <Wolfy> got a spare one though from the shop, it feels really weird
[22:11:50] <Wolfy> the arm was like bent at the back but this one is straight 
[22:12:07] <Wolfy> it's also silver as opposed to the matte dark grey 
[22:12:22] <Wolfy> mykita doesn't make this easy
[22:12:27] <Cel> are you now a whole different person?
[22:12:52] <Wolfy> completely, I lean slightly more to the left now, like a shopping cart
[22:13:54] <Wolfy> gotta wait 3 weeks for a replacement for both arms though since they got to make each pair from scratch 
[22:13:56] <Cel> like someone who accidentally shaves a bit of his mustache
[22:14:04] <Wolfy> exactly
[22:14:50] <Cel> I need new glasses, too... but completely... the glasses are scratched and the frame is falling apart
[22:15:14] <Wolfy> oof
[22:15:43] <Wolfy> mine are surprisingly durable for how thin they are
[22:15:55] <Wolfy> having had them flung across a room and suck
[22:15:57] <Wolfy> suck
