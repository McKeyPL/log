[13:45:31] <AlwaysAlias> Cyan_Spark: that or he just hasn't seen it. I think it's good.
[13:45:38] <Cyan_Spark> What's out of proportion, StarStream?
[13:45:41] <AlwaysAlias> Needs just a bit of work
[13:46:31] <StarStream> the head and body imo 
[13:46:35] <StarStream> compare with the limbs
[13:47:01] <Cyan_Spark> Limbs too um... short?
[13:47:29] <StarStream> kind of small 
[13:48:06] <Cyan_Spark> I see...
[13:50:09] <Cyan_Spark> Then maybe it's for the best he didn't see it
[13:50:19] <StarStream> who ?

[13:50:40] <StarStream> nope

[13:56:31] <StarStream> art is all about room for improvement
[13:56:37] <StarStream> if u dont acknowledge that error 
[13:56:43] <StarStream> or even ignore it 
[13:56:47] <StarStream> that means ur not improving
