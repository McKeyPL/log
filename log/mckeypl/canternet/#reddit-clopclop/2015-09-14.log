[00:09:12] <Katiepony> I bought too much food
[00:09:24] <Katiepony> And I have no choice but to eat it o:
[00:10:20] <iamalion> oh no
[00:10:28] <Wolfy> big eaty horse
[00:11:29] <Katiepony> I bought a meal with a cheap side. Then ate the cheap side.
[00:11:33] <Katiepony> And that filled me :<
[00:11:46] <Wolfy> my sides
[00:11:50] <Katiepony> So now I have a delicious meal, and I'm not hungry
[00:12:36] <Wolfy> give it to some people in London claiming its fancy street food 
[00:12:46] <Wolfy> then mug them
[00:12:51] <Katiepony> Why do you think I live in London!? D:
[00:13:10] <Wolfy> I didn't say that, I said you should go to London
[00:13:24] <Katiepony> But it's on the other side of the country
[00:13:27] <Katiepony> Why would I do that? :<
[00:13:34] <Wolfy> because too much food

[00:14:15] <Katiepony> Why wouldn't I just do that in my own city tho? o:
[00:14:46] <Wolfy> because London
[00:15:09] <Wolfy> or you could go out behind an underground outlet
[00:15:21] <Katiepony> Wolfy, you need to stop being so obsessed with London o:
[00:15:35] <Wolfy> I've seen it's wonders katie
[00:15:40] <Wolfy> I must
[00:16:16] <Katiepony> Hmm
[00:16:23] <Katiepony> Maybe I should just eat this food
