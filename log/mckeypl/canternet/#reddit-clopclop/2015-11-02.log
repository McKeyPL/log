[20:11:00] <Wolfy> I personally like orange apple horse
[20:11:00] <Tchakk> So how did you find /r/clopclop?
[20:11:17] <Evelina> It's not bad. I found it because it was getting linked everywhere on reddit, kindof like spacedicks was.
[20:11:30] <Tchakk> Yea, hehe
[20:11:37] <Evelina> People would make a sexual reference on r/mlp and someone would always respond with r/clopclop
[20:11:47] <RubyPinch> I didn't even want to find it but they forced me to moderate it and ive been trapped ever since aaaaa
