[04:29:17] <Toxotis> So I got some Carolina reaper peppers 
[04:29:17] <Toxotis> I'm not sure if I should try to eat them or not

[04:30:00] * plushie_pegasus double dragon dares you to eat the peppers
[04:30:03] <StarStream> sup
[04:30:14] <plushie_pegasus> Hi StarStream
[04:30:14] <RNGsus> Hi
[04:30:18] <StarStream> carolina reaper eh ?
[04:30:28] <StarStream> is that the current hottest chili in the world ?
[04:31:14] * ConnorCat hides from the peppers 
[04:32:06] <Toxotis> Yeah 
[04:32:10] <Toxotis> I'm scared 
[04:32:31] <thaostra> Toxotis, I'll eat them for you
[04:32:35] * ConnorCat nuzzles the Toxotis and hopes she doesn't die from spice death
[04:33:08] <thaostra> My tolerance for heat is very high, so I think I can conquer the carolina reaper
[04:33:44] <Toxotis> Well my gf ate one 
[04:33:48] <thaostra> I remember eating some ghost pepper hot sauce with a friend, and she remarked that it felt like a hot coal was in her stomach
[04:33:57] <Flame> RNGsus: idk how to work on upping it :( since I'm looking for actual companionship...
[04:34:03] <Toxotis> And she gave me two before I left 
[04:34:20] <RNGsus> Well Flame you arent going to get one unless you try
[04:34:25] <ConnorCat> I went to a culinary school and had one 
[04:34:26] <RNGsus> and complaining about it isnt going to help either

[04:41:37] <Toxotis> :(
[04:41:50] <Flame> RNGsus: idk how to try XD LOL besides just talking to people around campus and in classes and in a club...
[04:41:58] <Flame> which is all ~2ish weeks away
[04:42:00] <Toxotis> Making me feel so much better about it 
[04:42:22] <Flame> huh...3 weeks really
[04:42:23] <thaostra> Have lots of ice cream nearby
[04:42:31] * Flame huggles Toxotis cuz friend
[04:44:28] <thaostra> We should host a Hangout for this
[04:44:44] <Toxotis> I'm going to eat half 
[04:44:47] <thaostra> I'd eat a reaper, but I don't have one at hand
[04:45:23] * Toxotis hugs Flame back 
[04:45:30] <RNGsus> has there been a hangout for this channel before?
[04:45:57] <thaostra> I think I hosted at least one for either this channel or another pony channel
[04:46:28] <StarStream> remember to drink tons of milk 
[04:46:34] <StarStream> also cold milk 
[04:46:41] <StarStream> cause milk can disperse heat faster
[04:46:44] <RNGsus> dont swallow it
[04:46:51] <RNGsus> if you swallow if you will have a very bad time
[04:47:08] <RNGsus> and dont drink milk with it still in your mouth, thats also bad
[04:47:36] <thaostra> StarStream, Ice cream is more effective in my experience. Cold, and high in fat and sugar
[04:47:57] <StarStream> ah
[04:48:18] <expatriate> yeah it's basically milk but colder and fattier
[04:48:45] <expatriate> and I believe capsaicin is fat soluble so more fat is better
[04:49:15] <thaostra> Soluble in alcohol actually
[04:49:28] <thaostra> Fat just blocks the taste receptors effectively
[04:50:06] <cloppyhooves> https://i.imgur.com/AD9aKvV.png
[04:50:31] <thaostra> Combine that with numbing cold and you have temporary relief from hot foods
[04:50:42] <expatriate> ah
[04:58:56] <StarStream> so thats how it work 
[04:59:02] <thaostra> So no Google hangouts where we watch people punish themselves with hot peppers?
[05:02:20] <RNGsus> :(
[05:06:10] <Flame> o.o
