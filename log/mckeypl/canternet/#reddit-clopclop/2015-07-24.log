[17:10:20] <Katiepony> My local pizza place gave me a voucher for 50% off online deliveries.
[17:10:36] <Katiepony> That was over a year ago, and it has still worked every time I've used it.
[17:11:24] <Frosty> Flutter-overload. I like the boobs on the human version. Also, that's sweet. I wish I had a pizza deal like that.

[17:11:54] <Katiepony> Mhm
[17:12:00] <Frosty> Yay!
[17:12:05] <Katiepony> I mean, it's been a week o:
[17:12:11] <Katiepony> Probably wouldn't be on here if I hadn't eaten for a week.
[17:12:32] <Frosty> A week? You can survive that.
[17:12:42] <Frosty> Although, you'd probably be in the hospital.
[17:13:06] <Serene_Flow> I think it's 7 days with out food and 3 without water is what a human can survive.
[17:14:01] <Frosty> 3 weeks without food, three days without water, 3 minutes without air.
[17:14:05] <Frosty> Rule of 3.
[17:14:26] <Serene_Flow> Wow, 3 weeks?
[17:15:04] <Frosty> Yeah. I mean after the first week you'd be laying there, unable to move or do anything except lay there and wither away and die.
[17:15:09] <Katiepony> I wasn't implying I'd be dead, I was implying I'd have better things to do than be in this chat if I was starving o:
[17:15:38] <Frosty> It'd be the slowest three weeks of your life, but, I mean, three weeks.

[17:16:15] <Katiepony> 3 hours without clopping
[17:17:45] <Serene_Flow> 3 days without sleep.
[17:17:58] <Frosty> That's not true either.
[17:17:58] <Vulpixbrew> more than 3 days
[17:18:01] <Vulpixbrew> lot more
[17:18:09] <Katiepony> I think the record for staying awake is 11 days o:
[17:18:15] <Serene_Flow> World record is 11 days.
[17:18:21] <Frosty> Yep
[17:18:26] <Serene_Flow> For a scince fair project.
[17:18:28] <Katiepony> Yeah, world record is 11 days. But, you die after 3 days :3
[17:18:48] <Vulpixbrew> I've been awake for 5 days straioght does this mean Im dead?
[17:18:53] <Frosty> Death is not sleeping, that is true
[17:22:18] <Serene_Flow> I don't think I've been awake for any more than a day. I think almost a 48, but I wouldn't say I have.
[17:22:34] <Frosty> I went three days once. Never again
[17:22:56] <Serene_Flow> Yeah, I don't ever want to do more than a day.

[18:45:50] <weisey> KP, in the launcher, check for the extra dlc files
[18:45:56] <Katiepony> I have
[18:46:03] <Katiepony> I own none
[18:46:14] <Katiepony> Checked in the steam DLC thing, too
[18:46:49] <Katiepony> Also - It depends where you are in London, I guess.
[18:47:01] <Katiepony> We only really have like... 1 or 2 game store franchises, anyway
[18:47:05] <Katiepony> And they're doing awfully.
[18:47:11] <Wolfie> ah
[18:47:26] <Wolfie> I normally buy everything digitally from the US
[18:47:44] <Wolfie> fuck buying stuff for twice the price back home 
[18:48:00] <Katiepony> Pretty much everyone uses digital now, or they buy it on amazon for 2/3 the price.
[18:49:03] <Wolfie> it's the best way 
[18:50:13] <Katiepony> Found any food you've enjoyed, here? o:
[18:51:07] <Wolfie> yeah
[18:51:09] <Wolfie> well
[18:51:15] <Katiepony> Or candy :3
[18:51:24] <Wolfie> I've had pret for the last couple of days 
[18:51:47] <Wolfie> hmm
[18:52:04] <Katiepony> I've actually never been to one.
[18:52:13] <Wolfie> it's quite nice
[18:52:50] <Wolfie> you just pick a meal and something to drink  from a fridge 
[18:53:06] <Wolfie> very quick and neat
[18:53:38] <Wolfie> I had a chicken wrap which cost like £2.25 
[18:54:31] <Katiepony> Well, I've been up for a few hours, I think I deserve a nap

[18:56:45] * ConnorCat wants to come too :3
[18:56:55] <Katiepony> I mean, if you wanna sleep o:
[18:57:06] <Katiepony> I don't mind being spooned, but don't start grinding me in my sleep.
[18:57:08] <Wolfie> I'm exhausted after the walk

[18:59:27] <Katiepony> <3

[19:00:03] <Katiepony> Wanna snug from the front, ConnorCat? Or do y ou wanna be a little spoon?
[19:00:07] * Wolfie grinds up some nuts
[19:00:09] <Katiepony> Okay :3
[19:00:17] * ConnorCat can do either :3
[19:00:21] <Serene_Flow> Do the jetpack.

[19:08:51] <ConnorCat> Oh hey Lumia_ is here! hello Lumia! 
[19:09:21] <Vulpixbrew> why is it in every recent Marvel movie it seems secret identies are not a thing
[19:13:52] <Serene_Flow> Cause the heroes they have don't really have one? Iron Man told people his 1st movie. Hulk was a miltary accident. Cap America is a soldier working for the goverment. And Thor is, well Thor.
[19:16:57] <Vulpixbrew> Spiderman, let the bad guy know his secret idenity
[19:18:44] <Serene_Flow> Well, Sony own Spiderman movies.

[19:29:25] <Squirrelly> The funny part is that my sex drive is relatively unchanged. It's just how much I enjoy the sex that's changed
[19:29:54] <ConnorCat> The answer is more extreme sex 
[19:29:58] * ConnorCat grabs the leather
[19:30:00] <Squirrelly> Heh
[19:30:12] <weisey> Cap america has no secret identity because he needs to be the soldier the soldiers rally behind
[19:30:12] <weisey> And the man (Captain Rogers) that the civilians see
[19:30:18] <Squirrelly> That takes time and effort and usually another person

[19:32:36] <ConnorCat> Nuh, just grab a hitachi and a mic stand, Stick the hitachi in it and then set it 'just above you', then tie yourself to the bed :3

[19:36:46] <Katiepony> I have a pretty high sex drive, but it turns out sex can just be tiring and uncomfortable, especially if you're as out of shape as I am.
[19:36:55] <Squirrelly> Also I'm not super into being choked, though having my throat grabbed as a dominance thing is HOT
