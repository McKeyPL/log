[00:00:03] <Cel> I always blame sandra's bollocks
[00:00:05] <Wolfy> maybe it's that slight wing curvature 
[00:00:28] <Cel> yea straight wings make rocks bigger
[00:01:32] <Wolfy> or maybe the fighter just catches on the midiclorians
[00:01:42] <Cel> idk it just doesn't feel right... no problem with the other ships... just with the tie
[00:01:48] <Cel> yes that's it^^
[00:03:39] <Wolfy> interceptor is the real deal though
[00:04:12] <Wolfy> also I finally got a kill with it tonight 
[00:04:28] <Wolfy> and then approx. 2.5 seconds later I crashed
[00:04:32] <Cel> :D
[00:05:46] <Cel> my favorite (in terms of killing) is the A-wing... i took down about 5 ties and killed a couple (at least 2) ground troops... before crashing into an ATAT because - uh - I was blind or something

[00:17:59] <weisey> Wolfy: I know what it is
[00:18:20] <weisey> Akakak is from Mars Attacks
[00:18:54] <Cel> why is the big one called ATAT while the little one is called A-T-S-T?
[00:18:54] <Wolfy> yeah I knew that, just didn't see a connection

[00:20:34] <Wolfy> I've never heard anyone say at at
[00:20:38] <Cel> they could just say atst, too and I wouldn't even think about it^^
[00:20:52] <weisey> Akak sounds like atat when you say it out loud
[00:20:52] <weisey> @@ not A T A T
[00:21:03] <Wolfy> they say a t a t in the games and in the movies
[00:21:37] <Cel> yea officially... but people don't... at least not people I talk to
[00:22:09] <Wolfy> Germany is weird
[00:22:42] <Cel> I don't talk to germans about star wars... we talk about star trek alot instead
[00:23:49] <Wolfy> uuu
[00:25:32] <Cel> they can explain what a chroniton torpedo is and why a phaser compression rifle makes sense... but why an x-wing needs a firing position is beyond them^^
[00:27:40] <Wolfy> well to get the angle on the target
[00:28:34] <Cel> "yeah but it could just keep the wings in that position, it doesn't go faster just because you close the wings"
[00:30:25] <Wolfy> the s-foils on prequel trilogy vehicles sorta made sense. better manoeuvrability

[13:55:22] <RubyPinch> tfw a majority of the content submitted to r/clopclop is from bots v.v
[14:26:48] <Cel> why would you do that?
[14:31:15] <RubyPinch> i dont, the spammers do tho ;-;
[14:34:24] <Cel> build a counterbot
[14:38:40] <RubyPinch> automoderator is doing a good job
[14:40:16] <RubyPinch> if user is new (less than 5 minutes old), and links to a imgur page (which, if its the bot, will have spam links in the image description), auto-remove post and leave comment
[14:41:31] <RubyPinch> only problem is, some bot accounts get shadow-banned, and AM won't remove the posts of shadowbanned bots, so they stay in the queue. RES screws with the links so other mods think that its direct image links, and then hell breaks loose
[14:42:32] <RubyPinch> tbf I was confused for similar reasons: noticed 10 new accounts each 2 days, posting good content (although all reposts)

[21:14:17] <Connor> The hot tub bing part is fun, the installing it is poop, especially if you have an old one 
[21:22:44] <Connor> We had to rip a wall off our gazebo to get the old hot tub out which was probably 1200 pounds because all the insultion in it was so rotted and water logged 
[21:23:14] <Connor> And that was after our first attempt was cutting it in two so we could get it out the door
