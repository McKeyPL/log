[07:17:42] <IceFlurries> cloppyhooves: oreos...they are AMAZING :D
[07:18:33] <Connor> 2 cups milk (I have also used 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy cream)
[07:18:33] <Connor> 1/2 cup hot chocolate powder
[07:18:33] <Connor> 4-5 oreos
[07:18:33] <Connor> whipping cream
[07:18:33] <Connor> crushed oreos for topping
[07:18:33] <Connor> 1. Warm up milk and on the stove over medium low heat.  Be careful not to let it boil.
[07:18:33] <Connor> 2. Add the hot chocolate powder.  I have used both regular hot chocolate and candy cane hot chocolate powder.  The candy cane hot chocolate powder tastes like mint cookies and cream.  Both are delicious!
[07:18:33] <Connor> 2. Grind the oreos up very finely in a food processor or blender.
[07:18:33] <Connor> 3. Add the oreos to the warm milk.
[07:18:34] <Connor> 4. Serve with whip cream topping and oreos crushed on the top.
