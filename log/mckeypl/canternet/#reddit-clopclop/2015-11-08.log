[01:38:32] <Wolfie> oh my god
[01:39:11] <Wolfie> I remember doing something similar like this at school with that one crazy teacher
[01:39:26] <Wolfie> "everyone say your names and do something unique" 
[01:39:55] <Wolfie> it just ends up being painful for everyone involved 
[01:40:15] <cloppyhooves> D:
[01:40:39] <Wolfie> you guys never did stuff like that? 
[01:41:05] <cloppyhooves> Usually it's just sayign something unique, not doing a physical thing
[01:41:23] <Wolfie> it was different in some places
[01:42:01] <Wolfie> and every time it was painfully awkward

[01:42:47] * Wolfie does an elaborate thumbs up
[01:43:29] <Wolfie> then onto the next one who was supposed to do what you did and then theirs so that they'd remember your name or something 
[01:43:38] <cloppyhooves> Oh geez D:
[01:43:45] <cloppyhooves> Yeah I never liked those even with just the facts
[01:44:21] <Wolfie> and the teacher gets so into it

[01:48:31] <Wolfie> I dunno, I never felt school  was anything for me until I got to college where it's just education and no bullshit around it 
[01:49:00] <Vulpixbrew> college was complete bs if you ask me
[01:49:51] <Wolfie> I liked it because it took away the designated class of X people
