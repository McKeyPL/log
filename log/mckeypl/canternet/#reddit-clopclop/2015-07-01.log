[00:41:06] <Drago> it hasn't been so great. I didn't do anything else. I dunno if he is upset becase I didn't know that.. he seemed surprised that I didn't know.
[00:41:49] <Drago> He did say my name at least when I said hello....
[00:42:46] <Drago> Guess I better just carry on
[00:43:06] <Drago> I found a pretty cool private bar on f-list
[00:43:40] <Drago> I might work there.
[00:43:49] <Giggles> Oooh, that sounds cool

[04:48:10] <samonuh> I'll have to figure out how to do that
[04:48:14] <IceFlurries> and, compare PC game quality to console, and PC can outperform consoles almost always. However, PC gaming can be inconsistent as a whole (dif rigs, dif ports, dif software stacks, etc)

[04:52:36] <IceFlurries> I'd love to build this: a ARM/MIPS board that has a special case that looks like a famicom and a usb port on the top that corisponds with the cartrige loader...and you can load a Linux distro like the "retropi" and emulate! :D
[04:52:55] <samonuh> wat
[04:53:28] <IceFlurries> I may do that with my RaspberryPi B+...make a small emulating console

[05:55:41] <IceFlurries> Quinn: well that's a closed way of thinking @_@
[05:55:46] <Giggles> Super Mario Bros 3 is defintely a very good game.
[05:55:58] <Giggles> We were talking about Super Mario Bros. though.
[05:56:02] <IceFlurries> Super Mario Bros was awesome :D so was 2, USA (2 in america), and 3. I liked all of them :3
[05:56:08] <expatriate> this is my favorite comic evar: http://i.imgur.com/pQU8Tg0.png
[05:56:08] <IceFlurries> but they weren't "perfect"...
[05:56:26] <IceFlurries> "perfect" belongs to earthbound ;) jk
[05:56:52] <expatriate> I could see the original being called
[05:56:55] <expatriate> perfect
[05:56:56] <plushie_pegasus> When it first came out it was "cutting edge" for video games
[05:57:09] <expatriate> but it's easy to be perfect when you're not doing very much
[05:57:50] <Quinn> ^
[05:57:55] <Quinn> is that really "perfect"?

[05:59:56] <Giggles> It's sort of nonsensical to bandy about the term "perfect" when evaluating a piece of art.
[06:00:01] <StallionSucker> Hi
[06:00:42] <Futashy> hihi!
[06:00:55] * Futashy leans up against IceFlurries 
[06:00:56] <StallionSucker> Anyone got a Kik?
[06:00:59] <IceFlurries> nope
[06:01:03] <expatriate> with anything though, there's the art and the craft, and certain parts of the craft certainly can be perfect
[06:01:07] * IceFlurries whimpers
[06:01:19] <expatriate> the simpler it is, the easier that becomes (generally)
[06:01:27] <expatriate> idk, it's all semantics
[06:01:30] <Futashy> i only kik ppl i know :/
[06:02:15] <Quinn> he was like "literally every platformer copies mario"
[06:02:56] <Giggles> Sure a craft can be "perfect" but Super Mario Bros. certainly isn't. It has plenty of bugs and glitches.
[06:03:50] <Giggles> So all that's to be perfect is the design, which I think is very good but seriously calling a design perfect is weird.
[06:05:21] <Giggles> Well that is true. Super Mario Bros. is a pillar of gaming, part of the foundation of the art's history.

[06:05:50] <Quinn> the way he said it, he was trying to say that the developers of every platformer literally go to mario and directly copy shit
[06:05:52] <IceFlurries> Giggles:  would you buy a 30$ produce that was a Raspberrypi (or similar "development" board, perhaps MIPS or PowerPC or whatever) that came with a Linux distro that had many emulators on it (like retropi) and a snazzy 
[06:05:56] <IceFlurries>                      case? and perhaps a SuperFamicom usb controller? :o
[06:05:59] <IceFlurries> o_o
[06:06:15] <plushie_pegasus> Duck hunt that came with mario bros 1 was cutting edge technology for the mid 80's
[06:06:44] <Giggles> Probably not, but I don't really game much anymore.

[06:07:24] <IceFlurries> D:
[06:08:10] <Giggles> and retro games tend to have little to no strategic depth to them anyway, which is more what I'm about.

[20:46:57] * RubyPinch raptors cloppyhooves' butt
[20:47:14] <Wolfie> so it's not a bird of prey?
[20:47:26] * Wolfie hasn't seen Jurassic anything yet
[20:47:33] * Wolfie hides in shame
[20:49:21] <Wolfie> Achillia
[20:49:31] <cloppyhooves> Not a bird, but more like a dinosaur :3
[20:50:11] <weisey> Technically its a velociraptor
[20:54:23] <Wolfie> because it's related to the Achillobator species
[20:55:13] <cloppyhooves> Like a velociraptor or utahraptor, yeah C:
[21:00:18] <Wolfie> acceloraptor * timeraptor = velociraptor 
[21:00:29] <cloppyhooves> :D

[21:14:07] <Wolfie> a fresh prey! 
[21:14:11] <Wolfie> wait.. 
[21:14:28] * cloppyhooves shakeshakes her head to try to get her bearings
[21:14:31] <Wolfie> would it be considered cannibalism if it's different sub species? 
[21:15:08] <Wolfie> I've heard stories of Hindus eating monkeys so it can't be 
[21:15:53] <cloppyhooves> No, it doesn't count :o
[21:16:08] <Wolfie> yay! 
[21:16:13] <Wolfie> dinner is served!

[22:02:33] <Wolfie> I hate it with all my life but any other and I'm sure to think I'm being robbed or whatever 
[22:03:55] <Cel> I once put an air raid siren as alarm... didn't wake up... changed back to the standard brrrrt brrrt brrrt... wanted to kill that thing
[22:06:06] <Wolfie> the alarm sound is the bane of my existence 
[22:06:12] <Wolfie> the BAA BAA BAA one

But other than that your posts are hot af and I think that you guys are AWESOME! Do you think that there is a chance people will dress up as ponies and make pony porn? I would love to see that!
