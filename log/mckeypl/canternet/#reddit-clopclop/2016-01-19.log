[01:59:20] <Moka> Good question!
[01:59:25] * Moka gives Chiv a sample bottle.
[01:59:40] * Chiv appreciatevely takes it

[02:02:27] <Moka> not to my knowledge! ^_^
[02:02:31] * Chiv thought Moka being a choco/coffee fox was amazaing enough. Don't tell him ALL foxes are flavored!
[02:03:37] <Chiv> awww
[02:03:55] <Frosty> Woo. My new graphics card came with Rise of the Tomb Raider.
[02:04:00] * Chiv already had a net ready to go fox hunting, to see if he could find a caramel fox

[02:08:44] <Cyan_Spark> Mm, that comic 
[02:09:34] <expatriate> for real
[02:10:01] <expatriate> I've only looked at the first half
[02:10:18] <expatriate> I decided to save the rest for, uh, later
[02:10:20] <Chiv> voodoo shenanignas ftw!
[02:10:35] <Vulpixbrew> Chiv pretty much
[02:10:59] <Cyan_Spark> <3 expatriate 
[02:11:05] <Moka> holy shit that's hot >>
[02:11:14] <Cyan_Spark> Spoilers, there're orgasms! :3
[02:11:21] <expatriate> nooooo
[02:11:31] <expatriate> I might as well not even read it now
[02:11:41] * Vulpixbrew starts to make a fox shaped plushie
[02:11:41] * expatriate dies dramatically
[02:11:57] * Cyan_Spark is the type who likes to cum to pictures of cumming >.<
[02:12:38] <cloppyhooves> That seems self-sustaining :3
[02:13:03] <Cyan_Spark> Nah, autofellatio is x3 
[02:13:15] <Chiv> your neck though after a while. Ow
[02:13:25] <Cyan_Spark> Not with practice!
[02:13:46] <Cyan_Spark> If you wanna actually get pleasure from it, you have to make it a regular thing
[02:14:09] <Cyan_Spark> Not try once and then cum and say "Eh, it's not for me", then go 3 months without sucking cock
[02:14:26] <Cyan_Spark> Then you come across a really hot selfsucking pic and go "oh wow I wanna try that again"
[02:14:46] <Vulpixbrew> I wish I could
[02:14:52] <expatriate> several years ago I tried really hard
[02:14:54] <Cyan_Spark> No, you practice even when you don't feel like it. Soo... Basically yoga, I guess?
[02:15:00] <expatriate> stretched every day for  few months
[02:15:28] <Cyan_Spark> I'm only 4-inches .w. 
[02:15:39] <Vulpixbrew> I used to have dreams I could do it
[02:15:41] <expatriate> never got it to work
[02:15:57] <Cyan_Spark> I bet everyone here's longer than me
[02:17:04] <expatriate> if you believe the chart we made a long time ago, the average length in this chat is 9 inches
[02:17:10] <expatriate> (I don't believe the chart)
[02:17:27] <Cyan_Spark> Pff 
[02:17:42] <Cyan_Spark> Then on average everyone has the potential to suck their own cock >.>
[02:18:17] <Cyan_Spark> But of course your BMI should be reasonable first 
[02:18:40] <Chiv> well damn and here i thought i was okay being above average
[02:18:44] <cloppyhooves> Why not just use a straw???
[02:18:45] <Chiv> but apparently everyone here is a monster
[02:18:46] <Cyan_Spark> What position did you use, expatriate? 
[02:19:05] <Moka> hahahahaha cloppyhooves 
[02:19:15] <Cyan_Spark> A straw doesn't let you feel the warm, moist embrace of your lips around the glans :3
[02:19:58] <Cyan_Spark> And when you're close to cumming and the slightest murmur of your lips against the tip could send you over the edge
[02:20:21] <Cyan_Spark> Oh, you know that Flash by Zonkpunch of Derpy sucking herself off?
[02:20:45] <Cyan_Spark> Yeah, cumming in your mouth sounds /exactly/ like that 
[02:21:56] <iamalion> how to safely store 13 hard drive magnets http://img.superunicorn.net/i/mzbpak.jpg
[02:22:31] <cloppyhooves> Are hard drive magnets like refrigerator magnets?
[02:22:45] <Chiv> you should just keep them with your non-broken HDD's
[02:22:48] <Cyan_Spark> They're supposedly really strong 
[02:22:49] <iamalion> no they are very strong
[02:22:49] <Chiv> not like anything bad can happen
[02:22:58] <Cyan_Spark> Neodymium?
[02:23:00] <iamalion> like impossible to pull apart from each other strong
[02:23:01] <iamalion> Yep
[02:23:06] <iamalion> you have to slide them apart
[02:23:08] <iamalion> total bitch to do
[02:23:14] <iamalion> so i rolled them one at a time
[02:23:14] <Vulpixbrew> ^this
[02:23:27] <iamalion> only pinched myself a few times
[02:24:43] <Cyan_Spark> You know, I once watched a video of neodymium magnets being made. It's fascinating— apparently the mixture of metals initially isn't magnetic, unless you pass a strong current through them
[02:25:40] <Cyan_Spark> Like, there's this huge basket of the shiny silver chips, and the guy just runs his hand through the basket effortlessly 
[02:26:24] <iamalion> yup
[02:26:34] <Cyan_Spark> Then in to the 12,000V machine and bam! A line of neodymium magnets, held neatly in a line 
[02:27:07] <iamalion> i bought a set of 3mm cube magnets. they arent as fun to play with as i expected :(
[02:27:10] <Cyan_Spark> ...yesh, the my were so perfectly arranged that I had to mention it twice 
[02:27:16] <Cyan_Spark> they*
[02:27:21] <iamalion> Cyan_Spark were they in a line?
[02:27:30] <Cyan_Spark> XD
[02:27:34] <Chiv> No, they were on an assembly line
[02:28:16] <Cyan_Spark>  No literally you could put a ruler against the row of magnets and it'd fit
[02:28:18] * Moka paws cutely at Cyan_Spark
