[05:11:52] <Squirrelly> I don't do well with horror movies D:
[05:12:01] <Squirrelly> Halp
[05:12:11] <Vulpixbrew> Alien is a horror movie?

[05:12:45] <thaostra> Oh wait nvm
[05:13:03] <thaostra> For a moment I thought you were stalking me
[05:13:07] <thaostra> OR ARE YOU
[05:13:50] <Squirrelly> Alien IS a horror movie
[05:13:53] * Vulpixbrew tries to hide his telescope
[05:13:56] <Squirrelly> of a sort
[05:14:27] <thaostra> Alien is one of the best horror films of all time
[05:14:35] <thaostra> And Aliens is one of the best action films of all time
[05:14:36] <Squirrelly> I mean hell, the tagline is "In space, no one can hear you scream"

[05:15:18] * Vulpixbrew pokes Connor
[05:15:46] <thaostra> The film also has lots of sexual themes intended to make male viewers uncomfortable, like face rape, the vulva structure of the derelict ship, and the eggs
[05:15:46] <Squirrelly> I think it's about to kill a guy
[05:15:54] <Squirrelly> rofl

[05:19:20] <Squirrelly> lol really?

[05:20:45] <Squirrelly> I think I might've heard that on /r/TIL or something
[05:22:33] <thaostra> Are you watching the Theatrical release or the Director's cut?
[05:23:17] <IceFlurries> @_@
[05:23:54] <Squirrelly> Director's cut, why?
[05:23:58] <Squirrelly> Any major differences?
[05:24:07] <Squirrelly> I'm guessing a bunch of the giant, artsy shots weren't there
[05:24:08] <IceFlurries> aaannnddd have to wait 3 minutes XD
[05:24:15] <IceFlurries> such a weird game @_@
[05:24:27] <IceFlurries> Mr Saturn say "when ask for password, wait three minute"
[05:24:54] <thaostra> The director's cut is a director's cut only in name; Ridley Scott made the theatrical release the way it was because he felt the pacing was better
[05:25:49] <thaostra> The main difference between the two is a scene at the end where 3,3Ripley discovers what the alien did to her friends
[05:26:26] <Squirrelly> Ah okay
[05:26:34] <Squirrelly> Lol I've seen it in bits and pieces before
[05:26:39] <Squirrelly> Don't worry about spoiling things
[05:26:57] <thaostra> The Director's cut is definitely superior for Aliens though

[19:26:28] <frogaincia> I 
[19:26:32] <frogaincia> well whatever lol
[19:29:16] <thaostra> I recommend 4K so that your setup will be prepared for more and more media supporting the format
[19:29:40] <frogaincia> theostra: media? O_o
[19:30:00] <thaostra> Videos
[19:30:02] <frogaincia> what sort of media?
[19:30:16] <frogaincia> hm, I don't care much about media, at least when it comes to consumption
[19:30:24] <thaostra> Youtube also supports 4K streaming
[19:30:37] <frogaincia> and I haven't been asked to render a video in 4K yet
[19:30:45] <frogaincia> I rock 2x 1024x768
[19:31:24] <thaostra> What do you mean asked to render? Youtube should be able to take 4K uploads
[19:32:13] <frogaincia> thaostra: well nah, I work in motion graphics
[19:32:16] <frogaincia> and 3d graphics
[19:32:17] <frogaincia> and stuff
[19:33:10] <thaostra> The rendered output from software shouldn't be tied to your screen resolution
[19:33:18] <frogaincia> well obviously not
[19:33:28] <frogaincia> thaostra: but I mean I never had to work with 4K
[19:33:46] <frogaincia> because I don't care about watching videos and I have never been asked to make one in 4K
[19:35:49] <frogaincia> soooooo
[19:35:52] <frogaincia> yea
[19:36:05] <thaostra> It's still good to continually push the quality of videos. Hell I remember being able to watch 1080p on Youtube at least six years ago and only recently are they pushing 2160p@60fps
[19:36:32] <frogaincia> yea well... but
[19:36:54] <frogaincia> I'm saying I don't care about like my viewing experience or however it's called these days
[19:37:10] <frogaincia> I only need something that's good to work with
[19:37:21] <thaostra> Better to have it and not use it than to not have it and need it, because while most of your workflow right now doesn't require it there will be a shift to bigger and better formats
[19:38:07] <frogaincia> word up
[19:38:09] <frogaincia> thaostra: ?
[19:38:33] <thaostra> This is especially important because lots of applications can set their own resolution as needed you can still work in 1080p or whatever

[20:02:29] <frogaincia> weisey: but

[20:07:35] <frogaincia> uum why?
[20:07:43] <frogaincia> oh right
[20:07:52] <frogaincia> I wanna upgrade after 10 years
[20:08:55] <thaostra> weisey, What exactly do you mean by not pushing it? You can easily find videos in 4K and download them right now and they've supported it for at least a year now, especially since they've started supporting VP9 which is shown to stream higher quality video with the same amount of bandwidth compared to VP8 before
[20:09:15] <frogaincia> wait what
[20:09:15] <frogaincia> ?
[20:09:21] <frogaincia> oh
[20:09:22] <frogaincia> right
[20:09:24] <weisey> I mean its still not being pushed yo the general public
[20:09:36] <weisey> As in "4k is the future!"
[20:09:56] <frogaincia> well, in tvs it is
[20:10:21] <weisey> Also at my old work we used 4k because then we could have code window, schematic, and other stuff open all st once

[20:12:19] <thaostra> weisey, I must be missing something, because Youtube lists 4K as a supported option

[22:02:44] <cloppyhooves> (This is for a language if it helps)
[22:03:08] <bad_rooster> cloppyhooves: I thought you are supposed to learn it and you in colledge
[22:03:14] <bad_rooster> if it's uni stuff, you gotta 
[22:03:17] <bad_rooster> pirate the cd
[22:03:57] <bad_rooster> cloppyhooves: what's the name of the book?
[22:05:29] <cloppyhooves> Genki, 2nd edition, book 1
[22:05:45] <cloppyhooves> Piracy is bad but I do have a legal copy of the CD
[22:06:01] <bad_rooster> cloppyhooves: piracy
[22:06:03] <cloppyhooves> I have a USB CD drive at home so I'll do that then
[22:06:07] <bad_rooster> is ok
[22:06:19] <cloppyhooves> But it's illegal D:
[22:06:25] <bad_rooster> lol so?
[22:06:45] <RNGsus> cloppyhooves its not illegal if you own it legitimately
[22:06:49] <bad_rooster> it damages creators of the opensource
[22:06:56] <bad_rooster> it's fine
[22:07:00] <bad_rooster> it's like a library
[22:07:02] <bad_rooster> for sw
[22:07:14] <RNGsus> bad_rooster its not fine, it hurts the devs
[22:07:20] <RNGsus> but cloppyhooves actually has a copy so its okay
[22:07:47] <bad_rooster> RNGsus: it hurts the devs of open source alternatives
[22:08:26] <RNGsus> well if their product is good enough it wont hurt them
[22:08:34] <Vulpixbrew> college books, I hate to be that guy but the colleges raise the price of there books so much (I seriuosly brought the same book on amazon for a quarter of the price)
[22:08:50] <RNGsus> Vulpixbrew is right
[22:08:52] <bad_rooster> I didn't even buy the books this semester
[22:09:26] <thaostra> bad_rooster> it damages creators of the opensource <- What's this about creators of open source?
[22:09:31] <bad_rooster> RNGsus: not completely true... open source tends to be really awesome, but at a price of a steep learning curve
[22:09:50] <RNGsus> oh well
[22:09:54] <bad_rooster> thaostra: well if you have say 3D max and everypone pirates it, ppl don't use say Blender, which is equally potent, but free
[22:10:56] <thaostra> But people do tend to use Blender because it's Free and freely available. There's lots of material out there specifically for it
[22:11:31] <cloppyhooves> (I got this book on Amazon, not from the bookstore :3)
[22:11:37] <bad_rooster> I use it cuz it rocks :3
[22:11:39] <bad_rooster> GUYS
[22:11:43] <bad_rooster> GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS
[22:11:45] <RNGsus> (and gals)
[22:11:49] <bad_rooster> (obviously)
[22:11:53] <cloppyhooves> (And non-binary people)
[22:11:54] <bad_rooster> I bought HTC Desire
[22:12:02] <bad_rooster> (ofc!)
[22:12:03] <thaostra> And really, saying it hurts open source devs is a real damn stretch. People gravitate toward tools that work
[22:12:13] <bad_rooster> thaostra: it ain't...
[22:12:49] <bad_rooster> http://www.computerworld.com/article/2532091/technology-law-regulation/software-piracy-hurts-the-open-source-community--too.html
[22:14:03] <thaostra> Almost all users of software, proprietary or not, do not "help give back and contribute code". You of all people should know the difference between users and developers
[22:14:32] <bad_rooster> I tend 
[22:14:35] <bad_rooster> hm
[22:14:38] <bad_rooster> I guess you are right
[22:14:53] <bad_rooster> *slaps my flank*
[22:16:01] <thaostra> I've been using Linux for years, use Firefox, have Hexchat as my client, use Thunderbird for email, Libreoffice for word processing, etc, and I use them because they're the best tools for my needs, and being open source is icing on the cake
[22:17:08] <thaostra> And as much as I'd like to romanticize the ideals of software freedom where users and developers are one and the same, the reality is that'll never happen because time isn't free
[22:19:41] <bad_rooster> you smart man
[22:19:46] <iamalion> answer, first thing cx says after I ask how I can help is "well you can fix my computer" 
[22:20:11] <iamalion> well then you can go literally consume a penis
[22:20:12] <iamalion> thx
