[22:53:41] <Wolfy> I say 100

[23:23:29] <Wolfy> It just sits there and collects eggs until you take it out afaik
[23:23:43] <Wolfy> How it collects the eggs I'm not sure
[23:23:54] <Wolfy> Maybe there are tiny farmers on it with egg baskets

[23:33:31] <weisey> Wolfy, there are 2 IUD types

[23:33:36] <Wolfy> I know
[23:33:58] <Wolfy> I'm reading about it right now

[23:34:17] <weisey> And copper does some weird crap where it stops the production or some shit

[23:35:07] <Wolfy> I think it's a pretty solid thing

[23:53:36] <Wolfy> Or maybe she (assuming it's a couple) just whispered to him that it's ok, she's on the pill
[23:53:58] <Wolfy> And he's internally not buying it
