[10:40:32] <Squirrelly> I dunno
[10:40:40] <sleepyPon> When outside of horticulture papers have I written stamens??
[10:40:41] <sleepyPon> Lol
[10:40:43] <Squirrelly> They might make an exception for somebody as hot as cloppy
[10:41:00] * sleepyPon blushes
[10:41:24] <Katiepony> Autocorrect really likes stamens o:
[10:41:51] <Giggles> OOooh, Crypt of the Necrodancer looked awesome

[10:45:17] <sleepyPon> My dad asked me difference between pan and bi
[10:45:35] <sleepyPon> Gave him ok answer but wasn't ok with it fully myself 
[10:46:00] <Katiepony> As far as I'm aware, bisexual is still defined as liking both male and female?
[10:46:10] <sleepyPon> That's how I understood
[10:46:21] <Giggles> Totally
[10:46:25] <Katiepony> As opposed to everything that lies between
[10:46:39] <Katiepony> Maybe I'm wrong o:

[10:48:37] <Katiepony> cloppyhooves would probably know better than me
[10:48:54] <sleepyPon> Hehe
[10:49:27] <Giggles> That sounds correct to me
[10:50:18] <cloppyhooves> I've heard two different distinctions
[10:50:34] <sleepyPon> Oh?
[10:50:56] <cloppyhooves> First one: Bi means attracted to men and women, and maybe people in between; Pan explicitly means attracted to all
[10:51:22] <sleepyPon> All like all sentients or all humans or anything?
[10:51:28] <Giggles> right, that's what I usually get.
[10:51:29] <cloppyhooves> Second one: Bi means attracted to men and women and people in between; Pan means gender is not a factor at all in attraction
[10:51:40] <Katiepony> Pan is just attracted to people, regardless of gender I guess.
[10:51:48] <Giggles> I think humans is implied
[10:51:49] <Squirrelly> I kinda like the first distinction, cloppy
[10:51:57] <sleepyPon> But with clop or furry, how does that feed in?
[10:52:00] <Katiepony> Pan doesn't include animals, if that's what you're asking.
[10:52:08] <Giggles> How is that even a distinction though. :O
[10:52:26] <sleepyPon> Lol
[10:52:51] <Giggles> Oh, is the second one more restrictive I guess. Since it only addresses gender.
[10:52:57] <sleepyPon> Mhmm
[10:53:01] <sleepyPon> Hence me asking :3
[10:53:20] <sleepyPon> I want to thank everyone for not making fun of my question
[10:53:24] <Squirrelly> I identify as bi.
[10:53:26] <Squirrelly> Oh honey
[10:53:27] * sleepyPon blushes
[10:53:32] <Squirrelly> That's what we're all about :)
[10:53:44] <Squirrelly> We'll never make fun of something like that
[10:53:46] <sleepyPon> Well, I'm not used to nice
[10:53:50] * sleepyPon blushes
[10:53:58] <sleepyPon> Thank you
[10:53:59] <Giggles> Not making fun of questions? Seems like a weird thing to be based on.
[10:54:08] <Squirrelly> Oh hush
[10:54:08] <sleepyPon> Lol
[10:54:11] <Squirrelly> I meant openness
[10:54:19] <sleepyPon> :3
[10:54:29] <Katiepony> Cloppy is the most open
[10:54:38] <Katiepony> She's opened her legs to so many people from this chat :3
[10:55:01] * Squirrelly would open her legs to cloppy...
[10:55:08] * sleepyPon would too
[10:55:14] * sleepyPon blushes
[10:55:35] * Squirrelly wants cloppy's strapon inside her
[10:55:53] <Giggles> hot o.o
[10:56:14] * sleepyPon would say ok. And thinks he I straight to that :3
[10:56:29] <cloppyhooves> I would put it in a Squirrelly c:
[10:56:36] <cloppyhooves> Also, personally I go by the second distinction
[10:56:47] <sleepyPon> Nice
[10:56:48] <cloppyhooves> And call myself bi, because I'm not attracted to men and women and non-binary people in the same way at all
[10:56:52] <expatriate> oh dashie, you must learn to keep your face clean when you eat!
[10:56:53] <expatriate> http://i.imgur.com/Sy968b2.png
[10:57:15] <cloppyhooves> Like I'm generally a subby bottom for guys, and a switchy switch for girls, but I just have such a stronger preference for girls
[10:57:24] <cloppyhooves> Gender does matter, but I'm open to all genders c:
[10:57:26] <cloppyhooves> Which is why I say bi
[10:57:29] <Giggles> kinky :3
[10:57:34] <cloppyhooves> x3
[10:57:35] <Squirrelly> Yeah cloppy, I'm pretty much the same
[10:57:39] * cloppyhooves kinks Giggles 
[10:57:43] <Katiepony> With that definition, where do people who are only attracted to the binary genders lie? o:
[10:57:50] <sleepyPon> Lol
[10:57:52] <Squirrelly> I'm still subbier with girls, but I'll switch now and then
[10:57:57] <cloppyhooves> I guess also Bi? I dunno D:
[10:57:58] <sleepyPon> Sure
[10:58:04] <Giggles> :D
[10:58:13] <Squirrelly> Uhhhhhh non-binary-exclusive?
[10:58:20] <sleepyPon> What about those of us who feel differently depending on how our day is feeling? :30
[10:58:31] <cloppyhooves> I've heard people describe their sexuality as fluid
[10:58:36] <Katiepony> I'm Bi, it's short for non-BI-nary-exlusive-sexual :3
[10:58:41] <Squirrelly> genderfluid seems like fun
[10:58:43] <Squirrelly> :3
[10:58:44] <Giggles> Regular Bi, instead of premium.
[10:58:44] <sleepyPon> Lol, Katie
[10:58:54] <Katiepony> You should try my gender fluids :3
[10:59:11] <sleepyPon> Hehe, only â‚¬3.99 an ounce, Katie? ;)

[11:01:43] <Giggles> plus I still have 50 minutes of Magic the Gathering to watch. :O
[11:01:45] <sleepyPon> Never sleep!!!
[11:02:03] <Giggles> I think that's an easy sleep. As bad as eating is I think sleeping is worse.
[11:02:19] <Squirrelly> what MtG are you watching, Giggles?
[11:02:22] <Squirrelly> Star City?
[11:02:24] <Katiepony> I could save so much money if I didn't need to eat

[11:05:03] <Squirrelly> No he made it through that
[11:05:10] <Squirrelly> Then he accidentally missed half a nap
[11:05:16] <Squirrelly> And got supremely fucked up
[11:05:17] <expatriate> I wish I could take like 6 months and work on art full time

[11:34:45] <Squirrelly> Wait
[11:34:48] <Melon_Phone> I ain't found shit
[11:34:49] <Squirrelly> Giggles what're you watching?
[11:34:51] <sleepyPon> That's what I got
[11:34:58] <Giggles> Now or before?
[11:35:18] <expatriate> Melon you on mobile?
[11:35:18] <Squirrelly> Yes
[11:35:36] <sleepyPon> Yah, I think it's a mobile issue
[11:35:46] <Melon_Phone> <---
[11:35:54] <Giggles> I just finished watching season 1 of the Vintage Super League. Now I'm watching LSV draft Modern Masters 2015.
[11:35:55] <expatriate> ah I see
[11:36:10] <Squirrelly> Ahhhhh
[11:36:13] <Squirrelly> LSV is awesome
[11:36:22] <Squirrelly> I've met him
[11:36:25] <Giggles> Yeah he's the best. ^_^
[11:36:25] <Squirrelly> He's super nice and stuff
[11:36:32] <Squirrelly> He signed my Elesh V tokens :D
[11:36:44] <Giggles> Awesome :D
[11:36:53] <sleepyPon> I don't know what that is, but awesome
[11:37:17] <Giggles> I hae to prepare my Modern Masters 2015 skills for the draft at my part this week. :3
[11:37:41] <Giggles> LSV videos will treat me how to draft the blue ones. O.O
[11:37:48] <Giggles> teach*
[11:38:40] <Melon_Phone> we should all just start collecting and trading Pokemon cards
[11:38:51] <Giggles> I have a few :D
[11:38:57] <Giggles> I actually hae a Pokemon booster box.
[11:39:17] <Giggles> unopened. It's leftover from when I drafted Pokemon.
[11:39:24] <Melon_Phone> I had some like a million years ago back in early elementary 
[11:40:03] <Squirrelly> I have a bunch still
[11:40:11] <Squirrelly> Including my two charizards
[11:40:20] <Squirrelly> and a bunch of other stuff
[11:40:44] <Melon_Phone> then yuhioh kinda caught on and everyone switched to that 
[11:40:51] <Melon_Phone> yugioh* 
[11:41:10] <Giggles> Yeah I don't have nearly as many yugioh cards
[11:41:20] <Melon_Phone> I had like one
[11:41:28] <expatriate> night all
[11:41:29] <FineLine> 'Night expatriate!
[11:41:35] <expatriate> sun is rising, should probably go to bed
[11:41:48] <Melon_Phone> it was a card that came with the movie ticket when we all went to see it
[11:41:50] <Squirrelly> I played yugioh semi-competitively. That community was not all that female-friendly :\
[11:42:25] <Melon_Phone> some of my friends go to these competitions as a laugh more than anything 
[11:42:43] <Melon_Phone> mostly to replicate that mtg ass crack post 
[11:42:52] <Melon_Phone> and pose with ass cracks
[11:42:52] <sleepyPon> Squirrelly, only because they are raised wrong? I'm sorry

[11:52:04] <Squirrelly> "What if I just...did....this...."
[11:52:22] <Giggles> I think my favorite LSV moments are his videos playing Vintage Masters.
[11:52:48] <Squirrelly> I dunno
[11:53:11] <Squirrelly> My favorite LSV thing might be the story about how he won half a tournament using a storm deck with no actual storm cards in it
[11:53:21] <Giggles> There's like 4 videos of him aggressively forcing storm decks and losing until he eventually drafts this absurd deck with a black lotus and 2 tendrils and wins.
[11:53:24] <Squirrelly> Sorry no, it didn't have Tendrils
[11:53:45] <Giggles> Yeah, there was no kill. That one is great.
[11:54:06] <Squirrelly> Well, there WAS Darksteel Colossus
[11:54:19] <Giggles> He accidentally replaced the tendrils in his board with something.
[11:54:22] <Squirrelly> Yup
[11:54:41] <Squirrelly> He was like "Huh, there's this weird open spot. Oh well. I'll just put this other thing in"

[21:44:10] <Hitler> *tips nazi cap* m'are
[21:44:23] <RNGsus> I aint no mare
[21:44:40] <cloppyhooves> You should change your name, Hitler 
[21:44:56] <RNGsus> What if
[21:44:58] <Hitler> *tips fedora
[21:44:59] <RNGsus> it was an autogen name
[21:45:02] *** Parts: Hitler (Mibbit@Pony-ou72d3.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) ()
[21:45:09] <cloppyhooves> They're from germany
[21:45:11] <cloppyhooves> What even
[21:45:22] <RubyPinch> what autogen would give such a name
[21:45:27] <RNGsus> Who would name themselves hitler if they are from germany

[21:46:25] <Vulpixbrew> wait I missed Hitler
[21:46:35] <RNGsus> it was great
[21:46:43] <RNGsus> he made two shitty references of the same may may
[21:46:44] <RNGsus> then left
[21:46:45] <Vulpixbrew> dawwwwwww I wanted to kick him in the sack
[21:48:45] <RubyPinch> he has already been banned once if I'm not mistaken
[21:48:52] <RubyPinch> and also lives in PA
[21:49:06] <cloppyhooves> Going through a german proxy? :o
[21:49:15] <RubyPinch> I believe so
[21:49:46] <Cel> wait... why does it matter that they were german?
[21:50:06] <RNGsus> his name was hitler
[21:50:10] <Cel> and?
[21:50:28] <Cel> someone from america with that same name would be ok?
[21:50:34] <RubyPinch> no?
[21:50:37] <RNGsus> naming yourself hitler while being german is like naming yourself muhhamed atta while living a block away from the freedom tower
[21:51:03] <RNGsus> its wrong either way but out of all the people germans are the least likely to do it
[21:51:44] <iamalion> haha that is great
[21:52:05] <Cel> that's not true... all germans I met mock around with nazi stuff... me inclusive... doesn't mean we're racist, or mean anything serious
[21:52:42] <Cel> and I don't oppose to kick someone with that name... just calling him out because he's german is odd
[21:53:14] <cloppyhooves> Perhaps I just overreacted, I'm sorry :c

[21:54:00] <iamalion> its so cute
[21:54:12] <RNGsus> I never said you were racist cel
[21:54:20] <RNGsus> I dont even know how you got to that conclusion
[21:55:30] <Cel> that's not what I mean either, but you were underlining that especially germans shouldn't do that
[21:56:07] <RNGsus> I didnt mean shouldnt i meant more less likely and strange that they would
