[22:12:41] <Flame> weisey: ...sorry to keep asking and stuff, but is there any reason for me to not keep CM? Or even use that over Carbon or others?
[22:13:02] <weisey> its all preference
[22:13:21] <weisey> if you dont like it
[22:13:23] <weisey> dont keep it
[22:13:26] <weisey> simple as that
[22:14:22] <Flame> hmm...okay...also, is there a easy way to transfer a "secondary rom" to the "default rom"?
[22:14:42] <Flame> or basically take the secondary rom and overwrite it over the default/internal rom?
[22:14:47] <weisey> yep
[22:15:48] <weisey> Advanced > multirom >list roms, tap the rom
[22:15:59] <weisey> sorry
[22:16:07] <weisey> multirom > swap roms
[22:16:29] <Flame> it won't overwrite pictures/music/etc eh? o.o just curious
[22:16:32] <Flame> I presume no?
[22:16:41] <weisey> nope
[22:16:51] <weisey> those are stored on internal storage
