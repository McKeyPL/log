[09:59:09] <Vulpixbrew> really it took 4 allies to knock me down and I still got the kill
[09:59:43] <Cel> they're allies, what'd you expect?
[10:00:51] <Wolfy> after this week, back to the future will happen entirely in the past
[10:00:56] <Vulpixbrew> ashrens its 6 to 2
[10:01:03] <Vulpixbrew> and the other dude is afking
[10:02:16] <Cel> 2?
[10:02:36] <Vulpixbrew> theres no one in the bg
[10:02:42] <Vulpixbrew> 6 allies to horde
[10:03:22] <Cel> hmm
[10:05:06] <Cel> also... back to the future was very disappointing... we still don't have hoverboards, self-adjusting clothing, flying cars and most importantly... holosharks
[10:06:14] <Vulpixbrew> and they have heals......
[10:06:20] <Wolfy>  Pepsi did a commercial recently about the new bottles
[10:06:22] <Vulpixbrew> ell not much I can do any more
[10:06:27] <Vulpixbrew> ooo they did
[10:06:44] <Cel> but they don't have heels, that's what's important
[10:06:50] <Wolfy> I read somewhere the adjustable clothes were in development 
[10:07:09] <Cel> too little to late... might as well just blow the world up
[10:07:17] <Wolfy> and tony hawk tried out a prototype of the hover board 
[10:09:35] <Wolfy> Yiff is the future http://i.imgur.com/szyR5MM.jpg
[10:09:37] <Cel> tbh I just want flying cars... flying and self driving... I hate travelling, but if I don't have to drive and the path is shorter, then maybe
[10:09:52] <Wolfy> auto pilot! 
[10:10:03] <Wolfy> I like electric vehicles
[10:10:15] <Cel> me too
[10:10:28] <Vulpixbrew> I want a self driving telsa model s
[10:10:32] <Cel> and the tesla is closest to what I need... but it doesn't fly
[10:11:05] <Cel> the last update brought autopilot to all tesla... but they don't want you to let go of the wheel for now^^
[10:11:21] <Wolfy> well cuz it's autopilot
[10:11:39] <Wolfy> pilots don't put planes into autopilot and go nap 
[10:11:51] <Wolfy> although that'd be real cool 
[10:12:02] <Cel> but they could
[10:12:07] <Wolfy> just set a destination and sleep until you get there
[10:12:11] <Cel> yea
[10:12:14] <Cel> that's what I want
[10:12:22] <Wolfy> they could but I don't think they'd get to their destination
[10:12:39] <Wolfy> yknow because some dumb guys law of planes
[10:12:55] <Cel> yea
[10:13:30] <Cel> trains are still manned, too... but they just push a button to tell the controlcenter that they're still alive
[10:14:42] <Wolfy> maybe if we could evolve some system of transport where people could just board and travel to their destination at will
[10:14:49] <Wolfy> Yiff http://i.imgur.com/nvHHVVa.jpg
[10:15:18] <Cel> make a big drone, sit in a container, get picked up^^
[10:16:22] <Vulpixbrew> 144 mounts
[10:16:22] <Wolfy> gotta get an AV suit for that drop
[10:16:27] <Vulpixbrew> so close to my kite
[10:16:31] <Vulpixbrew> and yes please Wolfy
[10:16:47] <Vulpixbrew> bound me gag me and hump me
[10:17:02] <Vulpixbrew> and Im working obn my sky golem

[10:19:48] * Vulpixbrew licks the wolf
[10:21:58] <Vulpixbrew>  Oh Cel go off collections in the achievemnts
[10:24:16] <Cel> 142 that explains it
[10:25:32] <Vulpixbrew> yeah other faction mounts and profession only mounts dont count towards the achievment unless your on that character
[10:25:42] <Vulpixbrew> like Flying Carpet is only for tailors
[10:27:41] <Cel> other faction mounts should be more... I bought all of them... so they don't count anyways... but the profession ones make sense
[10:28:17] <Vulpixbrew> also dk mounts only count on dk and smae for pallie locks
[10:29:04] <Cel> I could buy my last missing nether drake... and all of the nether... uh... squids
[10:29:40] <Vulpixbrew> that would do it
[10:29:53] <Vulpixbrew> I need to get on panderian mounts and WoD mounts
[10:30:26] <Cel> I have 24 days left on my subscribtion and I'm at 70k again... so I can throw a bit at mounts^^
[10:30:54] <Vulpixbrew> Im at 28 days and 19k
[10:32:48] <Cel> my followers want me to be rich... 4 1k rewards in 3 days (and many lower ones)
[10:32:56] <Cel> one ship brought me 3,5k

[10:33:25] <Vulpixbrew> I need to work on followers on my off toons

[10:59:33] <Cel> he has a pan!

[11:00:05] <Cel> lucky thing is... there is no spoon
[11:00:32] * Wolfy dives a paw into his pocket and pulls out the deadly SPOON
[11:01:01] * Vulpixbrew brings a 1000 stormtroopers who all shoot and miss
[11:01:37] * Cel brings one sith lord, who will ultimately fail, because... reasons
[11:02:06] * Wolfy throws the spoon at the sith, grabbing his pan by the hilt
[11:03:00] <Cel> great... now the sith is eating soup... that one is even more useless now
[11:04:24] <Vulpixbrew> you know I cant help but get annoyed aqt people who say the rebel lost Hoth
[11:04:35] * Wolfy uses the pan to melee Vader in the back of the head
[11:05:00] <Cel> I was a sith inquisitor once (swtor)... I killed everyone who did not resist and let everyone who fought live (story npc)
[11:05:18] <Wolfy>  orbital strikes do massive damage on the walkers
[11:06:20] <Wolfy> and everyone uses them on snowtroopers
[11:06:27] <Wolfy> no wonder the rebels lose
[11:07:01] <Cel> the rebels lost in terms of territory... but monetary... whole different story^^
[11:07:10] <Vulpixbrew> the rebels had three goals on hoth, one use the ion cannon to clear the route for evecution, two hold Imperial ground forces till three the complete evuacation off all personal which they did compeltely
[11:07:41] <Vulpixbrew> and if it wasnt for han solo being chased the rebels would have lost some ships
[11:09:38] <Wolfy> Yiff http://i.imgur.com/YpfFoPG.png
[11:09:40] <Wolfy> boobies
[11:10:20] <Cel> I still don't understand how tie fighter pilots are that useless... and storm troopers for that matter... they're supposed to be strong... not intentionally miss everything
[11:10:54] <Vulpixbrew> well the heroes did havve two mile thick plot armor
[11:11:42] <Cel> yea but why... you could have made them dumb cannonfodder and no one would complain... then they turn them into clones of the greatest bounty hunter and everything is shit... of course people denie that this is canon, but still^^
[11:11:45] <Vulpixbrew> on hoth the empire had a few goals, destory the generator,  passed, prevent any rebels from escaping, failed, capture kill key personal includid the princess and skywalker, failed
[11:12:13] <Wolfy> I think it was all the emperors plan 
[11:12:33] <Wolfy> clones were discontinued after the rise of the empire 
[11:15:08] <Wolfy> I dunno I blame Lucas
[11:15:11] <Cel> the empire fails far too much for someone with that much influence... they can build a death star... granted with a huge flaw, but still... and then they can't build weapons that punch through a shield generator without having to disable it first?
[11:15:51] <Wolfy> well isn't that the point of a shield generator? 
[11:16:02] <Wolfy> to prevent penetration 
[11:16:13] <Cel> theoretically, but every shield has a limit in terms of energy
[11:16:36] <Wolfy> they just need cycler rifles smh
[11:17:43] <Cel> or a couple of ion cannons... they seem to be good against shields... the only ion weapon I know the empire uses are bombs dropped from a tie bomber
[11:18:12] <Vulpixbrew> the empire wanted to lose
[11:18:18] <Wolfy> the turrets on star destroyers are ion
[11:18:18] <Cel> guess so
[11:18:29] <Vulpixbrew> the battle on endor proves it
[11:18:32] <Wolfy> the emperor is a masochist 
[11:18:32] <Cel> they are?
[11:18:56] <Wolfy> iirc green lasers are ion
[11:19:16] <Cel> i though ion is blue
[11:19:19] <Wolfy> I have a Star Wars book in my basement
[11:19:31] <Wolfy> maybe it is
[11:19:39] <Wolfy> I'm still sorta asleep
[11:19:49] <Wolfy> stayed up way too late last night 
[11:20:05] <Compu> i want a sweetie belle to cuddle
[11:20:41] <Cel> this is all so much easier in star trek... everything has a fix color for what it does... phaser is orange, disruptor is green, tachyon is blue

[11:25:05] <Compu> i wanna play star trek online again but its no fun imagining im playing it cuz i have no windows pc that works at the moment, let alone one remotely capable of gaming
[11:26:25] <Cel> I tried playing it again, but it bores me... I like the game, but the missions since they raised the level cap are crap
[11:26:54] <Compu> eh
[11:27:30] <Compu> i just like flying places and meeting people in an open world where every single fucking person ever WONT spam kill u at every chance they possibly get
[11:27:40] <Compu> god i hate gta online public sessions
[11:29:12] * Vulpixbrew puts an I win sticker on the Compu but
[11:29:36] <Vulpixbrew> ooo Compu played STO?
[11:31:39] <Compu> yeah back when my mom's friend we used to live with had a $1400 gaming laptop he bought with the money he was supposed to use to keep him going while he was in between jobs
[11:32:12] <Compu> after we moved out of there because of his violent anger issues i couldnt play anymore
[11:32:20] <Compu> not that i could very often anyways
[11:32:45] <Compu> he preferred falling asleep while using his super expensive laptop to watch fucking netflix -_-
[11:33:12] <Wolfy> worth
[11:33:23] <Compu> ?
[11:34:29] <Vulpixbrew> got to love that
[11:34:55] <Vulpixbrew> ecpensive gaming machine to watch netflix and facebook
[11:35:14] <Compu> oh he used it for gaming sometimes
[11:35:21] <Compu> he played euro truck simulator
[11:35:26] <Compu> and thats pretty much it
[11:35:30] <Cel> my alienware notebook turned into a paperweight right after the warranty ran out... that was fun
[11:35:50] <Vulpixbrew> mean while Im keeping an hp laptop barely limpinmg along
[11:36:10] <Compu> im using a dell inspiron 1420 to talk to u guys
[11:36:16] <Vulpixbrew> I almost refuse to pay more then $250 for a laptop now
[11:36:43] <Compu> Vulpixbrew: we're trying to save up for a $170 chromebook
[11:37:08] <Compu> now if u want a machine for netflix and facebook a cheap chromebook is perfect
[11:37:34] <Vulpixbrew> yeppers
[11:38:05] <Wolfy> I'll probably get a chrome book at some point after this lap has died
[11:38:06] <Compu> anyways im getting it for things like watching the bronystate stream
[11:38:10] <Wolfy> or a surface pad 
[11:38:36] <Compu> Wolfy: chromebook handles lower hardware specs a lot better than any windows thing will ever do
[11:39:58] <Vulpixbrew> I saw $170 dolalr windows table/ laptop a couple days aago that I might save up and get
[11:40:02] <Wolfy> eh
[11:40:08] <Compu> Vulpixbrew: dont, ever
[11:40:10] <Vulpixbrew> all I need is something cheaplight with a huge batt life
[11:40:18] <Vulpixbrew> dont ever what?
[11:40:21] <Cel> i bought a raspberry pi 2 a couple of weeks ago... that'll be my media machine as soon as I find a space for my projector to project to
[11:40:33] <Compu> dont ever get a windows machine for less than $250
[11:40:43] <Compu> windows does not handle low specs well at all
[11:40:57] <Vulpixbrew> I was gonna rip windows off and place ubinthu on it
[11:41:02] <Compu> if u want cheap, light, and lots of battery life u want a chromebook
[11:41:28] <Compu> Vulpixbrew: many of the ones that cheap dont let u change the OS
[11:43:31] <Vulpixbrew> either way I just need something with a huge batt life stats dont mean much to me as my desktop does most of he work
[11:43:54] <Compu> Vulpixbrew: yeah get a chromebook
[11:44:35] <Compu> its cheap, high battery life, super light weight, and u dont ever have to worry about viruses with it pretty much
[11:46:37] <Vulpixbrew> no seriously how can scrubs go so dark so quick
[11:47:42] <Cel> dark?
[11:47:46] <Vulpixbrew> sad
[11:47:57] <Cel> ah ok

[11:53:16] <Vulpixbrew> Im gonna wait on that game till the first couple of patches
[11:53:44] <Cel> me too
[11:53:46] <Vulpixbrew> Bethsada games tend to be broken on release

[11:54:17] <Vulpixbrew> was in the ESo beta they fixed things and broke a lot else
[11:54:59] <Cel> that doesn't count... they don't know what they're doing in terms of multiplayer... they never knew^^

[23:01:57] <Frosty> So I'm playing Paper Mario...
[23:02:09] <Frosty> And I'll be honest. So far, I liked the second one better.
[23:02:28] <Wolfy> so your verdict is that it's.. 
[23:02:31] <Wolfy> paper thin?
[23:02:36] <Frosty> No
[23:03:00] <Frosty> I just like a lot of the aspects of the second one more than the first one so far
[23:03:20] <RNGsus> I liked your pun Wolfy 
[23:04:13] <Wolfy> so you think it's.. 
[23:04:18] <Wolfy> tearable?
[23:04:59] <Frosty> I didn't think it was bad. It just didn't really go with my statement
