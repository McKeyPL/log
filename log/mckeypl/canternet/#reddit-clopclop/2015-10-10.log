[18:51:32] <Cel> I always wanted to try that... I said something like that to a friend once, but she knows me too well... it had no effect
[18:58:18] <Katiepony> Cel: 'So uhh, I jack off to bikini photos of you online' Girl: 'I know you do, Cel.'
[18:58:42] <Cel> no... girl: "no, you don't"
[18:58:58] <Cel> me: "how would you know?" girl: "internet"
[19:13:04] <Cel> goddam I hate bad backup procedures... only 350GB data... but... 290GB duplicates
[19:13:58] <Cel> also... including all windows files (as well about 20 2GB pagefile.sys)
[19:14:46] <Vulpixbrew> sounds like the way I back up things and then spends days claening things up
[19:14:59] * Cel shakes Vulpixbrew 
[19:15:34] * Cel cries
[19:16:19] * Vulpixbrew passes out
[19:16:32] * Cel cries more

[19:19:12] <Vulpixbrew> speaking of that i need to put all my music in one spot alleast
[19:20:01] <Cel> I don't minde multiple copies on different devices... but multiple copies on the same drive... most in the same folder... some with the same name but a "(1)" ahead of the extension... I just cant
[19:20:39] <Vulpixbrew> then again mine is ;laptop back up, server back up, photos back up
[19:20:41] <Vulpixbrew> ect
[19:21:20] <Cel> I have my main PC and a NAS... that's it... very important files are encrypted on google drive

[19:47:00] <Giggles> ANd the Zero SUit Samus model is from fucking Other M. I can't believe they pulled that shit.
[19:47:19] <Wolfy> zero siut is sexy
[19:47:19] <Frosty> She's still hawt, tho
[19:47:29] <Giggles> Actually false.
[19:47:38] <Giggles> You'd think that, but you'd be wrong.
[19:47:54] <Frosty> /kickban giggles for having a different opinion
[19:48:25] <Frosty> Why am I rong?
[19:49:48] <Giggles> Her shoes are ugly. :O
[19:50:36] <Giggles> Atually I think that might be a BRawl thing. But either way, it's hideous
[19:51:14] <Frosty> Oh no. Her shoes don't match her outfit. Truly a travisty
[19:52:06] <Frosty> I'm giggles. I'm a winer
[19:52:10] <Frosty> waaaaa
[19:52:33] <Giggles> They're ALSO shockingly hideous.
[19:52:39] <Cel> in smash I always play her... in the orange suit
[19:52:49] <Giggles> Well Yeah, that's the best one.
[19:52:59] <Wolfy> I'd definitely smash her tho
[19:53:00] <Frosty> Nah. Pajama Shamus best Shamus
[19:53:11] <Wolfy> big suit or zero suit or sans suit
[19:53:38] <Cel> i like the idea of her shoes... but I'd have her wear black... but that's personal pref
[19:54:09] <Cel> with "idea" I mean the jets... I want those

[23:17:17] <Cel> without cheating?
[23:17:27] <Wolfy> YEAH
[23:17:33] <Cel> woha
[23:17:40] <Wolfy> git gud actually works
[23:19:14] <Cel> oO
[23:47:21] <Wolfy> in all honesty I was empire in thar match 
[23:47:41] <Wolfy> they all whooped out asses the next couple of rounds 
[23:47:53] <Wolfy> did get some quality headshots tho
[23:49:07] <Cel> well maybe people get used to it... I still haven't seen rebels win without massive "BANNED" spam afterwards
[23:49:23] <Wolfy> oof
[23:49:33] <Wolfy> I think it'll be better in the full game 
[23:49:52] <Wolfy> as in it'll have more cards that might be better against the walkers
[23:50:11] <Cel> probably... and currently there are almost no useful unlocks... everyone just runs around with the sniper rifle
[23:50:15] <Wolfy> and also the rocket launcher in the survival mode has yet to come 
[23:50:24] <Cel> the rocket launcher is a drop
[23:50:30] <Cel> I always get that thing
[23:50:35] <Wolfy> the homing one?
[23:50:39] <Cel> I want orbital strike once in a while
[23:50:43] <Cel> the smart launcher, yes
[23:50:46] <Wolfy> you played the tattooine level 
[23:50:58] <Cel> I haven't played tatooine once
[23:51:01] <Wolfy> it's two different stuffs
[23:51:22] <Wolfy> the rocket actually locks onto and homes in on the target
[23:52:11] <Cel> so does this thing... the crosshair only goes red when targeting a vehicle
[23:52:33] <Cel> it's not the same launcher, no... but it is a homing rocket
[23:53:08] <Wolfy> ah yeah
[23:53:21] <Wolfy> the other one is a regular weapon 
[23:53:26] <Wolfy> deals more damage I think
[23:53:39] <Wolfy> it took an at st down to like 30 in a good hit
[23:53:54] <Cel> ^^
[23:54:23] <Wolfy> agh I'm just really salty right now
[23:54:44] <Cel> I just use ion shot to take down a walker... it's not strong enough alone, but it helps
[23:55:31] <Wolfy> yeah
[23:55:41] <Wolfy> armour piercing rounds tho
[23:56:44] <Cel> the game has potential... but they really need to do more... currently it's not worth paying for
[23:57:31] <Wolfy> yeah that's understandable 
[23:58:46] <Cel> they have to fix the tie fighter hitbox... close to the ground does not mean "ermrgd splode"
[23:59:41] <Cel> with a tie interceptor it's no problem... but tie fighter always hits nothing
[23:59:42] <Wolfy> Gravity, dog
[23:59:49] <Wolfy> blame Sandra bullock
