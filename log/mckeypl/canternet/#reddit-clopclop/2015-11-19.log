[23:23:04] <Wolfy> Hmm, white does seem useful since arctic environments and such but there are very few fun animals there
[23:23:41] <Wolfy> Black or brownish sounds alright
[23:23:54] <Wolfy> Or maybe like that comforting woof yesterday
[23:27:17] <Cel> make it neon
[23:27:23] <Wolfy> For now I think it's just up for imagination
[23:27:29] <Wolfy> Pink neon, settled
[23:27:36] <Cel> :D
[23:27:46] <Cel> I go purple neon... not a woof, but still
[23:28:25] <Wolfy> Can't go the same colour
[23:28:33] <Wolfy> Vulpix will go orange neon
[23:28:45] <Wolfy> And Nigiri is green neon
[23:28:46] <Cel> who goes same color?
