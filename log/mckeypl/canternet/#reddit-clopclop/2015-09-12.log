[00:20:03] <Evelina> my question is, why bother blindfolding and gagging the bear.
[00:21:01] <Wolfy> it's a nannycam
[00:22:27] <Katiepony> Sometimes to make a kid feel more comfortable with something they show their stuffed toy experiencing the same thing. Like, if a kid breaks their arm, someone puts their bear in a sling too o:

[05:48:11] <Vulpixbrew> Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.
[05:48:11] <Vulpixbrew> And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.

[08:18:56] <plushie_pegasus> Do you know what the 3 min rule is, e ?
[08:19:04] <e> ye you were talking about it a few days ago
[08:19:16] <plushie_pegasus> ok
[08:19:28] <e> that people should wait 3 minutes after saying bye before they leave as a courtesy
[08:19:56] <e> Not an actual rule really
[08:20:11] <e> more of a suggestion
[08:20:34] <plushie_pegasus> but it's rude not to do it
[08:20:45] <e> Not really
[08:21:44] <e> I can see how it might be percieved that way though
[08:28:16] <weisey> plushie_pegasus, 
[08:28:37] <weisey> thats not realy practical at all
[08:29:15] <Squirrelly> Yeah
[08:29:16] <weisey> "bye" implies intent to leave immediately
[08:29:23] <Squirrelly> Sometimes people just have to go
[08:29:29] <weisey> also
[08:29:36] <weisey> in the real world
[08:29:48] <weisey> that would be awkward as hell
[08:29:51] <e> Lol
[08:30:07] <e> Well the idea is to give people a chance to say bye to you before you leave
[08:30:13] <e> but this doesn't happen in RL
[08:31:09] <plushie_pegasus> Ok..If you are at a party do you just take off without telling others goodbye and run off?
[08:32:04] <weisey> pretty much
[08:32:18] <plushie_pegasus> :-o
[08:32:32] <weisey> i mean, i tell like, the 2 people im near and are friends with
[08:32:57] <plushie_pegasus> note to self...do not invite weisey to a party
[08:33:01] <plushie_pegasus> XD
[08:33:04] <weisey> so if anyone is like "whered they go" theyll be like "she had to leave"
[08:33:52] <weisey> cause if i have to go im sure as hell not being late or missing a boat just to go around telling everyone im leaving
