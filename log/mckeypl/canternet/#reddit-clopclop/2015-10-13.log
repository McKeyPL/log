[03:54:49] <RNGsus> unwanted and annoying. I like it
[03:55:21] <Vulpixbrew> I starts a band called 999 Megabytes
[03:55:28] <Vulpixbrew> we still ahven't gotten a gig
[03:55:43] <RNGsus> :D
[03:55:44] <weisey> 1023mb *
[03:57:12] <RNGsus> 1024?
[03:57:26] <weisey> You aren't japanese, you cant use the Japanese gigabyte.
[03:57:40] <RNGsus> wat
[03:57:52] <Vulpixbrew> weisey the antipun fox
[03:57:59] <weisey> The Japanese Gigabyte = 1000mb
[03:58:11] <weisey> a true Gigabyte = 1024mb
[03:58:36] <RNGsus> thats what i thought
[03:58:40] <RNGsus> so not 1023?
[03:58:58] <weisey> yeah but the joke needs to be the band is called 1023mb, 
[04:00:27] <weisey> The japanese gigabyte is called that because the japanese harddrive manufacturers started advertisting as 10^x bytes not 2^x bytes
[04:00:31] <weisey> and it stuck
[04:00:50] <weisey> thats why your harddrives appear smaller when plugged in

[11:48:45] <cloppyhooves> Yup :3
[11:48:46] <RubyPinch> aw ye
[11:49:44] <Evelina> Grr, I know there's something wrong about that youtube video but I don't know enough about electricity to prove why it's wrong
[11:50:03] <Wolfy> ? 
[11:52:16] <Wolfy> well you can charge your phone with a potato and a monster energy drink
[11:52:17] <Evelina> Charging aphone with your bodies latent energy
[11:52:30] <cloppyhooves> It's not a capacitor, is the main thing
[11:53:03] <Evelina> Right I understand that because that is a chemical reaction, but through skin transfer there wouldn't be anywhere near enough latent energy to charge a phone
[11:54:00] <Wolfy> I doubt it's enough to properly charge a phone but give it enough so it displays that it's charging
[11:54:04] <Evelina> And even then human body has really good resistance
[11:54:16] <cloppyhooves> I meant the setup with the coins and the paper doesn't make a capacitor
[11:54:30] <Wolfy> well duh
[11:54:42] <Evelina> Oh right, I know that, that's just technobable to make people beleive the video more
[11:55:06] <cloppyhooves> If the body had built up electricity, that would just be static electricity
[11:55:13] <cloppyhooves> Like when you walk over carpet with wooly socks
[11:55:21] <cloppyhooves> Which is a lot of voltage but not a lot of current
[11:55:26] <cloppyhooves> So not a lot of energy to give the phone
[11:56:01] <Wolfy> paper isn't really a dielectric material anyway 
[11:56:58] <Evelina> Chemistry is fun
[11:56:59] <Wolfy> yeah, it might just be enough to give the illusion that it's charging
[11:57:17] <Wolfy> pff chemistry sucks
[11:57:50] <cloppyhooves> Also, it's not a capacitor but a short circuit, so charge wouldn't flow any more than just touching the end of a USB with your finger
[11:57:53] <cloppyhooves> Which doesn't do anything
[11:58:42] <Wolfy> yep
[11:58:44] <RubyPinch> :D
[11:59:06] <Evelina> So, is it potentially just "Charging" off of it'self?
