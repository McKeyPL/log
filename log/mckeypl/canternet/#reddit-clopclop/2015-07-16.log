[10:50:03] <Squirrelly> This sucks
[10:50:23] <Squirrelly> It's 4 AM, and I have a massive desire for steak
[10:50:34] <Squirrelly> Quantity over quality
[10:51:19] <Squirrelly> How the hell am I supposed to eat steak at 4 am?! I don't live near one of those western-style trucker diners
[10:51:58] <Squirrelly> I once had something like a 21 oz steak for $10. It was beautiful.
[10:52:08] <PlamsNThings> Fuck
[10:52:16] <PlamsNThings> Wish meat was that cheap here
[10:52:26] <Squirrelly> It's not that cheap here lol
[10:52:37] <Squirrelly> This was in the middle of nowhere
[10:52:53] <Squirrelly> That beef likely came from one of the various farms nearby
[10:52:59] <PlamsNThings> We export so much of our meat here in new zealand we need to pay a premium 
[10:53:50] <Squirrelly> I live in the suburbs. Meat isn't cheap unless you cook it yourself, and even then it's pretty expensive
[10:54:13] <Squirrelly> I wish I liked cooking better
[10:54:20] <PlamsNThings> I love cooking
[10:54:23] <Squirrelly> I'd make steak and stuff all the time
[10:54:27] <PlamsNThings> you a guy or a girl?
