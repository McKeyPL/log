[16:26:22] <Vulpixbrew> http://i.imgur.com/3yWGTTN.jpg
[16:33:52] <Cel> they told us everything about it at... wait for it... 14
[16:34:28] <Cel> I was 15 since I had to repeat a grade
[16:49:57] <Vulpixbrew> I remmeber sex ed, football coach
[16:50:09] <Vulpixbrew> talked more about crusty bed sheets then anything esle
[16:50:15] <Cel> yay
[16:51:06] <Cel> we had a hot chemistry teacher with pink hair... she was awesome, and she didn't care about the topic, she just did what she had to and after that she blew up some hydrogen
[16:55:58] <Vulpixbrew> sex ed with expliosions
[17:00:06] <Cel> she should have made the thing that squirts white stuff when you light it on fire
[17:02:20] <princesssluttershy> Shit
[17:02:38] <princesssluttershy> So I just got a call from this place and they want me to start working tomorrow
[17:03:14] <princesssluttershy> but I have shifts with my other job later this week
[17:05:05] <princesssluttershy> So I don't knw what to do like I can't call my current job and say that I want to only have weekend shifts before calling this new place and I can't call this new place without asking for only weekends where I already work D:
[17:05:35] <princesssluttershy> I thought they'd give me more than like 19 hours to talk to my other job D:
[17:10:54] <princesssluttershy> I don't know what to do I want to keep my current job because the new one is only for 2 months
[17:11:17] <princesssluttershy> and I have to make a decision very soon D:
[17:20:06] <princesssluttershy> update: current work said yes to just weekends
[17:20:25] <princesssluttershy> now to call new work and say I can start tomorrow but can't work for a couple days this week :/
[17:28:26] <princesssluttershy> Update: new work didn't answer the phone
[17:28:39] <princesssluttershy> It's like 12:30 though so they're probably just on lunch
[17:36:02] <princesssluttershy> Sorry about all that
[17:36:17] <princesssluttershy> typing it out helps me think about what's going on more clearly

[23:28:49] <AmberTT> these names are not familiar to me
[23:28:54] <Wolfy> cel should become a celout. maybe he'll get enough cash from that
[23:29:16] <Cel> I'd be so much of a celout, you won't believe... but who'd give me money?
[23:29:36] <AmberTT> Do you think if Cel sat under a tree they'd become Cel-Shaded
[23:29:53] <Cel> that's a given
[23:30:12] <Wolfy> mr robot is a new tv series about a hacker. first season just ended like a couple months ago
[23:31:14] <Cel> and it's relatively believable... just the name "evil corp" is a bit too much on the nose... I mean... spoiler?... at least call it "shady corp"^^
[23:32:07] <Wolfy> it sticks out like a sore thumb but otherwise the series is pretty solid
[23:32:10] <Wolfy> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/7050141_orig.jpg
[23:32:29] <AmberTT> Has there ever been a game or show or anything where they named something Evil-Corp or something similar and it turned out to be the peeps the protagonist side up with later
[23:33:35] <Wolfy> you should base your next game on that
[23:34:04] <Wolfy> after all the interviews about your current game 
[23:34:05] <Cel> hmm... I think that depends on the viewpoint... command & conquer had something like that... when kane joined the GDI
[23:34:06] <AmberTT> fter the long journey of this first game is done xP
[23:34:36] <Wolfy> it's a goty
[23:34:43] <Wolfy> I can feel it in my fingers
[23:34:54] <AmberTT> lol
[23:34:59] <Cel> ooo
[23:35:08] <AmberTT> totally not
[23:35:31] <AmberTT> It's just gonna be a Dungeon Crawlery RPG-y Adventurey type of game
[23:36:09] <Wolfy> do you get to bang elves? 
[23:36:27] <AmberTT> lol no
[23:36:40] * Cel turns away
[23:36:43] <Wolfy> lame
[23:36:49] <AmberTT> you can wait until some random fan game if one ever is made xP
[23:37:07] <AmberTT> It's probably gonna be Rated T or something
[23:37:27] <Wolfy> I want a game where I can realistically bang elves or similar
[23:38:06] <Wolfy> I want it to be a really gripping game
[23:38:06] <AmberTT> lol
[23:38:10] <Cel> Ju-C
[23:38:18] <Wolfy> really wrap its long fingers around me
[23:38:25] <AmberTT> pls
[23:38:28] <Wolfy> slowly caressing
[23:38:58] <Cel> but seriously... I haven't heard anything about the penis controller for a while... do they still develop it?
[23:39:12] <AmberTT> Out of these three you can usually only pick two: Realistic, Sex, Actually Good
[23:39:25] <AmberTT> Whats this about a penis controller
[23:39:32] <Cel> the Ju-C
[23:40:03] <Wolfy> I want it for Christmas 
[23:40:03] <Cel> the Ju-C air blows you off while you use it to control dating games
[23:40:18] <AmberTT> oh
[23:40:28] <AmberTT> riiiiiight
[23:40:29] <Wolfy> them it malfunctions and sucks your willy dry
[23:40:34] <Wolfy> rip
[23:40:36] <AmberTT> Not actually what I was expecting
[23:40:52] <AmberTT> I thought it would just be a joystick-type controller
[23:40:55] <Cel> well there are blowjob machines at some streetcorners in japan
[23:40:59] <AmberTT> but with a dick for the joystick
[23:41:05] <Cel> heh
[23:41:53] <Wolfy> that'd be fun
[23:42:07] <Wolfy> blowjob machines are weird
[23:42:16] <RubyPinch> I need
[23:42:19] <RubyPinch> 300 chickens
[23:42:28] <Wolfy> and a blowjob machine? 
[23:42:28] <AmberTT> I need 27 Blue Gems
[23:42:31] <Cel> yea... but I still need a complete girl robot
[23:42:38] <AmberTT> Ahaha ofc
[23:42:50] <Wolfy> I'd love a robot girl 
[23:43:01] <AmberTT> The ever awaited actual sex robots that the future will probably have a few of
[23:43:04] <Wolfy> I'd press all her buttons
[23:43:48] <Wolfy> there was an article today about that in 2050 sex with robots  will be more possible
[23:44:01] <Wolfy> just gotta wait 35 years for that 
[23:44:10] <Cel> people go too much to realistic looking... I don't want it to have a plastic face... EVA's face (WALL-E) would be more than fine for me
[23:44:22] <AmberTT> "More possible" lol ok
[23:44:35] <Wolfy> I can't words now
[23:44:43] <AmberTT> I like how, technically you can totally make a sex robot already just minus the complex AI
[23:45:11] <Wolfy> what is my purpose
[23:46:02] <Wolfy> the future is weird
[23:46:07] <AmberTT> lol
[23:46:15] <AmberTT> we knew this already
[23:46:41] * Wolfy does the robot
[23:46:48] <AmberTT> beep
[23:46:52] <Cel> a holodeck would be good too... I'd create a spacegoat and never leave the place
[23:47:35] <Wolfy> heh spacegoat 
[23:47:51] <Wolfy> not a girl robot? 
[23:48:02] <AmberTT> Maybe Cel is Welsh
[23:48:07] <Cel> on a holodeck?... nah
[23:48:25] <Cel> I'd have a spacegoat in the holodeck and a robot girl in my bedroom

[23:50:33] <RubyPinch> omgea

[23:51:06] <RubyPinch> aslpha
[23:51:26] <Wolfy> I'd go with black slave 1
[23:51:43] <Cel> why 1?... do you intend to need another?
[23:51:51] <AmberTT> I mean
[23:52:04] <AmberTT> Would you rule out the possibility of making a 2?
[23:52:06] <AmberTT> That being said
[23:52:17] <RubyPinch> rudes
[23:52:19] <AmberTT> Who puts a 1 in front of first things
[23:52:28] <Wolfy> just in case
[23:52:36] <Cel> oh there will always be a 2, but the first one should be expected to last forever
[23:52:50] <Cel> that's the same why so many companies call their shit "NG"
[23:52:55] <AmberTT> The official name for Ghostbusters 1 was Ghostbusters, not GHostbusters 1!
[23:53:00] <Wolfy> which is kinda funny 
[23:53:58] <Cel> also... uniformcode on my ship... everyone wears high heels... EVERYONE
[23:54:14] <Wolfy> the slave 1 ship was stolen from its factory by jango fett, who then destroyed the other prototypes, making his ship the one of its kind
[23:54:31] <Cel> rest doesn't matter... first officer can wear boxers and a fedora if he wants
[23:54:50] <Wolfy> can I wear a corset?

[23:54:56] * AmberTT casually wears her fedora
[23:54:58] <Wolfy> awesome 
[23:56:03] <Compu> i love fluttershy's archery outfit from friendship games
[23:56:06] <Wolfy> I think I'm gonna submit to the sheets
[23:56:25] <Cel> and if the ships doctor runs around naked, that's fine too... but if anyone comes across with less then 5 inch heels... to the brig
[23:56:54] <Cel> no... not the sheets!
[23:57:01] <Wolfy> can I run around naked but in heels?
[23:57:12] <Cel> of course
[23:57:28] <Wolfy> I'm liking this more and more
[23:57:33] <Wolfy> where do I sign up?
