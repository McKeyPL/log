[03:14:06] <IceFlurries> :C
[03:14:27] <IceFlurries> the Ubuntu phone that's available globally now http://liliputing.com/2015/08/bqs-ubuntu-smartphones-now-available-globally.html is only on certain bands :( meaning only 2G speeds in USA...
[03:17:18] <Araiya> Meh. That phone would require me to switch carriers, too.
[03:17:28] <IceFlurries> :/ GSM...so yeah. 
[03:17:34] <IceFlurries> I wanted it cuz Ubuntu :C
[03:18:34] <IceFlurries> but yeah...900/2100 for the BQ phone...america is mostly on 850/1900
[03:19:06] <Vulpixbrew> The Transmog system was not discussed in the presentation, but the website states "Weâ€™re improving the transmogrification system, allowing you to collect item appearances and save your favorite outfits without sacrificing precious bag space."
[03:19:34] <Vulpixbrew> As a person with a full bank/void storage and poverflow when posible to toher characters I love this
[03:19:49] <Araiya> I mean, my Lumia 735 works fine on VZW, and it's not a CDMA device. I just don't see any LTE radios in that Ubuntu phone, which kinda makes that phone a non-starter for me.
[03:24:04] <Vulpixbrew> http://i.imgur.com/Jv4HvDb.jpg
[03:24:50] <IceFlurries> yeah...LTE isn't a feature i need lol
[03:24:58] <IceFlurries> I'm on a HSPA+ Pre 3 atm xD lol
[03:26:32] <Araiya> It's a requirement for me if I don't want to switch carriers, and currently, I don't want to switch carriers.
[03:27:36] <IceFlurries> ...does Verizon not have plain old 3G or something?
[03:27:39] <weisey> IceFlurries: on the contrary
[03:27:48] <weisey> Once you go lte
[03:27:48] <weisey> You never go back
[03:27:48] <weisey> LTE/4G
[03:28:21] <Kara> http://i.imgur.com/ssbjCe7.png
[03:28:33] <Araiya> VZW and Sprint are CDMA/LTE. AT&T, T-Mo are GSM/LTE. That's why that phone is a non-starter: It'd not even work on my carrier.
[03:29:11] <Wolfy> I've yet to break my LTE/4G hymen 
[03:29:17] <Wolfy> pls be gentle 
[03:29:24] <weisey> No I mean in terms of usage experience x3
[03:29:24] <weisey> They should have regular old 3G
[03:29:24] <weisey> But 4G is soooooooooooo much better
[03:29:24] <weisey> Like
[03:29:24] <weisey> Out where I live
[03:29:25] <weisey> I get LTE at like 8-10 Mbit
[03:29:26] <weisey> vs my DSL at 1-1.5 if I'm lucky
[03:29:27] <weisey> Usually down at 256k
[03:30:30] <IceFlurries> weisey: lol
[03:30:31] * Amber is looking at what you guys are talking about and is like "I cant tell if you guys are doing Algebra or what"
[03:30:50] <Araiya> My big problem with the carriers is that AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mo aren't investing as much in their network out here. My old T-Mo phone spent a lot of time tower-hopping.
[03:30:54] <IceFlurries> Araiya: I...was...not thinking clearly T_T sorry
[03:31:24] <IceFlurries> Amber: aww :c

[03:32:36] <Kara> http://i.imgur.com/cc8gZ0w.png
[03:32:38] <Araiya> I'm happy to see that Ting is using two carriers for their MVNO works, because being on Sprint only was a non-starter for me.
