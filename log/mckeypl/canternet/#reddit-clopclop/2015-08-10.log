[03:14:06] <IceFlurries> :C
[03:14:27] <IceFlurries> the Ubuntu phone that's available globally now http://liliputing.com/2015/08/bqs-ubuntu-smartphones-now-available-globally.html is only on certain bands :( meaning only 2G speeds in USA...
[03:17:18] <Araiya> Meh. That phone would require me to switch carriers, too.
[03:17:28] <IceFlurries> :/ GSM...so yeah. 
[03:17:34] <IceFlurries> I wanted it cuz Ubuntu :C
[03:18:34] <IceFlurries> but yeah...900/2100 for the BQ phone...america is mostly on 850/1900
[03:19:06] <Vulpixbrew> The Transmog system was not discussed in the presentation, but the website states "We’re improving the transmogrification system, allowing you to collect item appearances and save your favorite outfits without sacrificing precious bag space."
[03:19:34] <Vulpixbrew> As a person with a full bank/void storage and poverflow when posible to toher characters I love this
[03:19:49] <Araiya> I mean, my Lumia 735 works fine on VZW, and it's not a CDMA device. I just don't see any LTE radios in that Ubuntu phone, which kinda makes that phone a non-starter for me.
[03:24:04] <Vulpixbrew> http://i.imgur.com/Jv4HvDb.jpg
[03:24:50] <IceFlurries> yeah...LTE isn't a feature i need lol
[03:24:58] <IceFlurries> I'm on a HSPA+ Pre 3 atm xD lol
[03:26:32] <Araiya> It's a requirement for me if I don't want to switch carriers, and currently, I don't want to switch carriers.
[03:27:36] <IceFlurries> ...does Verizon not have plain old 3G or something?
[03:27:39] <weisey> IceFlurries: on the contrary
[03:27:48] <weisey> Once you go lte
[03:27:48] <weisey> You never go back
[03:27:48] <weisey> LTE/4G
[03:28:21] <Kara> http://i.imgur.com/ssbjCe7.png
[03:28:33] <Araiya> VZW and Sprint are CDMA/LTE. AT&T, T-Mo are GSM/LTE. That's why that phone is a non-starter: It'd not even work on my carrier.
[03:29:11] <Wolfy> I've yet to break my LTE/4G hymen 
[03:29:17] <Wolfy> pls be gentle 
[03:29:24] <weisey> No I mean in terms of usage experience x3
[03:29:24] <weisey> They should have regular old 3G
[03:29:24] <weisey> But 4G is soooooooooooo much better
[03:29:24] <weisey> Like
[03:29:24] <weisey> Out where I live
[03:29:25] <weisey> I get LTE at like 8-10 Mbit
[03:29:26] <weisey> vs my DSL at 1-1.5 if I'm lucky
[03:29:27] <weisey> Usually down at 256k
[03:30:30] <IceFlurries> weisey: lol
[03:30:31] * Amber is looking at what you guys are talking about and is like "I cant tell if you guys are doing Algebra or what"
[03:30:50] <Araiya> My big problem with the carriers is that AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mo aren't investing as much in their network out here. My old T-Mo phone spent a lot of time tower-hopping.
[03:30:54] <IceFlurries> Araiya: I...was...not thinking clearly T_T sorry
[03:31:24] <IceFlurries> Amber: aww :c

[03:32:36] <Kara> http://i.imgur.com/cc8gZ0w.png
[03:32:38] <Araiya> I'm happy to see that Ting is using two carriers for their MVNO works, because being on Sprint only was a non-starter for me.
