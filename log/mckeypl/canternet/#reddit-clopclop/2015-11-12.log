[11:34:07] <StarStream> ah 
[11:34:11] <StarStream> yea the mane is kind of annoying

[11:34:29] <StarStream> cheaper than customs tho 
[11:34:34] <TheRedOne> true

[11:35:52] <StarStream> oh ?
[11:36:02] <TheRedOne> except that was at my grandma's place because I don't have the space for a sewing machine

[11:37:19] <TheRedOne> *and back
[11:37:35] <StarStream> but a mini sewing machine then

[11:38:00] <StarStream> ah 
[11:38:03] <StarStream> i dont really care tho 
[11:38:05] <TheRedOne> ...I might be able to make room for that

[11:38:33] <StarStream> good 
[11:38:44] <TheRedOne> but at the same time I think they're going to be slightly disappointed in me
[11:39:04] <StarStream> anyway most important thing is you must be happy 
[11:39:16] <StarStream> if u urself is not happy then whats the point
[11:39:40] <StarStream> as long as you yourself is happy who the hell care about ur hobby .. its urs not others to judge

[11:42:19] <TheRedOne> I don't know most of what I want, and what I do know I want is completely opposite to other things I want
[11:43:19] <StarStream> thats an interesting way to put it

[11:44:08] <TheRedOne> exactly
[11:44:23] <StarStream> but its really tiring
[11:44:51] <TheRedOne> now at the same time I want a sort of safety/security that comes with having your own place, in case shit happens, and I got loads of, say, books that I have to dump *some*where and things like that
