[00:37:23] <RNGsus> Yes
[00:40:03] <cloppyhooves> I need to do more of that
[00:40:21] <Katiepony> I prefer wet humping
[00:40:40] <cloppyhooves> Both are fun :3
[00:40:56] <Katiepony> It's much the same as dry humping, except you do it in the rain
[00:41:02] <Katiepony> or in a swimming pool! :3
[00:41:18] <cloppyhooves> That sounds really hot >.>
[00:43:37] <Vulpixbrew> rain wet humping is just fun
[00:44:54] <Vulpixbrew> aka sex in the rain
[00:46:05] <Guilygryph> never done anything outside and that needs to change
[00:46:30] <cloppyhooves> I've done kinky stuff outside, but not anything sexual :o
[00:46:59] <Guilygryph> I've worn kink related things under my clothes out but that's about it
[00:47:31] <cloppyhooves> Like what? c:
[00:47:56] <Cel> when is it sexual and not only kink?
[00:48:16] <Guilygryph> well for one I wear a tag 24/7 except for showering and sleeping or if I have my collar on
[00:48:24] <Guilygryph> but otherwise mostly just clothing items
[00:48:59] <Guilygryph> I wear it on a chain and keep it under my shirt x3
[00:49:36] <Vulpixbrew> outside sex is awesomes
[00:54:33] <Vulpixbrew> I know the great location to it's out in the country a bit
[00:54:41] <Vulpixbrew> off a dirt road, 
[00:55:10] <Vulpixbrew> if you have a pickup take a couple of towls to throw in the bed
[00:55:20] <Vulpixbrew> or hell if it's winter just go lay on the ground
[00:55:41] <iamalion> being naked in snow is fab
[00:55:46] <cloppyhooves> I'd say sex and not kink if it were just like oral or penetration
[00:55:47] <Guilygryph> jelly
[00:55:54] <cloppyhooves> Compared to just flogging someone outside
[00:56:11] <Guilygryph> rrrrr I wanna be tied to a tree and beaten >////<

[10:48:14] <Cel> at least after about 100 tries
[10:49:26] <Vulpixbrew> it took me forever to the flash light shoulder set tokens to drop
[10:50:45] <Cel> I wonder why they made the tokens class based... doesn't really change anything, except if 6 tokes for the same classes drop, everone of the other class is pissed... I'd rather lose a roll or in DKP

[20:38:33] <Compu> it reports itself as a media device
[20:38:41] <cloppyhooves> Oh D:
[20:39:05] <Compu> ur best bet is to put the media on a thumb drive and then plug that into the tv
[20:39:18] <cloppyhooves> Right :o
[20:39:23] <cloppyhooves> I just don't have a thumb drive D:
[20:39:26] <Compu> or run a DLNA media server from ur computer and stream it to the roku
[20:40:27] <cloppyhooves> How do? :o
[20:41:27] <Compu> download DLNA software such as PS3 media server to ur computer
[20:41:32] <Compu> or Plex
[20:41:47] <Compu> then point it to ur media folders
[20:42:07] <Compu> then go to whatever the network section is on the roku and find the media server
[20:42:14] <Compu> then find the video and play it

[20:49:16] <cloppyhooves> Or I could do the profoundly silly thing of moving my Backup Drive over to my TV :3
[20:49:34] <cloppyhooves> If I do go the streaming route, would it matter if they're nt connected to the same Wi-Fi?
[20:51:06] <Wolfy> good mornin

[23:32:40] <Frosty> I'm all  dressed up in my Blues, lol
[23:33:15] <ponder> I am not sure on the meaning of that.
[23:35:38] <Nigiri> I thinks it's a term for fancy military pants 
[23:35:56] <ponder> Ah, I see
[23:35:56] <Frosty> http://www.hanscom.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/2012/12/121206-F-VS938-001.jpg
[23:35:58] <Frosty> Blues.
[23:36:03] <Frosty> I'm wearing them
[23:36:15] <ponder> I took it as blues being depression
[23:36:29] <ponder> And I was like, "He's dressing up while depressed?"
[23:41:08] <Frosty> Nah
[23:41:26] <Frosty> I'm going to a friends graduation to support him tonight.
[23:44:51] <ponder> neat
[23:45:02] <Frosty> I think so. I like dressing up.
[23:46:22] <ponder> So, are you a soldier
[23:47:40] <Frosty> I am.
[23:47:57] <Frosty> Never really thought of myself like that, though
[23:48:05] <ponder> I see
[23:48:34] <weisey> Frosty: can you be deployed to conflict zones?
[23:49:29] <Frosty> Yes. I actually volunteered to go to one, but I wasn't picked up. Another guy in my shop was, tho. Butt head.
[23:50:24] <ponder> Isn't not going where people are going to shoot at you a good thing?
[23:51:04] <Frosty> Yeah, but that's not what keeps terrorists out and away from us.
[23:51:11] <Frosty> From the US, anyway.
[23:51:28] <ponder> Hehe, I see.
