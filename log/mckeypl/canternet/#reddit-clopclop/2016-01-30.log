[07:53:06] <Flame> perhaps
[07:53:12] <RubyPinch> man they like, made the water shiny and that was about it
[07:53:38] <thaostra> And used some higher quality textures, not to mention you can use the console
[07:54:31] <thaostra> Black Mesa is a full remake though, so the levels aren't 1:1
[07:54:54] <Flame> Story same?
[07:54:56] <Flame> O_o
[07:54:57] <RubyPinch> I am p sure you could use the console in hl1
[07:58:54] <RubyPinch> HL1 didn't really have a story from what I recall, so BM should be an improvement on that in any form :n
[07:59:33] <thaostra> Oh, looks like you can. I just checked. However there are definitely visual improvements such as atmospheric effects, and replacing bitmaps with 3D skyboxes
[08:00:01] <thaostra> There's really no reason to not use the Source port
[08:02:41] <weisey> <Flame> Story same? <-- Nope, Xen still doesnt exist

[08:14:39] <Flame> episodes?
[08:14:58] <RubyPinch> its a choice with no official windows builds and no I'm not going to switch OS for a torrent
[08:15:40] <thaostra> Alright, does qb not support PEX and DHT?
[08:16:07] <RubyPinch> it supports them but either qb or my ISP is intentionally being a child about it
[08:16:35] <Flame> thaostra: https://youtu.be/NUHRNgRTx6o
[08:16:53] <thaostra> Does your client not use obfuscation? Usually that helps to keep ISPs from interfering with torrent traffic
[08:17:26] <thaostra> obfuscation in this case being "encryption" as clients call it, but it's really just obfuscation
[08:17:55] <RubyPinch> it supports that
[08:18:19] <thaostra> You should probably enable that if you haven't already

[08:20:31] <thaostra> Flame, You can if a sufficient number of peers will allow encryption
[08:21:57] <thaostra> RubyPinch, You might want to set it to "require encryption" if nothing is downloading for a couple minutes

[08:26:31] <thaostra> Ah
[08:30:15] <thaostra> I didn't feel a need for a tracker because P2P technology is mature enough and modern torrent clients typically enable support for DHT and PEX by default, making central tracker redundant
[08:31:00] <RubyPinch> redundancy is nice though for various reasons

[18:12:02] <weisey> Squish it?
[18:14:07] <Wolfy> Then it would be a stationary dark pixel
