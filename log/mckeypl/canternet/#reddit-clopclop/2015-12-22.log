[21:39:35] <Wolfy> How did kitty do?
[21:44:44] <Nigiri> 3.38 overall because I fucked around in a stupid 1 credit learn how to college class 
[21:44:47] * Wolfy sets about to decorate his den
[21:45:09] <Wolfy> GPA?
[21:45:57] <Nigiri> Yea, 2 Bs and an A in the real classes in a C in the dumb class 
[21:47:02] <Wolfy> Uuuu
[21:47:11] <Wolfy> I got about the same
[21:47:39] <Wolfy> Got 7's in a couple stupid courses
[21:48:12] * Cel tilts
[21:48:14] <Nigiri> What's a 7?
[21:49:32] <Wolfy> 7/10
[21:49:40] <Wolfy> Grade
[21:49:49] <Wolfy> We don't have GPA system here
[21:50:32] <Nigiri> Weird 
[21:51:57] <Wolfy> Yea
[21:52:06] <Wolfy> We do things outta 10, not 4
[21:52:06] <Vulpixbrew> I've decided to run an expirement withmy vvault in fallout vault

[21:53:10] <Wolfy> I know right :D
[21:53:21] * Wolfy puts on a smart bow tie
[21:53:24] <Cel> we do things out of 6... in reverse
[21:53:33] <Cel> 1 good... 6 bad
[21:54:39] <Wolfy> Now that's just confusing
[21:55:36] <Cel> and you fail with a 4... you need at least a 3.5 average
[21:56:15] <Wolfy> That just broke me
[21:56:34] <Cel> but essentially... if you get anything worse than a 3 you're at the wrong school... if you get a 1 you're also at the wrong school
[21:58:29] <Wolfy> What's the right school?
[21:58:43] <Cel> that depends on your level
[21:59:49] <Cel> we have a schooltype for idiots (without disability)... a schooltype for average people... and one for "intellectuals"
[22:00:30] <Cel> I tried all of them^^
[22:01:41] <Cel> same goes for university... if you can't get a degree at heidelberg, try berlin
