[00:11:14] <RNGsus> foxes are cute
[00:11:28] <RNGsus> and furry foxes are hot, and usually subs, so usually subs pick foxes maybe?
[00:11:46] <RNGsus> Like id pick a fox if there wasnt already like 4 of them on here already
[00:12:03] <Vulpixbrew> to be fair f0x type pokemon
[00:12:19] <Squirrelly> lol
[00:13:16] <cloppyhooves> I just like acting like a fox c:

[05:47:58] <thaostra> One of the things I've wanted to do is have a comprehensive archive of clop that's the cream of the crop. A couple years ago I had the Imgur Clop Compilation, but it'd be peanuts compared to what I'd do with everything I've learned since then
[05:48:28] <cloppyhooves> "Both genders" D:
[05:48:30] <Toxotis> Could have 
[05:48:32] <Toxotis> Do it 
[05:48:39] <cloppyhooves> (From the Bethesda stream)
[05:48:56] <RNGsus> whats wrong cloppyhooves 
[05:49:03] <RNGsus> Thats good
[05:49:19] <cloppyhooves> "All genders" is more inclusive c:
[05:49:31] <RNGsus> uh
[05:49:36] <plushie_pegasus> Connor  https://static1.e621.net/data/8d/83/8d83357826adc98c812a3553bf33129e.jpg
[05:49:42] <cloppyhooves> Included non-binary genders :3
[05:49:49] <cloppyhooves> Though I know they probably wouldn't have that in game :o
[05:49:50] <Vulpixbrew> And Im buying to collector edition
[05:49:57] <RNGsus> Well they dont include them do they
[05:50:07] <RNGsus> its male and female, not gay male. the gay part is up to your imagination
[05:50:45] <RNGsus> and if they said all genders then people would expect additional things that might not be in
[05:50:50] <cloppyhooves> True :o
[05:51:28] <cloppyhooves> I don't expect them to let you play as non-binary people, but saying "male or female" vs just "both genders" to not exlude them would've been cool c:
[05:51:41] <plushie_pegasus> http://i.imgur.com/heUakUt.jpg
[05:51:46] <Connor> ((((((( GoT spoilers posted on the eve subreddit 
[05:51:54] <RNGsus> they arent ecluding them, its just not part of the game
[05:51:59] <RNGsus> *exclud
[05:52:28] <cloppyhooves> I guess I'm just addressing a broader issue beyond just this D:
[05:52:31] <cloppyhooves> But you're right c:
[05:52:48] <plushie_pegasus> http://24.media.tumblr.com/0c4cfe06fc38296966ed26c37d91be78/tumblr_mport3r7gb1rcheypo4_500.jpg
[05:53:17] <thaostra> It's re-enforcing a male-female gender binary, even if it's unintentional
[05:53:24] <RNGsus> I dont think they had any ill attempt
[05:53:38] <cloppyhooves> thaostra said what I meant but worded better c:
[05:53:51] <cloppyhooves> I should say, thaostra worded it better, not me D:
[05:53:58] <RNGsus> To most people these days a non gender binary is still nonexistant to them
[05:54:12] <RNGsus> So it would appeal and make sense to more people if they phrased it that way
[05:54:27] <RubyPinch> on a round-about way, just look at it in the way of, you can have a feminine build or a masculine build by default, and can kinda go in between the two via further customisation.
[05:55:05] <RNGsus> By saying all genders, it could cause confusion to people who dont understand that gender isnt just biological
[05:55:23] <thaostra> Sex is biological
[05:55:36] <RNGsus> Yes
[05:55:54] <RubyPinch> it can't really ever fit into game-play as no other character is going to know you before meeting you, and that being the case, you would need to correct every single NPC in every discussion
[05:56:11] <cloppyhooves> That would be an interesting game mechanic c:
[05:56:17] <cloppyhooves> Probalby wouldn't see it in a AAA game, though
[05:56:23] *** Joins: Quinn (Mibbit@Pony-43431f.fios.verizon.net)
[05:56:27] <cloppyhooves> Hi Quinn c:
[05:56:28] <Quinn> hi :o
[05:56:31] <Quinn> hi cloppyhooves!
[05:56:31] <RNGsus> it seems like its not really worth the development time
[05:56:38] <thaostra> RubyPinch, It cannot be done unless the player gets to call NPCs shitlords, or maybe that's in the DLC
[05:56:48] <cloppyhooves> I would pay $5 for that
[05:56:51] <cloppyhooves> :3
[05:56:54] <RubyPinch> I wouldn't say interesting, it would be more like, "I've already corrected 500 NPCs, I just give up, its wasting too much time"
[05:56:55] <RNGsus> And most people wouldnt
[05:57:04] <RNGsus> most people would rather get a few new items than that
[05:57:05] <Quinn> what's this? D:
[05:57:12] <RNGsus> its just marketing, higher demand for other things
[05:57:22] <cloppyhooves> We're talking about gender and non-binary identities in games :3
[05:57:28] <Quinn> ah
[05:57:30] <Futashy> quinn is here!
[05:57:32] <RubyPinch> and noting that this is a society where homosexual views are not acceptable
[05:57:32] * Futashy applauds
[05:57:33] <RNGsus> im on the shitlord side
[05:57:35] <cloppyhooves> (And also Bethesda's E3 stream)
[05:57:38] <Quinn> Futashy is here too! 
[05:57:43] <Futashy> :o
[05:57:58] <RubyPinch> cause like the setting is rewinded back to the pre-80s
[05:58:06] <RNGsus> 50s
[05:58:16] <Vulpixbrew> dawwwww fallout shelter not avaiable on drois
[05:58:18] <RNGsus> This is a time where if you were black you had to sit in the back of the bus
[05:58:20] <Vulpixbrew> droid*(
[05:58:28] <Vulpixbrew> I wanted to play that
[05:58:30] <RNGsus> why would they address you as a non binary gender
[05:58:46] <RNGsus> It just breaks immersion
[05:59:19] <Quinn> stuff like that really depends on the setting of the game :o
[05:59:31] <RNGsus> and the setting is 65 years ago
[05:59:36] <thaostra> There's such as thing as genderless pronouns
[05:59:38] <Quinn> so, obviously not
[05:59:49] <cloppyhooves> I suppose you wouldn't have to have something like this in the Dishonered setting
[05:59:56] <cloppyhooves> But a separate game it would be interesting to explore that c:
[06:00:02] <Quinn> yea :o
[06:00:07] <Quinn> but I agree it would not fit in a game like dishonored
[06:00:27] <Vulpixbrew> setting of fall out is far in the future
[06:00:33] <Vulpixbrew> hello Quinn!!!!
[06:00:36] <RNGsus> It still doesnt fit in the setting thaostra 
[06:00:37] <Quinn> Vulpixbrew!!!!!
[06:00:53] <Connor> You don't pick gender when you choose your character, you pick sex. If my toon wants to be a gender queer helicopter kin they can be. You saying they can't just because they are assigned a sex is wrong 
[06:01:13] <Quinn> I mean they can
[06:01:17] <Quinn> but nobody is gonna call them that
[06:01:17] <RNGsus> I meant they can
[06:01:21] <RNGsus> ^
[06:01:47] <RNGsus> Its much easier to just add male or female, than to add this that and the other
[06:02:18] <RNGsus> because while you may be satisfied with a male character being called she, i want my character to be called zhter
[06:02:45] <RNGsus> Which is still unrealistic in the setting
[06:02:52] <cloppyhooves> I just wish it wasn't like that :c
[06:03:02] <RNGsus> A lot of people do
[06:03:16] <RNGsus> but a lot of people actually grew up in those times
[06:03:36] <RNGsus> Though honestly most wouldnt be playing fallout
[06:03:53] <plushie_pegasus> https://static1.e621.net/data/43/9a/439a607911ef50abb465d20f698aa807.png
[06:04:42] <RNGsus> Either way i guarantee there will be 100s of posts bitching to bethesda about how they didnt say all genders instead of male and female, even though it was an honest mistake
[06:05:35] <cloppyhooves> I didn't mean to seem like I was complaining about Bethesda D:
[06:05:52] <RNGsus> Well you sort of were imo
[06:06:05] <RNGsus> Not in a bad way
[06:06:15] <RNGsus> But other people would take it way further
[06:06:35] <Drago> Interesting topic.
[06:06:47] <RNGsus> I agree, its fun to discuss 
[06:07:16] * Vulpixbrew feels kinda selfish for being more pissed about fallout shleter not dropping for android
[06:07:30] <RNGsus> IMO fallout 4 looked like shit
[06:07:31] <Quinn> im kinda pissed that the game looks like it came out 5 years ago
[06:07:34] <RNGsus> the trailer with the dog was awful
[06:07:37] <RNGsus> ^^
[06:07:44] <Drago> I just finished a long ass RP, trying to catch up.
[06:08:11] <Vulpixbrew> Graphiccs do not make the game
[06:08:23] <Quinn> see
[06:08:28] <Quinn> a AAA title in 2015
[06:08:28] <RNGsus> Graphics make the game to me for $60
[06:08:32] <Futashy> someone understands me :3
[06:08:35] <Quinn> has literally 0 reason to look the way it does
[06:08:40] <RNGsus> If they are going to push that shit on me, i want the price of fallout 3 for it
[06:08:40] <Futashy> that dog was really poor quality for 2015
[06:08:47] <Futashy> no one else agreed
[06:08:53] <RNGsus> Oh I know loads of people who agreed
[06:08:56] <Futashy> clopclop understands me
[06:08:57] <Quinn> it's not a style statement, it's just lazy/poor quality
[06:08:58] * Futashy giggles
[06:09:02] <RNGsus> the animation looked like it was from call of duty 4
[06:09:21] <cloppyhooves> More like Fall Out Duty 4
[06:09:31] <plushie_pegasus> animated  http://mylittleponyporn.org/xxx-pics/picsex_716.gif
[06:09:34] <Quinn> they've got "Fallout" behind their game so people will buy it and excuse  the shitty quality
[06:09:35] <Vulpixbrew> then again werent that playing iit on a an xboneone?
[06:09:45] <Quinn> even for an xbox
[06:09:45] <Quinn> lol
[06:10:03] <Quinn> look at something like Crysis 3 on an xbone, it looks 100 years more advanced than that trailer
[06:10:09] <Quinn> Witcher III
[06:10:14] <Quinn> GTA V
[06:10:19] <Quinn> any recent  AAA titles
[06:10:30] <RNGsus> Even games that came out years ago in 2010 looked better than that mistake of a trailer
[06:10:32] <Quinn> even on peasant boxes they make F04 look like a joke  lol
[06:10:33] <Futashy> gta v has really bad pop-in issues on the new xbox i heard
[06:10:43] * Futashy shrugs
[06:11:22] * RNGsus just wants someone to buy his batman copy for elite dangerous
[06:11:49] <thaostra> <RNGsus> It still doesnt fit in the setting thaostra  <- Ah yes, a post-apocalyptic world set place in an alternate universe with deadly mutant beasts, but god forbid that language and culture evolve to decouple gender from speech because that would make the wasteland too progressive
[06:12:20] <plushie_pegasus> http://rule34-data-000.paheal.net/_images/22efdff264d9e3ba459570c1569becd3/1343118%20-%20Friendship_is_Magic%20My_Little_Pony%20Shining_Armor%20Soarin.png

[06:12:40] <Futashy> plushie_pegasus keeping things on track
[06:12:41] * Futashy giggles
[06:13:03] <thaostra> I did
[06:13:10] <RNGsus> Then you see my points
[06:13:24] <Vulpixbrew> but screw bethesda anyways I lost faith after Skyirm wannabe obnline
[06:13:32] <Vulpixbrew> tomorrow
[06:13:40] <Vulpixbrew> Mass Effect
[06:14:01] <thaostra> RNGsus, I'm talking about the speech in the game, not the character itself
[06:14:31] <thaostra> If you decouple gender, then you wouldn't have to code any special cases for the avatar's gender
[06:14:52] <RNGsus> How so
[06:15:29] <Futashy> http://imgur.com/ipTyHXX.jpg
[06:16:27] <Drago> I like clop
[06:16:32] <RNGsus> ew gross
[06:17:15] <Drago> o gosh I got like an hour long rim the other day
[06:17:25] <RNGsus> :3
[06:17:26] <cloppyhooves> https://derpicdn.net/img/2012/12/28/195613/large.png
[06:17:28] <Drago> and buttsex
[06:17:47] <thaostra> For example in traditional dialogue you'd hear your character be called "him" or "her", depending on the sex you chose for your character which necessitates having to program special cases for using different clips during a scene, but if using genderless pronouns you'd only need to use one sound clip
[06:18:47] <RNGsus> I think that would be a good idea
[06:18:48] <RubyPinch> all fallout societies progress seperately, they probably would not all for-some-reason progress to a point of common use of ungendered terminology
[06:19:05] <Vulpixbrew> I wanna see fallout world
[06:19:06] <cloppyhooves> Like how everyone calls you "Shepard" in Mass Effect, thaostra? :o
[06:19:10] <RNGsus> I agree with that too RubyPinch 
[06:19:14] <thaostra> cloppyhooves, basically
[06:19:40] * Vulpixbrew picks of cloppyhooves
[06:19:56] <Vulpixbrew> Im commander shepard and this is my favorate fox on the citadel
[06:20:11] * cloppyhooves makes paragon fox noises
[06:20:22] <thaostra> RubyPinch, They don't all have to, but it's an interesting idea to throw in if you're making a sequel in a completely different land like FO4
[06:20:56] * Futashy makes futashy noises
[06:21:03] <RNGsus> FO4 isnt a completely different land though
[06:21:59] <thaostra> It is set in a different region and the player is supposed to start in a different vault
[06:22:24] <RNGsus> still the same overworld as i understand

[07:26:01] <Drago> heh, neat pic
[07:28:43] <samonuh> I haven't been horny in like a week
[07:28:50] <samonuh> I think something happened in my brain
[07:29:25] <Drago> That happened to me like a month ago
[07:29:58] <Drago> biggest gulp I have ever seen someone take :P
[07:30:43] <samonuh> ???
[07:31:24] <plushie_pegasus> About once a week i gotta take a break from yiffing plushies to recharge
[07:31:46] <Drago> I broke the streak of not cumming by getting a blowjob
[07:32:02] <Drago> at least 7 days worth o_O
[07:32:14] * Vulpixbrew needs to get humped
[07:32:20] <samonuh> Ah, alrighty :P
[07:32:47] * Drago humps Vulpixbrew 
[07:33:03] <samonuh> I went 46 days without masturbating
[07:33:05] <samonuh> My best streak
[07:33:08] <Drago> my word
[07:33:21] <samonuh> I was so ashamed when I broke it
[07:33:25] <Futashy> did... did you explode?
[07:33:26] <samonuh> Cause I was doing NoFap
[07:33:44] <samonuh> Well, I had sex once or twice in that time
[07:33:48] <samonuh> So I wasn't all backed up
[07:36:27] <Drago> I always type long as things that I end up thinking no one wants to hear some personal stuff about butt sex. lmao
[07:36:54] <samonuh> lol
[07:37:02] <Drago> But this was nice so I'll share anyway
[07:37:33] <Drago> So I'm fucking this chick doggy style in the ass right? And I'm being real slow and cautious because it was our first time doing anal. I was like halfway in when she suddenly pushed herselp up with her arms causing her ass to slam into me taking everything. Took me by aboslute surprise lmao
[07:37:52] <Drago> I was impresssssed
[07:38:07] <samonuh> How do I do anal with my girlfriend without hurting her?
[07:38:28] <Drago> practice with toys smaller than you
[07:38:49] <samonuh> Too lazy
[07:39:45] <plushie_pegasus> Give her an enema first , you don't want a mess
[07:39:53] <Drago> :P
[07:39:59] <plushie_pegasus> And lots of lube
[07:40:11] <samonuh> Maybe I'm into that ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[07:40:16] <Drago> i found my favorite new lube
[07:41:30] <samonuh> Hot sauce?
[07:41:30] <Drago> a water based thick jelly that will get crazy slick and sloppy after adding some water after an hour or so of fucking. 
[07:41:49] <Drago> never have to reapply, just get it wet again and slick as fuck
[07:42:14] <samonuh> Whenever I listen to hip hop, I'm disgusted with myself

[07:44:36] <Drago> nice
[07:46:10] <Drago> to answer though, just a type of KY. All the other ones have been too thin and require reapplication for anything more than a casual half hour quickie

[07:46:42] <samonuh> Damn, I'm doing it all wrong

[07:48:17] <plushie_pegasus> The meds I take make it difficult for me to cum, I get right on the edge, takes me at least 20-30 min to cum
[07:48:35] <Drago> I can esentially go  for maybe 4-5 hours before I can't hold my erection any longer then need a break before starting again

[07:48:54] <Drago> I can hold my orgasm as long as I want in most cases.
[07:48:57] <samonuh> I don't want it to start to hurt or something
[07:49:12] <Drago> I'm with a masochist atm
[07:49:19] <samonuh> Nice
[07:49:19] <samonuh> lol

[07:49:45] <Drago> sweetest lil thing too... you'd never imagine lmao
[07:49:51] <samonuh> My girlfriend's diabetic, which I think makes her get drier earlier than most people. That's what I read at least.
[07:50:32] <Drago> I am with an aboslute freak
[07:50:38] <plushie_pegasus> My plushies love it, but it drives me crazy (er)
[07:51:19] <Drago> I was fucking her face then moved forward for her to give the old orbs some atttention then kept moving forward... lmao
[07:51:51] <Drago> Until I was just sitting on her face pretty hard
[07:53:08] <Drago> sorry...probably no1 wanted to read that.

[09:12:57] <TheRedOne> well that's where the ersatz comes in. hay isn't exactly traditional human diet
[09:13:31] <Toxotis> I don't actually know what ersatz is 
[09:13:48] <TheRedOne> replacement
[09:14:18] <TheRedOne> basivally instead of hay we made hay from potatoes
[09:14:33] <TheRedOne> called straw potato, is a thing in high cuisine apparently
[09:15:04] <TheRedOne> So essentially we made really thin chips, fried those to a patty

[09:16:11] <Toxotis> Hey Melon_Phone 
[09:16:20] <TheRedOne> yeah gonna do that on an alt tho
[09:16:24] <Melon_Phone> that becomes soggy in no time
[09:16:31] <TheRedOne> what does
[09:16:43] <Melon_Phone> super thin fries
[09:16:49] <Melon_Phone> either it becomes super hard
[09:16:56] <TheRedOne> ah but they're not left as fries
[09:16:57] <Melon_Phone> or super soggy 
[09:17:04] <Melon_Phone> there's no middle ground
[09:17:07] <TheRedOne> you cut thin potato chips
[09:17:20] <TheRedOne> and fry them all together in a shaping ring
[09:18:20] <TheRedOne> So they just stick together and form a sort of air breathing potato patty with a crust

[09:23:42] <Toxotis> Ahh i was about to ask if eating hay is healthy at all
[09:24:35] <TheRedOne> far as I can tell, it prolly won't kill you, but whether it makes for a filling dish I am not particularly sure.
[09:24:59] <Toxotis> Probably doesnt

[23:59:31] <thaostra> Flame, Video looks pretty, but I'd wait until the reviews come out. Also funny how Dice claimed to emphasize the game's accuracy with the Star Wars universe, yet put RotJ Luke right on Hoth to fight Vader
