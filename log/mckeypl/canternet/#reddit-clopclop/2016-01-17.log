[02:24:37] <Flame> oh, it;s 17:24 D:
[02:29:44] <FuchsianMilk> such wasted potential the new battlefront, probably the best looking game of last year and in many ways cool but in the end so much wrong with it
[02:30:35] <Wolfy> I think it just needs to be moved to Dice LA
[02:30:55] <Wolfy> That's what happened with BF4 and it got a lot better afterwards
[02:31:30] <Wolfy> Dice Sweden had a lot of potential but fell pretty short on a lot of them
[02:31:30] <Chiv> new battlefront makes me sad :(
[02:31:54] <Wolfy> Visual-wise it's pretty stunning, so I'll give em that
[02:32:11] <Chiv> especially cuz EA pulled their typical DLC shenanignas. Though I'll definitely agree it looks great
[02:32:37] <Wolfy> In total the game costs $110
[02:32:43] <Wolfy> Which is shit
[02:32:49] <Chiv> Eeeeyup
[02:33:02] <Wolfy> For 4 extra dlcs, one of which might be already out
[02:33:07] <Chiv> especially considering the "base" game really ain't worth $60
[02:33:08] <Wolfy> The jakku map pack
[02:33:50] <Wolfy> Compared to the $1=1 hour thing, I've gotten my money's worth like 3 times now
[02:34:44] <Wolfy> Despite that, the lack of some features during gameplay really gets my blood boiling
[02:35:36] <Wolfy> First of all, to DL-44 users: please, fuck off and die, thank you
[02:35:37] <FuchsianMilk> I almost feel bad for the developers who clearly worked a lot to make it look as good as it does and then the games fame is tattered by EA greed and lack of actual gameplay content
[02:36:00] <FuchsianMilk> whats up with DL-44 users?
[02:36:15] <FuchsianMilk> is that gun only for the deluxe edition players?
[02:36:20] <Wolfy> It's a pistol that does 50 damage on short-medium range
[02:36:29] <Wolfy> It's unlockable at lv. 28
[02:36:38] <Wolfy> 50/100
[02:36:45] <FuchsianMilk> so it 2 shots anyone?
[02:37:02] <Wolfy> Two shot, no skill rapid fire ass fuck
[02:37:20] <FuchsianMilk> nice
[02:37:44] *** Joins: Cyan_Spark (Cyan_Spark@sparks.only.last.so.long)
[02:37:52] <Wolfy> Compare that with a jump pack, homing shot and a focus shot star card setup you've got the "I suck and can't aim for shit" starter pack
[02:38:03] *** Quits: Cyan_Spark (Cyan_Spark@sparks.only.last.so.long) (Quit: Sparks only last so long)
[02:38:05] <FuchsianMilk> the gameplay content just feels so half assed in that game which just seem really really odd thinking how big budget game it is
[02:39:09] <Wolfy> Then there's the Fighter Squadron balancing. Holy fuck
[02:39:34] <FuchsianMilk> whats out of balance with them?
[02:39:46] <Chiv> makes me so upset that there's no space battles O_O
[02:40:02] <Wolfy> I love this game mode but shit, if you're rebel and your team knows how to basic steer a fighter, you're gonna win
[02:40:46] <Wolfy> There's like a fraction of a chance you'll lose as rebels and that's if your team is an actual vegetable
[02:41:34] <Wolfy> Rebel fighters have a couple things, a shield, honing shot and a third thing I can't remember
[02:41:58] <Wolfy> And two fighters to choose from A and X wing
[02:42:25] <Wolfy> A wing is my choice because it's the fastest in the game
[02:42:40] <Wolfy> Imperials have the tie fighter and the advanced tie fighter
[02:42:48] <Wolfy> Both of which are exactly the same
[02:42:58] <Wolfy> The only thing different is the model
[02:43:06] <FuchsianMilk> wonder why they are so unbalanced, like shouldn't it be common sense to make them at least close to being balance? or did they just want that rebels would win most of the time :D
[02:43:10] <Wolfy> And they both suck
[02:43:15] <Wolfy> I KNOW'
[02:43:19] <Wolfy> It's so simple!!!
[02:43:30] <Chiv> well, in universe, ties are more maneuverable, but they don't have shields 
[02:43:41] *** Joins: Vulpixbrew (HoneyBrew@Pony-68js8b.res.rr.com)
[02:43:42] <Chiv> weird that they wouldn't at least give them the agility part
[02:43:45] <Flame> o.o
[02:43:47] <Chiv> also hi vulpixbrew
[02:43:52] <Flame> or you can waste all your time on OpenTTD :P
[02:43:55] <Wolfy> That's true and the a wings are canon fastest fighters
[02:44:46] <Wolfy> But shit, they say this is the way battlefront was supposed to be all along
[02:45:25] <Wolfy> Also it's just supposed to be content from the original trilogy
[02:45:42] <Wolfy> Which is wrong because there's an emote from ep. 3
[02:46:10] <FuchsianMilk> and then when you consider that original battlefront was so loved but they decided to just make everything different
[02:46:17] <FuchsianMilk> what emote is it?
[02:46:27] * Vulpixbrew howls ledwly
[02:46:30] <Wolfy> Darth Vader going nooooooooo in the end of the movie
[02:46:38] <Chiv> What, uh, makes a howl lewd?
[02:47:03] * AstralMouse squeaks lewdly
[02:47:13] <Wolfy> Despite all that, I can't help but feel I've developed Dice Stockholm Syndrome
[02:47:17] * Chiv is now doubly confused
[02:47:24] <AstralMouse> :3
[02:47:41] <Wolfy> Cause I really like it
[02:47:52] * Wolfy yiffs at the Vulpixbrew in return
[02:47:53] <FuchsianMilk> it just needs a strong seductive eye contact with the howl, Chiv
[02:48:04] <Wolfy> Also rant over, sorry for filling up chat
[02:48:46] <Wolfy> But howls are usually directed upwards
[02:49:06] <Wolfy> How are you gonna make eye contact that way?
[02:49:07] <FuchsianMilk> oh I'm sure the game is fun and it does look pretty, but it just bothers me that it could have been so much more, it was supposed to be the chosen one, not fall to the dark side
[02:49:11] <Chiv> Soooo eyebrow waggle while howling, got it
[02:49:44] <Wolfy> Definitely, I just hope it gets moved to LA
[02:49:54] <Wolfy> They're our only hope now
[02:50:02] <FuchsianMilk> well you can still look to your side even if you are facing up, yes it is a bit harder to be seductive while doing it but eh, doable
[02:50:21] <Wolfy> Just lift your tail up as you howl
[02:50:34] <Chiv> doesn't most howling occur while sitting, though?
[02:51:19] <FuchsianMilk> don't think so?

[02:51:48] <Chiv> oh, well, huh, guess that'd work
[02:51:58] * Chiv just needs to learn how to howl now
[02:52:00] <Wolfy> Varies
[02:52:18] * Wolfy lifts his head up and howls at the top of his lungs
[02:53:48] * Chiv wiggles a hoof in his ear

[03:07:40] <Wolfy> Oh irl
[03:08:16] <Chiv> Assuming that's what you meant by the applying to another place
[03:08:28] <Wolfy> Currently nothing, but working on an EE degree and applied for an interns position at a local power company
[03:08:42] <Moka> Neat!
[03:08:56] <Chiv> y'know, i asked you about that ee degree thing earlier i think >.> But nice, hope you get the internship!

[03:10:21] <Wolfy> Then it's uniii
[03:11:47] <Chiv> woo 
[03:11:55] <Chiv> *Woo \o/!
[03:11:58] <Wolfy> With the other apply thing, I joined a f-chat room and literally applied for a position there
[03:12:08] <Chiv> oh?
[03:12:11] <Wolfy> It was super weird yet cool
[03:12:23] <Wolfy> Yep, gotta get that rp cash
[03:12:26] <Chiv> i've never figured out how to get into f-chat really
[03:12:49] * Chiv made an f-list and everything but so many of those "personals" advertisments just seem...awkward
[03:12:57] <Wolfy> The ads are rubbish
[03:13:14] <Wolfy> I just went to private rooms and found one that I got into
[03:13:23] <Chiv> hm
[03:14:00] <Wolfy> Most of them are ad free too
[03:15:12] <Chiv> Do some of them have ads? 
[03:15:30] * Chiv runs adblock so maybe he just didn't catch that, thooough he also hasn't surfed too many of the f-chat rooms
[03:15:41] <Wolfy> Aaah those aren't traditional ads
[03:16:01] <Wolfy> More like rp ads and stuff, X looking for Y to do Z stuff

[03:16:23] <Chiv> also random adorable here: https://i.imgur.com/Y4UMY4b.webm
[03:16:29] <Wolfy> And those really fill up the public rooms
[03:16:40] <Chiv> makes sense
[03:17:06] * Vulpixbrew pops up an ad for yiff
[03:18:54] <Chiv> :o
[03:19:29] * Wolfy doesn't see it cuz it got drowned it 100s of other ads
[03:19:39] <Wolfy> In
[03:20:37] <Chiv> So what's this other job you applied for then? :3
[03:20:59] <Chiv> or position i should say
[03:22:14] <Wolfy> Breeder!
[03:22:31] <Wolfy> There lotsa other positions there too
[03:22:36] <Chiv> Hot!

[11:36:07] <Katiepony> Depends if the combined flavors count as a pre-established flavour, themselves.
[11:36:53] <EbonMane> I need to find a particularly sensual soda fountain, clearly.
[11:37:00] <iamalion> Yes its called "Con"
[11:38:00] <cloppyhooves> Would you want to
[11:38:02] <cloppyhooves> Soda jerk off
[11:38:37] <Moka> EbonMane is cute as fuck
[11:38:43] <Moka> extremely huggable
[11:38:48] <EbonMane> <3
[11:38:49] <Moka> 10/10 would hug again
[11:38:50] <Moka> <3
[11:39:26] <Katiepony> I wonder what would happen if you put semen in a sodastream.
[11:39:33] <Katiepony> I imagine somebody must have tried that.
[11:40:23] <cloppyhooves> You'd get cum burps
[11:40:29] <iamalion> all i know is dont ever put milk in one
[11:40:32] <iamalion> it is GROSS
[11:41:10] <Katiepony> Damn. Cum burps is a horrible phrase.
[11:41:21] <iamalion> not as bad as bogwater
[11:41:26] <Katiepony> Eh
[11:41:29] <Katiepony> worse than that
[11:41:37] <iamalion> frothy smegma? :D
[11:41:43] <Katiepony> That's pretty close.
[11:42:08] <iamalion> .... chunkyfrothy smegma? :D :D
[11:42:12] <EbonMane> Two words: smegma fondue
[11:42:19] <Moka> why
[11:42:22] <iamalion> :D
[11:42:25] <iamalion> hi Moka!
[11:42:27] <EbonMane> It's the cheesiest
[11:42:31] <Moka> hai iamalion c:
[11:42:40] <Katiepony> Whelp, I've been put off my breakfast o:
[11:42:50] <Katiepony> So long, scrambled eggs.
[11:43:29] <iamalion> scrumbled uggs
[11:44:09] <iamalion> ill scramble your eggs
[11:44:12] <iamalion> if you catch my drift
[11:44:56] <Katiepony> pls no o:
[11:44:58] <Moka> oh gosh I forgot
[11:45:13] <Moka> some people are just waking up now
[11:45:21] <iamalion> iamalion's time: 02:45:22 and date: 17/01/2016
[11:45:24] <iamalion> i need to go do sleep
[11:45:28] <iamalion> as soon as i fix this bug
[11:45:54] <Katiepony> is it a bed bug? o:
[11:45:54] <Moka> Sun Jan 17 02:45:54 PST 2016
[11:46:01] <iamalion> worse
[11:46:03] <iamalion> php .-.
[11:46:08] <Moka> i'm so sorry
[11:46:16] <EbonMane> >PHP
[11:46:21] <iamalion> i love php
[11:46:21] <Moka> i know right
[11:46:31] <iamalion> Ive fixed it, but I dont know >why< it was happening
[11:47:03] <EbonMane> Some people love crack. Doesn't mean it's good for them.
[11:47:20] <Moka> lmaoooooo
[11:47:27] <iamalion> I made a clone of imgur using only php :D
[11:48:00] <EbonMane> How well does it scale?
[11:48:07] <Moka> hey man, if it works for you, it works for you ^^
[11:48:33] <RubyPinch> http://i.imgur.com/P6FK7g8.jpg dark theme yay
[11:48:48] <Moka> hey EbonMane 
[11:48:49] <Moka> guess what
[11:48:58] <EbonMane> What?
[11:49:03] <Moka> EbonMane: BUTTS
[11:49:03] <iamalion> well the main thing it does is integrate data-driven network effects which lets me enable podcasting life-hacks and share dynamic network effects using beta-test standards-compliant values
[11:49:15] <EbonMane> OMG butts.
[11:49:28] <Katiepony> That's a lot of words o:
[11:49:32] <RubyPinch> iamalion pls
[11:49:35] <Katiepony> Butts is a word I understand.
[11:49:36] <EbonMane> But is the integration continuous?
[11:49:59] <iamalion> main idea is to engage social communities using standards-compliant data-driven values
[11:50:45] <Moka> i continually integrate kink into my FACE
[11:51:23] <iamalion> but the scaling is done using a clever solution to matrix bleeding-edge web services
[11:51:33] <iamalion> (which allows me to unleash back-end methodologies)
[11:52:00] <iamalion> but being simple it means that it can be used to enhance next-generation content
