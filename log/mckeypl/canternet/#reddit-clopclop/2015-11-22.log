[05:16:07] <thaostra> I've been playing Game Boy Color games lately. Apparently the original hardware was capable of approximately 60FPS; on a modern monitor these games have a certain smoothness to them despite the 160x144 resolution
[05:16:44] <Futashy> oooo
[05:16:48] <Futashy> sounds nice :3
[05:18:49] <thaostra> Remember when you had to play in just the right light settings from the lack of a backlight, and you couldn't keep the device on as long as you wanted because you have to swap batteries? Luckily emulators don't have those limitations

[05:21:42] <thaostra> Have a microSD slot to store ROMs, microUSB port for charging

[05:22:54] <thaostra> They're usually 1MB each
