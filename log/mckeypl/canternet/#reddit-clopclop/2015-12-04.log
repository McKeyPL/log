[03:24:22] <RNGsus> Have the ability to upgrade, I have a GS4, thinking of switching to iphone 6s
[03:25:57] <AndChat|244209> What does the 6s do that your s4 doesn't? 
[03:26:15] <RNGsus> Charge correctly i suppose
[03:27:38] <cloppyhooves> Awww, thank you RubyPinch c:
[03:28:56] <Compu> RNGsus: nopenopenopenope
[03:29:01] <Compu> dont ever get an iphone
[03:29:05] <Compu> its craaaaap
[03:29:08] <RNGsus> Alright, why not
[03:29:17] <RNGsus> Be more descriptive, and what phone do you use
[03:29:50] <Compu> because its made by apple, it runs ios, and the new iphones dont have the magnesium frame that gives phones structural integrity
[03:30:13] <Compu> if u want a nice, expensive phone then try samsung phones
[03:30:27] <RNGsus> I own a galaxy s4
[03:30:36] <Compu> alright
[03:30:42] <Compu> well try the s6
[03:30:43] <RNGsus> It's good, charging port doesnt work chrome stopped working half of the time as well
[03:30:45] <RNGsus> I will
[03:30:47] <Compu> or the note 5
[03:30:55] <RNGsus> I will try both, but why do you not like ios
[03:31:03] <Compu> i have a note 4 and i love it
[03:31:07] <Compu> well lets see

[03:31:26] <Compu> its incredibly restricted, u have to have every single app on ur home screen
[03:31:42] <Compu> they only recently added things that android has had for a long time
[03:31:47] <Compu> things like widgets
[03:31:59] <Compu> and the ability to have custom keyboard apps
[03:32:09] <RNGsus> But now it has it correct?
[03:32:16] <Compu> and the update system for ios is absolute crap
[03:32:56] <Compu> RNGsus: yeah but its not any better than what android already has, and android 6 has even better widget functions
[03:33:11] <RNGsus> TBH i dont even use that many widgets
[03:33:11] <Compu> also chromecast works a whole ton better on android
[03:33:24] <weisey> IOS to android is like Mac to Windows/Linux
[03:33:32] <Compu> oh and on android 5.0 and up u can now get screen recorder apps
[03:33:33] <weisey> Looks Slicker, but functions less well
[03:33:54] <RNGsus> I've heard people from android have been switching to apple, i might go with gs6 who knows
[03:33:57] <weisey> But with a little bit of effort (emphasis on little) you can make android look just as slick
[03:34:19] <weisey> RNGsus, Consumers yes, anyone with any tech experience, no
[03:34:26] <Compu> weisey: its already slick imo
[03:34:37] <RNGsus> My GS4 is pretty slick too
[03:34:51] <Compu> anyone with a brain who doesnt just jump on the nearest bandwagon goes with android
[03:35:00] <Scrunchface> where's the pegasus plushie
[03:35:14] <Scrunchface> .seen plushie_pegasus
[03:35:17] <Compu> RNGsus: oh by the way the note 5 and s6 have global themes u can install
[03:35:19] <Scrunchface> !seen plushie_pegasus
[03:35:19] <FineLine> Scrunchface: I last saw 06plushie_pegasus in #reddit-clopclop 21 hours ago saying, "03Off to satisfy horny , demanding plushies, goodnight everypony"
[03:35:41] <RNGsus> That sounds nice, so just install a theme and everything changes?
[03:35:46] <Compu> yep
[03:35:52] <RNGsus> Sounds nice
[03:35:55] <Compu> icons, fonts, even the samsung keyboard
[03:35:58] <weisey> Compu, so does any CM based rom
[03:36:11] <weisey> http://boards.4chan.org/wg/thread/6396024/official-homescreen-thread-44 Android Ricing at its finist
[03:36:12] <FineLine> [ /wg/ - Official Homescreen Thread #44 - Wallpapers/General - 4chan ]
[03:36:12] <Compu> weisey: which involves voiding warranties
[03:36:33] <weisey> Aaaand?
[03:36:48] <weisey> literally nothing can go wrong if you follow the guides to the letter and make a backup
[03:36:50] <RubyPinch> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwbeqPVyxCQ
[03:36:55] <Compu> weisey: most people dont wish to do that since they like to use the warranties they get
[03:37:10] <weisey> plus, you can re-enable your warrenty (providing no QFuse) by just factory resetting 
[03:37:12] <Compu> like, say, if a battery goes bad or some shut
[03:38:00] <Compu> weisey: anyways, having an average user install a custom rom is like having ur grandparents figure out the command prompt
[03:38:39] <weisey> >My grandpa can use the command prompt
[03:38:52] <weisey> >uses it more than the gui because he is used to DOS
[03:39:07] <weisey> Honestly though RNGsus, its all user preference
[03:39:17] <Compu> RNGsus: anyways, also on samsung phones u can get an app called HiFont to install custom fonts without needing to root ur phone
[03:39:46] <Compu> and the HiFont app has TONS of fonts to choose from
[03:40:05] <Compu> as well as being able to install .ttf fonts from a file onto ur phone
[03:40:52] <Compu> RNGsus: oh and if u go with the note 5 u get the s pen of course
[03:41:06] <RNGsus> Need something to fit in my pocket with an otterbox
[03:41:26] <Compu> mmm
[03:41:38] <Compu> u would probably want to go with the s6 then
[03:42:12] <Compu> i have a note 4 without a case (i cant stand how they look) and i cant even put my shoes on if the phone is in my pocket
[03:42:31] <Compu> but maybe thats cuz im short or something
[03:43:45] <RubyPinch> I have a note3 + zero-lemon battery case, fits fine in my pocket, tho I usually wear slacker clothes

[13:00:52] <Serene_Flow> Sometimes you're just not in the mood. Sometimes you do get horny a lot in here. Others, you just came to the pics and are satisfied at the moment.

[13:05:49] <Serene_Flow> It's cool. Yeahm it's just a thing most of us are use to. Also, there isn't anything wrong with getting aroused a bit either. That's kinda what they're for anyway.
