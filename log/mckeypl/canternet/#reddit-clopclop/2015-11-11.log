[02:06:49] <Flame> nothing
[02:06:57] <Flame> the capslock key doesn't light up either

[02:07:52] <Flame> and main reason why i like it: comfy for me and it's Russian/English official, no sticky letters...
[02:08:01] <Flame> any idea what caused it?
[02:08:37] <iamalion> power spike maybe i dunno. can i get a model number
[02:09:12] <Flame> A142
[02:09:19] <Flame> A1242*
[02:09:36] <Flame> and as i said is Rus/Eng
[02:09:40] <Flame> got off ebay...
[02:09:49] <Flame> was new...still had wrapper stuff on  it

[02:15:48] <Flame> ...they give you only C - C? D:
[02:15:51] <iamalion> Flame wireless or wire
[02:15:54] <Flame> ...makes no sense...
[02:15:56] <Flame> iamalion: wired
[02:17:37] <Flame> also i had a usb mouse attached all during the time the keyboard was also...and it still works...so i don't think power spike
[02:17:38] <weisey> Flame: google is really pushing USBC
[02:17:46] <Flame> weisey: usbc is awesome
[02:17:50] <iamalion> well i dunno flame
[02:17:56] <Flame> but...to not include C - A is...not a wise decision

[17:50:25] <Wolfie> usually eaten fermented

[17:50:33] <TheRedOne> er
[17:50:39] <TheRedOne> like lutefisk or what
[17:50:42] <Wolfie> buried in the ground for 6 months 
[17:51:07] <TheRedOne> what's it taste like
[17:51:20] <Wolfie> it's to get rid of poison in the fresh shark that would otherwise kill people 
[17:51:36] <Wolfie> it tastes pretty rank to be honest 
[17:51:45] <TheRedOne> sounds like
[17:51:53] <Wolfie> you're supposed to eat it with a very strong schnapps 
[17:52:00] <Wolfie> literally called burning wine
[17:52:26] <Wolfie> because it scolds your throat pretty hard to numb you from the taste of the shark 
[17:52:45] <Wolfie> it's pretty much a last resort made into an annual thing 
[17:53:53] <TheRedOne> huh, whaddaya know
[17:56:45] <TheRedOne> over here we have "mett"
[17:56:54] <TheRedOne> which is basically raw, seasoned mincemeat
[17:57:03] <TheRedOne> you eat it on bread for breakfast.
[17:57:10] <TheRedOne> basically european meat sushi
[17:57:31] <Wolfie> mmmm 
[17:57:56] <TheRedOne> it's actually tasty, but doesn't keep for long
[18:15:23] <Wolfie> I've never seen the appeal of sushi
