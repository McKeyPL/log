[10:01:01] <AlwaysAlias> hi Cyan_Spark 
[10:01:13] <Cyan_Spark> Heya 
[10:01:25] <AlwaysAlias> Whats up?
[10:01:37] <Cyan_Spark> Just clopped x3
[10:01:54] <AlwaysAlias> Did you make sure to clean up?
[10:08:34] <Cyan_Spark> Well, it kinda all went down my throat, so I guess that's a yes?
[10:08:56] <AlwaysAlias> Well isn't that really the only way to clean up?
[10:09:23] <Cyan_Spark> :P
[10:09:51] <Cyan_Spark> Pretty hard not to swallow when your cock is already in your mouth anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
[10:10:12] <Cyan_Spark> Though I didn't always swallow at the beginning... 6_9
[10:10:27] <AlwaysAlias> Well in your mouth, in your hand, on your chest. Have a snack
[10:10:37] <AlwaysAlias> It's a developed taste
[10:10:57] <Cyan_Spark> Mm
[10:11:13] <Cyan_Spark> I used to just hold it in my mouth after cumming, then stumble to the shower and spit it 
[10:11:31] <Cyan_Spark> Then there was this really hot RDxSoarin blowjob flash one day 
[10:11:51] <Cyan_Spark> And Soarin came, Dash swallowed, my mind was just "ah screw it" and I swallowed too X)
[10:11:55] <Cyan_Spark> Felt icky 
[10:12:00] <Cyan_Spark> Now it's just meh 
[10:12:24] <AlwaysAlias> it's pretty tasteless
[10:12:34] <AlwaysAlias> Want to try what the pineapple does
[10:13:51] <Cyan_Spark> For me, it makes it more tasteless XD
[10:14:09] <Cyan_Spark> Gets rid of the, um, gooey texture and saltiness I guess?
[10:14:30] <Cyan_Spark> I tried vanilla ice-cream once and tasted it in my cum later in the day 
[10:15:07] <Cyan_Spark> I'd even forgotten I had eaten ice cream in the morning, and my cum reminded me of that :P 
[10:15:09] <AlwaysAlias> ..that sounds good
[10:15:22] <AlwaysAlias> I do love vanilla
[10:15:28] <Cyan_Spark> Mind you, I hardly ever eat ice cream though 
[10:15:41] <Cyan_Spark> So maybe my body wasn't set to, I dunno, absorb it?
[10:16:02] <AlwaysAlias> Don't know, time to experiment!
[10:16:23] <Cyan_Spark> Now? :3
[10:16:31] <AlwaysAlias> Cyan_Spark, get some ice cream and eat it, I'll do the same. Put on the netflix and let me suck you!
[10:16:51] <Cyan_Spark> Wot XD
[10:17:30] <Cyan_Spark> It wouldn't be a fair test, though. What if the vanilla taste was just a placebo?
[10:17:55] <Cyan_Spark> You need to be unaware of my diet to truly judge whether my cum tastes like vanilla :P
[10:18:15] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> o_o
[10:18:23] <AlwaysAlias> hi DJ-C0L7[EIT] 
[10:18:33] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> such a random thing to randomly see while browsing through chat windows on IRC lol

[10:20:48] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> dunno
[10:21:21] <Cyan_Spark> My cum is not /always/ vanilla-flavored QAQ
[10:21:34] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] giggles
[10:21:48] <AlwaysAlias> We know that, but we should try and see what changes the flavors
[10:21:52] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> silly stallion
[10:22:00] <AlwaysAlias> If there is a way to make my semen taste like cola I shall find it!
[10:22:20] <Cyan_Spark> I suppose you've tried drinking Coke and then cum?
[10:22:35] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i do know that more fruit in your diet changes whats in your spunk
[10:22:47] <AlwaysAlias> Maybe, I drink like 80ozs a day.
[10:22:51] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> and i could see that changing the taste *shrugs*
[10:23:03] <Cyan_Spark> Goodness gracious 
[10:23:23] <Cyan_Spark> The last time I drank Coke was... um, a few months ago?
[10:23:35] <Cyan_Spark> Or Pepsi, for that matter
[10:23:48] <AlwaysAlias> I love me soda and teas
[10:24:10] <Cyan_Spark> Soda is addictive 
[10:24:25] <Cyan_Spark> Swap your Coke with water for a week and see what happens to your body 
[10:24:39] <AlwaysAlias> Oh I know what it'll do
[10:24:51] <AlwaysAlias> I get the withdraws

[10:25:09] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> caffene headaches are the worst
[10:25:10] <Cyan_Spark> Now when I drink Coke I only pour like half the cup Coke and the other half water 
[10:25:24] <Cyan_Spark> Nyeh heh heh 
[10:26:08] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] stretches and yawns and flexes wings a bit before sitting down and watching the conversation unfold
[10:26:16] <AlwaysAlias> I tend to drink sodas and teas. I only drink water basically once a week.
[10:27:00] <Cyan_Spark> O.o

[10:27:32] <AlwaysAlias> but I love flavour

[10:38:11] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'm trying to find a screenshot that shows the profiler from the game, but my internet is dragging its flank atm
[10:38:52] <Cyan_Spark> Actually I've been wondering 
[10:39:33] <Cyan_Spark> If estrogen is predominant in the body, will sperm be absent in the ejaculate?
[10:39:51] <AlwaysAlias> To the medical books
[10:40:10] <Cyan_Spark> o/
[10:40:13] <cloppyhooves> If someone with testes takes estrogen, it'll cause them to stop producing sperm :o
[10:40:28] <Cyan_Spark> So like, clear cum?
[10:40:40] <Cyan_Spark> Bet it tastes great >3>
[10:41:08] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> fun fact, males also produce estrogen but in lower quantities than females
[10:41:20] <cloppyhooves> I've played with a few trans women c:
[10:41:25] <cloppyhooves> It does get clear, yes!
[10:41:34] <Cyan_Spark> Whoa~
[10:41:36] <cloppyhooves> And it tastes less strongly :o
[10:41:44] <cloppyhooves> And is a lot thinner
[10:42:11] <AlwaysAlias> Its probably mostly the fluid that is mixed with the semen
[10:42:17] <Cyan_Spark> Mmhm

[19:00:46] <cloppyhooves> That Stonewall movie got <$200k at the box office
[19:00:49] <cloppyhooves> This makes me happy :3
[19:02:57] <Moka> hahaha
[19:03:02] <Moka> it even released?
[19:03:06] <Moka> my level of care was at 0
[19:03:39] <Moka> maybe someone will make one that doesn't erase trans women of color
[19:07:53] <Nigiri> Spicy tuna hand roll!

[19:12:15] <Moka> yes.
[19:14:06] <Moka> omfg, both of those posts are just so great
[19:39:00] <thaostra> cloppyhooves> This makes me happy :3 <- Also has a 9% on RT and 3.2 on IMDB. These are good things
[19:41:18] <Nigiri> I've never heard of it, what's it about? 
[20:03:33] <cloppyhooves> It's supposed to be a movie about Stonewall
[20:03:54] <cloppyhooves> Except it stars a made-up gay white guy who ends up being the person who starts the riots
[20:04:10] <cloppyhooves> Instead of the people of color and trans people who did
[20:04:41] <cloppyhooves> So it takes a historical moment away from them just to have a more majority person be the star
[20:14:28] <weisey> Yeeeeeeeh whitewashing movies getting shit on
