[01:27:30] <cloppyhooves> I've played with a bunch of guys who've said they can't cum from oral
[01:27:36] <Araiya> Probably looking for a larger samplin-- yup.
[01:27:38] <cloppyhooves> So I was wondering if that was a general trend
[01:28:08] <Araiya> Though it now makes me wonder whether those guys were cut or uncut.
[01:28:29] <iamalion> mum just got back from her Dr appt
[01:29:21] <iamalion> shes done with chemo. they cant get her white count high enough. shes always had a bad immune system thanks to chernobyl, but with chemo she has basically no white cells. so shes just going to have CT scans ocasionally and we will consider us as having beaten it

[01:34:44] <iamalion> yeah

[01:38:17] <Araiya> There's this pizza place near me that takes EBT cards. I'm surprised at this.
[01:38:35] <Connor> Ebt? 
[01:39:15] <Araiya> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP (which was Food Stamps way back in the day).
[01:40:15] <Giggles> Googles
[01:40:45] <Araiya> If you buy a pizza and do not let them bake it, it counts as a valid SNAP purchase, because it's no different than buying a frozen pizza at the grocery store, aside from having what should be better quality and quantity toppings.
[01:40:46] <Giggles> That's pretty awesome Araiya :O
[01:41:00] <Giggles> Hehe, smart
[01:41:22] <Araiya> That said, I've never been full from two slices of pizza before. I've got leftovers for work tomorrow. :D

[05:25:51] <Squirrelly> ^^^^^
[05:25:53] <Squirrelly> Yesssss
[05:25:56] <RNGsus> add it to the google docs
[05:25:59] <expatriate> or whatever profiles you're willing to share
[05:26:05] <Squirrelly> we have a google doc?
[05:26:10] <RNGsus> 2
[05:26:26] <expatriate> then maybe put that in the community links?
[05:26:31] <Squirrelly> Oh cool!
[05:26:41] <RNGsus> one for our gender, preferences, age, ect. one for dick size
[05:26:41] <Giggles> We do indeed, where has that link got too?
[05:26:46] <expatriate> so it's available to everyone, even new users
[05:26:57] <Connor> Wouldn't take long to make a spreadsheet 
[05:27:19] <RNGsus> just add a link to f lists on one of the docs
[05:27:52] <expatriate> the Clopchat yearbook
[05:27:55] <Giggles> Omg, that reminds me of the teapony summay I was writing! I wonder if I have that somewhere.
[05:28:20] <cloppyhooves> It would be interesting if you could give different answers for topping/bottoming for these :o
[05:28:38] <RNGsus> what do you mean
[05:28:55] <cloppyhooves> Like "Hair pulling"
[05:28:57] <Squirrelly> cloppy, you kind of can
[05:29:09] <cloppyhooves> I would put different answers for pulling someone's hair compared to having my own pulled
[05:29:15] <Squirrelly> Like, you can make one for your dom self, and one for your sub self
[05:29:26] <Squirrelly> Oh
[05:29:27] <Squirrelly> :\
[05:29:41] <cloppyhooves> I guess that does sort of work :o
[05:29:46] <Giggles> Yeah that is kind of interesting.
[05:30:01] <Connor> You can use custom kinks and explain in those 
[05:30:10] <Giggles> But you could have a "giver" and a "reciever" character, as it were.
[05:31:46] <cloppyhooves> I might :o
[05:31:51] <cloppyhooves> For now I'll just do one
[05:31:59] <cloppyhooves> 'cause doing this once takes a while D:

[05:59:36] <Squirrelly> Did ANYBODY but maybe Giggles understand that?

[07:37:18] <princesssluttershy> DId Dirty Bomb come out on early access last year?
[07:37:27] <princesssluttershy> that would be a good game from last year
[07:37:54] <princesssluttershy> though early access games shouldn't count

[10:51:32] <RNGsus> usually from 6-7 hours ago to 12 hours ago
[10:51:40] <RNGsus> though 4 hours ago it was lively
[10:52:15] <RNGsus> Do you clop Allah ?
[10:52:20] <RNGsus> Or do you not partake in the horsefucking

[11:01:42] <Allah> Can't say I've experienced that, but that would be pretty hilarious
[11:02:15] <RNGsus> He started micspamming german speeches by adolf, then he switched teams to the ruskies and started blasting the national anthem
[11:02:42] <Allah> That sounds amazing

[11:08:46] <RNGsus> red and silver used to make it red and silver, but with the new update its literally just red
[11:09:16] <RNGsus> the best description to the music ive been listening to occasionally is music that would fit in a vietnam war documentary
[11:09:36] <Allah> My friend bought me terraria a few years back, I've only played like 20 minutes or something
[11:10:05] <RNGsus> 773 hours
