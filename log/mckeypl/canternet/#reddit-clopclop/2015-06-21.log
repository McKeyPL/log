[03:39:57] <Melon_Phone> es****
[03:40:45] <Flame> yeah...
[03:41:20] <Flame> one thing he talked about was that from early 2000's till late 2000's he was "dead to Lego"...because of another hobby. In a sense, that speaks truth about Lego as a hobby: it truly needs a LOT of your time and money
[03:41:30] <Melon_Phone> I'm here with my 2*4 and 2*2 bricks put together imagining it was a ship 
[03:41:42] <Flame> and perhaps is a hobby best used when it's your sole hobby...

[03:44:08] <Melon_Phone> only gripe I have with vii's x wings is the engine intakes
[03:44:24] <Melon_Phone> they're 2, not 4 and they kinda split into two

[03:48:54] <Melon_Phone> you're splitting a propulsion engine intake into two

[03:50:04] <Melon_Phone> oh well he kinda solves it there 
[03:50:14] <Melon_Phone> having it as a double intake engine

[08:02:26] <Vulpixbrew> not curse sorry
[08:02:41] <Vulpixbrew> nexus
[08:03:11] <Katiepony> 3D NPCs is pretty good
[08:04:05] <cloppyhooves> Horse vagina mod
[08:04:19] <Katiepony> Breezehome FullyUpgradable is good if you like Breezehome.
[08:04:32] <Vulpixbrew> the unofficial skyrim patch fixes a lot of issues. 
[08:04:44] <Vulpixbrew> Sky UI is a must
[08:04:48] <Katiepony> Yup
[08:05:04] <Katiepony> If you're into Immersion, Realistic Needs and Diseases is a great survival mod
[08:05:08] <Katiepony> As is Frostfall
[08:05:37] <Vulpixbrew> whiterun enchanced
[08:05:57] <Vulpixbrew> I use dovakin mountion retreat as a base
[08:06:16] <Katiepony> Convenient horses is a must, imo
[08:06:56] <expatriate> capes!
[08:06:59] <Katiepony> I mostly use dozens of little tweaks, myself, pertaining to the way I like to play the game o:
[08:07:15] <Katiepony> I wouldn't say most of them are essential for the average player
[08:07:30] <expatriate> also something that lets you kill whoever you want whenever you want
[08:07:32] <Katiepony> Immersive Armor and Immersive Weapons
[08:07:35] <Vulpixbrew> yes capes are a must left ahnd rings are helpful the Towns and Villages Enhanced series
[08:08:22] <Katiepony> ACE - Balance Your Own Game is good if you want to tweak some gameplay settings while playing. 
[08:08:22] <Evelina> Yea I was planning so far on getting skyui, script extender, realistic needs and diseases
[08:08:51] <Evelina> there was a mod I used to have that balanced magic out better, (IE magic damage skales as you level instead of flamethrower becoming useless at high levels
[08:08:54] <Vulpixbrew> Helmetless Warrior
[08:09:32] <Katiepony> There's a really interesting magic mod I'd reccomend, but only if you're planning on doing a mage playthrough tbh
[08:09:34] <Katiepony> Let me find it
[08:09:56] <Evelina> I'm gonna play through like my first time
[08:10:09] <Evelina> Sneakmage, Goal, Find the Bound Bow skill ASAP
[08:10:25] <Katiepony> Forgotten Magic: Redone
[08:10:29] <Evelina> Well, sneakmage evolving into crazymage
[08:10:32] <Katiepony> Is the best magic mod I've used :3
[08:10:34] <Evelina> Link katie?
[08:10:40] <Katiepony> http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35339/?
[08:10:44] <Katiepony> I'd watch a video on it

[19:12:31] <Vulpixbrew> ooo I get a death star......
[19:12:45] <Melon_Phone> ?
[19:12:46] <Vulpixbrew> And Naboo is on the map.........
[19:13:04] <Vulpixbrew> Im playing Star Wars Empire at war
[19:13:31] <Melon_Phone> Oooh
[19:14:09] <Melon_Phone> naboo really should've been alderaan in the films imo
[19:14:23] <Melon_Phone> maybe ditch the gungans
[19:14:53] <Vulpixbrew> I think vader had that on his to do lit right after crushing the rebels
[19:15:17] <Melon_Phone> it would've presented a connection between the films, showing the significance and the political background of alderaan
[19:15:44] <Melon_Phone> instead of just "the rebel base and home planet of the Princess" 
[19:16:06] <Melon_Phone> there was a comic I think
[19:16:22] <Melon_Phone> where vader went on like a killing spree on naboo or something similar 
[19:16:29] <Vulpixbrew> of course jar jar is the one who retty much moved to give the Emperor emeregency powers
[19:17:35] <Melon_Phone> remember, if JJA fucks up episode VII, then we'll call him Jar Jar Abrahams from that moment on 
[19:20:38] <Melon_Phone> also there's a VII teaser in the summer Lego catalog 
[19:21:29] <Melon_Phone> it has bb8 on it 
[19:21:40] <Melon_Phone> excited to see how they translate him into bricks
[19:22:02] <Vulpixbrew> likely his own special mold created

[19:22:16] <Vulpixbrew> making him stand willbe a bitch
[19:23:16] <Melon_Phone> there will probably be like a stud hole for him to connect to plates n stuf
[19:24:59] <Melon_Phone> did you see kylo ren's unmasked face in the BtS pics? 
[19:25:37] <iamalion> oh boy i just love sleeping through my alarm for 45 minutes. had ~15 minutes to get ready for work this morning
[19:45:34] <Vulpixbrew> I broke empire at war
[19:45:53] <Vulpixbrew> I blew up naboo and was doing the same to tatooine and the game froze
[19:46:29] <iamalion> "and how were you noticinf the slowness" "i dont even kow how to answer that, it just seems slow"
[19:46:32] <iamalion> that guy was total dick
[19:47:00] <Melon_Phone> they don't want you to diverge from the canon
[19:47:30] <Melon_Phone> I'm so pissed off that they cut Expanded Universe out of canon storyline
[19:48:48] <Melon_Phone> that's Old Republic out of the image 
[19:48:54] <Melon_Phone> so much lore gone...
