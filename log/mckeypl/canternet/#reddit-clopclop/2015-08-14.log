[08:45:19] * Evelina pets the cute IceFlurries

[08:47:29] <Cel> so there too I do manual updates
[08:48:34] <Cel> and even when it works, it takes ages to download... downloading the file manually is much faster

[10:17:49] <Katiepony> But, I remembered it wasn't plugged in. I sleepily search frantically for whatever the noise was, and can't find it.
