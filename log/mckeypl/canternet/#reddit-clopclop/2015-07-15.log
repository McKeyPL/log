[03:48:41] <expatriate> not really
[03:48:51] <cloppyhooves> I think most people with penises have like a really sensitive spot near the frenulum?

[03:51:56] <Squirrelly> But with penises you get to cum on/in stuff!
[03:52:03] <Squirrelly> That seems so fun
[03:52:31] <samonuh> You can put things in vaginas
[03:52:35] <samonuh> Multiple things!
[03:52:39] <samonuh> And have multiple orgasms
[03:52:46] <Squirrelly> Fair

[03:53:05] <iamalion> i can
[03:53:07] <cloppyhooves> I know some peopele with penises who can

[03:53:37] <Squirrelly> I thank the stars that I can :3
[03:53:40] <samonuh> I orgasmed during a blowjob, but my girlfriend was like "there was no cum" and then I kept jerking it and orgasmed again
[03:53:58] <samonuh> I usually need a 15 minute break
[03:54:02] <Squirrelly> Huh
[03:54:19] <expatriate> immediately after an orgasm it's pretty unpleasant to keep going
[03:54:24] <samonuh> Like, I could cum twice in an hour. That's the best for me.
[03:54:33] <iamalion> pleb
[03:54:34] <expatriate> but a couple times I've pushed through and made it again, but to be honest the second one isn't worth it

[11:00:33] <PlumsNThings> *pets Wolfie* My BF would like you

[11:01:14] * Wolfie pouts
[11:01:26] <PlumsNThings> He's more into furry then me... That doesn't mean I don't
[11:02:10] * Wolfie curls with a small whimper
[11:02:17] <PlumsNThings> *hugs Wolfie*
[11:03:27] * Wolfie nuzzles into PlumsNThings' hug, licking him gently
[11:04:44] <PlumsNThings> ^^
[11:05:28] <PlumsNThings> The only problem I have with my BF is that he isnt dom. But thats alright. I can deal with it
[11:05:39] * RNGsus is sub as well
[11:05:59] * Wolfie is Dominos all the way
[11:06:06] <Wolfie> although I like subway 
[11:06:12] <Squirrelly> :P
[11:06:25] <PlumsNThings> Never forgetti Mom's spaghetti 
[11:06:27] <Squirrelly> I'm pretty subby myself, though I have an occasional dommy streak
[11:07:17] <PlumsNThings> God, it would be chaos if we were to have a meetup
[11:07:27] <Squirrelly> Heh nah
[11:07:30] <Wolfie> :Þ 
[11:07:33] <Squirrelly> IRL I can be much more dommy
[11:07:41] <Squirrelly> Especially with other girls
[11:07:54] <Squirrelly> I'm like a 4 on the kinsey scale
[11:08:07] <Squirrelly> I really like other girls, though guys aren't so bad either :3
[11:08:20] <RubyPinch> ur a 10 on the cutie scale
[11:08:26] <cloppyhooves> I'm a switchy c:
[11:08:28] * RubyPinch snuggles Squirrelly 
[11:08:41] <cloppyhooves> The question is, who could be dommiest among us during a meetup? :o
[11:08:50] * Wolfie whistles innocently
[11:08:51] * Vulpixbrew will says he strongly prefers males but if he finds a good girl he will not object
[11:09:13] <RubyPinch> a dom can only dom as much as a sub can sub, and never any more
[11:09:15] <Vulpixbrew> between all the pets, ammm
[11:09:29] <PlumsNThings> I actually remember what one of the first things that made me suspect im at least Bi was. 
[11:09:34] <Wolfie> I can pizza pretty good
[11:09:55] <Squirrelly> Hmmmmm
[11:10:04] <Squirrelly> I think either cloppy or Wolfie would be the dommiest
[11:10:15] <Squirrelly> Definitely not me
[11:10:26] <Squirrelly> And ESPECIALLY not if cloppy or Evelina were there
[11:10:39] <Wolfie> :P
[11:10:46] <cloppyhooves> I know, RubyPinch c:
[11:10:54] <Squirrelly> They....well...I can't really NOT be subby around them...
[11:10:57] * Squirrelly blushes
[11:10:59] * Vulpixbrew tugs on Squirrelly's collar
[11:11:03] <Squirrelly> Nyahhhh
[11:11:05] <PlumsNThings> I really want to be between Wolfie and cloppy with a strapon now 
[11:11:06] * Squirrelly blushes more
[11:11:17] <PlumsNThings> ._.
[11:11:35] <cloppyhooves> :D
[11:11:42] * Wolfie grins
[11:11:52] * RubyPinch headbutts Squirrelly 
[11:11:57] * Squirrelly giggles
[11:11:59] <RubyPinch> I can be dommy too ya know
[11:12:00] <Squirrelly> Hi cutie
[11:12:04] <Squirrelly> Is that so?
[11:12:15] <Squirrelly> You haven't dommed me, though, so how do I know?
[11:12:19] <Squirrelly> :P
[11:12:33] <RubyPinch> trueeee
[11:13:06] <Squirrelly> Also, wolfie's plenty dommy, but cloppy and Eve are the only ones in here that really make me...well...kind of just head straight into subspace
[11:13:17] <Squirrelly> Also Canteloupe...
[11:13:24] <Wolfie> :3 
[11:13:26] * Squirrelly blushes
[11:13:27] <PlumsNThings> If i could actually draw then i would try my best to think of what the resulting spit roast of me between cloppy and wolfie would be like
[11:13:36] <Wolfie> dawww
[11:13:44] <cloppyhooves> :D
[11:14:04] <Serene_Flow> I'm pretty glad I found out about this place now.
[11:14:23] <Vulpixbrew> I will say this about cloppyhooves I'm 50/50 dom sub with her half of me wants to be a fox around her the other half involves her on a leash
[11:14:31] <Squirrelly> Like, Evelina can make me want to kneel down IRL with no more than a few words...
[11:14:55] <cloppyhooves> Oooh~
[11:15:06] <cloppyhooves> Both sound fun, Vulpixbrew c:
[11:16:01] <PlumsNThings> If we were to meet up somehwere. I predict it will only take three beers before we start banging.
