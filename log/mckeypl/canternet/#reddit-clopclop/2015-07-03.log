[05:25:27] <samonuh> Reddit is burning
[05:25:34] <RNGsus> Why
[05:25:43] <samonuh> ...
[05:25:58] <samonuh> Why not?
[05:26:04] <samonuh> jk
[05:26:11] <samonuh> Victoria was fired
[05:26:13] <samonuh> People angry
[05:26:17] <RNGsus> whos victoria
[05:26:18] <samonuh> All subreddits going private
[05:26:45] <samonuh> Victoria assisted with celebrity AMAs. Without her, /r/IAMA is impossible to maintain
[05:26:57] <RNGsus> oh well
[05:27:05] <samonuh> https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3bxqgr/live_thread_of_iama_updates_with_subreddits_going/
[05:27:21] <RNGsus> I guess videos was privated. thats the only one that affects mr
[05:27:22] <RNGsus> *me
[05:27:42] <samonuh> Yup
[05:28:36] <RNGsus> Reddit as a site is set up to forget things almost immediately. i dont expect that many lasting effects
[05:28:55] <samonuh> I fear that what you're saying will come true
[05:28:58] <samonuh> I hope not thouh
[05:29:01] <samonuh> This is fantastic
[05:29:20] <RNGsus> I love drama as the next guy but this one is about something i dont give a single shit about :c
[05:29:48] <RNGsus> 95% of the amas are of people i have never heard of so i unsubbed long ago
[05:29:48] <samonuh> Really? It's probably the most important thing to happen to reddit
[05:30:05] <samonuh> Like, literally half the defaults are down
[05:30:07] <samonuh> In protest
[05:30:19] <RNGsus> Yeah but the only thing that happened was that amas wont happen right?
[05:30:20] <Drago> Hi plushie_pegasus weisey! (sheesh, sorry for that response time)
[05:30:24] <Drago> <3
[05:30:31] <Drago> Hello everypony
[05:30:32] <samonuh> It's not just about the AMAs
[05:30:40] <samonuh> It's about a lack of communication between admins and mods
[05:30:47] <RNGsus> Hasnt that always been there?
[05:30:54] <samonuh> The admins literally did not inform the mods of /r/IAMA AT ALL about this
[05:31:01] <samonuh> Left them in the dust
[05:31:28] <samonuh> And if you follow Alexis Ohanian's comments today (founder of reddit), he's just being  smug asshole
[05:31:33] <samonuh> Writing off all criticism
[05:31:35] <RNGsus> im more dissapointed by the fact that i pressed the button and got 59 seconds 
[05:32:07] <samonuh> I want reddit to die so I can have free time
[05:32:55] <RNGsus> I want reddit to die so that i can create all the subs that im subbed to on voat first
[05:33:10] <samonuh> Voat is gross
[05:33:14] <RNGsus> Why
[05:33:16] <samonuh> Full of terrible people
[05:33:23] <samonuh> All of reddit's shitty people migrated there
[05:33:31] <RNGsus> That sounds fantastic
[05:33:34] <samonuh> ...
[05:33:53] <cloppyhooves> Can I ask you two to take this to PMs?

[05:35:38] <Flame> Can I ask for...well, style opinions? Thoughts on a messenger bag in college? Idk...just curious :3
[05:35:51] <samonuh> Hm...messenger bag?
[05:36:08] <RNGsus> samonuh im pretty sure thats just a troll
[05:36:10] <samonuh> Aren't those typical in college?
[05:36:30] <cloppyhooves> It wouldn't be unheard of for a guy to have one :o
[05:36:30] <samonuh> Nah RNGsus, you're too optimistic. A lot of people legitimately think that way. 
[05:36:48] <weisey> A lot of guys use messenger bags
[05:36:57] <samonuh> I wonder if /r/ClopClop will go private

[20:55:38] <princesssluttershy> and I don't like most of the stuff they did with it after Beta 1.6
[20:56:42] <princesssluttershy> I guess I just like the way that old worlds generated
[20:57:27] <princesssluttershy> I'd probably play it a lot more if I could stream it

[21:04:44] <mib_5ueso7> it's a workstation
[21:04:46] <Wolfie> or similar
[21:04:54] <ConnorCat> About 300$ of computer parts and and an alienware sticker 
[21:04:56] <Wolfie> something awful like that 
[21:05:08] <princesssluttershy> I'm looking at building a $4k PC with two 980tis in it :/
[21:05:14] <mib_5ueso7> I am beginning to thing it's my fault tho lol
[21:05:33] <Wolfie> I'm thinking amd for my build
[21:05:36] <princesssluttershy> I spent like $800 on my current PC
[21:05:43] <Wolfie> mainly because I live in Iceland and I need the heat
[21:05:50] <princesssluttershy> lol
[21:06:25] <mib_5ueso7> princesssluttershy: was that money you earned?
[21:06:38] <princesssluttershy> mib_5ueso7, yeah
[21:06:40] <Wolfie> my budget was $850 then the vendor buggered off and I bought a n3ds 
[21:06:48] <Wolfie> ragrets? none

[21:07:29] <mib_5ueso7> at least that lol
[21:07:51] <princesssluttershy> My current PC can already play any game I want
[21:08:09] <princesssluttershy> I just want that other one so I don't have to build another one for a long time and 4k
[21:08:54] <Wolfie> then you gotta go with a 4k monitor right? 
[21:09:00] <princesssluttershy> Yeah
[21:09:29] <Wolfie> aren't high frequency 4k monitors like riddick priced? 
[21:09:33] <princesssluttershy> I'll probably wait a bit for a 4k monitor
[21:11:41] <Wolfie> you can get mine which I nicked from a school dump
[21:11:50] <Wolfie> 720p niiiig
[21:12:14] <princesssluttershy> Right now I have 3 1080p monitors

[21:36:25] <Flame> in part I put it off...but also it took forever to get my grades from my community college in (I think mid-june was when I got them), and I put it off about a week before doing transcripts, which took another week and a half or so to get there
[21:36:45] <Flame> so...it wouldn't let me register w/o transcripts :/ I think...
[21:38:11] <Flame> also starmen.net seems down :C
