[04:46:27] <plushie_pegasus> Hello Everypony
[04:46:28] <FineLine> Hello plushie_pegasus!
[04:47:32] <plushie_pegasus> Vinyl? OMG thats so 70's  I have nt listened to scratcy vinyl in decades
[04:47:43] <thaostra> I recommend looking into converting your vinyl records to digital, that way you can keep that same signature sound without degrading the record every time you play it
[04:49:02] <plushie_pegasus> If you realy want retro, get an 8track player LOL
[04:51:07] <plushie_pegasus> 8 track players sucked , i would alwas keep a matchbook in he car, to put either under or on top of the cartrige to make it play right
[04:54:10] <Compu> thaostra: i recorded a song from it with my phone, i listened to it and the recording is pretty accurate
[04:54:55] <thaostra> You recorded the song with your phone's microphone?
[04:55:37] <Vulpixbrew> I feel like hell right now
[04:55:42] <Vulpixbrew> Im a go lay down
[04:55:56] * plushie_pegasus hugs Vulpixbrew
[04:58:10] <Compu> thaostra: yeah but i listened to the recording and it's pretty accurate to how it sounds irl, the galaxy note 4 has good built in mics

[05:00:20] <thaostra> Compu, That pretty much sounds like what I expect a phone recording to sound like
[05:00:24] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[05:00:47] <Compu> thaostra: thats what the player sounds like irl
[05:01:45] <Compu> thaostra: u know of a better way to capture the audio with my phone?
[05:02:37] <thaostra> To capture that nostalgic sound, you need a record player with built-in audio capture. Audio Technica makes some damn good record players that sound great on their own and can give you the ideal source since you're converting the audio directly instead of recording what they sound like coming from speakers

[05:16:34] <Princesssluttershy> nerrrrp
[05:16:45] <Princesssluttershy> CDs are pretty horrible
[05:17:11] <Princesssluttershy> records give way cleaner sounding audio
[05:18:09] <Princesssluttershy> I'm actually trrying to find the year that mine was made I'mm thinking now that it might not be as old as I thought it was
[05:18:59] <thaostra> CDs were too limited to beat vinyl in quality. Super Audio CD was a real successor to vinyl, but it remained a niche format
[05:19:41] <Princesssluttershy> according to a guy on a forum the turntable I have is better than an Audio Technica AT-120
[05:19:54] <thaostra> That said, nothing beats audio encoded in a lossless codec
[05:20:57] <thaostra> Princesssluttershy, The 120 is an entry-level turntable in AT's LP line

[23:14:40] <Wolfie> my leg is cramping 
[23:18:39] <cloppyhooves> Too much yiff? D:
[23:18:56] <Wolfie> yiffed too hard >.< 
[23:19:12] * Vulpixbrew nuzzles the hurt leg
[23:19:13] <Wolfie> gotta be careful when yiffing, kids 
[23:19:25] <Wolfie> also true without comma 
[23:19:55] * Cel nods
[23:20:58] <Wolfie> I love the cia's method of ratting out female kgb spies 
[23:21:14] <Wolfie> because it really is just playing the long con
[23:21:48] <Wolfie> so the cia guy would get to intimately know the supposed spy and start a relationship with her
[23:22:01] <Wolfie> of course as a good spy shed keep her cover and stuff
[23:22:05] <Wolfie> but here's the catcher
[23:22:26] <Wolfie> he'd get her pregnant and at then at childbirth he'd listen closely 
[23:22:46] <Wolfie> because in most cases women curse in their mother tongue during childbirth 
[23:23:12] <Wolfie> boom, kgb spy ratted out 
[23:23:30] <TheRedOne> because only spies could ever curse in russian in the states
[23:24:02] <Wolfie> well if she says she's Russian when they meet she'd just be arrested 
[23:24:08] <Wolfie> this is the Cold War 
[23:24:24] <Nigiri> That sounds like a lot of effort to maybe catch a spy 
[23:24:33] <Wolfie> as I said, the long con
[23:25:01] <Cel> hax
[23:27:51] <TheRedOne> yakov smirnoff didn't get arrested
[23:28:04] <TheRedOne> or are we talking mccarthy years
[23:28:13] <TheRedOne> with the board of unamerican activities
[23:30:16] <Wolfie> he wasn't a woman
[23:30:56] <Wolfie> I'm talking about cia methods of catching /female/ kgb spies 
[23:31:01] <TheRedOne> oh

[23:43:18] <Wolfie> scary wigs
[23:43:49] <Wolfie> speaking of which the barber school department at my college is terrifying 
[23:44:18] <Wolfie> you walk past their wing every day and you see the silhouettes of disembodied heads line the walls
[23:44:38] <Wolfie> once got a free haircut there though 
[23:45:02] <Wolfie> she was cute and gave me a very lovely scalp massage before
