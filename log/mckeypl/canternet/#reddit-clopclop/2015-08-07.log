[08:25:58] <captainorange> Don't hate on the human.
[08:26:10] <captainorange> It's what you're stuck having sex with. XD
[08:26:29] <captainorange> Hmm pronouns.
[08:26:33] <Quinn> was just a joking tag captainorange :P
[08:26:36] <captainorange> Well I like to roleplay as futas.
[08:26:39] <cloppyhooves> I think she's attractive too c:
[08:26:45] <captainorange> So, I guess whatever that is.
[08:26:56] <Quinn> I'd love to have beautiful hair like that :c
[08:27:23] * captainorange might have a things for futas.
[08:27:24] <Woofles> [yiff|MF] http://i.imgur.com/hzjb3NN.jpg
[08:27:29] <cloppyhooves> So she/her, then? :o
[08:27:42] <captainorange> Sure, that works.
[08:27:42] <cloppyhooves> I just wanna know the proper way to refer to you c:
[08:27:44] <cloppyhooves> Okay!
[08:28:00] <captainorange> Honestly gender is a very subjective construct, just call me whatever you like. :)
[08:28:36] * Quinn wants hair like the cloppyhooves has :c
[08:28:40] <cloppyhooves> c:
[08:28:54] <captainorange> I like to switch up genders when roleplaying so I've been called all sorts of things.
[08:29:04] <captainorange> Oh does cloppyhooves have nice hair then?
[08:29:16] <cloppyhooves> I'd like to think I do! c:
[08:29:54] <Quinn> one day I'll be as beautiful as cloppy <3
[08:30:01] <captainorange> I can't judge, so I guess I'll just agree until you start posting pictures. XD

[08:31:12] <captainorange> Quinn I kind of agree there, she's a bit too young looking for my tastes.
[08:31:42] <Quinn> captainorange: again ewwwwhuman is mostly just a joke, in this room we have to tag everything as human, so I just make it a joke
[08:31:54] <captainorange> Derp, my bad.
[08:32:47] <cloppyhooves> The joke is it's a pony porn chat :3

[08:35:55] <Woofles> humans are the worst! 
[08:38:21] <plushie_pegasus> I agree! "RL sex is good, Plushie sex is so much better"

[08:39:03] <Flame> o.o
[08:41:14] <Woofles> i hear thunder but there's no rain
[08:41:29] <Woofles> this type of thunder break walls and window pane 
[08:41:30] * plushie_pegasus had a couple of dog plushies, Woofles

[08:41:38] <Woofles> ooooh!! 
[08:41:44] <Flame> Woofles: D:
[08:41:45] <Woofles> can I borrow one? 
[08:41:48] <Flame> it's not raining here either
[08:41:53] <Flame> but I hear thunder far off
[08:42:01] <captainorange> So many plushies?
[08:42:34] * plushie_pegasus has 40+ plushies
[08:42:47] <captainorange> I'd say yes.
[08:43:21] <Woofles> which do you think is your best canine plushie?
[08:44:34] <plushie_pegasus> A 2' realistic dog with collar and leash
[08:45:31] <captainorange> So are they anthro plushies?
[08:45:39] <captainorange> Or do they look like feral dogs?
[08:47:04] <Woofles> hmm, I like both but it's a good question 
[08:47:57] <plushie_pegasus> No they look like dogs
[08:48:15] <Woofles> wohoo! 
[08:48:32] * Woofles sniffs at it and licks
[08:49:22] <Flame> I loved the hike I did today! :D
[08:51:01] <cloppyhooves> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7S7CO2E7kw
[08:55:45] <Quinn> I made an imgur account of yiff! :o
[08:56:03] <captainorange> Wow, they actually do a very convincing pinkie voice. :)
[08:56:08] <cloppyhooves> Yeah! :D
[08:56:11] <cloppyhooves> And yay yiff c:
[08:56:31] <Woofles> yiff is cool
[08:56:44] * Woofles yiffs cloppyhooves
[08:56:56] <captainorange> We must love teh yiffs.
[08:57:33] <Quinn> http://voidpuppy.imgur.com/
[08:57:37] <Quinn> incase anyone is interested :o
[08:58:28] * cloppyhooves moans
[08:58:32] <captainorange> Seems there is a bit of a bias towards gay yiffs there.
[08:58:47] <captainorange> How did they even come up with that term anyhow?
[08:59:06] <Woofles> yiff? 
[08:59:12] * captainorange nods.
[08:59:19] <captainorange> I also wonder how long it's been around.
[08:59:28] <Woofles> the sound some canines make when in heat iirc
[08:59:36] <Woofles> or animals 
[08:59:46] <captainorange> I know furries are one of the oldest fandoms out there, didn't it start off as some offshoot of a sci-fi convention and it went from there?
[09:00:02] <Quinn> captainorange: there are lots of LGBTQ+ people here, so I guess it sorta makes  sense, I like gay yiff a lot, so there is a lot in my albums :P
[09:00:16] <Woofles> I dunno. I'm only here for the porn
[09:00:33] * Flame is sleepy
[09:00:48] <captainorange> I see, it's just strange because whenever I'm on omegle or something it seemed like furries were very hetero male dominated.
[09:01:15] <Quinn> really? a quick look at /r/yiff would show that there are a lot more gay/bi furries than you'd think
[09:01:36] <Flame> oooooooooooo
[09:01:36] <captainorange> Well, maybe only the ones who do yiff roleplaying.
[09:01:37] <Flame> rain
[09:02:00] <captainorange> I'm still looking for a dedicated yiff roleplaying forum, I found one for clopping, but no yiffing.
[09:02:11] <captainorange> Which is weird considering how long it's been around.
[09:02:44] <Quinn> I like to RP here because I'm comfortable with the environment and the people who I RP with :3
[09:02:46] <Woofles> there's plenty of yiff rp here
[09:03:13] <captainorange> Hmm, but how do I go about getting one going?
[09:03:23] <captainorange> Hey Quinn, wanna yiff with me?
[09:03:25] <Quinn> ask around, go to #crpg
[09:03:31] <Quinn> not right now, but maybe later c:
[09:03:45] <captainorange> It was meant as more of a joke, but I won't turn you down. XD
[09:03:52] <Quinn> heh :P
[09:03:57] <Quinn> not really in the mood right now
[09:04:05] <Quinn> my dildo is still wet from earlier >_>
[09:04:18] <captainorange> Okies, gotta love that TMI.
[09:04:20] <captainorange> XD
[09:04:31] <Quinn> well excuse me then :P
[09:05:16] * Woofles #crpg's hard all over himself
[09:05:56] <captainorange> Well that would be like me saying my keyboard is sticky from before, who wants to hear about my masturbation? XD
[09:06:17] <Quinn> lots of talk of masturbation here, better get used to it :P
[09:06:35] <captainorange> I'm incredibly jealous of female orgasms.
[09:06:53] <captainorange> Whenever I hear a woman climax, it sounds like an incredible, life changing experience.
[09:07:20] <plushie_pegasus> remember to take any RP to #crpg 
[09:07:40] * Woofles #crpg's onto plushie_pegasus' back
[09:07:41] <Quinn> everyone is really open here about that stuff, just fyi captainorange 
[09:08:15] <plushie_pegasus> captainorange, when when a plushie orgasms it's also incredible
[09:08:27] <captainorange> It's fabric, how does that even happen?
[09:08:57] <Woofles> it's magic fabric 
[09:08:58] <plushie_pegasus> If you lovea plushie enough they can become sentient

[09:10:03] <plushie_pegasus> My plushies talk to me
[09:11:02] <captainorange> Ok, well an accepted world religion is centered around a dead guy becoming a zombie.

[09:25:22] <plushie_pegasus> Quinn, do you beleive in god?

[09:27:06] <Quinn> heh he looks so smug Woofles 
[09:27:47] <plushie_pegasus> Some of your soul can inhabit a plushie. 
[09:27:48] <StarStream> well.. imagination is unique in a sense that if u love something a lot it tend to bleed into reality
[09:27:58] <StarStream> and also like what plushie_pegasus said
