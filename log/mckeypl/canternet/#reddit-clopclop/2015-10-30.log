[01:06:21] <Nigiri> D:
[01:06:35] <Frosty> She doesn't let him do anything fun
[01:07:02] <Frosty> And the worst part is he's choosing her over friends he's had for 10+ years.
[01:07:14] <Cel> I know that problem. I lost my best friend to that same thing about a year ago
[01:07:29] <Frosty> Did they ever recover?
[01:07:45] * Cel shakes head
[01:08:03] <Frosty> Oh man.
[01:08:07] <Frosty> What a shame.
[01:08:16] <Frosty> I like to think I'd never let that happen
[01:09:28] <Cel> "I'll join you later, just have to make a call" - "go on without me" - "I've already got things planned" - "I'm gone for the weekend" - "maybe next month"... and that'S that
[01:09:53] <Frosty> I wouldn't think that'd happen until they get married.
[01:10:04] <Frosty> It's such a shame. I really liked him, no homo
[01:10:29] <Frosty> He never comes into chat, too.
[01:10:39] <Frosty> Oh, BTdubs I'm talking about Giggles.
[01:11:06] <Cel> oh
[01:11:34] <Frosty> Lol, you seem to carew a lot less now.
[01:14:23] <Cel> I'm just thinking about how often I've seen that name... not often
[01:15:20] <Frosty> Oh, he's an old member. As old as me, actually. He started coming in a lot less once they started dating, and becames more of a douche.
[01:15:52] <Frosty> The wosrt part is that now they have an apartment together so she has him trapped.
[01:16:05] <Cel> D:
[01:16:37] <Frosty> Yeah. I feel so bad for him.
[01:17:08] <Cel> the question is... is he more of a douche because he "leveled up" in life... or because he's now subconsciously oppressed^^
[01:18:49] <Frosty> Mosdef the prior. He's been oppressed to a good degree most his life. He's become content with it
