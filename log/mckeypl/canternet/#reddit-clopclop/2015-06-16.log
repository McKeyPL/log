[00:00:31] <Flame> haha xD yeah
[00:00:42] <Flame> well...personally I'm not too upset. 
[00:00:50] <Flame> perhaps the textures weren't all done? xD idk
[00:02:00] <thaostra> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXU5k4U8x20&t=190 <- Looks like the AT-AT's head moves a bit when the speeder gets too close. You'd think they would redo that scene
[00:04:12] <Flame> https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/39xv2m/teslas_model_3_will_boast_a_250mile_or_greater/ WOO :D
[00:04:20] <Flame> yeah o.o
[00:05:22] <Flame> thaostra: for me, it's a joy to see it so well done *as it is*...yes, there are many improvements that could be made, but for now I shall bask in the circle jerk that is Star Wars fandom xD
[00:07:03] <thaostra> It looks good, but is probably scripted which would explain the sudden head jerk that would otherwise result in the speeder crashing into it. I'd reserve further judgement until I see actual gameplay
[00:08:44] <Flame> same...I'm reserving further judgement for free-hand gameplay...
[00:08:47] <Flame> xD
[00:08:53] <Flame> btw, I now have mesa 10.6 :D

[00:10:22] <thaostra> Meh, there's still no GL4 compliance. Good to know my Intel GPU still can't be utilized
[00:10:31] <Flame> :c
[00:10:38] <Flame> "utilized"?
[00:11:57] <thaostra> Ivy Bridge can support up to GL4.0 with the Intel driver on Windows, but on Linux can only get 3.3

[08:26:24] <cloppyhooves> Yiff >> http://i.imgur.com/jgE4U2a.png
[08:27:38] <Squirrelly> MMmmnnnnn
[08:30:47] <Giggles> Yea but, why?
[08:31:44] <Futashy> there was a thingy in the news about how the company behind magic constantly fights to keep prices low on all cards
[08:31:51] <Futashy> was really interesting
[08:31:52] * Futashy shrugs
[08:32:47] <Giggles> Bleh, they're not fighting enough. :\
[08:33:07] <Giggles> It's a crime that they didn't reprint Serum Visions in MM15
[08:34:02] <Futashy> they literally mass print cards that become worth a lot to devalue them
[08:34:06] <Futashy> along with printing 'better' ones
[08:34:24] <Futashy> to make sure people actually play the cards, not just keep them for money
[08:35:00] <Giggles> Yea I still think they could be doing more. And they aren't doing anything for older formats either.
[08:35:25] <Futashy> at least they are trying
[08:35:28] * Futashy pouts at Giggles 
[08:35:34] <Giggles> Serum Visions is a common and it's over ten dollars.
[08:36:27] <Squirrelly> Honestly, having any card that's been printed recently be more than $100 is crazy
[08:36:45] <Futashy> i should have been asleep hours ago
[08:36:47] * Futashy flails
[08:36:47] <Giggles> Sorry, I'm pretty familiar with what Wizard's is doing, I'm just annoyed because I have to live with the ridiculous prices they claim to be trying to fix. :\
[08:38:30] <Giggles> The real enemy is actually collectors who don't want their cards devalued. Wizard's can only do so much to reduce prices because they're customer base will actually get offended by it.

[22:12:41] <cloppyhooves> D:
[22:14:46] <Vulpixbrew> when a bottle of lube cost more then a medium chance
[22:16:39] <Vulpixbrew> oh welll cum lube it is
[22:17:12] <weisey> http://i.imgur.com/RrO9jOw.gif
[22:17:23] <cloppyhooves> A bottle of lube was $100???
[22:17:33] <weisey> Holy fucking shit what?
[22:17:52] <cloppyhooves> I think medium chance is like $125
[22:17:55] <cloppyhooves> Or it was when I bought it
[22:18:00] <Vulpixbrew> wait I thought it cost 80
[22:18:05] <cloppyhooves> I think that's the small
[22:18:16] <weisey> A BOTTLE OF LUBE WAS 80+ DOLLARS???
[22:18:27] <Vulpixbrew> either way
[22:18:37] <Vulpixbrew> I know right
[22:18:54] <Vulpixbrew> there wasnt anything cheaper then 30
[22:20:02] <cloppyhooves> Was it at least like a gallon of lube?
[22:20:08] <cloppyhooves> Becuase geez that's insane
[22:20:20] <Vulpixbrew> I think it was a liter it was a large bottle but still
[22:22:37] <cloppyhooves> Bad Dragon lube, if you don't buy in bulk, is $7 per 8 oz
[22:22:46] <cloppyhooves> ACcording to google, that makes it $30 per liter
[22:22:55] <cloppyhooves> And bad dragon lube is definitely not on the cheaper end of lube
[22:23:03] <cloppyhooves> How on earth is a liter of lube $80 >.>
[22:23:08] <cloppyhooves> Unless it's like actual dragon semen
[22:23:35] <Vulpixbrew> I have no idea I imagine a drop of it and you couyld take a xl conkers with ease
[22:27:57] <cloppyhooves> http://professor-ponyarity.deviantart.com/art/Luna-Says-Ew-539973682
[22:29:28] <cloppyhooves> Also because I have too much tim eon my hands:
[22:29:40] <cloppyhooves> Buying in bulk lowers it from $30/liter to $23/liter

[22:31:16] <Vulpixbrew> well not flying but going througjh an airport
[22:35:43] <Vulpixbrew> 2 bottles of cum lube 16 oz of lube with shipping comes out to 28.55
[22:37:17] <weisey> IT also costs ~ 2 grand to shower in cumlube for 5 minutes
[22:37:32] <Vulpixbrew> I will do that one day
[22:37:38] <Vulpixbrew> and take video of it
[22:38:25] <weisey> though the price is fairly drastically reduced if you got for one of those low-flow heads
[22:38:33] <weisey> high pressure low flow*
