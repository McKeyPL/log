[17:07:26] * RubyPinch squirms
[17:10:16] * Vulpixbrew pokes the squirm RubyPinch
[17:10:52] <RubyPinch> i feel so unwell
[17:11:04] <Cel> D:
[17:12:12] <RubyPinch> a right to live makes sense from a moral pov
[17:12:44] <RubyPinch> but there is nothing for that, if you can't get work, you can't get money, if you can't get money, you become homeless, then you can't get work because of that, then you die
[17:14:05] <Cel> that's what the social system is for... in my country there are thousands of "hartz 4 empf√§nger"... who live solely on tax money
[17:14:52] <Vulpixbrew> Im stuck in the can't get work cycle
[17:15:17] <RubyPinch> I have enough savings that getting into the socialism side of things is more difficult, but I am literally on the edge, so I obviously have about enough to live for, you know, some weeks at best
[17:16:24] * Cel nods
[17:16:57] <RubyPinch> so the option is to say, fuck this money I got over my lifetime so I can be paid piddlywink, and not afford psych to help with my dickass fears of reality n' shit, because being afraid is a bloody hard sell to healthcare systems
[17:17:28] <RubyPinch> so then I can't fulfill "trying to be a productive member", fall out of the safety net, homeless, die
[17:20:52] <RubyPinch> and that whole pre-emptive filtering bull, I can't even get into my dream job when given the chance, because some hirers think colorblindness is some disabilititating thing 100% of the time
[17:21:05] <RubyPinch> not like there are different kinds and strengths
[17:21:26] <Rylee> err
[17:21:27] <Rylee> aren't there anit-discrimination laws
[17:21:40] <Cel> didn't you want to do programming? how does colorblindness hinder in that?
[17:21:59] <RubyPinch> anti-discrimination laws instantly fold if the discrimination can be related to the work itself
[17:22:57] <RubyPinch> you can't hire a person in a wheelchair to do maintainance on radio towers, after all
[17:23:03] <Rylee> sure, yes
[17:23:07] <RubyPinch> Cel: nah I hate programming
[17:23:32] <Cel> ah^^ well what's it then?
[17:23:43] <RubyPinch> IT/electrical for a telco
[17:24:04] <RubyPinch> I like IT, I like electrical
[17:24:57] <RubyPinch> but apparantly, since I'm low levels of red-green colorblindness, I obviously obviously, can't tell the difference between red and green
[17:25:30] <RubyPinch> it should really be called dark-muddy-colors-which-are-not-blue-can-be-confusing-sometimes colorblindness
[17:26:55] <RubyPinch> it prevents me from bloody naming colors, but it doesn't mean I can't hold two wires together and say "yep, these are the same hue and shade"
[17:28:09] <RubyPinch> and yeah sorry for like, TMI in here, just, I've somewhat run out of places right now
[17:28:14] <Cel> true... and as long as you don't constantly handle higher voltage it shouldn'T matter at all
[17:29:14] <Cel> I was thinking about how often I had to handle green cables, but that's highly irrelevant^^
[17:29:59] <RubyPinch> its more a question of, how often you handle muddybrowngreen cables and muddybrownred cables together
[17:30:19] <RubyPinch> and the cables arn't ordered
[17:30:27] <Cel> all our network cables were either green or yellow... so that wouldn't be an issue in any universe^^
[17:30:30] <Cel> yea
[17:31:05] <Cel> and cables for electric wireing are obvious... black and blue... yellow with green stripes... such things
[17:32:44] <RubyPinch> exactly
[17:35:29] <Cel> I think when they give such excuses they just don't want to talk about the real issue... I had so many rejections because they just didn't like me, and they always had to give some nonsensical reason because "not liking" isn't acceptable... only one told me straight that I'm socially incompatible^^
[17:37:24] <Cel> best one... I once noticed my interview failed when I said "I mainly use linux"... his attitude changed instantly
