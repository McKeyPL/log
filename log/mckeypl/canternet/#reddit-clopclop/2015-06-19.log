[00:16:37] <SleepyPon> .. when did it  become OK for people to wear underwear around outside...
[00:16:56] <cloppyhooves> ?
[00:17:08] <SleepyPon> like, men in tshirts
[00:17:11] <SleepyPon> women in bikinis
[00:17:12] <RNGsus> SleepyPon like you dont do that?
[00:17:22] <SleepyPon> How do you mean, RNGsus?
[00:18:07] <RNGsus> you dont wear your underwear everywhere?
[00:18:13] <SleepyPon> not on the outside!
[00:18:22] <RNGsus> heheh
[00:21:04] <SleepyPon> ... so no ideas on my poll? :P

[00:21:47] <SleepyPon> go to the movie?
[00:22:29] <Drago> I dunno dude. Whatever you want. 
[00:23:08] <SleepyPon> well, i want all those
[00:23:22] <SleepyPon> I normally ask advice when i'm conflicted :)
[00:23:52] <Drago> I wish I would have tried minecraft when it first came out. I still think about playing it but I don't like to come into an mmo and be clueless. I like when everyone is just as clueless lol
[00:24:04] <SleepyPon> it's not an MMO :)
[00:24:07] <SleepyPon> lol
[00:24:14] <SleepyPon> it's mainly single player, buddy
[00:24:22] <TheRedOne> eh depends
[00:25:08] <TheRedOne> working with others can really help build stuff
[00:27:20] <SleepyPon> that's true
[00:27:25] <SleepyPon> but it isn't necessary, was m point
[00:32:13] <iamalion> everyone who rides an elevator eventually gets off
[00:32:19] <TheRedOne> lol
[00:32:41] <Drago> Hey iamalion 
[00:32:47] <iamalion> oha2u
[00:33:29] <cloppyhooves> T-shirts aren't really underwear, no?
[00:33:37] <cloppyhooves> And bikinis makes sense if you're near a beach, I guess
[00:33:48] <SleepyPon> yes, T-shirts are underwear
[00:33:49] <cloppyhooves> Or if you're sunbathing
[00:34:00] <SleepyPon> but... a bikini shows more than most ladies undergarments!
[00:34:05] * SleepyPon is blushing
[00:34:14] <cloppyhooves> It's different, though
[00:34:18] <SleepyPon> how so?
[00:34:25] * SleepyPon is honestly asking
[00:34:43] <cloppyhooves> Bikinis are the outermost layer, so you prepare yourself to be seen with that
[00:34:56] <cloppyhooves> Underwear isn't, so you aren't prepared to be seen in just that
[00:35:03] <SleepyPon> but they expose more of one's self.
[00:35:10] <cloppyhooves> Plus underwear can be lacy or frilly while bikinis can't
[00:35:49] <TheRedOne> I could imagine some frilly bikinis tho.
[00:36:01] <cloppyhooves> How often do you see a frilly bikini? :o
[00:36:17] <TheRedOne> not often I'll admit
[00:36:29] * SleepyPon loves the idea of a frilly bikini now
[00:36:34] * SleepyPon whimpers :)
[00:36:59] <TheRedOne> I think I'd seen one in a manga/anime or two, and maybe actually irl. but I don't pay wildly much attention to bikinis I've seen on others
