[07:22:30] <Quinn> ^ basically
[07:22:59] <Serene_Flow> Same.
[07:23:00] <Quinn> but I stopped enjoying the show and that sorta translated into not liking the porn either

[10:43:33] <Plums> SO serene
[10:43:40] <Plums> Anything new happening?
[10:49:35] <Serene_Flow> Well today me and my Mom and an annoying adventure trying to find a "unique" lightbulb for my ceiling fan light.
[10:52:24] <Serene_Flow> Rewind a week ago. We got a ceiling fan for my room that had some lights from Home Depot. It later gets installed and the lights aren't too bright. Mainly because they're forsted and kinda small.
[10:53:28] <Serene_Flow> So we got bigger ones, but the dome that surronds the light is too small for them to fit. So, we head to Home Depot with the lights it camw ith in order to find better ones.
[10:54:10] <Serene_Flow> We ask if they had any that size, but brighter, and they don't even have the kind we have. At all.
[10:56:39] <Serene_Flow> Why they sell a ceiling fan light, but not the bulbs that it uses. We don't know. I ask if they needed to see the fan, but they said no. Then to immediately say if it's a new ceiling fan, they might not have the bulbs yet. To which I think to myself. "Then why didn't you want me to show you what the hell we got then so you know if it's new or not."
[10:58:51] <Serene_Flow> They look online and can't find anything anything on their store and one of them tells us there's a specialty store that only sells light bulbs so we might find them there. My Mom was thinking it might be easier just to take the ceiling fan back, but they obvioulsy didn't want that and say since it's already installed, just try and look for the bulb.
[11:00:36] <Serene_Flow> We don't go to the store, but to Lowes and they don't have the bulb either. We think maybe just get a different dome, but wasn't sure if what size to get. We head back to Home Depot to find the people we were talking to, to ask if it could be change, but none of them were there and couldn't find anyone to help.
[11:02:41] <Serene_Flow> Not only that, but Home Depot didn't have any good domes to begin with, so we figure just head back to Lowes. We go home and get the dome and along the way thought maybe Wal-Mart across the street from Home Depot might have thes off chance of having some domes we could get.
[11:03:36] <Serene_Flow> We go into Wal-Mart into the light ection and see their light bulbs. And within said section we say them. The vary Light bulb we needed, but not frosted.
[11:06:06] <Serene_Flow> So in the end. They weren't unique at all. It's just Home Depot, the store that sold the ceiling light and Lowes, both just didn't have the bulb. But a Wal-Mart across the street from said Home Depot did have them.
[11:11:12] <Plums> o...okay
[11:13:54] <Serene_Flow> Sorry for the wall of text. Like I said. It was an adventure.

[17:07:14] <Squirrelly> Hi!
[17:08:51] <RubyPinch> wow Squirrel
[17:08:54] * RubyPinch catches it
[17:08:58] <Squirrelly> ?
[17:10:04] <Connor> Squirrel?? 
[17:10:12] * Connor chases it 
[17:10:13] * RubyPinch nibbles and licks Squirrelly 
[17:10:18] <Squirrelly> EEP!
[17:10:21] <RubyPinch> nu is mine
[17:10:23] <Squirrelly> I'm just here for a little bit
[17:10:30] * Squirrelly jumps onto the filly
[17:11:00] <RubyPinch> aw ye
[17:17:27] * Vulpixbrew tugs on the Squirrelly tail
[17:20:12] * Squirrelly squeaks
[17:49:07] <Vulpixbrew> if you haven't I suggest Doctor Strangelove as a movie to watch
[17:49:44] <Vulpixbrew> Stanley  Kubrick was point on in the movioe
[17:50:38] <Squirrelly> Eh. Kubrick's stuff always just feels...a little over-the-top-artsy to me
[17:50:54] <Squirrelly> Like 2001: A Space Odyssey
[17:51:13] <Frosty> Rubber is a great movie.
[17:51:18] <Squirrelly> No
[17:51:23] <Squirrelly> No it's not
[17:51:26] <Frosty> It's a classic
[17:51:33] <Squirrelly> It's terrible AT BEING TERRIBLE
[17:51:34] <Vulpixbrew> I normally don't like his movies the beginning of FUllmetal jacket and Doctor strangelove being the exceptions
[17:51:53] <Squirrelly> It tried too hard to be a funny bad movie, and ended up just being a terrible movie
[17:51:55] <Frosty> FMJ started to suck after the dude dies.
[17:52:00] * RubyPinch tirerolls around Squirrelly 
[17:52:09] <Squirrelly> But yeah, FMJ was hilarious until about halfway through
[17:52:41] <Frosty> Is Strangelove the one with NPH?
[17:52:50] <Frosty> No, that's Dr. Horrible, nvm
[17:53:10] <RubyPinch> one of my fave channels got "youtube partnered" by someone who wasn't youtube
[17:53:52] <RubyPinch> a week later, all their videos gone from youtube, only runs through their own site now, which is full of links to basically a low-quality video farm
[17:53:52] <Squirrelly> You mean sponsored?
[17:54:15] <Squirrelly> ewwwwww
[17:54:17] <Squirrelly> That sucks
[17:54:18] <RubyPinch> no, I mean one of those channel shitters whtat offers to "protect" and "help" a channel
[17:54:24] <Squirrelly> Ah
[17:54:31] <Vulpixbrew> FMJ was meant to feel like two differnet movies, what stateside was conmpared to Warzone
[17:55:15] <RubyPinch> they brand it as youtube partnerships, but as soon as you try looking for it, you find nothing remotely close x-x
[17:56:36] <Vulpixbrew> anyways this fox has to run
