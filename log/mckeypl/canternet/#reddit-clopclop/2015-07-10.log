[05:50:54] <Princesssluttershy> Holy shit and the x files

[05:51:24] <Inuria> Battlestar or X-Files? 
[05:51:29] <Princesssluttershy> both
[05:51:36] <Inuria> I couldn't finish Battlestar Galactica

[05:52:23] <Inuria> The acting was just D:
[05:52:36] <Inuria> The 20-some characters with no depth
[05:52:53] <Princesssluttershy> at least they put Dr Who high on the list... it doesn't deserver to be ahead Star Trek, Firefly or Stargate
[05:53:11] <Inuria> Never watched Dr Who
[05:53:27] <Princesssluttershy> It's good up to the last season or so of Tennant
[05:53:42] <Inuria> Mmmmmm
[05:53:51] <Princesssluttershy> then Smith and the new writer made it horrible
[05:54:07] <Princesssluttershy> But Peter Capaldi's stuff has been good from what I've seen
[05:54:37] <Princesssluttershy> Wait they split TNG and the original Star Trek up

[05:56:17] <Inuria> Remove a show you want to watch from Netflix
[05:56:32] <Inuria> Like I was rewatching Terminator 2 before going to see Terminator Genisys
[05:56:48] <Princesssluttershy> T2 is awesome
[05:56:54] <Inuria> I didn't finish it before heading out for Genisys

[05:57:11] <Inuria> ...DVD Only
[05:57:18] <Inuria> And it's like, "Oh, Come on!"

[05:58:21] <Princesssluttershy> It's boring

[06:00:28] <Princesssluttershy> At least Rose had character
[06:00:39] <Princesssluttershy> Clara is just... blegh
[06:00:53] <Princesssluttershy> and Peter Capaldi is so good 
[06:01:27] <Princesssluttershy> and the writing isn't as shitty as it was when Smith was the doctor
[06:01:48] <Princesssluttershy> I'm gonna watch TNG ^-^
[06:01:50] <Princesssluttershy> I love that show
[06:02:00] <expatriate> I liked the first season of smith
[06:02:11] <Princesssluttershy> Me too
[06:02:15] <Princesssluttershy> tehn it got bad
[06:02:17] <expatriate> and I thought I liked the second, untill the last episode, and then I realized I didn't like the second
[06:02:22] <expatriate> lol
[06:02:26] <Princesssluttershy> also they took stargate off of netflix D:

[06:23:52] <thaostra> There's just no getting around the long commute into the city
[06:25:29] <expatriate> what city?
[06:26:32] <thaostra> Boston
[06:29:31] <thaostra> The subway system is reasonable, having a contactless card system that you use to pay about $2 once to get into the system and can go to any stop around the city until you leave the station. The commuter rail on the other hand, expect having a ride lasting more than an hour each way and paying almost $20 for a round trip
[06:30:27] <expatriate> oh damn
[06:30:45] <expatriate> in chicago it's like a $8 round trip from the farthest point
[06:31:16] <expatriate> the commuter rail, the subway is the same as what you described
[06:33:24] <thaostra> It's really insane how quickly the commuter rail adds up if you're a daily commuter. They should do something to lower the cost, considering that Boston is one of the leading cities in tech startups

[09:48:49] <Vulpixbew> that about describes it
[09:50:03] *** Quits: Cel (Cel@Silver.Horizon) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:52:19] <RNGsus> so technically gay people can be considered evolutionary failures?
[09:54:17] <plushie_pegasus> RNGsus   http://i.imgur.com/XUteJOY.jpg
[09:54:59] <RNGsus> did you have a celebration?
[09:55:36] <plushie_pegasus> Just lots of cuddling and yiffing :)
[09:56:21] <Vulpixbew> this pick axe is going so fast its lagging minecraft
[09:56:28] <RNGsus> WAY2FEST
[09:56:30] <cloppyhooves> I would say no, RNGsus :o
[09:56:35] <RNGsus> whys that cloppyhooves 
[09:57:21] <cloppyhooves> Being gay doesn't necessarily stop you from spreading genes
[09:57:43] <RNGsus> an evolutionary disability
[09:57:56] <cloppyhooves> Also, there's a hypothesis that queer people help raise their kin's offspring, which leads to an increased chance of indirectly passing on their genes
[09:58:29] <RNGsus> interesting
[09:58:51] <cloppyhooves> Also, there isn't really such a thing as an "evolutionary failure" per se
[09:59:47] <RNGsus> how is that
[09:59:48] <plushie_pegasus> Tired.. off to yiff horny plushies, goodnight everypony
[10:00:21] <cloppyhooves> An eolutionary success is just "surviving long enough to pass on your genes"
[10:00:47] <cloppyhooves> So something would only be a maladaptation if it prevented someone from passing on their genes in that environment at that time
[10:00:57] <RNGsus> such as being gay
[10:01:22] <cloppyhooves> If a gay guy gives his sperm to a surrogate, then he's passed on his genes :3
[10:02:06] <RNGsus> But there is more advantage to just not being gay in that respect
[10:02:16] <cloppyhooves> In a sense, yes
[10:02:25] <cloppyhooves> But that doesn't make being gay an evolutionary failure
[10:02:43] <cloppyhooves> (Which I still think is just a really loaded term)
[10:02:53] <RNGsus> A maladaptation as you said then?
[10:03:02] <cloppyhooves> It wouldn't be a maladaptation either :o
[10:03:17] <RNGsus> But it has a lower chance of passing on its genes
[10:03:26] <cloppyhooves> Lower chance, but not impossible
[10:03:29] <cloppyhooves> Impossible is the bar here
[10:03:40] <RNGsus> so its a negative trait
[10:03:54] <cloppyhooves> I'd still say no
[10:04:01] <RNGsus> and why would you say that
[10:04:26] <cloppyhooves> It's kinda binary here
[10:04:31] <cloppyhooves> Either you pass on your genes or you don't
[10:04:50] <cloppyhooves> If you have a lower chance but still do, then it's still not a maladaption
[10:05:05] <RNGsus> What would it be called then
[10:05:23] <cloppyhooves> Evolution-wise, nothing, really :o
[10:05:26] <cloppyhooves> Just a variation
[10:05:35] *** Quits: plushie_pegasus (IceChat77@Pony-j2kv31.ph.cox.net) (Quit: RL sex is good, Plushie sex is soo much better!)
[10:05:46] <RNGsus> Can you not classify variations as negative or positive?
[10:06:39] <cloppyhooves> You can also classify them as just neutral :o
[10:06:52] <RNGsus> so there is a negative and positive classification
[10:07:40] <cloppyhooves> Here's where I think the problem is, in my mind
[10:07:53] <cloppyhooves> Waaaaaay too often people try to classify being gay as a negative variation
[10:08:04] <cloppyhooves> Mostly to delegitamize

[20:41:15] <Connor> Hello 
[20:43:09] <Wolfie> Katiepony what to do in London
[20:43:18] <Katiepony> iunno
[20:43:23] <Katiepony> I've only been there like twice.
[20:43:50] <Wolfie> going there in a week
[20:43:52] <Katiepony> Don't buy anything, it's like one of the most fucking expensive places in the world.
[20:43:58] <Wolfie> dunno what to do
[20:44:07] <Wolfie> oh wow.. 
[20:44:11] <Katiepony> Make sure you get an english breakfast, though.
[20:44:30] <Katiepony> Try a sunday roast at a pub
[20:44:52] <Katiepony> Aside from all the touristy stuff, that is.
[20:44:53] <weisey> Wolfie: what to do in london
[20:45:04] <Wolfie> is that coffee? 
[20:45:07] <weisey> Get the heck out of London and go to the smaller places
[20:45:14] <Wolfie> aha
[20:45:17] <Katiepony> No, it's a meal o:
[20:45:30] <Katiepony> Take a 4 hour train journey to visit Katie.
[20:45:47] <Katiepony> For 200
[20:46:11] <Wolfie> going there for business
[20:46:19] <Wolfie> thinking of doing something in between 
[20:46:34] <Connor> I can't stop watching cutthroat kitchen 
[20:46:51] <Wolfie> maybe I can scratch 200 for a weekends visit to auntie Katie 
[20:47:16] <Katiepony> You should get some decent fish and chips
[20:47:47] <Katiepony> Maybe a Tikka Masala o:
[20:47:56] <Wolfie> ooh that sounds good actually
[20:48:16] <cloppyhooves> One time I tried getting an English breakfast
[20:48:24] <cloppyhooves> At the Harry Potter part of Universal Studios
[20:48:29] <cloppyhooves> Probably not the best introduction to it
[20:48:36] <Katiepony> Probably not
[20:48:39] <Katiepony> What did they have?
[20:49:27] <Wolfie> yay I'm going to WB studios for the Harry Potter thing
[20:52:01] * Wolfie wiggles
[20:52:20] <Wolfie> anakin's teen angst is a bit weird 
[20:52:30] <cloppyhooves> They had sausage, blood sausage, eggs, baked beans, and I don't remember what else
[20:52:38] <cloppyhooves> It was all low quality ingredients, though
[20:52:45] <cloppyhooves> Also, Wolfie, that's awesome! :D
[20:52:50] <Katiepony> I think american baked beans are pretty different to UK ones o:
[20:52:59] <Katiepony> You guys usually use some kinda bbq sauce in them.
[20:53:06] <cloppyhooves> Baked beans are too sweet for me >.>
[20:53:15] <Katiepony> Yeah, ours aren't sweet, really.
[20:53:44] <cloppyhooves> The butterbeer there is really good c:
[20:53:48] <Katiepony> Also, it's difficult enough to find decent black pudding here, so I doubt they'd have the decent stuff there.
[20:55:36] <Connor> What's butterbeer ? 
[20:56:02] <Wolfie> my friend went there and said the butterbeerr was suuuper sweet
[20:56:10] <Wolfie> like a vanilla pudding 
[20:56:17] <Wolfie> I'm apprehensive about it
[20:57:55] <Wolfie> still very excited to see the diagon alley dragon
[20:58:00] <Wolfie> and get a want
[20:58:04] <Wolfie> wand*
[20:58:17] <Wolfie> then I can poke you guys in the butts
[20:59:04] <Wolfie> and maybe accio your knickers to me
[20:59:33] <Cel> cheats
[20:59:43] <Wolfie> the movie pronunciations are weird 
[20:59:54] <Wolfie> Dan says accio like ackio
[21:00:12] <Wolfie> he probably says ackident aswell
[21:00:28] <Cel> he does... ackidentally
[21:00:30] <Wolfie> and Nike as NikE
