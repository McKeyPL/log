[04:19:35] <plushie_pegasus> weisey, how much is that Bugatti?
[04:20:47] <Princesssluttershy> a few mil I'd guess
[04:26:07] <plushie_pegasus> With 1,001 horsepower pumping from its W16 engine, it's also the world's most powerful production car. And with a price tag of about $1.5 million, it's the world's most expensive new car. For the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, everything is a superlative.
[04:26:37] <Princesssluttershy> I think those are the specs for the old one
[04:28:16] <plushie_pegasus> year:

[04:28:40] <Princesssluttershy> Why would they not up the HP from their old model?
[04:29:07] <plushie_pegasus> Ohh only 2.5 million , gee I will buy two LOL
[04:29:47] <Princesssluttershy> there are probably going to be people who will buy two or three
[04:30:04] <Princesssluttershy> hell they probably already have a couple on preorder
