[19:37:26] <PuppyGirl> You can do pacifist in that game?
[19:37:53] <cloppyhooves> Basically through all the levels you never use your sword so you never attack anything
[19:38:01] <cloppyhooves> You have to attack bosses 'cause there's no way around that
[19:38:11] <cloppyhooves> But every non-boss enemy you leave alone c:
[19:38:14] <PuppyGirl> Oh okay
[19:38:29] <cloppyhooves> It's not something the game officially recognizes
