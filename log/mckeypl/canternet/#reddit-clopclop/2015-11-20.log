[06:06:58] <RubyPinch> weisey: you need to make sure the server connection is utf8, and you need a capible font or backup font

[09:43:36] <Wolfy> Dem claws
[09:44:29] <Princesssluttershy> can I just say one thing
[09:44:36] <Princesssluttershy> I fucking hate cyclists
[09:45:58] <Princesssluttershy> They don't belong on the fucking road
[09:48:12] * Vulpixbrew coughs
[09:49:55] <Compu> oooh more redstone stuff just got added to minecraft PE
[09:50:58] <Compu> Princesssluttershy: well until ur ready to go out and buy us all brand news cars as well as pay for our licenses dont complain
[09:51:56] <Vulpixbrew> ^this
[09:52:21] * Vulpixbrew doesnt really have much of a choice bt to bike
[09:52:30] <Compu> same here
[09:54:38] <Wolfy> While I do agree, I think cyclists should move off the road if there isn't a cycling lane
[09:55:41] <Wolfy> I see too many cyclists here cycling on the road at sub 20kmh in a much faster zone
[09:56:53] <Princesssluttershy> Compu, then don't drive in the middle of the orad
[09:57:10] <Compu> Princesssluttershy: i dont, i stay on the shoulder
[09:57:21] <Princesssluttershy> then you're not the kind of cyclist I hate
[09:57:28] <Compu> usually i'll go on the dirt if i have to
[09:57:34] <Princesssluttershy> as long as you actually follow the rules
[10:00:56] <Princesssluttershy> also screw anyone who goes out after dark in dark clothes and goes on the road
[10:01:07] <Princesssluttershy> it's incredibly hard to see you

[11:55:44] <cloppyhoofs> Good night, you sexy ponies!
[11:56:17] <Vulpixbrew> I have a weapon that has a 33% chance to add 600 temp hp and stacks up to 15 times
[11:56:47] * Cel waves
[11:56:48] <Vulpixbrew> My shuttle on has 6000 hp
[11:57:04] <Vulpixbrew> with thatI get 150% temp hp point
[11:57:16] <Vulpixbrew> I nee to take this damned thing in pvp
[11:57:47] <Cel> :D
[11:58:37] <Cel> I did pvp only once, so I don't really know how that works
[11:59:57] <Cel> popped an escort the moment it decloaked with my science ship... took about 7seconds... so I have exactly 7seconds pvp experience^^
[12:02:01] <Vulpixbrew> the only pvp I really do is with friends and interfleet
[12:02:50] <Cel> pick someone with a cruiser and dismantle it with your shuttle... that should be fun
[12:04:11] <Cel> I flew a cruiser once... tricobalt torpedos and mines... phasers on subsystems only (weapons and shields off)... npc dreadnoughts were no problem... frigates however... damn
[12:04:57] <Cel> even borg cubes... I did the first 3 borg fleet ops solo
[12:05:48] <Cel> granted the first two were easy even with the other ship^^
[12:06:16] <Vulpixbrew> I have a Jem'Hadar Heavy Escort carrier, I love it
[12:07:50] <Cel> the only carrier i have is the atrox... but I don't use it
[12:14:44] <Cel> maybe I should install it and check whats going on... I should get another veteran badge just from logging in^^
[12:16:56] <Vulpixbrew> check the email attached to the account I know they ahve been sending out free ships for inative accounts and new ones
[12:26:07] <Cel> last email for free stuff was season 10^^
[12:26:18] <Vulpixbrew> fair enough
[12:26:24] <Vulpixbrew> new level cap is 60
[12:26:31] <Vulpixbrew> you can doff starships now
