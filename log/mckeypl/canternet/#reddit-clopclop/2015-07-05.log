[00:28:09] <RubyPinch> I wonder how hard it would be to write a irc bot in brainfuck
[00:28:19] <iamalion> prolly not TOO hard
[00:29:06] <iamalion> for being drupal though it actually isnt too bad. fairly easy to edit the code and such. I run it on 3 other networks and it is used on some other really big irc channels like the 3d printing one and etc

[09:20:46] <bad_roostah> do you guys know like
[09:20:52] <bad_roostah> Darren Shan, the horror author?
[09:21:00] <bad_roostah> I read him a lot, but I dunno, he is kinda cheezy
[09:21:02] <Amber> nope
[09:21:13] <bad_roostah> I mean for instance he wrote this new book, called "ZOM-B"
[09:21:28] <bad_roostah> and it's this pararell to racism and stuff
[09:21:34] <bad_roostah> there are those zombies, right
[09:21:48] <bad_roostah> and then one guy who is like racist and he is an abusive father and what not 
[09:22:06] <bad_roostah> and I think it's a bit obvious and cheap, but still ok for a book about zombies
[09:22:10] <bad_roostah> I kinda like it I guess
[09:22:17] <bad_roostah> how about King? :3 He good
[09:22:36] <bad_roostah> Kings actually a really good author
[09:22:52] <bad_roostah> I mean once you read like 10 books from him, he starts repeating himself
[09:23:06] <bad_roostah> like always there is this alcoholic guy who is somewhat nice
[09:23:35] <bad_roostah> some girl that will most likely have sex with him later on

[09:30:15] <bad_roostah> Four lifelong friends gather in the woods of western Maine for their annual hunting trip. When they were young, they were bound together forever by an act of bravery involving a fifth friend, whose influence has given these men special powers. Their trip is disrupted when a stranger, disoriented and delirious, wanders into camp, muttering about light in the s
