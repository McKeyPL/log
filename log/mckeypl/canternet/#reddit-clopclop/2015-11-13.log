[07:58:15] <Serene_Flow> Speaking of Amiibos. MewTwo comes out today.
[07:58:26] <princesssluttershy> Now I also really need to get a copy of Twilight Princess on the GameCube
[07:58:49] <princesssluttershy> The store I work at has a bunch of first generation amiibos
[08:00:10] <princesssluttershy> I feel like I should buy them
[08:00:26] <princesssluttershy> cuz I can sell them online for $10 more than we're sellingthem in the store
[08:01:32] <Wolfie> I think the platform alignment doesn't quite fit with the pillars
[08:03:28] <Wolfie> otherwise the models look sweet

[09:44:22] <cloppyhooves> Also those all three might be guys?
[09:45:08] <Serene_Flow> The one sitting is a girl. You can see her vag and showing the sperm getting to the womb.

[09:48:42] * Wolfy nuzzles cloppy consolingly
[09:49:12] <Wolfy> I think the white one is a guy because penis, the other two are Vagentlemen
[09:51:14] <Serene_Flow> Okay, looking at the tags and the source. Yeah, the white one is penis guy. The other 2 are vag guys.
[09:51:51] <cloppyhooves> I love the term vagentleman but I'd prolly not call a trans guy that unless he said he was okay with it :3
[09:52:37] <yiffbot> i don't like the  c term either although i do use the word itself often
[09:53:16] <Evelina> On the contrary, I'm fine with it because the opposite is used a TON.
[09:53:42] <yiffbot> i mean, it is the most used, doesn't mean i like it
[09:53:52] <cloppyhooves> I don't like the c term either D:
[09:53:54] <Evelina> Male genetalia is thrown around a LOT as language. So the idea of using the female genetalia as a word shouldn't be so hated
[09:54:01] <Evelina> I mean, look at australia.
[09:54:48] <cloppyhooves> I meant more referring to trans people by the genitalia they may not like more than the c word itself :o

[11:27:40] <Evelina> Wow
[11:27:49] <Wolfy> Then she gulps some mouthwash and gargles on your shaft
[11:28:03] <Wolfy> Well the shows been on for 5 years now
[11:29:22] <TheRedOne> it just doesn't intuitively seem like a vector for "attacks". like sure, we're a demographic, but...

[11:30:13] <Vulpixbrew> I cant make this crap up
[11:30:34] <TheRedOne> lol
[11:30:34] <Wolfy> As if regular spam mail works
[11:31:06] <TheRedOne> it's gotta catch someone, otherwise people would've given it up by now
[11:31:16] <Vulpixbrew> also to be fair it's the email box I use for craigslist and making accounts for crap for free ingame stuff and I dont want them spamming my normall email boxes

[11:31:56] <Wolfy> I refuse to believe there isn't anyone in this fandom gullible enough

[11:33:04] <TheRedOne> what I mean though. I wouldn't use fim as my selling point, because we do know that ponies (sadly) aren't real
[11:33:13] <Evelina> I'd like to make her moan.
[11:33:18] <TheRedOne> oh wow
[11:33:56] <Wolfy> There's still that one division that does however believe it
[11:34:21] <Wolfy> And a percentage of them is going to click that ad

[11:43:40] <Vulpixbrew> dant it I wanted to have fun with the old demo
[11:46:34] <Serene_Flow> Hey anyone remember the name of a person that came in here one time and was saying they were into fapping to clop with others?
[11:46:42] <Serene_Flow> I think it was in this channel.
[11:46:52] <Evelina> I don't remember...
[11:47:09] <Serene_Flow> Think it started with an S.
[11:47:37] <Wolfy> I remember that but I don't know what they were called
[11:49:27] <Serene_Flow> I remember they said they had a clop skype account. Wish I would of gotten it.
[11:54:27] <Vulpixbrew> I know who your talking about but cant remember their name
[11:54:47] <TheRedOne> I don'tthink I was around for them. check your log?
[11:55:02] <Serene_Flow> How does one check their log?
[11:55:17] <TheRedOne> your client probably keeps one, which one are you using
[11:55:45] * Serene_Flow shrugs.
[11:56:11] <Serene_Flow> I just use some site thing called kiwiirc/
[11:56:33] <TheRedOne> hmm
[11:57:06] <TheRedOne> ok no idea, google it. not sure how web clients handle logs.
[12:00:36] <Serene_Flow> How do you guys usually check it?
[12:01:26] <TheRedOne> I'm using hexchat, and that just dumps it in a txt in appdata
[12:02:24] <Evelina> I don't keep a log
[12:07:15] <TheRedOne> wolfy
[12:07:20] <TheRedOne> what client are you using?
[12:08:33] <Wolfy> On ios, colloqui and turboirc
[12:08:45] <TheRedOne> ko sec
[12:08:49] <Wolfy> On desktop, adium
[12:09:17] <TheRedOne> because if you were around for that bloke, you can look in your logs as well
[12:09:17] <Wolfy> Adium saves logs automatically and ios ones allows log saving
[12:09:32] <TheRedOne> which one were you on? alternatively check all of em
[12:09:38] <Wolfy> Turno
[12:09:41] <Wolfy> Turbo
[12:09:48] <Wolfy> Doesnt save outomaricallt
[12:09:53] <Wolfy> Automatocally
[12:10:09] <TheRedOne> who else was around then?
[12:10:18] <TheRedOne> c'mon, a bit detective work :D
[12:11:03] <RubyPinch> want me to check later?
[12:11:20] <TheRedOne> I think Serene_Flow would appreciate that
[12:12:36] <Serene_Flow> If you want to.
[12:12:57] <Serene_Flow> I'd be thankful, but not forcing anyone to do anything.
[12:19:47] <Vulpixbrew> ioima go lay down
[12:20:01] <Serene_Flow> Alright. Rest well.
[12:28:17] <Serene_Flow> And yeah, I can't seem to find anything about logs or history for Kiwi IRC.
[12:29:17] <Serene_Flow> I'm at least hoping they're not a one time show up person and visit somewhat often at least.

[12:31:27] <Serene_Flow> Oh. They talked about how they're in college net and they weren't able to use Omegle anymore.
[12:31:58] <TheRedOne> more keywords to search the log for, sounds good
[12:32:23] <Serene_Flow> Oh really? Awesome.
[12:33:33] <TheRedOne> well it's a text, and anything that's uníque to the cenversation makes it easier to find
[12:33:39] <TheRedOne> ideally, the nickname
[12:33:53] <Serene_Flow> Sweet.
[12:34:04] <Evelina> Hey
[12:34:08] <Evelina> Omegle is awesome
[12:34:33] <TheRedOne> I've only been on there like twice, and neither was very talkative
[12:34:33] <Serene_Flow> But yeah, the discussion started with they were somehow banned from Omegle cause of college shared net. And they missed it cause that's where they like to go and fap with others.
[12:36:26] <Evelina> OOh sexy
[12:36:41] <Evelina> I've fapped with people through text and a few times over the phone.
[12:36:49] <Evelina> I got close the other night with some random on skype.
[12:36:58] <Evelina> she's a yiff artist
[12:37:01] <TheRedOne> Do I need to "know" anything before using omegle? or rather, to have a valuable experience?
[12:37:28] <TheRedOne> I've only ever clopped while on mike in teamspeak
[12:37:28] <Serene_Flow> I guess depends on what you want to know.
[12:37:57] <Serene_Flow> I've only clop through text stuff like this and Skype text.
[12:37:58] <TheRedOne> I dunno, again, I've had two very short discussions of the kind "hi - hi - left"
[12:38:41] <Evelina> Not sure
[12:38:43] <Evelina> maybe fap
[12:38:57] <Evelina> as a tag
[12:39:15] <Serene_Flow> Yeah, use tags to narrow your search.
[12:40:06] <Serene_Flow> They also have an unmordeated video chat for all their adult stuff. It has most of the guy jerking off there.
[12:40:27] <TheRedOne> I don't have a camera...
[12:40:41] <Evelina> awehh
[12:40:52] <Serene_Flow> Then stick with text obviously and use tags.
[12:40:52] <Evelina> But fapping
[12:41:16] <Serene_Flow> Yeah. Fapping, fap, masturbate, jerk off. Stuff like that.
[12:43:20] <Evelina> Serene_Flow... I wouldn't mind snuggling you
