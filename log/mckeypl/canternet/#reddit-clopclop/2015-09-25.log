[01:09:51] <Katiepony> People talk about offtopic stuff :3
[01:09:55] <Katiepony> And link off topic porn.
[01:10:12] <Katiepony> And outrageously flirt with one another

[01:11:21] <RarityDarling> and I caught wind of this video, have any of you seen "My Little Porny"

[02:12:51] <RubyPinch> heat it betterr
[02:13:02] <weisey> Also flux saves lives
