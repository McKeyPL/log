[11:07:03] <Vulpixbrew> doesn't mean I won't gank them
[11:08:40] <Vulpixbrew> I still  love thatone duel I did 
[11:08:44] <Cel> I do gank people who always bother me for a duel... if they lose 3times in a row they're dead if I see them
[11:08:55] <Vulpixbrew> hunter friend of mine decides he has best dps ever
[11:09:48] <Vulpixbrew> challanged my shammy to a duel, he had 70k dps, i was in resto spec in raid gear, my hps was around 85k
[11:09:56] <Cel> :D
[11:10:01] <Vulpixbrew> yeah he couldn't touch me
[11:10:54] <Vulpixbrew> well he could but I just out healed the dps
[11:10:54] <Cel> I watched a duel... resto druid vs holy pala... it was 2006... how long did that take?
[11:11:33] <Cel> hint... I heard lay on hands go off 3 times
[11:11:59] <Vulpixbrew> he finally said screw it
[11:12:14] <Vulpixbrew> wait isn't that a 10 minute CD?
[11:12:33] <Cel> not in 2006
[11:13:36] <Vulpixbrew> I forget what it was bvack then
[11:13:37] <Katiepony> Back then it was a week long cooldown and dissallowed you to renew your subscription for the next month
[11:13:53] <Cel> that would be nice
[11:13:56] <Cel> but it was only 1h
[11:14:02] <Katiepony> But, at least it was balanaced
[11:14:10] <Katiepony> Because it removed all your mana, too
[11:15:00] <Cel> yea but there was this regeneration thingy... up to 50% in a couple of seconds
[11:15:51] <Cel> no one should duel a healer if he'S not absolutely sure he can beat it... it's just boring^^
[11:16:22] <Katiepony> Hour long duels outside of org
[11:16:44] <Cel> als warlock it'S easy vs healers who have to cast... but I'd never go against a druid
[11:16:45] <Katiepony> Nobody could kill me <:
[11:17:44] <Cel> :D
[11:19:21] <Cel> I have a resto druid myself... it's just not fair... you can't silence them... and even if... there are these 3 trees that just keep healing if used correctly... and the mushroom that keeps healing... and the hots... and yseras gift that heals just because the druid is alive
[11:21:08] <Vulpixbrew> I'm rasing a worgen resto
[11:21:13] <Cel> and then... if he should go a little low... instant heal for at least 50% hp every 3 minutes... and instant heal every 30sec for about 30%... you cast if you're bored
[11:21:20] <Vulpixbrew> just my alliance is on hold atm
[11:21:33] <Cel> hold the alliance!... uh... why?^^
[11:22:04] <Vulpixbrew> cause one I want to see the story from the alliance side 
[11:22:27] <Cel> sure but why is it on hold?
[11:22:34] <Vulpixbrew> I'm to busy gearing up a dk, pvping my fury and getting a bear tank to 100
[11:22:35] <Katiepony> Don't worry, Thrall is also 90% of the alliance story, too.
[11:22:50] <Cel> aah
[11:23:26] <Vulpixbrew> orc jesus in goldshire
[11:24:00] <Cel> one of my follower missions brought me a baleful upgrade... 695 weapon for free... I was going for the 700er weapon for pvp, but now I wont... not because of 5 ilvl
[11:24:47] <Vulpixbrew> I never gad a bafefukl wepon follower mission
[11:25:02] <Vulpixbrew> then again it took me forever just to get the damned slefie cam
[11:25:03] <Cel> not the weapon, just the upgrade
[11:25:15] <Vulpixbrew> ooo neat
[11:25:30] <Cel> right after the pet and the toy
[11:25:57] <Cel> then again I have 11 chances per day to get one of those rare missions^^
[11:26:07] <Vulpixbrew> my fury has one 695 bafleful and a 670 crafted
[11:26:16] <Vulpixbrew> Im replacing the 670 with the 700
[11:26:24] <Cel> ^^
[11:27:08] <Cel> my warlock recently got the pvp staff... that thing is a murderous bitch... granted I need a little bit of luck (or just stupid alliance) but then... 150kdps
[11:27:12] <Vulpixbrew> I just need the conquest which means horde needs to win everynow and then
[11:28:11] <Cel> cataclysm is the best spell ever invented... 80k dmg on everyone and 2 dots on everyone
[11:28:33] <Cel> shoot an empowered seed after it... 3rd dot game-set-match
[11:29:20] <Cel> combine that with one dk and one mage and everyone just dies without fail
[11:31:08] <Cel> people don't use cataclysm often, because it has a long cast time and you glow in a huge green storm... but I rarely get interrupted^^
[11:32:11] <Katiepony> Deathwing tries to use it all the time, but it's interrupted whenever you attack him.
[11:33:25] <Vulpixbrew> but deathwing's cast time was a whole expansion
[11:33:28] <Cel> deathwing is a newb
[11:40:29] <Vulpixbrew> lay onm hands die
