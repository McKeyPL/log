[00:57:13] <thaostra> Heh, I'm starting to feel like how girls feel about guys messaging them on dating sites, because I've been getting a lot of attention moments after I uploaded a selfie. I got a message that says "Hi I'm teddy". Not even an attempt at starting a conversation. Yeah I'll Pass
[00:57:53] <expatriate> I made a female account once to test the matching algorithm
[00:58:02] <expatriate> and I was disgusted by the messages I got
[00:58:34] <expatriate> it amazes me that any women at all can deal with it
[00:58:48] <thaostra> It feels nice that I get approached by others and not the way around, and I have the option to turn people down
[00:58:48] <Toxotis> Yeah i made one of those before 
[00:59:14] <Wolfie> okcupid
[00:59:33] <expatriate> the funny thing, though, was that I used a carefully cropped picture of myself from when I had really long hair and was wearing my friend's glasses
[00:59:47] <expatriate> so a bunch of straight dudes were telling me I was hot :D
[01:00:10] <Toxotis> Haha'
[01:01:38] <cloppyhooves> Soooooo true to the messages thing, expatriate :c
[01:03:47] <expatriate> like, one person somehow got offended by my profile I guess and called me* a bitch
[01:04:01] <expatriate> how fucking broken are you on the inside
[01:04:08] <expatriate> that you go around looking at dating profiles
[01:04:20] <expatriate> and messaging the ones you don't like, calling them a bitch?
