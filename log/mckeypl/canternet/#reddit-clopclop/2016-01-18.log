[00:05:00] * Wolfy shakes it
[00:05:11] * Wolfy pouts under the bad cat
[00:16:04] * Chiv crawls back, having endured hell and high water in running a repair shop by himself for an entire day.
[00:16:11] <Chiv> It is 5 degrees out
[00:16:26] <Chiv> there should be nobody out, and yet apparently everybody needed their stuff fixed today :|
[00:17:52] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[00:18:27] <Nigiri> It's  - 11 out 
[00:18:40] * Wolfy shows chiv his canine pepper that needs fixing
[00:19:05] * Chiv thinks of Corruption of Champions
[00:19:30] <Chiv> So, what's wrong with your pepper? Not booting up?
[00:26:51] <Chiv> Also Nigiri: either way it is WAY too cold for the number of customers we were getting
[00:28:07] <Wolfy> It's been stiff the entire day!
[00:28:14] <Wolfy> I dunno what to do!
[00:31:00] <Chiv> Hrm..
[00:31:19] * Chiv gently pokes it, trying to see if he can get it to unfreeze
[00:31:29] <Nigiri> Try hiding it in Chiv
[00:31:32] <Chiv> I think it needs a hard reset.
[00:33:05] * Wolfy whines as it remains rigid and throbs a little
[00:34:21] <Chiv> Someone's gonna need to reach in and rub the reset button for 30 seconds, should force the pepper to eject the faulty load state and reboot.
[00:34:55] <Chiv> Nigiri you have small paws, think you can get it?
[00:35:27] <Chiv> just gotta reach in the hole in back, should be pretty much right there on the side facing the pepper.
[00:36:11] * Wolfy looks back and forth between chiv and nigiri with a worried look
[00:36:56] * Chiv could always go grab a drumstick, apparently those are the cool new button pusher device
[00:39:34] * Wolfy nods, anything to get rid of this persistent thing
[00:41:18] * Chiv trots downstairs, grabs a drumstick, and returns. He puts a protective cover on the drumstick.
[00:41:33] <Chiv> Aaaand just lift the protective hole cover out of the way
[00:44:16] * Chiv waits for either the assistant or the device owner to move the tail out of the way.
[00:48:41] <Moka> Hayyyyyyyy ^^
[00:48:43] * Moka waves
[00:48:48] <Moka> Back in the hotel room for now ^^
[00:49:00] * Chiv waves back to the choco-coffee fox!
[00:49:01] <Moka> How;'re y'all doin' :3
[00:49:05] <Moka> Ooh ooh!
[00:49:08] <Moka> I got badge art :3
[00:49:14] <Chiv> Good, trying to help Wolfy troubleshoot his pepper

[00:51:02] * Chiv licks to confirm the tasty claim, though
[00:52:51] <Chiv> Yup true fact

[00:56:05] * Wolfy moves his tail out of the way, having gone down to wrap the pepper in a cold towel
[00:56:37] * Chiv inserts the reset stick, and starts prodding around for the button. He knows it's in there somewhere, hell that guy on reddit was going nuts about it.
[00:57:34] * Wolfy suddenly howls out and releases the faulty discharge all over chiv, collapsing backwards
[00:57:47] <Chiv> ...Well, good, that worked better than expected!
[00:58:08] * Chiv grabsa nearby fox and wipes himself dry
[00:58:46] * Wolfy slowly goes limp and woohoo's tiredly
[00:59:31] * Chiv pats Wolfy's belly comfortingly.
[00:59:41] <Chiv> Try not to force stop the program next time, nasty stuff happens :p
[01:00:23] <Wolfy> I'll keep it.. in mind..
