[14:00:31] <Wolfy> good day! 
[14:00:39] * Cel waves
[14:01:42] <Wolfy> company presentations are fun 
[14:01:55] <Wolfy> lots of freebies
[14:02:03] <Cel> swag
[14:02:14] <Wolfy> yeah
[14:02:24] <Wolfy> well at least sodas and breakfast and candy
[14:02:41] <Wolfy> to compensate for 4 hours of boring presentations
[14:02:46] <Cel> :D
[14:02:48] <Wolfy> well at least half was boring
[14:02:55] <Wolfy> the other was quite interesting
[14:03:57] <Cel> I once had to do a presentation for my company... holy shit, people who do this for fun need a mistress... really
[14:04:21] <Wolfy> I need a mistress
[14:04:37] <Cel> me too, but that's not the point xD
[14:04:45] <Wolfy> two guys were really insecure and it was kinda painful to watch
[14:04:59] <Cel> oh no^^
[14:05:10] <Wolfy> others were confident and fun to watch 
[14:05:23] <Wolfy> I noticed the fun ones let us demo their products
[14:05:46] <Wolfy> so if you're doing a presentation, let the audience interact 
[14:06:04] <Wolfy> one guy was demoing some German tools
[14:06:15] <Wolfy> let us try them out and handle them 
[14:06:32] <Cel> peoples heads would have fallen of if we let our customers use our products^^ but essentially, hands-on is always better
[14:06:57] <Wolfy> other guy was demoing like switches (also German) and made it look fun
[14:07:36] <Cel> those people sell stuff
[14:08:29] <Wolfy> then there was a guy showcasing like pressure gauges and temperature meters and was kinda shy 
[14:09:08] <Wolfy> does cel sell cells? 
[14:10:42] * Cel cells celf-propelled celery
[14:11:27] <Cel> it doesn't sell well... I think I have to close my shop
[14:11:41] * Vulpixbrew selols shrimp
[14:11:55] <Wolfy> that's when you become a sellout! 
[14:12:03] <Cel> i want to
[14:14:20] * Wolfy 's business is in the ruff
[14:14:41] <Cel> I'd advertise matches in front of a burning forest if someone would pay me^^ no morals here
[14:16:13] <Cel> it's dog business... ruff ruff
[14:16:26] <Wolfy> gotta start the presentation by having a guy demo a bomb where it accidentally goes off, killing the guy
[14:16:52] <Wolfy> then you come on and demo your new bomb fail safe mechanism
[14:16:59] <Cel> "see it works just fine... let me wipe this of the projector and let's continue"
[14:17:06] <Cel> or that
[14:17:41] <Vulpixbrew> brb 10 minutes
[14:17:46] <Wolfy> "yeah Dave you start the presentation. no go on its perfectly safe" 
[14:18:20] <Cel> "checked everything. of course the failsafe is on the second bomb. it's a different product, moron! now get on stage!"
[14:19:34] <Wolfy> "it's business, Dave! Gosh!" 
[14:19:43] <Wolfy> also it's the 19th today
[14:19:52] <Cel> uhh?
[14:20:03] <Wolfy> "I must be on hoth because I'm suffering from HYPE-OTHERMIA"

[14:20:48] <Cel> oh... ok
[14:20:56] <Cel> I don't like trailer... they tend to lie to me^^
[14:20:57] <Wolfy> also premiere tickets are going on sale right about now

[14:31:48] <Cel> the lightsaber construction kit is funny... so many stupid possibilities^^
[14:33:40] <Wolfy> maybe we could construct a sabre that instead of keeping the laser stationary, it fires it really fast at the opponent
[14:36:09] <Cel> hmm

[19:46:46] <Katiepony> And I want one of them
[19:47:22] <Katiepony> But husbandhorse is allergic to cats.
[19:49:07] <Wolfy> keep it secretly
[19:49:58] <Katiepony> Yeah, but then I'd have to keep it locked in one room
[19:50:00] <Katiepony> Or something
[19:50:07] <Katiepony> And that is a sad cat existance :<
[19:50:14] <Katiepony> existence* 
[19:50:21] <Cel> therapise him!
[19:50:27] <Katiepony> Unless that one room has a bed, litter box and food
[19:50:39] <Connor> Keep him locked up in one room and let the cat roam free 
[19:50:39] <Katiepony> Then the cat probably wouldn't notice the difference.
[19:50:46] <Katiepony> Hmmmm
[19:50:50] <Katiepony> It is tempting
[19:50:50] <cloppyhooves> Get him to adopt a new immune system too :3
[19:50:56] <Cel> heh
[19:51:02] <Katiepony> But I'd cuddle the cat all day and then we couldn't spend time together
[19:51:20] <Katiepony> because he'd be allergic to my fluff covered clothes.
[19:52:16] <Connor> Cuddle him in the nude
[19:52:19] <Wolfy> if the husband snuffs it you can become a crazy cat and bunny lady
[19:52:26] <Connor> Or the cat in the nude
