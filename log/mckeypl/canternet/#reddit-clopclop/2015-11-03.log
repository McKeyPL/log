[00:26:06] <Princesssluttershy> oh also weisey I don't remember if I told you already but I got my steam account and CSGO items back
[00:26:19] <weisey> Nice!!!
[00:26:25] <Princesssluttershy> Yup
[00:26:28] <weisey> Thats great to hear!
[00:26:37] <weisey> now go enable 2FA so it doesnt happen again ;)
[00:26:54] <Princesssluttershy> dude I already had steam guard enabled
[00:27:16] <Princesssluttershy> and it was supposed to send me an email and a text if someone tried to get into my account but it didn't
[00:27:35] <Princesssluttershy> and it always did that when I tried to log in on a browser on my own PC
[00:29:32] <weisey> there are some files that get stored in the steam directory that helps determine if its a new computer or not, so that you dont get 7day market banned every time you log in
[00:29:50] <weisey> they stole that,
[00:30:05] <weisey> means they wouldnt need to do steamguard 
[00:30:24] <weisey> cause steam saw those files and went "okay yeah they've logged in here recently before"
[00:30:39] <Princesssluttershy> oh
[00:40:06] <Compu> im seriously getting tired of assholes in gta online, i join a mission and the first thing one of the players does it put sticky bombs on everyone elses personal vehicles
