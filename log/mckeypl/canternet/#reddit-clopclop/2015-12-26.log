[02:55:33] <Vulpixbrew> also, how can scrubs go from rolling on the floor laughing to you will cry now so fast
[02:57:03] <diny> probably the same way that porn can make me go from wanting to hump walls to making tax forms look appealing
[02:58:01] <diny> (they were both figurative metaphors) 
[03:24:19] <Chiv> suuure they were
[03:25:22] <diny> mer, I have a fleshlight or something mounted to the wall I find other things more appealing
[03:25:55] <diny> unless I have a fleshlight
[03:27:17] <diny> an yeah, it would have to be pretty bad porn for me to want to just completely stop and fill out paper work
[03:27:20] <y007ghg7> gah, making a yarn tail takes forever
[03:27:33] <y007ghg7> and there are little bits of yarn everywhere
[03:27:48] <diny> why are you making it out of yarn?
[03:28:03] <y007ghg7> because they are really soft
[03:28:51] <diny> oh, I was thinking jute twine, which is like sandpaper
[03:29:39] <diny> how will it be attached to the recipient? 
[03:29:39] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> lol
[03:29:53] <y007ghg7> most likely velcro or elastic
[03:30:20] <y007ghg7> it is 100% acrylic yarn
[03:30:31] <y007ghg7> caron simply soft brand
