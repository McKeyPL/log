[09:40:43] <plushie_pegasus> Because Wolfy said eww smoking
[09:40:54] <Evelina> Yea, ew smoking
[09:40:57] <Wolfy> ...
[09:40:58] <Evelina> It's not attractive
[09:41:03] <Wolfy> because it's eww
[09:41:14] <Evelina> So, someone voiced a dislike of something so you post it more?
[09:41:38] <plushie_pegasus> Rarity makes it look attractive 
[09:42:45] <RNGsus> Nah, smoking is still eww
[09:43:09] <RNGsus> If you said "eww gay porn" I wouldnt start posting lots of braeburned 0.0
[09:43:12] <Wolfy> yeah lung cancer ain't attractive
[09:43:23] <plushie_pegasus> Haters gonna hate

[09:51:25] <plushie_pegasus> Hey, I don't say eww alcohol when other ponies talk about being drunk
[09:52:42] <Evelina> There are many reasons for that. But the main point is don't be that person who posts stuff just because someone voiced they didn't like it
[09:52:42] <RNGsus> You don't like alcohol?
