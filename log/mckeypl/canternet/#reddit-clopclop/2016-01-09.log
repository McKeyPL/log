[02:19:31] <cloppyhooves> I don't want to see what Twitch chat looks like right now
[02:21:14] <iamalion> why would anyone care?

[02:21:34] <cloppyhooves> Link to what?
[02:21:40] <Vulpixbrew> https://weninroam.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_0434.jpg
[02:21:45] <cloppyhooves> http://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick/
[02:23:50] <iamalion> looks like normal twitch chat to me with the occasional furfag
[02:24:02] <iamalion> not too bad actually
[02:24:07] <iamalion> most people seem to be being responsible
[02:24:09] <Nigiri> Of course no one has slept in the last 12 hours... It's 830pm
[02:25:03] <weisey> iamalion: you haven't seen the chat when sagev3 is doing a run 
[02:25:33] <iamalion> no i dont watch it
[02:26:02] <weisey> So if hitler had cancer, and that cancer had its own cancer 
[02:26:26] <weisey> The chat during those runs would still be more cancerous than Nazi cancer cancer
[02:27:04] <cloppyhooves> Basically if there's a trans person on stream also don't look at twtich
[02:28:21] <weisey> Yep 
[02:28:58] <iamalion> meh its just standard internet troll
[02:29:02] <iamalion> no big deal
[02:29:19] <weisey> No it goes further than that
[02:29:45] <weisey> I'm suprised GDQ allows twitch chat 
[02:29:54] <weisey> It honestly really hurts their image 
[02:30:24] <iamalion> how?
[02:31:06] <weisey> The amount of cancer in the chat is insane
[02:31:12] <weisey> Way more than usual twitch 
[02:31:34] <weisey> Especially when the runner isn't a white guy 
[02:31:44] <iamalion> because its a big event
[02:31:45] <iamalion> ¯\(°_o)/¯
[02:31:56] <weisey> Or trihex, trihex gets a pass on the racism somehow
[02:32:14] <weisey> Yeah, that's my point
[02:32:42] <weisey> It's a big event with big sponsors/charities

[02:43:09] <weisey> It's one of the most appropriate places

[02:43:43] <RNGsus> Possibly
[02:43:59] <weisey> It wouldnt be very visible during a run
