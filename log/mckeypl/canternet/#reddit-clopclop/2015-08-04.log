[11:08:02] <RNGsus> the movie is called closer im pretty sure
[11:08:03] <Serene_Flow> Ithink the movie is called Closer.
[11:08:10] <Compu> RNGsus: i came
[11:08:18] <RNGsus> Nice, so did I
[11:08:23] <Compu> hehe
[11:08:33] <Serene_Flow> Hot~.
[11:08:36] <RNGsus> :3
[11:08:47] <Compu> so much squirt ^_^
[11:08:58] <Serene_Flow> I'm still stroking a bit.
[11:09:15] <Plums> ;-;
[11:10:40] <Compu> Plums: gotta learn some moderation, once or twice a day is usually best
[11:11:01] <Plums> I know
[11:11:10] <Plums> I should stick to once or twice
[11:11:30] <Serene_Flow> That's what I do. Usually once a night.
[11:13:17] <Plums> Also, I also find porn videos less interesting than art or fiction
[11:13:33] <Plums> But that's more just me being an imaginative person
[11:15:01] <Serene_Flow> I've gotten that way too with real porn. It's lame, fake, and annoying. That why I usually just watch hentai if I want a porn video to watch.
[11:15:57] <Plums> Also, anyone know if there is some voice acting work i can try applying for?
[11:16:11] <Plums> Also i agree Serene_flow

[11:16:24] <Plums> No
