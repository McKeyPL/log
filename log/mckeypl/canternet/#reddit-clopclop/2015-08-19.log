[11:39:40] <AmberTT> the #1 thing I hate about flying insects is when they buzz by your ear
[11:39:47] <GentleYam> I have a fear
[11:39:55] <GentleYam> That they will fly into my ear
[11:39:59] <GentleYam> And it's not unheard of
[11:40:01] <AmberTT> RIGHT?
[11:40:39] <AmberTT> Though for me buzzing insects are always either Flies, Bees, or Wasps rather than Mosquitos
[11:41:08] <GentleYam> gnats
[11:41:25] <AmberTT> I dont really think I can hear gnats o.o
[11:41:32] <GentleYam> lol idk
