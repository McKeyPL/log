[01:08:57] <Katiepony> The best I have is druid at 200 wins, but I haven't played druid in months...
[01:09:08] <Psi> still nice!
[01:09:12] <Katiepony> I enjoy my priest control deck, but it's just too slow to be viable at the moment.
[01:09:14] <Psi> i've had this since week 2 of beta lol
[01:09:30] <Psi> yea priest control was fun back when mind control was 8 mana...
[01:10:54] <Katiepony> Gonna go and check on my food, brb
[01:12:37] <divination> its a shame, I really want to get into Hearthstone but it's too much like playing Magic the Gathering all over again for me, I just can't get into it.
[01:13:16] <Squirrelly> I'm playing SenX hunter for ranked
[01:13:23] <Squirrelly> But Magic the Gathering is so much fun!
[01:13:26] <divination> I play it on my tablet on and off but just... I get so fatigued :/
[01:13:35] <Katiepony> SenX hunter was my favorite deck ever, a few months ago
[01:13:36] <Psi> yea i quit mtg and used that money to get into other things lol
[01:13:37] <divination> Yeah I played magic for about 3 years
[01:13:42] <Katiepony> Before face hunter came in and replaced it.
[01:14:02] <divination> until my gaming group got into infinity combos, and overplaying the same things over and over and over, then it just wasn't much fun
[01:14:10] <Katiepony> Replaced it in the meta, I mean. Not replaced it as my favorite >.>
[01:14:15] <divination> then went mardy because I protested about him using a banned card.
[01:14:36] <divination> so, you know... that went south pretty quickly :P
[01:15:42] <Melon_Phone> I'm running about hitting people with a hammer
[01:16:39] <Squirrelly> I dunno, I'm okay with infinite combos
[01:16:42] <Katiepony> Back with food :3
[01:16:50] <Squirrelly> The decks I play are specifically designed to fuck with combo players :D
[01:17:03] <divination> yeah but when banned cards are being used (which are banned for a reason) then it just isn't fun for anyone.
[01:17:09] <Psi> i was a straight fnm person =P 
[01:17:10] <divination> I know we only played casually, but still
[01:17:11] <Squirrelly> Like which cards?
[01:17:19] <divination> I cant even remember, it was a while back
[01:17:24] <Squirrelly> What format?
[01:17:35] <divination> we diudn't really stick to a format, we just played casually
[01:17:37] <Katiepony> I wish I could play HS with you guys, but EU and US servers :<

[05:46:56] <Squirrelly> Hey
[05:47:11] <Squirrelly> So, for homework, I have to write a movie concept
[05:47:20] <Squirrelly> Mind if I post it here? It's not that long
[05:49:12] <cloppyhooves> Go for it c:
[05:49:13] <samonuh> Sure
[05:49:42] <Squirrelly> Aliens are going to invade in 100-200 years, and we are informed of this. The only way we will be prepared in time is if we begin preparing for it right now. However, there is still a large portion of the population of Earth that isn't sure they're okay with working hard for the rest of their lives just so that their children or their childrens' children will
[05:49:51] <Squirrelly> be POSSIBLY safe. The movie follows the President of the United States as he is informed of this information, and then tries to inspire the country as well as the rest of the world to work selflessly for the future of the human race.
[05:50:49] <Flame> Not a bad premise, as it touches the "impending doom: go wild or work hard" impasse
[05:51:07] <samonuh> I can see it acting as a metaphor for global warming
[05:51:10] <samonuh> lol
[05:51:10] <Squirrelly> Yeah
[05:51:15] <Squirrelly> I kinda meant it to be like that
[05:51:33] <Squirrelly> Like, a lot of people will want to just go about life as normal, scared of change
[05:51:43] <samonuh> But I wouldn't have it follow the President trying to convince everybody. Seems kind of...corny? 
[05:51:45] <Squirrelly> Some people will be like "Fuck it, no point in having kids ever."
[05:51:48] <Flame> Possibly take a few "scientific accuracy" steps, like "we see their ships" or something lol. Not actual ships, but perhaps intercept radio signals that indicate strongly intelligence?
[05:52:06] <Squirrelly> I figured I'd do something with a deep space probe

[05:55:23] <thaostra> Squirrelly, What are the aliens' motivation for invading?
[05:55:48] <Squirrelly> Hmmmmm
[05:55:49] <Squirrelly> Not sure
[05:56:02] <Squirrelly> I was thinking either resources or slave labor or just bloodlust
[05:57:11] <Vulpixbrew> We should do the Murica thing and invade them first

[05:58:14] <Vulpixbrew> NINI EVERYONE
[05:58:14] <Squirrelly> Ooooohhhh and maybe for the proof, maybe I should have it be an alien scout vessel landing on Earth and the scout being captured and interrogated, and the interview being accidentally leaked online
[05:59:11] <Vulpixbrew> better then the standard clutch of other alien fil uses of rosewell and the crash landing
[05:59:15] *** Quits: Vulpixbrew (HoneyBrew@Pony-68js8b.res.rr.com) (Connection closed)
[05:59:56] <thaostra> Any type 1 civilization would likely have the technology to harvest all of the energy of neighboring planets, and there are plenty of those among the observable universe. As for slavery, it's easy to see the trend toward automation and robotics in our own society to see that a civilization advanced enough to travel many light years would probably have no need for fragile primates
[06:00:21] <Squirrelly> Hmmmm
[06:00:27] <Squirrelly> Then what would be a good motivation?
[06:00:31] <Squirrelly> Bloodlust?
[06:00:37] <samonuh> How would it end? A flash-forward 100 years in the future?
[06:00:48] <Squirrelly> They found life and want to destroy it?
[06:00:48] <samonuh> Or just open ended?
[06:00:50] <thaostra> If anything, we'd be more like ants to them and we'd be met with ambivalence more than anything
[06:00:58] <Squirrelly> Maybe just go Halo-like and make it a religious thing?
[06:01:14] <thaostra> That is, assuming the civilization has seen enough life across the universe that it becomes pedestrian to them
[06:01:20] <Squirrelly> Hmmmm
[06:01:20] <Squirrelly> OH!
[06:01:23] <Squirrelly> I've got it
[06:01:37] <Squirrelly> It's set in the not-too-distant future, when we make our first deep-space vessel
[06:02:20] <thaostra> Yeah?
[06:02:32] <Squirrelly> And that vessel is captured, and we manage to see the video of them being killed/whatever
[06:03:11] <Squirrelly> And we have the technology for rudimentary space fighters, but nothing that could transport even a small fraction of the Earth's population, due to the limits of our technology
[06:03:48] <samonuh> This needs to be a movie concept? That's simple. Just make a sob-story biopic
[06:03:54] <samonuh> Academy Award winning stuff
[06:03:57] <Squirrelly> Ew no
[06:03:59] <Squirrelly> Boring

[06:04:18] <samonuh> Write one about Joseph Stalin
[06:04:43] <Squirrelly> rofl
[06:05:03] <thaostra> It'd make for a good sci-fi action flick, but I don't know if it'd be a good premise for examining the human experience and its place in a strange universe
[06:05:22] <Squirrelly> Hmmmmm
[06:05:46] <thaostra> Perhaps you're looking too far into outer space? Have you looked into inner space? :)
[06:06:13] <Squirrelly> Would that allow for the same kind of time-frame?

[06:07:47] <Katiepony> Depends on the speed o:
[06:08:03] <samonuh> I don't think this movie should have too much concrete examples of solutions being made, like technological advances and stuff. It should take place nowadays and be largely open-ended. 
[06:08:23] <Squirrelly> Well yeah that's the point
[06:08:44] <Squirrelly> If I go with something in our solar system, then modern-day becomes much easier to do
[06:08:47] <thaostra> A theory for why the universe is so devoid of life is that since it's so vast that no one can possibly comprehend it, that civilizations don't bother trying to inhabit outer space and instead transcend into another dimension. It'd be interesting to have a scenario where humanity is on the cusp of ascension where we look inward to discover what it is that makes us human before letting go of our biological origin

[06:18:43] <cloppyhooves> Yes? c:
[06:18:49] <thaostra> Some of the people at the beginning of the movie were downright idiotic, like saying that the world needed more farmers rather than engineers even though engineers are exactly the kind of people you need for finding solutions to your blights

[06:20:38] <thaostra> I guess a lot of people can't eat without farmers, like the people who design and manufacturer the farming equipment
[06:20:57] <samonuh> It's a symbiotic relationship
[06:21:15] <samonuh> It's not idiotic to say that we could use more farmers though
[06:21:28] <samonuh> We could use more of most professions really
[06:22:03] <Squirrelly> Honestly we could use more farmers if we find a way to terraform the deserts of the world into more fertile areas
[06:22:14] <thaostra> No, it's idiotic that they prioritize farmers over engineers even when people show an aptitude for engineering

[06:22:48] <samonuh> Why is it idiotic?
[06:25:56] <thaostra> Because engineers the people who think of ways to solve a problem, usually with more efficiency than what was done before. Hell, the fact that they still resort to horizontal farming techniques with crops being exposed to open air years in the future suggests that they must've flat out ignored any advancements that are possible *today* and created their own problems
[06:26:26] <samonuh> Okay
[06:26:57] <thaostra> Essentially, trying to make everyone farmers is shortsighted and a poor use of resources
[06:33:54] <Princesssluttershy> thaostra, it worked in the middle ages
