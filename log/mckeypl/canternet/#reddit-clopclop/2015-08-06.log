[21:18:12] <Cel> I played ff14 on launch... stopped after 7hours... never went back
[21:18:23] <Vulpixbrew> The beta was amusing enough
[21:20:00] <Vulpixbrew> I like the old republc but every thing is paywalled now, Star Trek Online made the grind horrible
[21:20:10] <Cel> hehe... I try not to do betas or PTR content... they change stuff and I miss it^^
[21:20:59] <Cel> swtor was great for the story... it's awesome to be an inquisitor and just kill people randomly all through the storyline
[21:21:26] <Vulpixbrew> I found it amusing you could make fat toons
[21:21:43] <Vulpixbrew> my bounty hunter.....
[21:22:35] <Cel> my sto crew was all female... this captain doesn't fly without his short skirted harem^^
[21:24:05] <Vulpixbrew> when they went 60 level cap it killed the game
[21:24:32] <Cel> yea... I'm still just 51^^
[21:24:44] <Vulpixbrew> Im serious when I say I could log on for 2 hours and feel like I did something, rather it was level get dil or runs STFs

[21:37:05] <Vulpixbrew> sto academny comes back as a dns error
[21:37:22] * Cel tilts
[21:37:35] <Vulpixbrew> I was gonna link my ship
[21:38:12] <Vulpixbrew> ooo hey http://www.stoacademy.com/tools/skillplanner/?build=ssvagincourt_7712
[21:42:04] <Cel> this looks more like a ship, yes^^
[21:43:51] <Vulpixbrew> the name refers to the Normandys sister ship from Mass Effect
[21:50:45] <Cel> I wanted to play me3 again for the new ending... nah, it had its chance
[21:51:56] <Vulpixbrew> Im working on an insanity play through
[21:53:37] <Cel> the only really important question is... which one did you bang (first)?
[21:54:19] <Vulpixbrew> liara
[21:55:45] <Vulpixbrew> I left a girl on virmire shes ash
[21:56:27] <Cel> I don't even remember that
[21:56:31] <Vulpixbrew> also thabnk thrall fo fiegn death
[21:56:36] <Vulpixbrew> me1

[22:04:31] <Vulpixbrew> good luck with that
[22:04:40] <Vulpixbrew> also that tank was an idiot
[22:04:56] <Cel> the one that's worse than a pet?
[22:04:58] <Vulpixbrew> onlyreason we survived half the dungoen was my pet had growlon
[22:05:25] <Vulpixbrew> Im shocked he wasnt rocking cloth
[22:05:40] <Cel> yea... i love those guys... main reason why I never turn growl off... good tanks ignore that... bad thanks fail anyways
[22:09:20] <Vulpixbrew> I might ask kindly for growl to be turned off, then again I have half an idea what Im doing
[22:10:49] <Cel> just include it in your rotation... on bosses it'S stupid to have growl on, except the tank is a complete dud... but on thrash its like afk mode
[22:11:24] <Cel> I mean, I only know tanking as a warrior but I like having one less target
[22:11:46] <Vulpixbrew> scarelt monk dude, tank pulled him and the thhree adds the only reason we didnt wipe was cause my pet caught boss aggro 
[22:12:07] <Cel> hah... well^^
[22:12:14] <Cel> me pet is a nice off healer^^
[22:12:40] <Cel> doesn't heal much, but over a longer fight it's not bad
[22:13:49] <Vulpixbrew> 33 so basic starter pet
[22:14:04] <Vulpixbrew> I want to get that spirit cat that pvpgurl has
[22:14:38] <Cel> I have the spirit crab... the only tank I ever need^^
[22:19:53] <Cel> look at that... the ghosts are on vacation... horde is manned with things you wouldn't use as cannonfodder if you'd be paid for it
[22:20:09] <Vulpixbrew> fun
[22:20:14] <Vulpixbrew> why I barely pvp
[22:21:33] <Cel> yea but there I still get something even if we don't win... in dungeons I'd just leave and get nothing^^
[22:22:16] <Cel> guess what class everyone is who doesn't shut up and still says nothing of worth
[22:22:16] <Vulpixbrew> that only reason fror me is honor mounts
[22:22:32] <Vulpixbrew> mage?
[22:22:39] <Cel> hunter
[22:23:31] <Vulpixbrew> speaking of hunters melee weapons again
[22:23:34] <Cel> I'm doing it for 700 gear
[22:24:10] <Cel> melee hunter is best hunter... petless melee hunter is mlg 360 fullbloat
[22:24:12] <Cel> wait
[22:25:50] <Vulpixbrew> hell bring back the staffs
[22:26:02] <Cel> great... a rogue is the only one reasonable in ashran... rogues are supposed to be too narcissistic to care about everyone but them
[22:26:14] <Vulpixbrew> rogue wants to win
[22:26:58] <Cel> everyone wants to win... but everyone rather runs around looking for the artefact that still has ~5min respawn timer
[22:28:00] <Cel> I want my old pvp group back... granted it would be kinda unfair... almost everyone is grand marshal... but still
[22:32:45] <Vulpixbrew> wvwery one sucsks at pvp
[22:33:37] <Cel> and it's not even that hard
[22:34:03] <Cel> well, not standing in the fire is quite difficult so maybe we should close pvp
[22:36:28] <Cel> I hope they make a couple of solo scenarios for the artefact weapons... people cried so much because of the warlock green fire thing... it's not that hard, you just have to pay a little bit of attention
[22:36:54] <Cel> it's a joke compared to the hunter quest in vanilla
[22:38:59] <Vulpixbrew> gods what is with tanks today
[22:39:21] <Vulpixbrew> pulling to much not payiong attentionj to where aggro is
[22:39:34] <Vulpixbrew> I just saw heals tank more
[22:39:43] <Cel> what's with everyone today... it's like everyone is playing a class they never played before
[22:48:26] <Vulpixbrew> between me and my pet questing is easy mood right now
[22:49:36] <Cel> ^^
