[02:59:38] <weisey> Well, who could have ever predicted this?
[02:59:38] <weisey> As soon as it was announced that EA was again nominated for Consumerist’s Worst Company in America bracket, it was almost certain they’d win just like they did last year.
[02:59:38] <weisey> And they have won, yet again. This time they beat out Bank of America BAC +0.00% for the crown, while Ticketmaster and Comcast CMCSA -0.44% rounded out the final four.

[15:40:01] <Vulpixbrew> rather take the 15 a month and really buy the beer
[15:41:47] <Cel> I thought you're not paying anymore
[15:43:01] <Vulpixbrew> Im tempted
[15:43:15] <Vulpixbrew> this almost 30k a month farming has gotten annoying

[19:10:39] <RubyPinch> one as a sort of in-between for request threads (so "submit a request" will land on a wikipage instead of just being a submit buttan), and maybe a list of other clopsubs

[21:05:51] <Connor> What's a multisub
[21:06:19] <thaostra> https://www.reddit.com/user/thaostra_/m/clop/new <- Like this
[21:07:00] <RubyPinch> I'll probs have a link to a multisub, but I like organisation
[21:07:55] <RubyPinch> https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/wiki/list-sorted-by-subscribers e.g.
[21:08:40] <thaostra> (shameless self-promotion) I recommend my multisub if you're going to link one, as it's basically the one the clop Reddit community has agreed to link in their own subs and has requested I add their subs, as suggested in the sidebar
[21:10:46] <RubyPinch> depends if we decide to go comprehensive or just like, cherrypicked
[21:11:21] <thaostra> I went with comprehensive, just as a way to unify all subs into one page
