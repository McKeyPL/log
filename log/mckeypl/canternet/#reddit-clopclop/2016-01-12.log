[00:07:32] <Vulpixbrew> So i just found a Mass Effect 2 easter egg that i can't seem to get it to happen again

[00:25:49] <Vulpixbrew> I'm sure
[00:26:01] <Vulpixbrew> unless the Hammerhead VI has a glitch
[00:31:00] <diny> what ever that is it sounds dramatic

[19:59:50] <Vulpixbrew> I repeatfilm for a kids camera in the year 2016
[20:01:12] <Chiv> I mean, it does still exist...
[20:01:33] <Wolfy> Yeah
[20:01:43] <Wolfy> Also 2-2-2-2-2016
[20:02:33] <Vulpixbrew> Chiv for children?
[20:03:40] <Chiv> I don't know what would happen if i were given to a child. They'd probably just get fed a lot of apples or something.
[20:04:13] <Wolfy> Wait hang on
[20:04:22] <Wolfy> Does it use film?
[20:06:43] <Vulpixbrew> yes Wolfy 35 mm take it to be developed film
[20:07:33] <Wolfy> And it's a frozen branded camera
[20:08:15] <Wolfy> Do they even sell film for those any more?
[20:08:20] <Chiv> Frozen in time, apparently
[20:09:37] <Vulpixbrew> amazon has the film 
[20:09:55] <Wolfy> Ayyy
[20:09:59] <Wolfy> Ah that's good
[20:10:16] <Wolfy> You'd think sd cards were easier to implement and manufacture
[20:10:28] <Vulpixbrew> about 3 to 4 dollars a roll
[20:11:09] <Vulpixbrew> I think it's mostly for photographers who want to shoot with film
[20:11:29] <Chiv> It's probably still an overall less expensive camera
[20:11:51] <Wolfy> Probably yeah
[20:11:52] <Chiv> because those sorts of film cameras are just a base rotating mechanism to turn the film, an aperture, and a lens
