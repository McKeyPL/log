[11:05:12] <Compu> optimizing app 252 out of 509
[11:05:29] <cloppyhooves> I hate that thing, Compu D:
[11:06:10] <Compu> cloppyhooves: basically it reinstalls all the apps because when u install an app on android the install process optimizes it for that specific version of the OS
[11:06:28] <cloppyhooves> That makes sense c:
[11:06:38] <Compu> it reinstalls everything
[11:06:38] <cloppyhooves> One thing that sucks is when it does that after my phone crashes D:
[11:06:44] <Compu> including system apps
[11:06:52] <Compu> mmm
[11:07:07] <Compu> well android OS update is much better than iOS update
[11:07:35] <Compu> at least if the update fails the phone can still be booted since it reverts any changes it makes when an update fails
