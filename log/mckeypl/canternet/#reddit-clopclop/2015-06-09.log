[00:03:52] <samonuh> Yes
[00:04:04] <Squirrelly> Yep
[00:04:13] <Squirrelly> I live in the Chicago suburbs
[00:04:27] <Squirrelly> A LOT of people take the train
[00:04:37] <Squirrelly> Why?

[00:05:59] <Flame> Just curious how it was for you...
[00:06:13] <samonuh> I ride the subway all the time lol
[00:06:14] <Flame> like...good experience? or? I'm thinking of taking a train from CA to Denver or so...
[00:06:16] <samonuh> It's nothing

[00:07:11] <samonuh> No
[00:07:26] <Squirrelly> The subway is more like a bus
[00:07:32] <samonuh> No it's not
[00:07:38] <Squirrelly> Trains are much more pleasant
[00:07:45] <samonuh> We say "take the train"
[00:08:03] <samonuh> The schedule is the train schedule

[03:47:51] <expatriate> blackcurrant is a stereotypically English thing here
[03:48:17] <Katiepony> Hmm, fair enough o:
[03:48:31] <expatriate> I don't think I've ever seen it
[03:48:44] <divination> blackcurrant is like.. the best thing ever

[03:48:51] <divination> apart from watermelon
[03:49:14] <Katiepony> Watermelon flavours aren't common here o:
[03:49:21] <divination> nope :(
[03:49:55] <divination> I remember selfridges selling some overpriced watermelon flavoured jelly sweets in the shape of kittens. They were the best thing ever
[03:52:04] <Katiepony> That seems like the sort of thing the Japanese care about o:
[03:52:19] <divination> true!
[03:52:23] <Katiepony> From the limited japanese media I consume, I get the feeling they care a lot less about the way something tastes
[03:52:33] <Katiepony> And a lot more about the cutesy way it is presented.
[03:52:33] <divination> very true.

[18:43:08] <Evelina> http://i.4cdn.org/b/1433865228386.jpg
[18:44:04] <Cel> I don't think so... I was 6 when I definitely knew it was fake, but before... idk
[18:45:07] <TheRedOne> for me it's a bit strange
[18:45:31] <TheRedOne> my parents keep telling me I madly bought into it
[18:46:01] <TheRedOne> I can't recall a time I did believe in santa though
[18:46:27] <TheRedOne> I do remember acting devastated when my parents finally decided to tell me he wasn't real
[18:46:34] <TheRedOne> and I do mean acted
[18:46:43] <Evelina> Huh
[18:46:46] <Cel> I played along when my parents said "you have to go take a walk so santa can bring the presents"

[18:47:49] <Evelina> Mine was when I figured it out, I'd still get presents from santa because my younger cousins did.
[18:47:59] <TheRedOne> Hey kids let's go to the church - do we have to - come now at least once a year can't hurt - fine
[18:48:19] <Cel> hehe
[18:48:45] <TheRedOne> then we'd return home after maybe ten minutes in church and OMIGOD SANTA BROUGHT PRESENTS AND MOM DIDN'T NOTICE ALTHOUGH SHE WAS AT HOME THE WHOLE TIME
[18:48:49] <Cel> When I was six we had a party. and the guy who played santa couldn't read the name on my present... so I walked up to him and took it
[18:48:57] <TheRedOne> lol
[18:49:03] <TheRedOne> ok that is fail

[20:30:17] <cloppyhooves> How young do you remember knowing about sex?
[20:30:27] <cloppyhooves> Not like getting the talk, but knowing it exists
[20:30:33] <iamalion> 5
[20:30:37] <iamalion> prolly earlier
[20:33:49] <cloppyhooves> I just suddenly remembered beig in third grae and giggling because we were looking up the word "sex" in the dictionary
[20:34:01] <cloppyhooves> So for me it's 9, if not younger
[20:35:13] <TheRedOne> third grade elementary, general education class
[20:35:51] <TheRedOne> so 9 years. of course in kindergarten we would try out all the dirty words, but I'm not sure we actually knew what they meant
[20:36:23] <TheRedOne> then again I did know what homosexual meant back then, through some sort of knowledge osmosis
[20:36:33] <TheRedOne> so maybe four or five years
[20:39:26] <iamalion> i had a gf in kindergarted
[20:39:30] <iamalion> we used to make out daily
[20:39:34] <iamalion> it was totes rad
[20:40:40] <TheRedOne> I had mine in first grade elementary
[20:40:53] <TheRedOne> she had to redo the first grade, was what I'd be told later
[20:41:10] <TheRedOne> and it took me a long long time to realise that that wasn't quite what hat happened
[20:41:21] <TheRedOne> had*
[20:42:35] <iamalion> what happened
[20:43:57] <TheRedOne> I suspect she got taken to different caretakers or something similar.
[20:44:39] <iamalion> suck :(
[20:44:43] <iamalion> i had to repeat 3rd grade
[20:44:52] <iamalion> i had a total bitch as a teacher who i refused to do any work for all year
[20:44:59] <iamalion> repeated 3rd grade -_-
[20:45:09] <TheRedOne> I like to think she got a better home. I haven't seen her ever since first grade, so who knows
[20:45:14] <iamalion> then my 4th grade teacher was the vice principal
[20:45:16] <iamalion> and she was so awesmome
[20:45:19] <TheRedOne> heh
[20:45:20] <iamalion> that she skipped me over 5th grade
[20:45:27] <iamalion> so i went from 4th to 6th middle school
[20:45:34] <TheRedOne> wow
[20:45:40] <iamalion> shes one of my fav teachers
[20:45:43] <iamalion> i go visit her sometimes
[20:45:47] <TheRedOne> ninth grade english teacher (foreign language, that is)
[20:46:04] <TheRedOne> that old hag was a bit notorious in school
[20:46:11] <TheRedOne> as being rather unfair
[20:46:36] <TheRedOne> by that point I had a good solid grasp of english
[20:47:04] <TheRedOne> so most of what she'd teach us, mostly grammar structures, I just flat out ignored
[20:47:36] <TheRedOne> because I already knew them by then and she'd just keep repeating the same shit until all 28 of us finally got the memo
[20:47:52] <TheRedOne> she was thoroughly convinced I didn't understand a word she said.
[20:47:55] <Cel> our english teacher was completely incompetent... he made me fail a test, because he insisted that I can't use american english... or english that "we haven't learned yet"
[20:47:58] <TheRedOne> sure I could've cared more
[20:48:04] <TheRedOne> wow what
[20:48:09] <TheRedOne> ok that's idiocy
[20:48:27] <TheRedOne> so one time she aputs me on the spot and has me explain something
[20:48:37] <TheRedOne> in english, that is, for added challenge
[20:49:00] <TheRedOne> so I do just that, anything to get it over with
[20:49:41] <TheRedOne> and she's like, "so you do know your stuff, why do you make this so hard on yourself"
[20:50:13] <TheRedOne> and I'm like "not my fault I don't care for the n-th time of past progressive
[20:50:21] <TheRedOne> she mad
[20:50:25] <Cel> :D
[20:50:41] <TheRedOne> she actually deducted points off my next test
[20:51:00] <TheRedOne> back then I was a scared little kid that didn't know I could contest that
[20:52:28] <TheRedOne> still better than that asshole philosphy teacher
[20:52:58] <TheRedOne> eleventh grade, finally high school, things are gonna be much more mature and sensible here (yea right)
[20:52:58] <iamalion> exactly
[20:53:03] <iamalion> that was my entire problem in school
[20:53:05] <iamalion> i knew it all
[20:53:06] <iamalion> too easy
[20:53:14] <iamalion> the bump from 4th to 6th really helped in that regard
[20:53:32] <TheRedOne> first time ever having philosophy classes, I was curious what we'd actually do.
[20:53:33] <iamalion> except i accidentally got a crazy high score on the standardized testing for math which i guessed on 2/3 of the questions...
[20:53:39] <TheRedOne> lol
[20:53:41] <iamalion> so i got taken out of my low lwevel math class and stuck into the highest one
[20:53:48] <TheRedOne> aww man
[20:53:56] <iamalion> yeah
[20:54:10] <iamalion> ive been bad with math my entire life and that certainly didnt hepl me at all
[20:54:35] <TheRedOne> so teach goes "alright, philosophy is basically any school of reasoning, so we'll see how well you do that. homework, do some thinking and put it to paper"
[20:54:55] <Cel> I never did anything... I passed barely, but I passed^^
[20:54:56] <iamalion> call brb
[20:55:29] <TheRedOne> so I did. I typed up something about free will on my comp, added random fonts because that totally and clearly proves free will and I'm so smrt
[20:55:39] <TheRedOne> print it out, get it to school
[20:55:53] <Cel> who copied the homework on every single day?
[20:55:54] * Cel did
[20:56:00] * TheRedOne did too
[20:56:05] <Giggles> Sounds like you clinched it Red.
[20:56:30] <TheRedOne> dickwipe teacher goes "yeah you stole that online didn't you"
[20:56:36] <TheRedOne> and I'm like no I didn't
[20:56:53] <TheRedOne> and he's like "now now come on, you gotta admit that this is, you know"
[20:56:59] <TheRedOne> and I'm like no I didn't
[20:57:19] <TheRedOne> and then he gives me a 6, equivalent to an F in the states
[20:57:32] <Giggles> That's absurd. He should be mega fired. O.o
[20:57:34] <TheRedOne> there I still didn't know I could contest that
[20:57:40] <TheRedOne> no
[20:57:56] <TheRedOne> fired should be that crazy bitch that got me involved with the police
[20:58:09] <TheRedOne> this one's one for a beer and scotch
[20:58:46] <weisey> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEJHrmliVQw
[20:58:46] <TheRedOne> the year was do your research, and germany was shaken by fear of school shootings, most recently in the town of censored
[20:59:16] <TheRedOne> now TheRedOne was sadly not ThePopularOne
[20:59:31] <Cel> I once aced a test for someone else, but failed myself... we switched papers in the middle of the test, but I teach tought he did it for me, not vice versa
[20:59:33] <TheRedOne> and being a bit of an edgelord he noted down his homework in a black notebook
[20:59:40] <TheRedOne> lol
[21:00:32] <TheRedOne> so random commie chick in brand clothing goes to the craziest teacher in the school
[21:01:32] <TheRedOne> a certain bigoted bitch who thinks anything male is inherently evil
[21:01:52] <TheRedOne> tells her that TheRedOne is creating a hit list
[21:02:26] <TheRedOne> bitch teach goes to warn everyone she meets of TheRedOne by name, without never even having seen me
[21:02:38] <TheRedOne> she then calls the police
[21:03:07] <TheRedOne> TheRedOne is sitting in physics class, enjoying some nice lesson about semiconductors
[21:03:37] <TheRedOne> director's secretary comes in and tells me my mother called and I gotta get to the phone in the office
[21:03:46] <TheRedOne> curious, why didn't she call my mobile
[21:03:58] <TheRedOne> but maybe something happened
[21:04:18] <TheRedOne> I enter the office, with two strangers in leather jackets waiting
[21:04:47] <TheRedOne> they introduce themselves as police officers (ctually servicemen, but who the fuck cares not like civilians gotta know that shit)
[21:05:00] <TheRedOne> they tell me there's been a call and whatnot
[21:05:24] <TheRedOne> they take TheRedOne to the precinct, not for a questioning but for a testimony
[21:05:38] <TheRedOne> or rather witness report
[21:05:49] <TheRedOne> I tell them what they want to know
[21:06:10] <TheRedOne> little Red riding One was of course scared shitless because he never done wrong
[21:06:22] <TheRedOne> then they ask if they could come home with me
[21:06:39] <weisey> https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2727748211/c3d0981ae770f926eedf4eda7505b006.jpeg
[21:06:50] <TheRedOne> they did a couple of gross violations of conduct, but by now that's all an old hat
[21:06:57] <Giggles> This is insane
[21:07:03] <TheRedOne> anyways so i take them home
[21:07:10] <TheRedOne> they read my emails
[21:07:23] <TheRedOne> my father's a hunter, so that's alarm bells right there
[21:07:38] <TheRedOne> and worst of all, I have - shockingly - airsoft toy guns
[21:07:42] <weisey> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPa3HBVM4_E
[21:07:57] <TheRedOne> those get taken in as evidence, i get a receipt and nothing happens
[21:08:14] <TheRedOne> bitch teach gets away with not even apologising to me.
[21:08:29] <TheRedOne> and all that during my supposed preparation for graduation exams
[21:08:49] <Giggles> Yeah that sounds about right. I think the student is the real enemy here honestly.
[21:09:07] <TheRedOne> of course I was
[21:09:28] <Giggles> Not you. the one who reported you.
[21:09:36] <TheRedOne> oh
[21:09:41] <TheRedOne> well
[21:09:43] <TheRedOne> true
[21:09:48] <TheRedOne> but teach got a responsibility
[21:09:54] <TheRedOne> as an adult, and as educator
[21:10:05] <TheRedOne> she gotta decide a proper and measured code of conduct
[21:10:17] <Cel> no.. they got authority... that's means they're always right
[21:10:19] <TheRedOne> and not start a smear campaign against an individuum she never even encountered
[21:10:44] <TheRedOne> and the whole matter went under the rug.
[21:10:59] <Giggles> That is true, and I'm not saying she isn't insane, but if all she did was call the police that might not have been a ridiulous reation.
[21:11:08] <TheRedOne> I was angry, but I knew that getting back at either bitch or slut would just make me look worse
[21:11:26] <TheRedOne> no I'll concede that
[21:11:39] <cloppyhooves> !tell Evelina http://i.imgur.com/Herh59Y.jpg
[21:11:39] <FineLine> cloppyhooves: I'll pass that on when Evelina is around.
[21:11:48] <TheRedOne> and I'll also concede that the plice had to do *something*, because everyone was in a panic back then
[21:12:00] <TheRedOne> and them not doing shit would've caused a huge scandal
[21:12:17] <weisey> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JeOGQCy0is
[21:12:18] <TheRedOne> because what is the police there for if not to protect the citizens from danger
[21:12:48] <Cel> scaring people for nothing?
[21:13:02] <TheRedOne> well today you say that
[21:13:14] <TheRedOne> xD
[21:13:14] <Giggles> Yeah, no one should ignore a report like that but ideally those falsely accused would not suffer either.
[21:13:52] <Giggles> Like I said, I think the big fault was the initial false accusation after that, had it been a real situation, the system worked pretty well.
[21:13:55] <Cel> of course... but that's what mostly happens... investigations without sufficient evidence, and no apology afterwards
[21:14:10] <Giggles> Yeah it's an issue :\
[21:14:34] <TheRedOne> real situation?
[21:14:35] <Giggles> AAWWWWW wook at the little Snakey!!
[21:14:40] <TheRedOne> you wanna know real situation?
[21:14:57] <TheRedOne> so our school was one of three on the same compound
[21:15:02] <TheRedOne> sharing a building with one
[21:15:23] <Cel> friend of mine was forgotten for 3 days in a holding cell... that was fun... noone checked over the weekend
[21:15:39] <TheRedOne> so one bright life blossom sent a warning to his school he'd come on blah and start shooting
[21:15:54] <TheRedOne> their school was evacuated that day, and we were wondering why the fuck the building was so quiet
[21:16:02] <TheRedOne> our school was not even informed of that
[21:16:18] <TheRedOne> but surely the shooter would distinguish between his schoolmates and us
[21:16:23] <TheRedOne> yeah
[21:16:39] <TheRedOne> I'm not kidding when I said it was a panic back there
[21:16:53] <TheRedOne> and it worked really great
[21:17:05] <Giggles> Pfft
[21:17:10] <TheRedOne> that threat was a hoax, turns out
[21:18:12] <TheRedOne> and now excuse me
[21:18:27] <TheRedOne> it's not my favourite story to tell, and my computer is acting up
[21:19:03] <Giggles> No pro
[21:19:09] <TheRedOne> actually
[21:19:14] <TheRedOne> anyone care to lend a hand?
[21:19:25] <TheRedOne> my computer doesn't want to save things it seem
[21:19:34] <TheRedOne> I suspect something with the hard drive
[21:20:09] <TheRedOne> claims the directory appears to be damaged
[21:20:14] <Giggles> Won't save anything
[21:20:16] <Giggles> ?
[21:20:39] <TheRedOne> it did save a picture earlier, and I did somehow manage to download the libreoffice installer after like 69 tries
[21:20:45] <Cel> bad sectors?
[21:20:45] <TheRedOne> piecewise, too
[21:20:52] <TheRedOne> how do I check/repair?
[21:21:07] <TheRedOne> I set up the HD like three days ago
[21:21:08] <Cel> different tools... on repair discs
[21:21:24] <Cel> eg. ultimate boot cd
[21:22:19] <Cel> if it's broken on filesystem level a chkdisk could be enough
[21:22:58] <TheRedOne> aight
[21:23:07] <TheRedOne> wish me luck, I may have to reconnect via tablet
[21:23:18] <TheRedOne> shit just never ends
[21:23:19] <Giggles> fare thee well
