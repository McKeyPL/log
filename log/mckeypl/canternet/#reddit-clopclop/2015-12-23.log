[01:42:17] <Nigiri> Lion can you hack into my Internet and upgrade it to 2gbs
[01:45:43] <Santa-Claws> because comcast's cable network could actually handle speeds over 50mbps
[01:46:47] <Santa-Claws> /s
[01:46:53] <Nigiri> In this area they offer 75,150, 300? And 2gbs
[01:48:14] <Wolfy> I get all my winter clothes at Hoth Topic
[01:48:38] <Santa-Claws> yeah the new 2gbps plan is interesting. the price for the install is crazy
[01:48:55] <Nigiri> Wait how much is it? 
[01:50:12] <Santa-Claws> oh it actually went down a bit 
[01:50:32] <Santa-Claws> Monthly recurring fee: $299.95 per month.
[01:50:32] <Santa-Claws> •Equipment monthly lease fee: $19.95 a month.
[01:50:32] <Santa-Claws> •Activation fee: Up to $500.00.
[01:50:32] <Santa-Claws> •Installation fee: $500.00.
[01:50:37] <Santa-Claws> according to the cc website
[01:50:55] <Santa-Claws> *Requires a two-year contract upon subscription
[01:51:38] <Wolfy> Rip
[01:52:06] <Wolfy> And then you get like 5Mbps /s

[01:53:08] <Nigiri> My dreams are dead 
[01:53:22] <Santa-Claws> hah
[01:54:10] <Nigiri> How much is Google fiber? I don't think that is *much* more 
[01:56:12] <Wolfy> Gb+TV is 130$/month
[01:56:25] <Wolfy> Gb Internet itself is 70
[01:56:35] * Nigiri makes a sad face 
[01:56:37] <Wolfy> $300 construction fee waived
[01:56:56] <Wolfy> Basic internet is 0
[01:57:18] <Wolfy> I want it here ;-;
[01:59:34] <Santa-Claws> Im happy with time warner, I just want a faster upload but that isnt possible
[02:00:14] <Nigiri> Why not? Why can't they have like 10/25 as an option? 
[02:00:46] <Santa-Claws> nope, time warner still has analog tv, so there is no room for more upstream frequencies on the lines
[02:01:17] <Nigiri> Aww 
[02:03:14] <Wolfy> All our carriers switched to digital last Christmas
[02:03:47] <Wolfy> Now I'm wondering what I can do with the tv insert in my wall
[02:03:52] <Nigiri> They went fully digital in my area but still analog where my mom lives 
[02:04:19] <Wolfy> Was gonna thread an Ethernet cable through it but it's bothersome and I won't be here long anyway
[02:04:53] <Wolfy> They just gave a 30 day period for everybody To swap to digital, then they shut it down for good
[02:04:56] <Nigiri> Try humping it 
[02:05:01] <Wolfy> It was a right hassle
[02:05:05] <Wolfy> No!
[02:05:21] <Wolfy> I like humping living things
[02:05:43] * Nigiri pretends to die 
[02:06:40] <Wolfy> And living organisms!

[07:11:33] <expatriate> I was gonna do a RD/Doctor Whooves comic
[07:11:58] <expatriate> and just doing rough sketches to figure out the panels took like 5 hours
[07:12:22] <expatriate> so I didn't get any further
[07:13:10] <Joe> wait 
[07:13:23] <Joe> i thought clopfic was drawing naked ponies 
[07:13:30] <Joe> and its drawing vs. drawing naked ponies? 
[07:13:39] <expatriate> no
[07:13:44] <expatriate> clopfic is writing
[07:13:54] <expatriate> clop fiction
[07:14:07] <Joe> well right hahahah
[07:14:09] <expatriate> it's writing about naked ponies or drawing naked ponies
[07:14:33] <Joe> roger that 
[07:14:44] <Joe> i am not a smart man /forest gump
[07:15:00] <Moka> naked ponies are the best kind
[07:21:03] <Moka> what do you think on the matter mistress cloppyhooves 
[07:24:57] <cloppyhooves> "Beg pardon Rarity, but uh...we don't normally wear clothes."
[07:25:20] <Nigiri> Nudity is good but then you can't strip whoever it is 
[07:28:45] <expatriate> I do have to say
[07:28:59] <expatriate> spitfire is hotter naked than most ponies because she's usually wearing clothes
[07:31:00] <plushie_pegasus> I'm back!!! :)
