[01:01:37] <Katiepony> I just found a tonne of pics I forgot about. Like, a year ago, I was on a low-carb diet and constantly craving carby stuff. Husbandhorse kept sending me pics of delicious looking carb food :<
[01:01:47] <Katiepony> I told him to stop, and he said he would send pics of red pandas instead
[01:01:55] <Katiepony> http://imgur.com/a/J1fMl These were the pics I got
[01:01:56] <FineLine> [ Imgur: The most awesome images on the Internet ]
[01:02:38] <Wolfy> Imma give Katie my pasta noodle

[01:03:41] * Vulpixbrew is a low carb fox
[01:03:43] <Katiepony> That is a Vulpix o:
[01:03:52] <Katiepony> Everyone knows foxes are high in carbs
[01:03:59] <Katiepony> 'cause they're so sweet
[01:04:21] <Redfox> yay
[01:04:28] <Vulpixbrew> fire types help you burn carbs though
[01:04:31] <Redfox> did you like my OC
[01:04:45] <Redfox> I find him quite gentalmanly
[01:05:01] <Vulpixbrew> he looks like he could be a time lord
[01:05:35] <Katiepony> How old are you, Redfox? o:
[01:05:44] <Redfox> 18 why?
[01:05:58] <Wolfy> Imma give Katie my zucchini cuz it's low in carbs
[01:06:10] <Katiepony> We don't call it zucchini here.
[01:06:23] <Katiepony> And, just seeing if you were a timelord.
[01:06:26] <Redfox> and his look was inspired by my love of the Vicotian Lundon era
[01:06:50] <Redfox> His name is Tick Tock Time Tinker
[01:06:59] <Redfox> Tock for short
[01:07:10] <Katiepony> We call it courgette o:
[01:07:50] <Redfox> Sadly that is the only full picture I have on him, and I did not draw it
[01:07:55] <Wolfy> Imma give you my penis then, gosh
[01:08:05] <Wolfy> Talk about stalling things
[01:08:05] <Redfox> down wolfy 
[01:08:53] <Redfox> I'd do anything to have someone draw him in a lewd way(except paying for it cause I don't have a credit card)
[01:09:50] <Katiepony> Well you're in luck
[01:09:57] <Katiepony> None of us pay for anything here c:
[01:10:00] <Katiepony> You'll fit right in
[01:10:04] <Vulpixbrew> ooow Wolfy they made a muzzle of you ibn BD land
[01:10:06] <Katiepony> Also none of us are artists
[01:10:32] <Redfox> Figured
[01:11:09] <Redfox> Once I get a paypal account and disposable income then I'd probably do it
[01:13:20] <Redfox> but untill then I'm shit outa luck

[13:21:29] <Cel> yesterday was a bad day for pvp... we killed the boss 3 times in a row... and won 0 events
[13:22:02] <Vulpixbrew> 3rd lich kill of the week
[13:22:05] <Cel> 0 events means no green boxes... no basic pvp equip to get better equip quicker >.<
[13:22:54] <Cel> it tried to do ragnaros 11 times this week, but it's so damn boring^^
[13:23:02] <Cel> I stopped at 4

[13:35:20] <Cel> don't know... with my dk I need about 4 times as long as with my hunter... for everything
[13:36:37] <Cel> firelands 25 1min per boss... a bit of trash... and the walking because the bosses don't stand in a line to get farmed... so... 15min?
[13:37:12] <Cel> dk takes at least 30min and that on 10
[13:38:11] <Vulpixbrew> I can do it with in 20
[13:38:44] <Vulpixbrew> In one 24 hour period I could get everymount Im missing out of raids and dungeons
