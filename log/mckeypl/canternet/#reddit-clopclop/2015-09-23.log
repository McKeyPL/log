[17:52:59] <Katiepony> Will I run out of stuff to do in a few hours?
[17:53:01] <Princesss1uttershy> There's a lot you can do with it
[17:53:16] <Princesss1uttershy> it takes hours just to set up a basic base
[17:53:33] <Princesss1uttershy> and there are already tons of mods for it
[17:53:37] <Katiepony> Hmm
[17:53:41] <Katiepony> Should I play with mods?
[17:53:47] <Katiepony> For my first try?
[17:54:41] <Princesss1uttershy> No, I would suggest getting used to the basic game before you get the mods
[17:54:46] <Katiepony> Mmkay :3
[17:54:49] <Katiepony> Also
[17:54:50] <Princesss1uttershy> mods mostly add on to what is already in the game

[22:51:57] <iamalion> hi
[22:52:07] <Katiepony> So, what's happened at work? o:
[22:52:34] <iamalion> some dumbass that we banned from another irc network started attacking all the network staff. so that took down my internet connection
[22:52:50] <iamalion> but ofc since it wasnt just an outage, my supervisor is trying to tell me it is unexcused
[22:53:12] <Katiepony> 'cause somebody was personally attacking you, that makes it your fault? o:
[22:54:56] <iamalion> aparently
[22:54:59] <iamalion> talking to him about that nos
[22:55:26] <iamalion> Told my supervisor that I am under a ddos attack for some reason
[22:55:26] <iamalion> Response " This will unfortunately be classified as an unexcused circumstance of absenteeism."
[22:57:22] <Katiepony> Can you not ask for a reconsideration or for it to be properly investigated?
[22:57:42] <iamalion> yeahim talking to him now
[22:57:50] <iamalion> because now i know it what exacrtly it was

[23:05:37] * Wolfy nibbles on Katiepony
[23:06:57] <iamalion> to supervisor: mk attendance notified. also in regards to what you said earlier "This will unfortunately be classified as an unexcused circumstance of absenteeism." I would have accepted that if it had been something caused by me hosting stuff and etc, but now that I know the cause and such behind what happened I do not feel that that would be fair as this problem had absolutely nothing to do with any of that and would have happened regardless of if
