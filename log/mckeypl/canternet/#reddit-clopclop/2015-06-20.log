[03:30:14] <Lumia> Lol that's perfect cloppy xD
[03:36:21] <thaostra> Apparently there's this upcoming Disney movie called Zootopia, and the two main protagonists are a fox and rabbit
[03:37:31] <thaostra> The whole time during the preview I thought of how perfect this movie would be as furry fetish fuel
[03:38:30] <Araiya> Too late; we already have porn of that.

[03:40:00] <thaostra> I was growning when they literally used puns containing the word "fur"
[03:45:42] <expatriate> I love when people post art that is 100% terrible with the comment "Now open for commissions!"
[03:46:56] <expatriate> hey, that guy who has been drawing for 10 years makes money off it, I bet I could too! *breaks out crayolas*
[03:46:57] <Araiya> Surely it's not 100% terrible.
[03:47:05] <expatriate> oh
[03:47:06] <expatriate> it is
[03:47:35] <Araiya> Having been in the furry fandom for a while, I'm sure it's not. ;)
[03:48:44] <thaostra> There's definitely a lot of people who aren't quite there yet to be selling art
[03:49:23] <Araiya> There are people who have passable drawing skills that shouldn't be selling art. There are people who have fantastic drawing skills that shouldn't be selling art.
[03:49:54] <thaostra> And there are people who have neither
[03:50:05] <Araiya> I've taken my chances on an artist whose skills weren't the best, and watched her grow.
[03:50:05] <thaostra> Which is, ya know, what I was talking about
[03:50:26] <Araiya> So, I'm of a mindset that people need somewhere to start, instead of never trying.
[03:50:38] <expatriate> I totally agree
[03:50:45] <expatriate> and I love to encourage new artists
[03:51:31] <Araiya> Yeah. That's what makes me happy. :)
[03:51:34] <expatriate> but if you think people should be paying you for it, that's a different thing
[03:51:44] <thaostra> Of course they need somewhere to start, I'm not trying to discourage self-improvement. I'm just saying that when it comes down to it, there are already artists who'd be able to draw better at the rates they offer
[03:52:41] <Araiya> It's when your art doesn't even look like you've tried and you expect $100 that I draw the line. Being compensated a fair rate for your time spent is one thing, but asking exorbitant rates is another.
[03:52:44] <thaostra> To pay someone for reasons other than their proficiency is an act of charity

[03:55:43] <cloppyhooves> How do I open a wine bottle without a corkscrew?
[03:55:47] <thaostra> https://www.reddit.com/r/ClopClop/comments/3a6id4/my_little_damsel_anthro_bondage_pack_the/cs9pk4g <- Like here, I was looking for an honest evaluation of the quality of the artist's work to see how much they've improved from their usual work, but that didn't happen so I'm just going to pass on paying $6 for an art pack that I have no idea what to expect
[03:56:10] <expatriate> easiest way is to just jam the cork in and drink the whole bottle
[03:56:31] <thaostra> http://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Wine-Bottle-Without-a-Corkscrew
[03:57:25] <thaostra> If you had port wine then you'd use a blowtorch and tongs
[03:58:35] <expatriate> just be aware most of those methods are way harder than they look
[03:58:39] <expatriate> I've tried most of them
[03:59:00] <expatriate> got it out by twisting a knife 1/3 times, the other 2 I ended up just pushing it in
[03:59:28] <thaostra> A shoe also works if you have a sturdy wall
[03:59:41] <Araiya> Yeah, I can see what you mean now, thaostra. I've seen worse art, based on what I see in their gallery, but I wouldn't blindly buy their pack, either.

[06:48:11] <Futashy> and it had 10x the iron it was supposed to
[06:48:17] <Futashy> so they used it for the cartoon

[11:42:11] <RubyPinch> calming down and getting more of a grip these days
[11:42:28] <cloppyhooves> If I may ask (you can answer this in PMs, and feel free not to answer it), how exactly does it manifest for you?
[11:43:58] <RubyPinch> used to be, see insect of any form, if slow: killit asap, if fast/flying: shriek and scream for someone else to kill it while I ran into my bedroom and shut the door
[11:45:12] <RubyPinch> and it used to be worser than that too
[11:45:28] <cloppyhooves> Was it fine to just think of them?
[11:45:31] <cloppyhooves> And what about pictures?
[11:46:12] <RubyPinch> for me, ye and ye, and if they are on the other side of glass, is fine too
[11:46:47] <Giggles> Oh well gee, that's my experience. I wouldn't call it a phobia.
[11:47:25] <cloppyhooves> Interesting
[11:47:27] <Giggles> They merely inspire terror.
[11:47:33] <RubyPinch> its more the blabbering/shutting down part that is the phobia
[11:47:39] <cloppyhooves> So only the IRL ones do it for you
[11:47:45] <RubyPinch> ye
[11:48:08] <RubyPinch> I know someone who is more phobic than I ever way, that I could ask
[11:48:14] <cloppyhooves> Sure c:
[11:48:36] <RubyPinch> will take a day tho
[11:48:55] <cloppyhooves> No problem c:

[11:53:36] <RubyPinch> ehe, well there ain't really a normal I figure, its an "irrational fear" because it doesn't really have a specific manifestation
[11:54:10] <Cel> I get ready to launch a nuclear warhead at my house when I suddenly see a black dot moving where it's barely visible, but when I'm close up I can pick it up and throw it out.
[11:54:10] <cloppyhooves> I suppose :o
[11:56:02] <cloppyhooves> I wanna say how it works for me but only in PMs 'cause I'm worried someone will want to use it against me as a joke D:
