[02:34:17] <Katiepony> cloppyhooves, I made a pretty big mistake
[02:35:18] <cloppyhooves> D:
[02:35:21] <cloppyhooves> What happened?
[02:35:26] <Katiepony> I decided to make a new rebirth file and try to get RPG again before afterbirth. I was doing the 'Cat got your tongue' challenge, where you have to use Guppy's hairball to kill everything.
[02:35:53] <Katiepony> I saw a 6 Die room, and for some reason thought it would make the run way easier
[02:36:04] <Katiepony> I could just reroll into a better set of items.
[02:36:11] <Katiepony> Anyway, I had no way of dealing damage
[02:36:18] <Katiepony> Since I lost the hairball.
[02:36:26] <Katiepony> So I had to kill myself |:
[02:36:31] <cloppyhooves> :(
[02:38:21] <Katiepony> I did one run, unlocked that challenge, and decided to go and get the challenges out of the way, starting with that one
[02:38:34] <Katiepony> And now I don't think I have it in me to get RPG again :P
[02:38:43] <cloppyhooves> I'm sorry :(

[17:03:43] <Princesssluttershy> apparently imgur is being used as a botnet against 8chan right now :/
[17:04:06] <Serene_Flow> Weird.

[17:09:55] * Vulpixbrew curls up next to the Katiepony tempted to go back to sleep
[17:13:55] <Katiepony> I feel like everyone I know irl has tried an Occulus Rift
[17:14:02] <Katiepony> Except me :<
[17:14:41] * RubyPinch puts one on Katiepony 
[17:14:47] <Serene_Flow> That must suck. I think I only know one friend who tried a demo at a con once.
[17:14:51] <RubyPinch> could go to a PAX or the such?
[17:15:03] <Vulpixbrew> Ive been wanting to get one Katiepony
[17:15:08] <Katiepony> I imagine PAX is expensive o:
[17:15:11] <Katiepony> And also in the US.
[17:15:21] <RubyPinch> in like 3 places i think?
[17:15:25] <Serene_Flow> PAX is US.
[17:15:42] <RubyPinch> no, only 2 places
[17:15:46] <RubyPinch> US and AU
[17:16:11] <Serene_Flow> Oh. I didn't know that had an AU location.
[17:16:31] <RubyPinch> I don't know if I'm going to go or not
[17:16:40] <RubyPinch> I'm going to be in state when its happening
[17:16:46] <Katiepony> I have 3 bffs irl. One owns a dev kit, one tries them regularly at their workplace, one worked on software for them at university.
[17:17:10] <RubyPinch> can't show up at the uni?
[17:17:14] <Katiepony> And husbandhorse used one during his degree.
[17:17:50] <Katiepony> There's like a year long game exhibit going on in my city at the moment
[17:17:53] <Katiepony> I hear it has one
[17:17:58] <Katiepony> I might go there to try it
[17:18:07] <Serene_Flow> Year long? Dang.
[17:18:34] <Katiepony> They cycle different exhibits out
[17:18:51] <Katiepony> Each one usually lasts several months o:
[17:18:59] <Serene_Flow> Wow.
[17:19:36] <Katiepony> This one just happens to be about gaming
[17:19:42] <Katiepony> Bad news is, it's part of my old Uni
[17:20:34] <RubyPinch> how bad is that bad news?
[17:20:50] <Katiepony> It's a public 'museum' type thing, usually with more modern exhibits. The other half of the building is the labs and lecture halls solely for Genetics.
[17:21:50] <Katiepony> I get a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach any time I ever see that place 'cause I basically threw away any hopes of a successful future when I fucked up my degree there.
[17:22:37] <Serene_Flow> Sounds rough. Sorry to hear that.
[17:23:02] * RubyPinch snugs Katiepony 
[17:23:36] <Katiepony> Kinda wanna avoid going to the exhibit so I don't accidentally bump into any of my old peers.
[17:24:00] <Serene_Flow> Wear a mask. They'll never know it's you.
[17:24:00] <Katiepony> But I do wanna try an Occulus Rift o:
[17:24:26] <Katiepony> It'd take more than a mask, probably
[17:24:35] <RubyPinch> wear two masks
[17:24:45] <Serene_Flow> Wear a hoody.
[17:25:28] <Katiepony> That would make it difficult to wear the occulus o:
[17:26:14] <Serene_Flow> Well, you take it off when wearing the Oculus.
[17:26:38] <Cel> do one of those heavy makeup things you find on youtube^^
[17:27:06] <Katiepony> What if I meet someone in the virtual matrix tho
[17:27:25] <Katiepony> How do I disguise myself in there?
[17:27:53] <Cel> reprogram yourself
[17:30:47] <RubyPinch> reprogram them
[17:30:50] <RubyPinch> their eyes
[17:31:24] <Katiepony> Good idea o:

[22:16:19] <Wolfy> I'm thinking of upgrading soon to 160
[22:16:30] <Wolfy> It's kinda expensive but oh well
[22:17:02] <Connor> I think I paid 80$ for a 250Gb ssd
[22:20:17] <Vulpixbrew> I want a 1 tb ssd
[22:20:18] <Compu> i paid $50 for a 1 TB HDD, plus another $50 to max out all possible warranty options
[22:20:30] <Compu> Vulpixbrew: they exist, for about $1,000
[22:20:54] <Wolfy> Mine cost about 120 for the 80 gigs

[22:24:51] * Vulpixbrew shrugs far suture purchase for me
[22:24:59] <Compu> since i dont have any gaming computers theres not a real big benefit to me having one, for the most part the hard drive is not the bottleneck for my computers
[22:25:08] <Compu> its the processor and such
[22:25:18] <Connor> Ssds don't have anything to do with gaming

[22:27:15] <Connor> There is essentially no benifit for gaming
[22:27:32] <Connor> It's about faster booting and app opening
