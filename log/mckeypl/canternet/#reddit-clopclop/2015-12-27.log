[01:09:31] <Wolfy> My friend lent it to me and said he didn't like it
[01:09:35] <Wolfy> Too much to do
[01:09:49] <Wolfy> Which is exactly what I need in games nowadays
[01:10:00] <Squirrelly> Like, picking people up with the trunk of an elephant and smashing them against the ground
[01:10:08] <Squirrelly> It's so...satisfying
[01:10:09] <Wolfy> Yeah!!
[01:10:23] <Squirrelly> Is that why guys like punching bags?
[01:10:48] <Wolfy> Punching bags only induce anger

[02:30:22] <Squirrelly> :3
[02:30:26] <diny> is bad dragons cum lube water based?
[02:30:40] <Squirrelly> I should hope so
[02:31:02] <Squirrelly> The other options are oil and silicone based, which are both big no-nos
[02:31:28] <Wolfy> :D
[02:31:44] * Wolfy rolls onto his back and lightly kicks out his hind paws
[02:31:45] <diny> yeah its been ages since I have seen silicone based lube, and I didnt know that oil lubes were a thing
[02:32:09] <Wolfy> Gotta get extra Virgin olive oil for the taste
[02:33:07] <Squirrelly> Oil lubes are a thing. They're just absolutely terrible
[02:33:16] <Squirrelly> Never ever use them
[02:33:47] * Squirrelly scratches the puppy tummy
[02:33:56] <diny> I can see someone using olive oil for a nice BJ, but it seems like it would be annoying overall
[02:34:04] <Wolfy> WD-40 everyday
[02:34:21] <Wolfy> Although not a lubricant
[02:34:31] * Wolfy pants happily
[02:34:36] <diny> nar, 2 stroke motor oil
[02:34:45] <Wolfy> Oh yeah
[02:34:56] <Wolfy> Gotta get the performance type
[02:35:03] <diny> lol
[02:35:09] <Squirrelly> Lol
[02:35:33] <Wolfy> For bjs we used to do a teeny bit of thin honey
[02:35:57] <diny> mhm, that sounds nice
[02:36:38] <Wolfy> It's very much a challenge to clean up if you bail but we made it a challenge to do it
[02:37:11] <Wolfy> Haven't tried it myself with bjs but with fish eating it's lovely
[02:37:19] <diny> lol, it'd be better than petroleum 
[02:37:29] <diny> jell
[02:37:30] <diny> y
[02:37:56] <Wolfy> Hehe
[02:39:16] <diny> when I was young and stupid I tried that out once, (solo) and it nice and slippery.... for about 3 days
[02:39:29] <Wolfy> Ooof
[02:40:43] <Wolfy> Lube is fun
[02:41:02] <diny> I did have the most velvety smooth and soft member after it went away though
[02:41:56] <Wolfy> Oooh :D
[02:51:13] <Squirrelly> Lol
[02:51:21] <Squirrelly> That's oil based
[02:51:55] <Squirrelly> Also, oil based lubes put holes in condoms :/
[02:52:24] <diny> so do silicon based lubes
[02:52:54] <Wolfy> Silicon plus silicon is no!
[02:53:12] <Wolfy> And holes in condoms are bad too!
[02:53:13] <diny> yeah I never understood why thats the case
[02:53:31] <Wolfy> They cancel eachother out
[02:53:34] * diny comically gasps "really!"
[02:54:07] <Wolfy> So when a silicon particle meets another, an empty void of darkness and despair takes their place
[02:54:19] <Wolfy> At least that's what I heard

[02:54:29] <Squirrelly> I'll be back

[14:18:09] <Frosty> Well, I was loaned them all, so I might as well.
[14:18:26] <Frosty> How do you do this, 4-3?
[14:19:26] <Wolfy> I do it 1-6 cuz I like the prequels

[14:20:42] <Frosty> I think my friend said that's what he does, but only because he's seen them. Since it's my first time, he said I should go 4-3, I think

[14:37:58] <Cyan_Spark> Or is it alt-click?
[14:38:10] <y007ghg7> might be alt click
[14:38:18] <y007ghg7> or shift click
