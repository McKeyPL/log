[18:06:25] <TheRedOne> look I barely know like six words
[18:06:43] <Wolfie> hvað segir þú gott would be correct 
[18:06:49] <TheRedOne> ah
[18:07:02] <Wolfie> and for that matter, ég segi bara allt fínt, sko 
[18:07:03] <TheRedOne> well I had to replace thorn and eth because I was too lazy for character list
[18:07:38] <TheRedOne> sko?
[18:07:44] <TheRedOne> bara?
[18:07:52] <TheRedOne> and why do I feel I understand the rest Oo
[18:08:20] <Wolfie> it's just a really casual and laid back way to say I'm doing alright 
[18:08:45] <TheRedOne> ah
[18:08:58] <Wolfie> sko means well and is just shoehorned in there because reasons

[18:09:38] <TheRedOne> every time I read icelandic I really think I'd like to actually learn it
[18:09:54] <TheRedOne> then I look like four pages into that book I got
[18:10:04] <TheRedOne> and the next day, all is forgotten
[18:10:18] <TheRedOne> :(
[18:10:22] <Wolfie> standard
[18:10:34] <Wolfie> I don't remember anything from 3 semesters of Spanish 
[18:10:53] <TheRedOne> :D
[18:12:02] <Wolfie> it really stuck at the time and I did really well but it just kinda seeped out over the past year or so
[18:12:53] <TheRedOne> yeah you gotta keep at the langauges you're learning
[18:13:10] <TheRedOne> so my family has foreign roots, so I grew up bilingual
[18:13:25] <TheRedOne> except I barely use my mother's tongue, so...

[18:23:47] <TheRedOne> eh, no te preocupes. eso es totalmente normal

[18:27:01] <Princesssluttershy> better than I could do
[18:27:08] <TheRedOne> cada vez eso pasa puedes preguntar como se dice ese palabra en inglés
[18:27:11] <Princesssluttershy> the only spanish I know is from Dora
[18:27:40] <TheRedOne> I've had it from fourth through sixth form, but it didn't amount to anything
[18:28:14] <cloppyhooves> Supongo que podía preguntar a ella :o
[18:28:23] <TheRedOne> vale
[18:28:33] <Princesssluttershy> I was in french school for 9 years and I still can't speak it XD
[18:28:58] <TheRedOne> I had two years french and dropped it because back then I was like I didn't like it, top marks notwithstanding

[18:29:36] <Wolfie> it was either Spanish or German for me
[18:29:42] <Cel> suppe?
[18:29:47] <Wolfie> in my field neither are required though
[18:30:10] <cloppyhooves> Realmente puedo entender el "Spanglish" que habla mi mamá y mi abuela sin errores pero la gente afuera de mi familia no hablan así

[18:30:32] <cloppyhooves> Outside :3
[18:30:39] <Princesssluttershy> I learned Quebec french though so it's not "real" french
[18:31:46] <TheRedOne> quebec french is about as "not real" french as american or australian english isn't "real" english
[18:31:59] <cloppyhooves> I appreciate the opportunity to practice my Spanish, TheRedOne :)
[18:32:59] <Princesssluttershy> TheRedOne, but if you can speak american english british people will still be able to understand you
[18:33:04] <TheRedOne> pleasure is all mine. I get to brag
[18:33:11] <Princesssluttershy> I can't understand a word of France french
[18:33:18] <TheRedOne> well I'm sure that french people can understand quebecois
[18:33:21] <TheRedOne> really?
[18:33:22] <TheRedOne> whoa
[18:33:25] <Princesssluttershy> and they wouldn't be able to understand me
[18:33:27] <TheRedOne> well I mean
[18:33:40] <TheRedOne> okay, I won't understand, say, namibia german
[18:33:42] <Cel> quebec french is about as french as bavarian is german
[18:33:49] <TheRedOne> lol
[18:33:51] <TheRedOne> xDD
[18:34:01] <TheRedOne> okay in that case
[18:34:04] <TheRedOne> yeah I can see that
[18:34:24] <TheRedOne> my sister carries the taint of the pretzel
[18:34:37] <Princesssluttershy> Then there's Moncton/New Brunswick french which no one can understand

[18:34:48] <Cel> :D
[18:34:59] <TheRedOne> well I mean
[18:35:04] <Wolfie> it's like Danish to other Nordic countries

[18:36:42] <Wolfie> plus islands 
[18:36:58] <TheRedOne> I was about to mention Faroe
[18:37:39] <Wolfie> Faroe is like that one cousin you've heard of once 
[18:38:22] <TheRedOne> xD
[18:39:40] <Wolfie> or the one relative you met once at a family dinner and he sat beside you, looking slightly to the left of your head as he rambles on about stuff 
[18:39:52] <Wolfie> you just nod politely and forget him the next day 
[18:39:53] <TheRedOne> en teoría tengo que continuar mi clopfic... xD
[18:39:55] <TheRedOne> lol
[18:40:14] <TheRedOne> though I think faroe is, language wise, closer to iceland than denmark
[18:40:46] <Wolfie> I'd say it's an unintelligible blend of both 
[18:41:06] <Wolfie> að mogga is to have sex
[18:41:38] <Wolfie> which is funny because one of our newspapers' nickname is Mogginn

[21:31:49] <Wolfie> I'm trying to become as uninterested in fallout 4 as I can be but its so harrrd :c 
[21:32:25] <Wolfie> my YouTube subscriptions is like 90% fallout gameplay and the 10% being the fallout themed PC case :C 
[21:33:30] <Vulpixbrew> tomorrow all the shchools have the day off
[21:33:38] <Vulpixbrew> fall out just released
[21:33:46] <Vulpixbrew> I think I see a connection here

[21:33:57] <Wolfie> WHAT
[21:34:02] <Wolfie> that's unfair :C 
[21:34:10] <iamalion> talking about stripper unicorns in our team chat at wor

[21:34:19] <Vulpixbrew> Wolfie I dont have it either
[21:34:21] <Cel> I saw a video about the power armor... the only one I saw, but it's cool... I'm still gonna wait^^
[21:34:22] <Wolfie> I know one guy who skipped school today because of it 
[21:34:28] <Vulpixbrew> I cant afford it right now
[21:34:37] <Vulpixbrew> unlesss.....
[21:35:06] <Vulpixbrew> Ok I :LOVE THERAFLU
[21:35:13] <Vulpixbrew> It's like tea
[21:35:20] <Vulpixbrew> with medicine that makes you feel better
[21:35:46] <Wolfie> if anyone wants to support my fallout fund I'll be behind the dumpster outside chat 
[21:36:05] <Wolfie> is for good purpose I promise 
[21:36:21] <Cel> of course it is
[21:37:13] <Wolfie> and then there's battlefront
[21:37:17] <Wolfie> one week to that 
[21:37:31] <Wolfie> I'm gonna be a good boy though and wait until finals are done 
[21:37:51] <Wolfie> then maybe I can get the deluxe version 
[21:38:09] <Cel> mmm swag
[21:38:31] <Wolfie> it's funny the digital deluxe edit is cheaper than the standard retail here in Iceland 
[21:38:43] <Wolfie> deluxe is $110 
[21:39:38] <Wolfie> standard here is 13k isk 
[21:39:53] <Wolfie> oh wow

[21:40:57] <Vulpixbrew> Posted: November 9
[21:40:57] <Vulpixbrew> I've nearly finished making my character.
[21:41:13] <Wolfie> what game? 
[21:41:21] <Vulpixbrew> fallout 4 reviuew
[21:41:44] <Cel> yea, people seem to play around with the creation a lot
[21:42:47] <Wolfie> I'm still kinda glad I'm waiting
[21:42:49] * Vulpixbrew whines
[21:42:59] <Cel> me too
[21:43:04] <Wolfie> because when I finally get it, most of the bugs will be fixed 
[21:43:08] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[21:43:09] <Cel> xrs
[21:43:17] <Cel> exactly I mean
[21:43:18] <Wolfie> and so far I've heard it's very bad 
[21:43:34] <Wolfie> but standard for Bethesda release
[21:43:35] <Cel> the map doesn't work half the time... fast travel and such
[21:43:48] <Cel> yea
[21:44:00] <Vulpixbrew> that moment people are trying to dis the game when they know they want to play it
[21:44:02] <Wolfie> dogmeat is glitching all over the place and models are freaking out over the physics 
[21:44:04] <Wolfie> standard 
[21:44:08] <Wolfie> oh yeah
[21:44:15] <Wolfie> there are two kinds of people 
[21:44:25] <Wolfie> people who play fallout and people in denial 
[21:45:22] <Cel> I wouldn't call it denial when it's true... skyrim was a big ol pile of crap... that didn't change even after I played it until they fixed stuff^^
[21:45:45] <Wolfie> that's true
[21:46:01] <Wolfie> the vsync and over 60Hz setting was very fun 
[21:46:13] <Wolfie> a very bumpy ride 
[21:46:46] <Cel> fallout 3 was unplayable for a month and it's one of my favorite games, doesn't change that it was crap initially^^
[21:47:15] <Wolfie> someone at school said its unplayable currently on any post win 7 machine
[21:47:25] <Wolfie> I hope it's not true
[21:47:30] <Wolfie> I wanna play it :( 
[21:47:35] <Wolfie> and new Vegas 
[21:47:35] <Cel> I never tried that
[21:47:42] <Cel> new vegas runs well
[21:47:47] <Cel> on win 10
[21:48:26] <Wolfie> awesome 
[21:48:26] <Vulpixbrew> enjoy you skyrim with crappier grapihic and guns
[21:48:43] <Wolfie> ? 
[21:48:58] <Vulpixbrew> forgiove me
[21:49:04] <Vulpixbrew> Im notall here atm
[21:49:09] <Cel> :D
[21:49:16] <Wolfie> haha
[21:49:36] <Wolfie> I tried skyrim initially on xbox at a friend's place
[21:49:47] <Cel> the graphics thing is true though... but fallout story is far better... elder scrolls story stopped being good with oblivion
[21:50:27] <Wolfie> I just think the gamebryo engine needs to be put down 
[21:50:29] <Cel> morrowind was so genius... and then... portals and silly dragons>.<
[21:51:15] <Wolfie> just swap the dragons out for Tomas the tank engine models
[21:51:21] <Cel> lol
[21:52:59] <Wolfie> interested to see how farcry primal is gonna turn out 
[21:53:25] <Cel> I'm more interested in just cause 3
[21:53:31] <Wolfie> oh yeah
[21:53:43] <Wolfie> that's out in December right? 
[21:53:46] <Cel> I wanna stick a plane to another plane again
[21:53:56] <Cel> yea
