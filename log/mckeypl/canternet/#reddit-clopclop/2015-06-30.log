[09:09:44] <copycats> anyone else getting deja vu right now?
[09:09:53] <Amber> how so
[09:10:55] <copycats> kind of hard to describe
[09:14:56] <copycats> anyway what do you like?
[09:15:28] <Amber> Under what category? :p
[09:16:28] <copycats> stuff
[09:16:34] <Amber> stuff
[09:16:36] <Amber> uhhm
[09:16:40] <Amber> I like trains
[09:16:47] <copycats> O
[09:16:56] <copycats> yeah trains are cool
[09:17:05] * Amber only said that for the asdf ref :p
[09:17:23] * copycats actually likes trains what
[09:17:24] <Amber> But for realsies, for the most part I guess I'd have to say... games :P
[09:17:42] <copycats> "visual novels"
[09:17:45] <Amber> Ahahaha sorry to disappoint
[09:17:59] <copycats> nah not at all
[09:18:02] <Amber> I've only read... two? I think it's only two visual novels :p
[09:18:34] <copycats> lots of content, then?
[09:19:17] <copycats> or discerning taste maybe
[09:19:20] <Amber> lol not especially :P I havent read one in a while
[09:19:43] <Amber> It's more that I dont usually take interest in them
[09:20:21] <copycats> what games do you like?
[09:22:10] <Amber> Final Fantasy 14 is nice but I havent had a chance to paly it in a while, And a lot of other games I play are either harrowingly difficult things, rougelikes, or exploration games o-o
[09:22:54] <copycats> that's cool
[09:23:19] <Amber> yourself? 
[09:24:23] <copycats> Smash Bros. is my favorite series but I also like shooters
[09:24:57] <Amber> Smash on Wii or 3ds o-o
[09:25:32] <Amber> or an older one
[09:25:41] <copycats> WiiU but brawl is probably my favorite game in the series
[09:25:47] <Amber> because I forget the older ones are still relevant
[09:26:01] <Amber> Ahh got it, I've been playing a lotta the WiiU one
[09:26:34] <copycats> I wish the newer character were free but I guess Nintendo has to draw a line somewhere
[09:26:41] <copycats> *characters
[09:27:08] <Amber> yeah but, you know, it's more characters, that's better than any other smash game can say
[09:29:19] <copycats> I only hope it stays competitively balanced despite the new fighters.
[09:29:37] <Amber> It seems like it has been
[09:29:53] <Amber> Like Roy and Ryu are good but they're not meta-breakers
[09:30:50] <copycats> I wonder how Ryu translated from such a different style of game.
[09:31:22] <Amber> Pretty well
[09:31:30] <Amber> I'm guessing you havent played him right
[09:31:38] <copycats> Correct
[09:31:57] <Amber> You watched anything on how he's special or anything?
[09:32:07] <copycats> Nah, not really.
[09:32:11] <Amber> ok so like
[09:32:30] <Amber> he can do his Hadoken, Shoryuken, and hurricane kick with just, like
[09:32:39] <Amber> up, side, and neutral specials
[09:32:48] <Amber> not in that order
[09:33:19] <Amber> He can do them normally like that, but he can also still use street fighter inputs to make them stronger
[09:33:38] <copycats> Awesome
[09:34:03] <Amber> so like, B does Hadoken, but Down, Down-Forward, Forward, A does HADOKEN
[09:34:28] <copycats> interesting hybridization
[09:34:54] <Amber> And his tilts have light and strong version depending on if you hold or tap A
[09:35:16] <Amber> So yeah new most complicated character
[09:35:47] <copycats> I've heard of some people asking for Sora, what do you think of that?
[09:37:07] <Amber> knowing disney and how they have infinity already, and knowing how Square is, and knowing how the ballot was last time they showed us... not likely?
[09:37:39] <copycats> I haven't seen the ballot, but I know Krystal was a strong contender.
[09:37:51] <Amber> Krystal was at least top 15ish
[09:38:09] <Amber> King K-Rool was #1 and Inkling #2
[09:38:51] <Amber> oh, yeah, Krystal was 7th
[09:39:02] <Amber> http://warioforums.com/index.php?threads/smash-bros-fighter-ballot-early-results.902/
[09:39:15] <copycats> Cool, more reptillians
[09:39:33] <Amber> mhm :p
[09:41:09] <copycats> Fawful would make my life
[09:41:28] <Amber> Fawful would be awesome 
[09:41:47] <Amber> So would Geno
[09:41:57] <copycats> his only attack should be text bubbles
[09:42:10] <Amber> xD
[09:42:14] <copycats> Geno, let me look up who that is
[09:42:22] <Amber> Geno is like
[09:42:32] <Amber> a puppet-man or something from Mario RPG
[09:42:46] <Amber> Third Party member I think
[09:46:12] <copycats> Nice nice and Isaac in fifth is good to see
[09:46:42] <Amber> I hate to say I dont really know him D:
[09:47:21] <copycats> Neither do I, just that he's from golden sun and people have been clamoring for his inclusion in the series
[09:47:45] <Amber> something something light hands in brawl
[09:49:06] <copycats> hey can i ask you a personal question?
[09:49:20] <Amber> totally o-o
[09:49:43] <copycats> do you have someone in your life who makes you happy?
[09:50:13] <Amber> uhh
[09:50:27] <Amber> I want to say yes, but I'm going to say "Currently, No"
[09:50:56] <copycats> alright then thanks
[09:51:10] <Amber> No problem o-o
[09:51:19] <Amber> Why d'you ask?
[09:51:51] <copycats> if you did i might have asked how you met and got to know them that sort of thing
[09:52:18] <Amber> Ahh
[09:53:00] <Amber> Yeah I cant say I've rightly had that kinda person for a couple months @-@
[09:53:19] <copycats> sorry to hear that
[09:54:13] <copycats> what bands do you like?
[09:55:51] <Amber> Hmm
[09:56:25] <Amber> I need to actually check cause I never even think of the bands when I listen to music :p
[09:56:39] <copycats> that's fair
[09:58:09] <Amber> Supercell, Bush, P-Floyd, Greenday, Pretty Reckless, AKFG are all good ones
[10:01:53] <copycats> cool, downloading some now
[10:02:11] <Amber> ^^
[10:02:20] <Amber> Whatre some of your favorites?
[10:06:56] <copycats> The Strokes, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, The Shins.
[10:08:02] <Amber> Only one I'm not terribly familiar with there is the shins
[10:08:24] <copycats> Australia is a good song
[10:08:37] <Amber> will check it out :3
[10:13:16] <copycats> have you seen hunter x hunter?
[10:13:46] <Amber> I havent, too many other anime things under my blanket of procrastination D:
[10:14:33] <copycats> what else is under your procrastination blanket?
[10:15:51] <Amber> Hmm
[10:16:43] <Amber> There's some game-dev-type projects I've been working on for months, and uhh... like I have this plaster skull mosel that's still have not-constructed xP
[10:16:48] <Amber> model*
[10:18:30] <copycats> that sounds cool.
[10:22:18] <copycats> do you like scary movies?
[10:22:50] <Amber> Scary movies not so much, games though are more my thing (Big surprise)
[10:23:25] <copycats> Amnesia, outlast, that sort of thing?
[10:24:24] <Amber> Yeah, though my computer's not usually good enough for them, so I get more like Imscared, Ib/Witch's House, Gmod stuff,etc
[10:28:18] <copycats> is Imscared compatible with Apple computers?
[10:28:46] <Amber> uhh
[10:29:16] <Amber> I'm not rightly sure
[10:29:30] <Amber> How does mac handle .exe's?
[10:29:42] <copycats> idk honestly
[10:29:53] <Amber> well like
[10:29:59] <Amber> does it run them? I assume yes
