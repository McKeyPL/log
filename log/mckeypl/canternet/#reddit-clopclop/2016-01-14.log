[00:01:27] <Cel> that much experience comes with a price
[00:01:38] <Wolfy> Yeap
[00:01:50] <Wolfy> I mostly use a strap on but the don't have to know
[00:02:20] * Cel nods
[00:03:12] <weisey> 1.5 billion 
[00:03:17] <weisey> God damn 
[00:03:25] <Psi> they make pretty realistic strap ons now anyways =P
[00:05:26] <iamalion> DID NO ONE WIN
[00:06:34] <iamalion> weisey weisey weisey
[00:07:56] <weisey> iamalion: 
[00:08:08] <weisey> No one won on Saturday 
[00:08:18] <weisey> So it's up to 1.5 billion now
[00:09:10] <weisey> I can't even imagine what I would do with that kind of money
[00:10:00] <Moka> i'm starting to find Powerball tickets at my workplace
[00:10:00] <Wolfy> Hookers and coke
[00:10:28] <Psi> I'd get rid of it lol, one side of the family would prob burn my home down if they thought there was a chance it'd be laying there in a steel box at the end
[00:11:01] <iamalion> ohh
[00:11:04] <Wolfy> When id die I'd get myself mummified and buried in a tomb on Mars
[00:11:07] <iamalion> the drawing is today, i thought no one won today
[00:11:34] <weisey> Actually id probably buy a house, then set aside like 100k per year for living expenses, and then donate/invest the rest   
[00:12:06] <weisey> And use the investment returns for fun monies 
[00:12:42] <weisey> And I'd probably persue a pro gaming career with all that free time
[00:12:46] <Wolfy> I'd buy Disneyland and turn it into Yiff land
[00:13:12] <diny> I'd totally go there
[00:13:27] <Wolfy> Turn the studios into one big porn business
[00:13:34] <Psi> lol!
[00:14:22] <cloppyhooves> If I won the Powerball
[00:14:27] <cloppyhooves> I'd have a lot of money, probably
[00:14:30] <Wolfy> Then live as a King in the top of the Disney castle tower with lotsa pornstars which they've unknowingly signed up to be my slaves
[00:14:32] <Moka> probably
[00:14:42] <weisey> cloppyhooves plsssss
[00:14:43] <Wolfy> Flawless
[00:14:45] <weisey> plsssss
[00:14:53] <Moka> tbqh
[00:14:59] <Moka> If I had that much money 
[00:15:11] <Moka> I'd make a down payment on  house in the SF Bay Area
[00:15:16] <Moka> >_>
[00:15:19] <weisey> But seriously, I'd have literally no idea what to do with all the extra  
[00:15:27] <weisey> Hahaha moka
[00:15:40] <weisey> It's not *that* expensive down there  
[00:15:49] <Moka> i live here :P
[00:15:56] <Moka> i know it's not that expensive, but for the purpose of the joke, it is!
[00:15:58] <diny> first thing I'd do is see a financial adviser, because IIRC you dot just get a massive check 
[00:16:29] <diny> don't
[00:16:40] <Moka> probably some kind of big house in mountain view in which I can install a SEX DUNGEON
[00:16:52] <weisey> diny: its either an annuity for the full amount, for a massive check for about 900 mill pretax
[00:16:56] <Moka> i mean, uh, completely innocent coffee bar
[00:17:16] <weisey> But even then
[00:17:21] <Wolfy> Either way I think money would be hard to sleep on
[00:17:28] <weisey> After tax, that's still like 750mill
[00:17:32] <Wolfy> That being said I'm going to sleep anyway
[00:17:37] <weisey> That's 75 years of 100mill/year
[00:17:38] <Wolfy> Gnight all
[00:17:53] <weisey> WHAT DO YOU EVEN DO WITH THAT
[00:18:04] <Moka> er
[00:18:07] <Moka> 10m/yr
[00:18:08] <Moka> but yes
[00:18:14] <Wolfy> Teslas on teslas on teslas
