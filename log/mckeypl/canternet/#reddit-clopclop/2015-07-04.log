[02:43:18] <expatriate> Got to spend all day doing level design so I'm good ^___^
[02:44:14] <Suzi> Ooo are you making a game?
[02:45:23] <expatriate> well yeah, but my main project is a 2d puzzle-ish game, and today I was playing around with an FPS environment
[02:45:46] <expatriate> it was fun to do something that isn't for any real project
[02:45:54] <Suzi> kool
[02:46:25] <expatriate> how about yourself?
[02:46:58] <Suzi> i've always wanted to have a go at a really minimalistic FPS, kinda like Lovely Planet
[02:48:47] <expatriate> you should!
[02:49:00] <expatriate> have you ever made a game or have any programming experience?
[02:49:41] <Suzi> i played around with gamemaker when i was at school, but i never did anything other than rogulike 2d type games
[02:50:41] <expatriate> in my opinion the idea that 2D is easier to make than 3D isn't really true
[02:50:47] <expatriate> so I bet you could do it
[02:51:43] <expatriate> honestly with Unity and a couple standard assets (what they let you use for free) you could make a game like that with less than 20 lines of code
[02:55:17] <Suzi> probably, it's just a matter of setting some time asside

[05:26:47] <IceFlurries> the last thing on the FAQ here http://www.mother4game.com/faq.html sounds a lot like another game "studio" from a VN I played
[05:27:02] <IceFlurries> who only banded together to make "one sole game"

[06:54:45] <IceFlurries> nm
[06:54:49] <IceFlurries> smash
[06:55:12] <samonuh> smash?
[06:55:22] <weisey> SSB
[06:55:41] <samonuh> the first one?
[06:56:21] <IceFlurries> nope
[06:56:22] <IceFlurries> wii u
[06:56:26] <samonuh> Oh
[06:56:26] <IceFlurries> playing as ness :3
[06:56:34] <samonuh> Neato
[06:56:39] <samonuh> I played Melee today
[06:57:41] <princesssluttershy> I played Project M
[06:57:49] <IceFlurries> D:
[06:57:53] * IceFlurries has no proj m :c
[06:58:03] <samonuh> No idea what that is
[06:58:22] <princesssluttershy> It's a mod for brawl that makes it more like Melee
[06:58:32] <princesssluttershy> or something
[06:58:33] <samonuh> Oh
[06:58:39] <samonuh> Why not just play Melee?
[06:58:39] <princesssluttershy> I don't really get it
[06:58:56] <princesssluttershy> because this has net multiplayer
[06:59:12] <samonuh> overrated
[06:59:24] <weisey> samonuh: its a mod for brawl that rebalances characters (sonic is no longer op)
[06:59:28] <weisey> Adds characters 
[06:59:33] <Amber> Im just not interest in PM myself @-@
[06:59:43] <weisey> And makes the fighting style more like mele
[06:59:48] <weisey> Meele*
[06:59:50] <weisey> Fak
[06:59:54] <weisey> Either way
[06:59:56] <samonuh> Melee
[07:00:04] <weisey> It basically too the the best of both
[07:00:22] <weisey> And rebuilt brawl that way
[07:00:23] <samonuh> Brawl is literally awful in my opinion, so I'll stick to Melee
[07:00:34] <princesssluttershy> It makes the controls not shit like they were in brawl
[07:00:42] <IceFlurries> D:
[07:00:52] * IceFlurries wishes Smash Bros had more "history" unlockables :c
[07:01:10] <samonuh> Melee was done right when it came to unlocking characters and stages
[07:01:14] <samonuh> It took effort
[07:01:21] <samonuh> And was diversified in challenges
[07:01:34] <samonuh> It wasn't a play through story mode
[07:02:04] <samonuh> I still remember spending weeks trying to beat every target practice to win one stage
[07:02:05] <samonuh> lol
[07:02:30] <princesssluttershy> The one on the N64 is still my favorite
[07:02:41] <princesssluttershy> literally one of the only N64 games I liked
[07:02:49] <samonuh> Mariokart 64?
[07:03:00] <samonuh> Mariokart 64 had the best battle system.
[07:03:01] <princesssluttershy> I haven't played that unfortunatly
[07:03:07] <samonuh> Elimination is the way to go
[07:03:12] <samonuh> Not point count
[07:03:18] <princesssluttershy> the original Mario Kart is my favorite one to date though
[07:03:31] <princesssluttershy> I hate the new one
[07:03:50] <samonuh> I enjoyed it
[07:04:18] <princesssluttershy> My favorite ones are the original and the one on wii
[07:04:21] <princesssluttershy> the gamecube one was alright
[07:04:45] <samonuh> Mariokart Wii is great
[07:05:45] <princesssluttershy> Perfect Dark is still one of my favorite FPS games

[09:59:32] <Vulpixbrew> I had an odd thought
[09:59:57] <Vulpixbrew> in the old british navy when they had tall ships, the chief means of punishment was flogging

[10:00:05] <Amber> Ill never unsee
[10:00:10] <Amber> Not sure if thats a bad thing or not
[10:00:34] <Vulpixbrew> do you think there were kinky people who joined the navy and screwed up obn purpose
[10:00:50] <Vulpixbrew> you have been sentenced to 20 lashings 
[10:00:55] <Vulpixbrew> Yay I mean oh no
[10:01:11] <cloppyhooves> They weren't the fun kind of lashes D:
[10:01:19] <Wolfie> many died from infections 
[10:01:57] <Wolfie> cuz like they used actual whips not floggers
[10:02:18] <Amber> I like to imagine dickish ones would be the kind that would provoke the "Ok, everyone gets punished thanks to this guy" and he'd be let "Hehehe fuck all yall"
