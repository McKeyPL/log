[12:39:15] <bad_rooster> how to put it

[12:41:40] <Vulpixbrew> going back to sleep I hope
[12:42:00] <sparklesbright> Seriously, Linux would kill at all that stuff if the software existed for it. Music production you can do, the tools are there. But for video, or graphics work, or most other creative tasks, look elsewhere.

[13:23:36] <bad_rooster> Compu: well
[13:23:53] <bad_rooster> I'll make sure to fork it and rewrite it as a plugin for launchy
[13:24:54] <Compu> what is it trying to do?
[13:26:18] <bad_rooster> search various resources
[13:26:30] <bad_rooster> use them for search query 
[13:26:38] <Compu> launchy already does that
[13:26:38] <bad_rooster> list programs based on it
[13:26:42] <bad_rooster> .-.
[13:26:49] <bad_rooster> I said I don't wanna know
[13:26:51] <Compu> shortcut key, type, hit enter to launch
[13:27:04] <Compu> imports from start menu and quick launch on windows
[13:27:16] <Compu> and whatever other folders u tell it to
[13:27:42] <bad_rooster> yea well :3 mine's more special tho 
[13:27:45] <bad_rooster> cuz it does
[13:27:46] <bad_rooster> stuff
[13:27:55] <Compu> what stuff?
[13:28:20] <bad_rooster> well it searches man pages and assigns the program to it and is overall smart
[13:28:38] <Compu> mmmk
[13:28:47] <Compu> pretty sure windows doesnt have man pages
[13:28:56] <bad_rooster> ITS FOR LINUX 
[13:28:58] <bad_rooster> GRR
[13:29:18] <Compu> mmm
[13:29:31] <Compu> well for linux synapse is usually the choice
[13:29:48] <Compu> and i think it can already do that
[13:29:58] <bad_rooster> dude
[13:30:00] <bad_rooster> srsly though
[13:30:07] <bad_rooster> I. don't. wanna. know

[22:22:45] <ConnorCat> Spiders are really really really hard to drown :C

[22:22:52] <Wolfie> I don't hate spiders, just their eyes
[22:23:00] <Wolfie> ok this bot needs some work
[22:23:16] * Wolfie assigns himself to team felina
[22:23:18] <Squirrelly> Yup
[22:23:26] * Squirrelly is also on team Felina
[22:23:43] <Squirrelly> Also, spiders aren't that hard to get rid of in the shower
[22:23:47] <Squirrelly> Just get them down the drain
[22:23:54] <Wolfie> shpiders
[22:23:56] <Squirrelly> Worst case: they come out later after you've left the bathroom
[22:24:04] <Squirrelly> And they catch other bugs in the bathroom
[22:24:17] <Squirrelly> We usually have an ant problem upstairs in our bathroom
[22:24:25] <Squirrelly> We have a spider or two by the vent where they usually come out of
[22:24:31] <Squirrelly> Suddenly BAM no ant problem this year
[22:24:49] <Wolfie> hooray to helpful creatures 
[22:24:59] <Squirrelly> Mmhmm
[22:25:17] <Wolfie> man flist is a looooong lost

[22:25:28] <Squirrelly> rofl yep
[22:25:43] <ConnorCat> Spiders aren't helpful they are evil! EVIL! they only eat other bugs so they can grow bigger and eat me 
[22:26:02] <Wolfie> cats eat spiders
[22:26:18] <Wolfie> with gusto 
[22:26:24] <ConnorCat> Maybe normal cats, I am in fact a scaredycat

[22:29:33] <Squirrelly> I think I'm gonna go back through every single thing on F-List and re-evaluate my feelings about it
[22:29:41] <Squirrelly> I'm gonna have an opinion for every kink
[22:29:58] <ConnorCat> I'm doing that right now, I realized I hadn't gone through it since I made it however long ago 
[22:30:19] <Giggles> lol, I did that once. Took ages, really made me think.
[22:30:47] <ConnorCat> But I'm doing Fave=OHMYGODYESDOTHISTOME Yes=I like this No=Don't even ask and then everything else is basically if you like it I'm into it 
[22:30:51] <Squirrelly> Though I suppose I can leave out the ones that only apply to people with penises lol
