[07:12:07] <IceFlurries> I'd say Episode V, and then VI, then tie between III and IV...in overall terms
[07:12:22] <IceFlurries> You gotta admit the whole Mustafar scene was epic
[07:13:07] <samonuh> It was way too overdone
[07:14:54] *** Joins: Cel (Cel@Silver.Horizon)
[07:15:17] <thaostra> The lightsaber duel was great in terms of spectacle, but after a while of them deflecting each others blows in different ways the tension and importance of the scene feels watered down
[07:15:40] <samonuh> Exactly
[07:15:57] <samonuh> Luke vs. Vader in Episode V is the best duel
[07:16:22] <thaostra> What makes the lightsaber fights so great is not the sabers themselves, but rather the conflict between the people wielding them
[07:18:02] <thaostra> Luke vs Vader in V is excellent. Luke is severely outmatched, and learns that all too late instead of right at the beginning when his testing the waters with a first swing was immediately deflected with a few hits, and Vader was able to keep up with just one hand

[07:24:57] <iamalion> i love the 10:30  time
[07:25:21] <IceFlurries> :P I bet. I actually like ~9:30-10:30 start times
[07:26:03] <iamalion> ugh 9:30 sucks
[07:26:12] <iamalion> 10:30 sucks too, but its berable
[07:26:50] <thaostra> IceFlurries> but Anakin v Obi-wan wasn't bad <- It wasn't bad, but it wasn't definitive of Star Wars either. The prequel fights are different from the ones in the original trilogy as they became gimmicky. Can you think of how much conflict Obi-wan had when he fought General Grievous, or when Yoda fought Palpatine? The fights just didn't have much of a storytelling element
