[01:40:25] <RNGsus> its possible for people over 18
[01:40:36] <RNGsus> ^ thaostras got it
[01:40:39] <Ifuckingloveponies> i mean lying is possible for anyone under 18 but i was honest
[01:40:52] <Ifuckingloveponies> i feel like i deserve some points for honesty
[01:41:03] <Ifuckingloveponies> or are you just gonna ignore me for being nice, just like everyone else?
[01:41:03] <RNGsus> those arent awarded in a court of law :C
[01:41:08] <Melon_Phone> ^
[01:41:10] <Melon_Phone> besides
[01:41:24] <Ifuckingloveponies> by points i absolutely mean pornography of cartoon horses
[01:41:41] <RNGsus> there were links given
[01:41:46] <Melon_Phone> you can just wank off without porn

[01:47:04] <Ifuckingloveponies> that is not even a horse having sex with a horse why do you think i came here

[09:30:08] <iamaphone> I have approx 90mL of water a day 
[09:30:52] <Giggles> I never drink water, it tastes bad. :O
[09:32:13] <iamaphone> We have an aquifer so our water is very very good
[09:32:20] <iamaphone> I cannot stand bottled water
[09:32:32] <iamaphone> And I have to bring my own water to Portland when visiting my bro
[09:32:43] <iamaphone> Because I can't handle chlorine in my water :(
[09:32:58] <cloppyhooves> 90 mL? Isn't that only a little?
[09:33:04] <iamaphone> The 3 weeks over year they chlorinate our water is a very rough time for me and I get really sick 
[09:33:11] <cloppyhooves> :(
[09:33:41] <iamaphone> 90mL is quite a lot :o my water bottle is 10mL and I drink ~9 per day 
[09:35:05] <sleepyPon> It's  wry little
[09:35:17] <sleepyPon> A human adult should drink about 2 litters a day
[09:35:40] <Giggles> 90ml doesn't seem like a lot. I think I drink about that much soda a day.
[09:36:16] <sleepyPon> I'm serious on the 2000ml a day
[09:36:17] <iamaphone> That's 9 whole bottles of water O_o I dunno its a scratched steel bottle, it might not say 10 then 
[09:36:20] <cloppyhooves> Google says 10 mL is less than a fluid ounce
[09:36:38] <iamaphone> Oh
[09:36:42] <sleepyPon> Heh, yah
[09:36:45] <iamaphone> Pls calc 24 oz to ml
[09:36:55] <Giggles> Yeah wait, a ml is 100oth of a liter.
[09:37:03] <iamaphone> Because I see it says 24oz/??|0ml
[09:37:17] <iamaphone> Hmm probably like 110 then 
[09:37:28] <cloppyhooves> 24 fl oz is 710 mL
[09:37:32] <Giggles> Google says 24 oz is 710 ml
[09:37:51] <sleepyPon> Hehehe
[09:37:59] <sleepyPon> Silly kitty
[09:38:26] <iamaphone> Oh yeah I guess that looks like a 7
[09:38:30] <iamaphone> Sec will pic 
[09:39:05] <Giggles> If your water bottle is 24oz and you drink nine a day that is a pretty large amount.
[09:42:01] <iamaphone> http://imgur.com/a/fBcGW
[09:42:15] <iamaphone> I do drink around 8-9 a day. 
[09:42:40] <PantyStallion> 6 24 fl oz
[09:42:40] <iamaphone> <+iamaphone> sleepyPon: I drink a crazy amount of water
[09:42:46] <sleepyPon> Hehe
[09:43:32] <iamaphone> My brother bought this for me when he first moved to Oregon and I have used it daily ever since 
[09:43:39] <iamaphone> It goes everywhere with me
[09:43:47] <PantyStallion> 6which does indeed translate to 710 ml
[09:43:52] <iamaphone> If I have my phone, bottle and ChapStick I'm good 
[09:43:59] <iamaphone> Yeah the 7 is pretty worn off 
[09:44:19] <cloppyhooves> That makes more sense c:
[09:44:24] <cloppyhooves> It is a lot of water, yeah :o

[16:46:09] <TheRedOne> huh.
[16:48:49] <thaostra> I got the RSS Feed Reader for Chrome. It works very nice, displaying all of my feeds in a dropdown menu with all features easily configurable
[16:51:51] <thaostra> RSS is one of those things that I find best as either a native browser feature or as a browser extension. All of the native RSS readers I tried that have embedded page rendering are just re-inventing a web browser, and usually just end up distracting me from my workflow because it's in a different window
[16:53:31] <RNGsus> what is rss
[16:56:45] <thaostra> It's a format for publishing frequently updating information like blogs and headlines as a feed
[16:58:43] <thaostra> Many sites like like Reddit and Derpibooru support it, so with a feed reader you can get notifications of new posts
[17:00:00] <thaostra> Like right now, I just got a notification of someone posting to /r/ClopClop: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClopClop/comments/3a632y/lyra_x_hands/
[17:01:01] <thaostra> It's a smart way of consuming lots of new information without having to repeatedly check sites you visit everyday
[17:06:16] <thaostra> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp <- This is by far the best RSS reader I've used in Chrome. One of the more compelling features I've found is that it'll notify you if it detects an available feed which can be added with a click
