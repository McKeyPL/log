[01:19:39] <thaostra> Well uh, it would've helped to be a little more specific :P
[01:19:50] <thaostra> For a moment I thought you were talking about this server
[01:21:02] <Wolfie> kill the animals? 
[01:21:35] <weisey> Op
[01:21:39] <weisey> Broken sprites
[01:21:58] <cloppyhooves> Kill the animals refers to a bid war for Super Metroid
[01:22:10] <cloppyhooves> At the end, there's a slight detour you can get to save some animals on an exploding planet
[01:22:18] <cloppyhooves> Going to get them takes more time and slows the speedrun a bit
[01:22:20] <weisey> Wolfie: end of Metroid, room, can save animals (and increase the run time) or  not
[01:22:25] <cloppyhooves> Skipping them kills them, but goes faster
[01:22:33] <cloppyhooves> It's a tradition for GDQ :o
[01:22:36] <Wolfie> ah makes sense
[01:22:50] <cloppyhooves> It's usually a very high-priced bid war
[01:22:52] <Wolfie> oh they're gonna race? 
[01:22:52] <cloppyhooves> Right now it's
[01:22:53] <cloppyhooves> Kill them 	Save those delicious frames. 	$46,187.84 	(None)
[01:22:53] <cloppyhooves> Save them 	Make it canon. 	$43,607.33 	(None) 
[01:23:42] <expatriate> do you run canternet too?
[01:24:01] <Rylee> no
[01:24:05] <Rylee> blame Shutter for that one
[01:24:15] <Wolfie> damn you Shutter! 
[01:24:21] <Wolfie> whatever you did!

[03:11:41] <Vulpixbrew> I miss my firt desert spawn
[03:12:53] <expatriate> the best game of minecraft I ever had was when I spawned on an island that was like 4x5 blocks in a huge ocean with no other land in sight and just one tree
[03:13:03] <expatriate> it was actually challenging
[03:21:01] <IceFlurries> RubyPinch: plz send me to alaska? :3
[03:21:04] <IceFlurries> xD
[03:21:21] <IceFlurries> expatriate: I feel the best spawn I had was my first gmae xD lol before i got bored of it all ;-;
[03:22:05] <expatriate> it's the kind of thing that once you start, you don't want to do anything else for the next 100 hours
[03:22:16] <expatriate> and then you're like "what the fuck am I doing right now" and drop it
[03:22:19] <Vulpixbrew> see I loved my desert spawn I hade a Giant castle

[21:34:11] <Cel> maybe you could go tank for that boss
