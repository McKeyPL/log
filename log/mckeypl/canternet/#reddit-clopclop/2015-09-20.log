[03:14:17] <Katiepony> I was just thinking about popcorn and brought it up :3
[03:14:45] <Katiepony> Maybe it's 'cause we heavily pre-season our popcorn or something? o:
[03:14:52] * Vulpixbrew licks the Katiepony before pouncing the Squirrelly and kissing her again
[03:16:11] <Katiepony> In North America, it is traditionally served salted, often with butter or a butterlike topping, or with toffee or spices. In the United Kingdom, ready-made popcorn is available either salted or simply sweetened with sugar.
[03:16:43] <Vulpixbrew> England is weird
[03:16:57] <Squirrelly> SUGAR?!
[03:17:00] <Katiepony> Most cinemas offer sweet or salted popcorn
[03:17:04] <Squirrelly> That sounds delicious...
[03:17:06] <Katiepony> And I think sweet is far more popular
[03:17:14] <Katiepony> I've started to prefer salted, though.
[03:17:26] <plushie_pegasus> Yuck! sugar on popcorn
[03:17:30] <Squirrelly> Squirrels like sugar...
[03:17:34] <Squirrelly> I LOVE sugar

[03:17:36] * Vulpixbrew wants to try suger popcorn now
[03:17:38] <Squirrelly> :D
[03:17:50] <Katiepony> Actually, I prefer a mixture of sweet and salted >œâ>
[03:18:05] <Katiepony> They don't do sugar popcorn over there? o:
[03:18:11] <Vulpixbrew> I havent seen it
[03:18:18] <weisey> well
[03:18:22] <weisey> they do kettlecorn
[03:18:24] <weisey> but thats different
[03:18:31] <plushie_pegasus> Cheese powder is good on popcorn
[03:18:33] <Squirrelly> Kettlecorn is amazing
[03:19:43] <Katiepony> My supermarket sells bags of salt and vinegar popcorn
[03:19:53] <Vulpixbrew> ooo now that sounds yummy
[03:19:59] <Katiepony> And sour cream and chive popcorn. And BBQ popcorn.
[03:20:02] <Vulpixbrew> all this talk of popcorn is making me hungry
[03:20:03] <Katiepony> The BBQ stuff tastes weird.
[03:20:08] <Katiepony> But the others are really nice :3
[03:20:22] <weisey> see in america
[03:20:41] <weisey> we put those flavors on crisps
[03:20:54] <Katiepony> Well so do we o:
[03:21:00] <Katiepony> Or, we just import yours.
[03:21:34] <Katiepony> But recently I guess they started selling popcorn with those flavours :3
[03:21:52] <Katiepony> Unfortunately I don't think it was very popular 'cause my supermarket stopped stocking them shortly afterwards
[03:21:59] <Katiepony> I guess I was the only person that bought them
[03:22:02] <Katiepony> ... every day
[03:22:06] <Squirrelly> lol
[03:23:53] <Katiepony> The sour cream and chive pretzels are still sold, though :3

[23:21:14] <Squirrelly> Definitely doesn't make me horny
[23:21:15] <Squirrelly> At all
[23:21:22] <Squirrelly> Quite the opposite, in fact
[23:21:31] <Squirrelly> Makes my naughty bits less sensitive :(
[23:21:55] <cloppyhooves> :c
[23:22:09] <Squirrelly> Or maybe that's the lexapro
