[08:23:16] <iamalion> it happens
[08:23:17] <iamalion> no matter how many people I give my snapchat to no one sends me sexy pics
[08:24:14] <Quinn> I dont do that because it's easy to save stuff on snapchat
[08:24:34] <iamalion> back in the old days we would send naughty pics on msn and expect them to be saved
[08:24:36] <iamalion> i hate snapchat
[08:24:41] <iamalion> low res pics that cant be saved
[08:24:44] <iamalion> fucking useless -_-
[08:24:50] <cloppyhooves> :(
[08:24:52] <Quinn> you can save them
[08:24:55] <Quinn> that's the whole issue >_>
[08:24:57] <iamalion> I know that
[08:25:09] <iamalion> there are many apps out there for it
[08:25:20] <iamalion> fwb and I used to just email each other the full res pics from cameras
[08:25:29] <iamalion> we still have each others too
[08:25:30] <Quinn> or install phantom and just save them straight from snapchat
[08:25:32] <iamalion> i dont get what the teal is
[08:25:41] <iamalion> the app I use for snapchat has the ability to save pics
[08:25:46] <iamalion> I dont use it though since I am too moral
[08:25:53] <iamalion> I use it to be able to use my own camera app
[08:26:00] <Quinn> my bf has a DSLR camera and he's taken some pics of himself with them and it's super hot
[08:26:09] <iamalion> exactly
[08:26:44] <Quinn> but that's my bf
[08:26:59] <Quinn> I mean I dont send anyone else nudes but if I did I wouldn't want them to save them and possibly share them
[08:28:01] <iamalion> i dont care if people save my pics
[08:28:05] <iamalion> hell id be flattered by it :o
[08:28:11] <iamalion> I know eve has a lot of my pics
[08:28:16] <Quinn> I get it but like a lot of people dont want that :s
[08:28:23] <iamalion> i like the thought that people get off to be ^///^
[08:28:24] <Quinn> I dont wanna risk them using it against me somehow or having it get out
[08:29:02] <iamalion> "oh you want to send all my friends and family pics of my dick? Rad! Maybe some of my female friends will see it and message me :D" is my take
[08:29:03] <iamalion> ah well

[08:29:14] <Quinn> yup
