[17:22:00] <Wolfy> Hiya Katie!
[17:22:03] <Wolfy> Yeah
[17:22:15] <Frosty> Rowdy got rekt.
[17:22:19] <Wolfy> Stuff escalated real fast in R2
[17:22:35] <Wolfy> She got destroyed
[17:23:13] <Frosty> I didn't care who won at first, but when Ronda didn't bump gloves, I was immediatly for Holm
[17:23:59] <Wolfy> Ronda was very uncharacteristic yesterday
[17:24:25] <Wolfy> Usually she's 300 like the Romans but now she was very rude
[17:25:02] <Wolfy> Also flipping out after touching Holm's fist to her face

[17:30:35] <Wolfy> It's very crumbly
[17:30:40] <Wolfy> But very soft
[17:30:53] <Wolfy> Betty cocker type stuff
[17:30:55] <Katiepony> I never really understood red velvet o:
[17:30:58] <Katiepony> Why is it red?
[17:32:09] <Wolfy> I unno
[17:32:17] <Wolfy> Better red than bread

[17:37:32] <Wolfy> :>
[17:38:03] * Katiepony licks her paw clean
[17:39:17] <Frosty> Yeah, I think the title and celebrity status has really gotten to her ever since she won it.
[17:39:35] * Wolfy bites lip, staring intently
[17:39:45] <Wolfy> I also love Holm's reaction after winning
[17:39:48] <Wolfy> She's so happy
[17:40:12] <Wolfy> And ronda was out cold
[17:40:17] <Katiepony> I'm surprised how much I've seen this fight discussed on reddit
[17:40:18] <Frosty> They were both crying, it was so emotional
[17:40:24] <Katiepony> I didn't expect that sport to be so popular o:
[17:40:28] <Wolfy> I got a fill in chub
[17:40:33] <Wolfy> Full on
[17:41:01] <Wolfy> UFC is really popular here because of Gunnar Nelson
[17:41:46] <Frosty> It's popular in America because we Americans love to watch people bet the crap out of each other.
[17:42:05] <Frosty> It gives everyone hard ons. Even the the chicks get lady boners.
[17:42:14] <Serene_Flow> Hence why Football is also popular.
[17:42:24] <Serene_Flow> American Football.
[17:42:25] <Katiepony> Surely not as popular as, say, football? I rarely see that discussed on reddit.
[17:42:32] <Katiepony> Reddit hates sport, usually o:
[17:42:46] <Wolfy> I got a rock hard one because I love to see that kind of power swap
[17:43:01] <Frosty> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1c2KzJbcGA This might explain that, Katie.
[17:43:03] <Wolfy> Also I like seeing chicks getting smashed but I digress
[17:45:09] <Frosty> But srsly, in Americaa I'd say football is way more popular
[17:47:19] <Wolfy> I think itll be a sad day when esports take the lead
[17:47:36] <Frosty> It wont
[17:47:40] <Frosty> Not here, anyway
[17:48:13] <Wolfy> Like. I don't watch a lot of sports but I just don't think Dota 2 falls into a sport category
[17:48:24] <Wolfy> Or other esport games for that matter
