[22:30:55] * Melon_Phone nods, looking at the ground
[22:31:34] <Evelina> What's wrong love?
[22:32:22] <Evelina> I didn't put a tag on your collar.. You aren't owned by anyone.
[22:32:33] <Melon_Phone> oh
[22:32:39] <Melon_Phone> then it's all cool 
[22:32:55] <Evelina> I just thought you'd look lovely with a collar!

[22:34:17] * Evelina rubs up against Melon_Phone happily
[22:35:59] * Melon_Phone licks
[22:36:59] * Evelina licks Melon_Phone's tongue.
[22:37:18] <Connor> But the tags are the best part they jangle when you walk
[22:37:33] <Evelina> But, Melon_Phone is a feral wolf
[22:37:46] <Evelina> He needs to hunt his prey silently.
[22:38:39] <Evelina> Sneak into their windows..
[22:38:48] <Evelina> Gently pull the sheets back.
[22:38:54] * Evelina continues fantasizing to herself.
[22:39:34] <Melon_Phone> the big bad wolf

[22:47:20] <Evelina> OH no...
[22:47:38] * Evelina looks up at the fiersome wolf holding her.
[22:47:52] <Melon_Phone> wolf spiders are dedicated parents and give young spiderlings food and piggback rides
[22:48:37] <Melon_Phone> the only spider to carry all of her eggs on her back, a true nightmare of the arachnophobe
[22:48:46] <Melon_Phone> can confirm 
[22:49:14] * Evelina whines.
[22:49:22] <Melon_Phone> on a lighter note
[22:50:01] <Melon_Phone> the Mexican wolf was held in high regard in pre Colombian Mexico, where it was considered a symbol of war and the sun 
[22:50:50] <Melon_Phone> wolf pups are born completely blind and deaf

[22:52:01] <Evelina> OOhhh, cuttee.
[22:52:49] * Evelina flips her ears.
[22:53:01] <Melon_Phone> a bit on the weird side but apparently the piss of a maned wolf smells like marijuana 
[22:53:05] <Evelina> Wat
[22:53:23] <Evelina> Mr Melon_Phone , can I rest my head on your paws..

[22:53:45] <Melon_Phone> sure!
[22:54:14] * Evelina rests her head gently, snoozing.
