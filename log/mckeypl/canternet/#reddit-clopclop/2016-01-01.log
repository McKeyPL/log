[12:02:54] <Wolfy> Gotta rub it to tune the frequency
[12:02:54] <Cyan_Spark> Ah

[12:05:19] <Wolfy> Audible audio is between 20Hz and 20kHz
[12:05:53] <diny> and I might be able to get upto 7Hz if Im really going for it

[12:06:11] <Cyan_Spark> Nah, just clench your muscles and vibrate your hand :P
[12:06:14] <Wolfy> Pff that's barely more than a vibration
[12:06:41] <Wolfy> Get a machine and overclock it to 20000 strokes per second

[12:10:50] * Cyan_Spark coughs. "Frenular delta, if you want the scientific term."
[12:11:32] <Cyan_Spark> But I dunno, the physical stimulation is not as strong as using a hand 
[12:11:38] <diny> I just remembered I have access to on of them tonight too
[12:11:56] <Cyan_Spark> But it's a new sensation, so perhaps the novelty of it is erotic enough
[12:12:13] <diny> yeah
[12:12:21] <Cyan_Spark> Your showerheads are not detachable, diny?
[12:12:23] <Cyan_Spark> Shucks
[12:12:36] <Wolfy> Get a button vibe!
[12:12:39] <diny> I not at my normal place
[12:12:51] <Cyan_Spark> Mm, and stick it to your dick :3
[12:12:54] <Wolfy> Tie it around your head
[12:12:59] <Cyan_Spark> At the special place
[12:13:07] <Wolfy> And let it buzz while you go about your day
[12:13:12] <Cyan_Spark> You've done that?
[12:13:14] <diny> so tonight going to be a little treat, if I can handle another wank
[12:13:26] <Wolfy> Accidentally drop the remote in the supermarket
[12:13:43] <Cyan_Spark> Actually, it's gonna be a bit tricky to orgasm if you've already done so, diny
[12:13:48] <Cyan_Spark> Stimulation's a bit light
[12:13:48] <Wolfy> Someone picks it up and starts messing with it
[12:13:51] <Wolfy> Profit
[12:15:18] <Wolfy> It's time to work on your anal orgasms
[12:15:56] <diny> yeah, that what I normal stimulate with showerheads

[12:18:06] <diny> heh
[12:18:28] <Cyan_Spark> Is that what you do?~
[12:19:16] <Wolfy> Sex in the shower is the most awkward thing ever
[12:19:19] <diny> me? no, I like never masturbate in the shower
[12:20:30] <Cyan_Spark> Eh? What do you 'normally stimulate with showerheads' then?
[12:21:37] <diny> but if I am horny, and I do on the odd chance have access to a detachable shower head, I have once before just positioned it to blow water around my balls
[12:21:51] <diny> from below
[12:22:02] <Cyan_Spark> Ah
[12:22:05] <Wolfy> Foreplay!
[12:22:16] <diny> like you said, the novelty wears off pretty quickly though
