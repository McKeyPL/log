[06:47:37] * Futashy looks innocent
[06:47:55] <Toxotis> a little bit
[06:48:34] <IceFlurries> Amber: lol. Well...just curious, how does that feel? using that fake cum stuff?
[06:49:10] <Amber> It kinda depends how, err, 'prepared' I am beforehand
[06:49:47] <IceFlurries> o.o
[06:49:50] <IceFlurries> how so? 
[06:49:55] * IceFlurries is analytical in his curiosity
[06:50:31] * Toxotis is currently being pinned down so all blame is invalid 
[06:50:31] <Toxotis> :P
[06:50:35] * Futashy giggles
[06:50:43] <Amber> Or well, I mean using it as a lube, it either makes me go from 'not wet' to just right or from 'already wet' to 'too slippy'
[06:50:50] <Futashy> i do like having a good, pinned Toxotis....
[06:50:53] * Futashy winks
[06:51:04] <Amber> Using it from the cumtube... well, it feels like a fuckin' great load <3
[06:51:43] <Toxotis> I've never tried it but that sounds hot 
[06:52:00] <Futashy> ^
[06:52:48] <Amber> Especially since I can basically say "Moar" and jsut pump more of the cumlube in
[06:52:54] * Amber ran out fast
[06:53:33] * Futashy giggles
[06:53:39] <Toxotis> Ya i would want like a gallon
[06:53:43] <Futashy> 'more', 'moooore', 'moooooore!'
[06:54:03] <Toxotis> Just to see what that much would feel like
[06:54:17] <Futashy> your thighs and ass would be soaked
[06:54:17] <IceFlurries> Amber: ...you use it as lube eh? O_o I'd think it'd be more for "effect" than "function"
[06:54:28] <Amber> I dont normally
[06:54:43] <Amber> Unless I'm just for some weird reason not wet beforehand
[06:54:49] <Amber> Which happened like twice?
[06:55:14] <Squirrelly> I....would definitely use a LOT of it

[06:58:37] <IceFlurries> Amber: why?
[06:58:39] <cloppyhooves> This is again an ironic statement for me, but still x3
[06:58:43] <Toxotis> Creampie is the best kind of pie
[06:59:03] <cloppyhooves> Have you ever had chocolate mousse pie with oreo crust?
[06:59:07] <cloppyhooves> Hard to compete with that kind of pie
[06:59:18] <Amber> IceFlurries: It just feels nice to get pumped with something thick and creamy <3
[06:59:32] <Amber> lol cloppy
[06:59:40] <Amber> I prefer pumpkin pie myself :p
[06:59:58] <cloppyhooves> That's also good :3

[07:05:11] <IceFlurries> Amber: haha fun eh?
[07:05:23] <Amber> Only worth if you're going for the "Pouring down your throat" feeling

[07:59:36] <Wolfie> fish for lunch eh? 
[07:59:47] <Amber> Futashy: Since you were so interested before, thought I'd let you know the knot was nice and snug for a good while of the bouncing :p
[08:00:12] * Futashy blushes a bright pink
[08:00:28] <Quinn> lol cloppyhooves 
[08:01:03] <IceFlurries> Amber: what's the knot feel like?
[08:01:06] <IceFlurries> why is it so good?
[08:01:15] <IceFlurries> what about that feeling is good anyway?
[08:01:46] <Amber> That's... surprisingly hard to answer, the why bit anyway o.o
[08:02:25] <Amber> Girth generally feels better for me, and so does not-constant girth, that's basically what the knot it
[08:02:27] <Amber> is*
[08:02:54] <weisey>  ASSDICK
[08:02:55] <weisey> That is all.
[08:03:05] <Quinn> never used a knot, but
[08:03:07] <Amber> Then there's some kinda mentality-stuff involved 
[08:03:11] <Quinn> being filled is a good filling :3
[08:03:14] <Amber> ^
[08:03:16] <Quinn> feeling*
[08:03:59] <Giggles> It sounds fun :O
[08:04:15] <Giggles> Oh my god!
[08:04:37] <Amber> omg?
[08:04:47] <Wolfie> amg
[08:04:58] <Giggles> I have this external phone battery and for some bloody reason the way it "alerts" you that it's charged is to make this uite yet insufferable high pithed beeping.
[08:05:20] <Amber> xD
[08:05:20] <Giggles> It's just high pithed enough and quiet enough to make you think you're imagingin it or it's coming from really far away outside.
[08:05:45] <Giggles> I don't even notice it until it starts giving me a headache
[08:05:50] * Quinn noms on her dildo
[08:06:02] <Wolfie> http://i.imgur.com/urQEGp3.jpg >//> 
[08:06:13] <IceFlurries> Amber: ahh...okay. makes sense I guess :) just always...pondered, wondered, and thought about what the mentality stuff is for women "being filled" and whatnot...
[08:06:22] <Quinn> you should try it flame :D
[08:06:26] <Futashy> off to sleeps for me
[08:06:28] * Futashy yawns

[08:07:06] <IceFlurries> but...1) I'm alone and no one to experiment with, and 2) it isn't TOO appealing to me
[08:07:15] <IceFlurries> brb
[08:07:26] <Quinn> IceFlurries: you got amazon, that's all you need to find out if you like it or not :3
[08:08:06] <Amber> If I had the munnies I'd probably consider sending yeh a good toy to try out :p
[08:08:58] <Giggles> Well that and like 15-20 dollars and a postal address
[08:09:16] <Quinn> that too o:
[08:09:18] <Amber> yup
[08:09:21] <Amber> rip
[08:09:44] <Amber> Too much stuff, so sorry Flame, Amber shan't be treating you to a dick this day xD
[08:10:03] <Giggles> That's what always stops me. 15 dollars? for sexual satisfation? What am I made of cash?
[08:10:19] <Amber> Wait what costs the 15$
[08:10:35] <Quinn> oh also you'll  want lube 
[08:10:37] <Amber> Or is that just posta
[08:10:44] <Amber> yeeeaaah
[08:10:45] <Wolfie> shipping?
[08:10:45] <Giggles> the shittiest dildo money can buy. :O
[08:10:46] <Quinn> I recommend bad dragon cum lube :3
[08:10:46] <Amber> lube is nice
[08:10:50] <Amber> xD
[08:10:57] <Quinn> also condoms 
[08:11:06] <IceFlurries> Quinn: I live with parents :D lol not happening
[08:11:10] <Amber> Wait why condoms
[08:11:11] <Quinn> :c
[08:11:20] <Quinn> Amber: just makes things more sanitary 
[08:11:29] <Giggles> Yeah I almost included a way to get mail without people snooping in it on my list.
[08:11:35] <plushie_pegasus> A hot Build a Bear MLP plush will cost about $15-$25
[08:11:47] <Amber> But you cant get dem Bad-Dragon creampies with those xP
[08:11:53] <Quinn> go to a sex shop and buy one in person and sneak it into your room, if you  still live with parents
[08:12:10] * IceFlurries watches StarWArs Rebels Seige of Lothal
[08:12:35] * Giggles watches Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
[08:12:39] <IceFlurries> Amber: I'm a dork, nerd, socially awkward, never dated, only had one close female friend...yeah...am 21 too and been in community college 3 years
[08:13:04] <Amber> Yer point being? :p
[08:13:13] <Giggles> Meh sounds like someone I know.
[08:14:15] <Wolfie> fit the perfect description for a prescription of one dildo
[08:14:21] <Wolfie> trust me I'm a doctor
[08:14:24] <Quinn> ^
[08:14:28] <Quinn> it'll only do ya good :
[08:14:29] <Quinn> :3
[08:14:36] <Amber> xD
[08:14:42] <Amber> Pretty much :p
[08:14:52] <Amber> Or a penetratable
[08:14:57] <Amber> One of the two :p
[08:15:01] <Quinn> both :3
[08:15:23] <Quinn> suction cup the dildo under you and ride it while using the penetrateable  
[08:15:30] <Wolfie> mmm
[08:15:36] <Amber> SEE GUYS DO HAVE THE TOY LIFE BETTER
[08:15:57] <Quinn> a girl could have a vibrator + dildo
[08:16:06] * Amber wishes she knew what it was like to get to cum as a guy >:T
[08:16:07] <Quinn> or a million other combos
[08:16:09] <Wolfie> well girls can like have the hitachi
[08:16:27] <Amber> I mean technically a guy can have vibe+dildo
[08:16:48] <Wolfie> under the head but I can't get off to that
[08:16:58] <Amber> The only thing guys cant really do that girls can is three holes instead of two 
[08:17:07] <Amber> But they get a cock D:
[08:17:31] <Wolfie> three holes? 
[08:17:40] <Quinn> mouth, pussy, butt
[08:17:46] <Wolfie> ah
[08:17:50] <Amber> Three as in pussy/mouth/ass vs /mouth/ass
[08:17:50] <IceFlurries> Amber: I'm just...alone. and that isn't necessarily true...guys don't have the whole "experience" of sex, at least as far as I can tell, and don't have the "be fucked" or "made love to" or "taken" feelings as women do, nor have as pervasive of an orgasm as women
[08:17:54] * Wolfie licks his lips
[08:17:55] <IceFlurries> :/
[08:18:14] <IceFlurries> meh
[08:18:17] * IceFlurries stops
[08:18:24] <Quinn> again I really feel like that depends on the person
[08:18:26] <RNGsus> as a sub male id love to have a vagina
[08:18:29] <Quinn> sex is what you make of it
[08:18:35] <Amber> ^
[08:19:05] <Quinn> pretty innacurate to say that men can't have the "made love to" or "be fucked" feeling :P
[08:19:09] <Giggles> Yeah, I feel pretty "taken" by my girlfriend. :I
[08:19:29] <Wolfie> I'd like to try that one day
[08:19:58] <Wolfie> currently I'm the Dom in the bedroom 
[08:20:08] <Quinn> I'm a total subby <3
[08:20:15] <Amber> Sub here
[08:20:30] <Quinn> my bf is very manly (or he thinks he is lol)
[08:20:33] <cloppyhooves> Switchyhooves :3
[08:20:33] * Wolfie wags his tail
[08:20:49] <plushie_pegasus> I am emberased to say it, but sometimes my Trixie and Twilight plushies "Yiff" me with their horns  :$
[08:20:56] <Amber> I was a switch once until I figured out I'm just very bad at playing dom
[08:21:06] <Quinn> being dom feels wrong to me :c
[08:21:12] <Wolfie> I think I'd make a good switch
[08:21:20] <Wolfie> I can turn on lights pretty good 
[08:21:23] <Amber> When I'm dom I feel like I dont know what to do :p
[08:21:56] <weisey> I am a terrible dom
[08:21:59] * Wolfie flicks his switch, watching his nose glow on and off
[08:22:04] <weisey> I can top
[08:22:08] <weisey> But I can't dom
[08:22:11] <Quinn> I like to have my partner control me
[08:23:07] <Amber> ^
[08:23:32] <Quinn> I like to feel like he's using my body how he wants it
[08:23:34] <Quinn> :3
[08:24:06] <Giggles> Not knowing what to do is just inexperience, domming is harder than subbing because you have to make decisions. It really just takes practice and you can do anything.
[08:24:31] <Quinn> yea maybe I'm just lazy? lol
[08:25:09] <Amber> I have chronic bad-at-deciding-ness
[08:25:25] * Wolfie scritches self
[08:25:37] <Giggles> Me too atually I don't really like domming much it's hard and makes me nervous. :\
[08:25:57] * Quinn doesn't mind herself being pushed around on the bed a little bit
[08:26:12] <cloppyhooves> For the Doms: Bratty subs: Yay or nay
[08:26:24] <Giggles> I'd rather be pushed around on the bed a lot. ;P
[08:26:26] <plushie_pegasus> Tenderheart Doms me sometimes
[08:26:31] <Wolfie> bratty? 
[08:26:32] <weisey> Ohlawdplsnoexceptiamone
[08:26:44] <cloppyhooves> And for the subs too, I suppose :o
[08:26:52] <cloppyhooves> Do y'all like being bratty or no?
[08:26:52] <Quinn> what do you mean by bratty? D:
[08:26:58] <cloppyhooves> Bratty means
[08:27:01] <cloppyhooves> "Get on your knees"
[08:27:05] <cloppyhooves> "Make me >:3"
[08:27:22] <cloppyhooves> Basically, not obedient (to make the dom dom harder)
[08:27:24] <Wolfie> I'd get a bit annoyed 
[08:27:27] <Quinn> im not that kinda person really
[08:27:31] <cloppyhooves> Some people don't like it
[08:27:32] <cloppyhooves> Some do
[08:27:34] <Wolfie> get a little rough maybe? 
[08:27:36] <Amber> Psh, nah man he says to get on my knees and his dick's in my mouth
[08:27:45] <cloppyhooves> x3
[08:27:45] <Quinn> I don't like anyone being verbally rough
[08:27:47] <weisey> I am totally a "make me >:3" person
[08:28:02] <Quinn> I just like having him kinda move me where he wants me
[08:28:02] <Giggles> I go back and forth on that.
[08:28:03] <Amber> That being said I like my doms to be rough with me
[08:29:25] <Wolfie> I don't wanna hurt anyone, even if they want me to make them do stuff 
[08:29:28] <Quinn> although sometimes I like to do cowgirl, that lets me be in control  mostly but still be subby
[08:29:42] <Wolfie> I'm afraid that I might go waay overboard
[08:29:59] <Amber> Same, Quinn
[08:30:28] <Quinn> and I can lean and run my hands over his chest
[08:30:37] <Wolfie> mm
