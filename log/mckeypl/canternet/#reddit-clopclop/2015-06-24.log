[04:52:57] <Quinn> D:
[04:53:34] <Flame> Idea: why don't we send a rover or even anything with a camera into one of the caves/sinkholes on Mars?
[04:53:34] <Flame> hiya Quinn :D
[04:53:34] <Quinn> hiya Flame 
[04:54:36] <Vulpixbrew> Flame, the possiblity of a lack of signal could result in the loss of a rover that and it takes 10 minuites to get a broadcast to mars
[04:55:29] <Flame> Vulpixbrew: well, I'm talking about something that'd perhaps just sit in the sinkhole and take panoramic, hi-res pictures...and perhaps use a nearby rover as intermediary communication
[04:56:00] <Quinn> also because rovers are hella expensive
[04:56:09] <Flame> screw the money, I have rules...wait...
[04:56:18] <Quinn> the price to put on in there is probably not worth whatever it will take picturres of
[04:58:23] <Vulpixbrew> Flame nasa has an extremely limited budget
[04:58:23] <Flame> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVbie0Gk6u8 xD
[04:58:23] <Vulpixbrew> pisses me off how small it is
[04:58:23] <Flame> I know...I was just thinking that seeing underground could be great...
[04:58:23] <Flame> perhaps
[04:58:23] <Flame> FOSILS!
[04:58:23] <Flame> or cave-lizard men
[04:58:47] <Vulpixbrew> 18,010 million dollars
[04:58:58] <Vulpixbrew> would be cool to see but wont happen for a long while

[06:57:52] <Flame> Princesss1uttershy: SGDQ?
[06:57:55] <PinkPetals> I like mp3s
[06:57:56] <Giggles> Das so crazy. They were terrible. :O
[06:57:59] <PinkPetals> and mp4s
[06:58:08] <PinkPetals> they are convenient!
[06:58:09] <Princesss1uttershy> Flame, Summer Games Done Quick
[06:58:11] <Flame> PinkPetals: :| no
[06:58:16] <PinkPetals> I can just copy them to my phone wirelessly
[06:58:17] <Quinn> something is so satisfying about pushing the cassette tape in 
[06:58:20] <Ponypervert> I prefer non-anthro foals though
[06:58:22] <Flame> PinkPetals: FLAC and webm or ogg theora FTW
[06:58:25] <Princesss1uttershy> PinkPetals, Ever listen to vinyl?
[06:58:31] <PinkPetals> Princesss1uttershy: no
[06:58:34] <Vulpixbrew> cassette? nah dog we go 8 track
[06:58:40] <PinkPetals> I got some free speaker equipment
[06:58:51] <PinkPetals> and it came with a turntable and a casette deck
[06:58:52] <Princesss1uttershy> I never had a working 8 track player
[06:58:55] <PinkPetals> and a cdplayer
[06:59:02] <PinkPetals> that cdplayer sucked butts though
[06:59:11] <PinkPetals> cuz it was from the 80s
[06:59:12] <Quinn> I had the type of cassette player in my car where you only have to put in the cassette a little bit, and it grabs it from you and pulls it in
[06:59:12] <weisey> Holy shit
[06:59:15] <Quinn> it  was sooo satisfying
[06:59:33] <PinkPetals> the damn thing is a decade older than I am
[06:59:34] <Princesss1uttershy> I love vinyl
[06:59:49] <weisey> The end of Dishonored is so fucking dark
[06:59:51] <weisey> Holy 
[06:59:52] <PinkPetals> I kept the amplifier part and hooked my laptop up to it
[06:59:56] <weisey> Fuckin shit
[07:00:00] <plushie_pegasus> Back in the 70's i had a 8 track recorder
[07:00:03] <Quinn> weisey no spoilers D:
[07:00:04] <Flame> PinkPetals: use flac D:
[07:00:05] <Flame> plz
[07:00:06] <Flame> jk
[07:00:10] <Flame> well, semi jk :P
[07:00:17] <Princesss1uttershy> weisey, I second what Quinn says
[07:00:19] <PinkPetals> I like being able to copy stuff to my phone, lol
[07:00:29] <weisey> Though
[07:00:36] <weisey> I was pretty ruthless 
[07:00:42] <Quinn> yiff http://i.imgur.com/rUo9vda.jpg
[07:00:46] <Giggles> Yeah conenient file types are great.
[07:00:48] <weisey> I killed a lot instead of just doing stealth
[07:00:54] <PinkPetals> I love those 15 inch speakers
[07:01:00] <PinkPetals> the vibrations feel especially lovely

[07:01:32] <Quinn> speaking of, iOS 8.3 jailbreak today! I can finally add mp3 files to music app without itunes :D
[07:01:37] <Quinn> yay they left
[07:01:39] <Flame> :P
[07:01:45] <Flame> Quinn: why no alac?

[07:02:06] <Quinn> Flame: because it's hard to pirate songs in alac format :s
[07:02:17] <Flame> D:
[07:02:23] <PinkPetals> people can't even tell the difference between flac and mp3 according to google
[07:02:24] <Flame> ffmpeg is your friend ;3
[07:02:29] <weisey> Hmm
[07:02:33] <Quinn> mp3skull though
[07:02:35] <Flame> PinkPetals: depends on the equipment
[07:02:57] <weisey> I think I'm gonna go for a no kill no detections run
[07:02:57] <Quinn> like if I spent $0.99 per song I listen to, I'd not have any money for food every month D:
[07:02:58] <PinkPetals> you would need really expensive stuff
[07:03:02] <Flame> PinkPetals: I also like to support FLOSS software :P at least opensource and openstandards too
[07:03:06] <Giggles> Yeah I don't bother with anything besides deent quality Mp3s beause I use 9.99 headphones exclusively.
[07:03:09] <Princesss1uttershy> https://youtu.be/VoYlv1QVaDw?t=32s <- this is the first vinyl record I vever listened to ^-^

[07:03:14] <PinkPetals> you sound ideological
[07:03:23] <MysteryFluttershyFan> Hi
[07:03:27] <PinkPetals> hi MysteryFluttershyFan :)
[07:03:34] <Giggles> Hi Mystery
[07:03:43] <MysteryFluttershyFan> Any of you remember me?
[07:03:45] <Flame> IP addresses are awesome
[07:03:49] <Flame> :|
[07:03:51] <Quinn> where is FineLine D:
[07:03:52] <Princesss1uttershy> MysteryFluttershyFan, I do
[07:03:58] <PinkPetals> I am new MysteryFluttershyFan 
[07:04:06] <Princesss1uttershy> You wrote my little slave
[07:04:07] <PinkPetals> its nice to meet you :)
[07:04:10] <Flame> PinkPetals: I actually ahve some ideological standards. I try to keep all my music in OGG format at least.
[07:04:16] <MysteryFluttershyFan> I remember you too Princess.
[07:04:20] <Princesss1uttershy> ^-^
[07:04:23] * Princesss1uttershy kisses you
[07:04:25] <Flame> But with youtube, mp4 is better for downloading with youtube-dl...esp for bandwidth.
[07:04:34] <MysteryFluttershyFan> I think I tried that first Minecraft server, lol
[07:04:35] <PinkPetals> I like using the latest version of lame to dub some quick mp3s with foobar2k
[07:04:40] <Quinn> I feel like it's pointless downloading high quality audio files when you're using shitty headphones
[07:04:46] <PinkPetals> ^
[07:04:48] <PinkPetals> exactly
[07:04:56] <PinkPetals> even on my 15 inch speakers its pointless
[07:04:56] * Flame has decent speakers :P
[07:05:10] <Giggles> It pretty much is. but if you ever plan on getting good speakers it makes sense.
[07:05:13] <Quinn> I'd be surprised if you could tell them apart on speakers
[07:05:35] <PinkPetals> aac at a decent bitrate is impossible to distinguish
[07:05:52] <iam[a]lion> decent dickrate
[07:05:57] <Flame> I'm just saying D: Ogg for me ;3
[07:06:04] <Quinn> you can give me a decent dickrate ;3
[07:06:08] <Princesss1uttershy> I just use the mp3s I get from bandcamp
[07:06:09] <PinkPetals> isnt aac better than ogg
[07:06:26] <MysteryFluttershyFan> I have a dilemma I want advice on 
[07:06:36] <Quinn> sure o:
[07:06:45] <MysteryFluttershyFan> You should all know by now I come here for selfish reasons lol
[07:07:02] <Quinn> I don't think i've met you before, so no :o
[07:07:40] <MysteryFluttershyFan> Just gonna finish this omegle chat first.
[07:07:50] <MysteryFluttershyFan> Sorry it just got interesting
[07:07:59] <Princesss1uttershy> I met you on omegle one night lol
[07:08:17] <Princesss1uttershy> you asked for a good clopfic and I recommended MLS 
[07:08:45] <MysteryFluttershyFan> Really?
[07:08:51] <MysteryFluttershyFan> I wrote that.
[07:08:51] <Princesss1uttershy> Yeah 
[07:08:57] <Princesss1uttershy> it was a long time ago
[07:09:03] <Princesss1uttershy> I know you did <3
[07:09:09] <Giggles> Haha, that's great
[07:09:19] <Flame> PinkPetals: it depends. Ogg can have usually up to ~512kbps bitrate. And, for me, it's a principle of the think
[07:09:38] <Princesss1uttershy> and you did play on that first MC server we had I remember building something with you
[07:09:44] <Giggles> because ogg is on the side of good?
[07:09:49] <PinkPetals> I wouldn't use above 200 kbps
[07:09:58] <PinkPetals> it defeats the purpose of a lossy codec
