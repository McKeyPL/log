[03:53:22] <expatriate> 5 guys is way overpriced
[03:54:18] <expatriate> or use my family's secret burger recipe and have the best burger of your life that is also the cheapest burger of your life
[03:56:02] <cloppyhooves> Can I have that secret family recipe? :3
[03:56:17] <Toxotis> ^
[03:56:20] <expatriate> of course not
[03:56:25] <Vulpixbrew> best burger I had in my life was in Ohio
[03:56:45] <expatriate> I think it just seemed really good because you were in Ohio and everything else was just so terrible
[03:57:06] <Katiepony> Got any family secret Pizza recipes? o:
[03:57:23] <expatriate> I don't know if I can call them family recipes yet because I made them
[03:57:39] <Vulpixbrew> (then again I was fresh out of basic and crap food soooooooooo)
[03:57:50] <Vulpixbrew> (my taste buds may have been offf)
[03:58:46] <expatriate> but I am willing to share my work in progress
[03:58:56] <expatriate> once it's perfected I'll be keeping it closer to the chest
[03:58:57] <expatriate> http://pastebin.com/ntjEME1p
[04:00:00] <expatriate> ps that's like 7000 calories worth of pizza
[04:01:03] <Toxotis> That's a lot of pizza...
[04:01:43] <Vulpixbrew> ooooo
[04:02:08] <thaostra> Any burger is cheap if you make it yourself and you paid for the ingredients beforehand
[04:03:02] <Katiepony> Our secret family recipes are buying cheap, horrible food because we're poor :3
[04:09:42] <Giggles> Awesome! :D

[06:25:03] <samonuh> Which was like the last year of the war
[06:25:09] <Princesssluttershy> and the germans had a really good plan that probably would have worked if the guy who came up with it didn't die
[06:26:00] <Princesssluttershy> and all I know about ww2 is that Hitler did somethign
[06:26:08] <Princesssluttershy> and europe got mad at them

[17:15:44] <Cel> feq ze updates
[17:19:05] <TheRedOne> I dunno I feel these may be somewhat important
[17:19:56] <TheRedOne> blindows claims it is, despite apparently some weird version conflict going on
[17:20:26] <TheRedOne> I did some searching, and now I gotta repair the update repair tool update repairer tool update
[17:21:14] <TheRedOne> I'm waiting for the prompt telling me to sacrifice a goat to six hundred black cats
[17:22:57] <TheRedOne> but then I guess even electrons have office hours
[17:23:51] * Cel shrugs
[17:25:11] <TheRedOne> of course I can't just look up what the update is and decide whether or not I'll need it. and if I don't install it it will prolly constitute gross negligence if shit happens and it turns out I didn't update the nullmodem cable driver
[17:25:22] <TheRedOne> because that's what people use
[17:26:08] <TheRedOne> it's the third consecutive day of me whining about this machine
[17:26:39] <Cel> and all that is missing is the right timezone^^
[17:26:55] <TheRedOne> timezone?
[17:29:15] <Cel> well maybe your timezone is set to CDT instead of CET, but the clock is CET so windows thinks you're a time traveller^^
[17:30:25] <TheRedOne> I hope it's nothing like that
[17:31:15] <TheRedOne> because seriously, I can just set my year as 1632 if I so desire, so my timestamp shouldn't really factor in
[17:31:16] <Cel> you can always go back to sacrificing a goat
[17:31:27] <TheRedOne> I ain't got no goats
[17:31:31] <Cel> :D
[17:31:54] <TheRedOne> and I'm not sure the nearest farmers are gonna be appreciative
[17:32:05] <TheRedOne> Unless I buy it
[17:32:20] <TheRedOne> but then a goat may be more expensive than a new computer
[17:32:27] <TheRedOne> ...actually...
[17:32:34] <Cel> well
[17:32:39] <TheRedOne> I do wonder
[17:34:31] <TheRedOne> OMC it appears to be working
[17:34:46] <TheRedOne> at least she initialised the update
