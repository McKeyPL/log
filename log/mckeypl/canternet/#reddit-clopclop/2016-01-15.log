[04:41:08] <Moka> Calculating taxes >_>
[04:41:13] <Chiv> Ooch
[04:41:29] <plushie_pegasus> Use Turbo tax 
[04:41:32] <expatriate> my roommate is having a girl over
[04:41:39] <expatriate> so I'm stuck in my room all night
[04:41:41] * Chiv reaches back and gives Moka a sympathizing pat on the shoulder

[04:44:12] <Moka> But I don't have any W-2s back yet, so I'm just fantasizing about the glorious federal refund I'm going to get from spending five figures on relocating to CA :I
[04:44:21] <Moka> expatriate why are you stuck in your room all night
[04:45:37] <Moka> sounds frustrating D:
[04:45:46] <expatriate> because if I come out she'll see how beautiful I am and want to date me instead of him :D

[04:46:51] <expatriate> butt naked

[04:47:31] <expatriate> which is especially funny because the bathroom is away from the living room

[07:19:58] <Araiya> If I hadn't managed to get sick this week, I was considering something like a two day excursion across the border into Canada.
[07:21:26] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[07:21:30] <Flame> Araiya: :o
[07:21:47] <Flame> expatriate: yeah...we hit major turbulence coming into Sac two days ago...was insane.
[07:22:54] <Moka> sacramento?
[07:22:56] <expatriate> I know in my head that statistically it's extremely safe, and modern planes in the US very rarely crash
[07:23:16] <expatriate> but when there's bad turbulence
[07:23:20] <expatriate> that doesn't help much
[07:23:32] <Moka> if it helps
[07:23:37] <Moka> turbulence has never caused a crash
[07:23:48] <iamalion> the number of sata cables IS TOO DAMN HIGH http://img.superunicorn.net/i/hohkrd.jpg
[07:24:37] <Chiv> scariest landing i ever had was coming into San Fran
[07:24:45] <Chiv> pilot took us SO LOW to the water on landing
[07:25:06] <Chiv> my mother was even hugging me because she was slightly worried XD
[07:25:24] <Moka> that's pretty cool >.>
[07:26:14] <Chiv> In hindsight the pilot made a pretty slick landing, but holy shit was it nervewracking at the time
[07:26:22] <expatriate> oh yeah, flying into SFO is fun :)
[07:26:45] <Moka> urgh I do not like SFO at all
[07:26:49] <Moka> SJC is so much nicer >..>
[07:26:49] <Flame> Moka: yes, sac
[07:27:16] <Moka> neat
[07:27:21] <Flame> I'm fine with flying :) just like trains and enjoy it :3
[07:27:36] <Chiv> I'll agree with that one, Moka
[07:27:44] <Flame> I don't think I'll get into a public transit job, but would be interesting nonetheless
[07:27:52] <Chiv> while we were technically "closer" to SFO, the traffic alone....ugh
[07:28:18] <Moka> yeah.
[07:28:22] <Moka> i wonder if OAK is any good.
[07:30:59] <Frosty> I already slept today, but I don't start work for another 6 hours.
[07:32:57] <Flame> Chiv: wait till HSR is in :3 lol. Idk. I personally think linking public transit systems is the way to go (ex: Denver RTD is putting in commuter rail to their airport FINALLY. 10$ airport - downtown)
[07:33:28] <Chiv> Well, i'm not in cali anymore, so I don't have to worry about it
[07:33:30] <Chiv> Woo O'hare!
[07:33:37] <Chiv> Though screw United/Air France :D
[07:33:49] * Chiv 's familly managed to have their luggage lost flying to Paris...
[07:34:08] * Chiv then notes they had it lost AGAIN on the flight back home. Still haven't recovered it after the second time...
[07:34:14] <Araiya> ... did they route it to Paris, TX, instead of Paris, France?
[07:34:27] <Chiv> Nope! It was via Air france, international terminal
[07:34:29] <Moka> O'Hare is so bad ><
[07:34:37] <Moka> I have never had a good experience there
[07:34:39] <Chiv> Normally, never had a problem with them
[07:34:43] <Chiv> but usually we fly american
[07:35:12] <Moka> To be fair, my last two times flying out of ORD were...
[07:35:40] <Araiya> I can't remember the last time I flew. I like it that way.
[07:35:41] <Moka> Nov 29 and Dec 27
[07:35:42] <Moka> ><
[07:35:52] <Flame> Southwest is nice o.o
[07:35:52] <expatriate> yeeeeeaaaahhhhhhh
[07:35:58] <Vulpixbrew> I love flying Flame I always get a window seat
[07:35:58] <Flame> Araiya: :o
[07:36:05] * Flame has flown a decent amount
[07:36:09] <Vulpixbrew> also i love hate Delta
[07:36:11] <Flame> Vulpixbrew: nice lol. 
[07:36:15] <Moka> I like flying a decent amount
[07:36:25] <Araiya> More accurately, I dislike flying, and that's putting it nicely.
[07:36:33] <Flame> Moka: I presume you're Californian? 
[07:36:43] <Flame> or not...yeah, not o.o
[07:36:48] <Araiya> I'm a motherbangin' unicorn. Do I look like I like flying? :P
[07:37:03] <Moka> Flame: as of Dec 4, yes
[07:37:10] <Flame> ahh :O
[07:37:13] <Moka> previously, unfortunately, Texan
[07:37:54] <Flame> ahh...texas. my semi-friend has a friend from texas. moved in with him while he's getting back on his feet so to speak.
[07:38:07] <Flame> you ride amtrak? o.o or commuter rail?
[07:38:58] <Araiya> Me? I've never had the chance to ride Amtrak for anything useful, and the only commuter rail experience I've had was in Atlanta, on MARTA.
[07:39:47] <Flame> ahh. I know nothing about MARTA O_O only a bit about Metrolink and Caltrain, just learned of ACE Rail myself, didn't even know it was a thing and I lived near-ish it
[07:40:51] <Araiya> Unless this has been fixed, the problem with Amtrak when I was in my home city was just how long it took to get there. I could actually get to ATL from TPA faster on Greyhound.
[07:42:07] <Vulpixbrew> my issue with amtrak is i have to travel2 hours away to get to them
[07:42:27] <Vulpixbrew> everytime anyone suggest getting amtrak here people throw fits
[07:42:29] <Araiya> And a quick check of Amtrak says the problem's still there. You go from Florida, up through Georgia, and keep going until you hit North Carolina, then ping-pong back to get to Atlanta.
[07:42:32] <Flame> Vulpixbrew: yeah :/ unless you have a thruway bus or commuter rail to an amtrak station, or someone to take you there...yeah
[07:42:45] <Flame> Vulpixbrew: why? :o sorry I seek knowledge.
[07:43:18] <Flame> Araiya: partially blame the circumstances: Amtrak inherited its rails from freight companies, and isn't given much to lay their own rails :/
[07:43:49] <Vulpixbrew> I live in an as backwars town that just spent 2.2 million on a building that has somany building code violiationms they almost tore it dowwn
[07:43:50] <Flame> luckily California is making high-speed rail a thing and Amtrak California will get to use it :) up to 120mph then instead of 79~mph
[07:44:03] <Flame> Vulpixbrew: facepalm sorry :/
[07:44:24] <Vulpixbrew> we ave the rail system just hissy fits
[07:44:30] <Flame> Many people here are against the HSR, but I see it as the best option all things considered :/
[07:44:44] <Moka> HSR is a fantastic idea
[07:45:18] <Flame> mhmm :3
[07:45:39] <Flame> even if no private rail company uses the tracks, amtrak can IIRC
[07:46:19] <Moka> would be nice if caltrain was faster
[07:46:29] <Moka> 2h from SF -> MV makes me sad
[07:46:37] <Araiya> I'd love to see more rail usage.
[07:47:00] <plushie_pegasus> train related  https://data.desustorage.org/mlp/image/1422/32/1422329956432.png
[07:47:05] <Moka> it'd probably be faster to fly SFO -> SJC than it is to caltrain there

[07:48:26] <Flame> Moka: caltrain si electrifying...and there is the "baby bullet"...for what it's worth
[07:48:41] <Moka> "for what it's worth" -> not much
[07:48:47] <Flame> yeah :/
[07:48:49] <Moka> unfortunately :p
[07:48:55] <Flame> but there's also security, etc
[07:49:39] <Araiya> And suddenly, I complain less about the bus system here.
[07:49:48] <Moka> The bullet actually does help a lot

[09:02:47] <Wolfy> I overslept
[09:02:56] <Wolfy> Probably missed my bu-
[09:02:58] <Wolfy> Oh wait
[09:03:07] <Wolfy> No school today
[09:03:24] * Wolfy leaps back into bed and burrows
[09:03:48] <Frosty> I stay around it because I like it. It's fimiliar and I im still starting off.
[09:05:32] <Wolfy> Only think keeping me away from SC is the price. I think it looks super cool
[09:07:19] <Princesssluttershy> Wolfy, It's only like $20
[09:07:32] <Vulpixbrew> Star Citizen?
[09:07:37] <Princesssluttershy> yeah
[09:07:43] <Princesssluttershy> I got two fully armed ships for $40
[09:07:48] <Wolfy> The ships though
[09:08:09] <Princesssluttershy> they're gonna cost in game money when the game is actually released though'
[09:08:09] * Chiv returns from sleep temporarily
[09:08:13] <Wolfy> Can you buy a ship with in game cedars
[09:08:14] <Chiv> What princess said
[09:08:18] <Princesssluttershy> you won't be able to buy them with real money
[09:08:21] <Wolfy> Aah
[09:08:25] <RubyPinch> 20 bux to get into alpha as well?
[09:08:25] <Chiv> all ships, once the game is launched, will be in game credit only
[09:08:30] <Princesssluttershy> RubyPinch, yes
[09:08:42] <Wolfy> I just remember seeing the hornet a while back being $70
[09:08:43] <Chiv> and the biggest ships cannot be bought via cash
[09:08:49] * Vulpixbrew is waiting till SC jhas more content
[09:08:50] <Chiv> hornet is an upgraded ship
[09:08:57] <Chiv> the Aurora is the base starter ship
[09:09:14] <Wolfy> Right and what if I want a different ship
[09:09:15] <Chiv> look on the website, main thing you're looking for is the access bundle
[09:09:24] <Princesssluttershy> I have an Aurora and one of the origin jump works ships
[09:09:27] <Chiv> If you want a different ship, i think there are 3 starter level bundles
[09:09:46] <Chiv> beyond that, you're either going to have to buy one now, or wait until the game launches and earn it in game then.
[09:09:58] <Wolfy> Aaaa
[09:10:04] <Chiv> for now, ship purchases are merely a funding method
[09:10:23] <Wolfy> Right
[09:10:26] <RubyPinch> do they have anything resembling a game yet that isn't a pvp arena combat thing?
[09:10:31] <Chiv> though it also serves as a way to diversify the starting player base a bit, so everybody isn't flying around all the same ships
[09:10:33] <Chiv> and yes
[09:10:45] <Chiv> Persistent universe is in alpha, though only for 1 system iirc
[09:10:57] * Chiv hasn't had a chance to try it yet though >.>
[09:11:13] <Wolfy> The videos I've seen of ED look super cool and fluid
[09:11:29] <Chiv> Have you seen the SC vids?
[09:11:31] <Wolfy> That guy who did a smuggling mission into a port undetected
[09:11:36] <Wolfy> Some yeah
[09:11:51] * Chiv thinks his favorite is still Imagine: Star Citizen
[09:12:02] <Wolfy> They look alright but I find them flashy
[09:12:19] <Vulpixbrew> ED has one big issue right now
[09:12:19] <Chiv> Kinda, yeah, they're all advertisement vids for the most part
[09:12:24] <Chiv> at least the official ones
[09:12:34] <Chiv> though they recently launched a gameplay vid iirc
[09:12:34] <Wolfy> Are they in game shots?
[09:12:37] <Chiv> yup
[09:12:39] <RubyPinch> the aurora is 45 dollars why you two lie ;-;
[09:12:40] <Vulpixbrew> its a mile wide but an inch deep
[09:13:00] <Wolfy> Damn
[09:13:27] <Chiv> last i checked it was 20-oh. Anniversary sale was the last time i looked at it >_<
[09:13:37] <Wolfy> I dunno, so far of what I've seen I prefer ED, and I don't think I'll buy either tbh
[09:14:39] <Princesssluttershy> Vulpixbrew, RIP I thought it was $20 (CAD which is way less than $20 US D:)
[09:14:43] <Chiv> can ask Ruby about that one
[09:15:16] * Chiv mostly knows what he knows about ED via Rubypinch
[09:15:35] <RubyPinch> what is the squadron thing
[09:15:56] <Princesssluttershy> Squadron is the single player campaign
[09:16:10] <RubyPinch> but you get it regarldess of whichever starter you get?
[09:16:16] <Princesssluttershy> not sure
[09:16:42] <RubyPinch> this is the worst store
[09:16:55] <Chiv> basically
[09:17:02] <Chiv> star citizen comes with Squadron 42
[09:17:11] <Chiv> currently the opposite is true as well
[09:17:26] <Chiv> eventually squadron 42 will also be sold as a seperate game
[09:17:45] <Chiv> though for the same price
[09:18:15] <Chiv> or at least, i think for the same price, that part is iffy
[09:18:15] <RubyPinch> but will it still come with when one buys SC, or does that disconnect as well?
[09:18:24] <Vulpixbrew> all I know is Im happy with my ship in ED right now
[09:18:25] <Frosty> Vlupix, maybe you can help me with something in ED.
[09:18:33] <Vulpixbrew> what you need Frosty
[09:18:38] <Frosty> A package.
[09:18:41] <Chiv> It will still come if you buy SC i believe, Rubypinch
[09:18:53] <Vulpixbrew> package?
[09:18:57] <Frosty> Its one of those missions where you gotta hold on to a package for a certain amount of time
[09:18:57] <Wolfy> I like the idea of squadron 42
[09:19:06] <RubyPinch> so will the into cost to sc raise when it splits?
[09:19:08] <Frosty> But IDK where to get the package
[09:19:28] <RubyPinch> otherwise you'd just be able to get it at 45bux after its price-rise regardless
[09:19:34] <Vulpixbrew> yeah, you have the package if you took the mission just gotta wait for you contact to show up while hanging in space
[09:19:41] <Chiv> no idea, though SC will basically only have 3 packages after
[09:20:05] <Frosty> Oh, okay. So if it says 8:45, is that 9 minutes or hours?
[09:20:13] <Vulpixbrew> minutes
[09:20:14] <Chiv> specifically the three starter ship packages
[09:20:18] <Chiv> my guess from what i've read
[09:20:42] <Vulpixbrew> just a heads up though you will be interdicted at least once, enjoy the bounty
[09:20:42] <Chiv> is that at launch, SC will be a $60 title
[09:20:45] <Frosty> Okiay, cool. Spanks. :3
[09:21:36] <Chiv> this includes both the single player campaign and the persistent universe (as the former serves as an intro into the latter, supposedly, and is what nets you your first ship)
[09:21:53] <Chiv> Squadron 42 will also be available, though, as a seperate item at a cheaper price
[09:22:22] <Wolfy> Wuhu
[09:22:27] <RubyPinch> its still only arena commander that is available right now though, right?
[09:23:30] <Chiv> no
[09:23:56] <RubyPinch> well I can't see where anything other than AC is
[09:24:06] <Chiv> they're all under download
[09:24:41] <RubyPinch> there is arena commander and "social module"
[09:24:45] <Chiv> mhm
[09:24:55] <Chiv> social module is the PU bit
[09:25:21] <RubyPinch> can you fly about in the social module?
[09:25:41] * Chiv is pretty sure that's what the "discover planetside" bit is about, though he could be wrong
[09:25:47] <RubyPinch> eh whatever stream some when you wake up

[23:18:15] <iamalion> omg. Just had a customer called in, thought his internet wasnt working. Said "cannot find the server att.yahoo". I explained to him 6 different ways taht att.yahoo isnt valid and that it should be either att.com or yahoo.com and etc. So he says "oh okay, let me try att.yahoo.com". I tried to stop him and tell him that it wasnt right and he is like "Well son of a bitch you solved my problem, I had to type att.yahoo.com and now it loads! Thank you!".
