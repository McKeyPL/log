[05:40:55] <expatriate> I played 100 hours of GTA V over the past three weeks
[05:41:01] <expatriate> and I have a full time job
[05:41:13] <plushie_pegasus> :-o
[05:41:56] <princesssluttershy> I've played 200 hours of csgo over two years
[05:42:07] <princesssluttershy> and I don't have a job at all
[05:42:10] <Quinn> when I was still in college
[05:42:17] <Quinn> I played over 3,000 hours on tf2
[05:42:23] <expatriate> wtfffffffffffff
[05:42:36] <Quinn> I played in UGC Platinum though
[05:42:42] <expatriate> that's nuts
[05:42:53] <Quinn> maybe it's why I failed
[05:42:57] <Quinn> who knows
[05:43:14] <expatriate> the most I've played a single game is definitely Garry's Mod
[05:43:19] <expatriate> I think I have around 600 hours
[05:43:48] <princesssluttershy> I don't get how people can play that much gmod
[05:43:54] <expatriate> wire
[05:43:58] <princesssluttershy> Like it's not even a game
[05:44:08] <Vulpixbrew> friends to screw aorund with?
[05:44:13] <expatriate> I basically taught myself programming and didn't realize it
[05:44:21] <princesssluttershy> and I don't personally find the game modes very fun
[05:44:44] <expatriate> it's what got me into game design
[05:44:56] <expatriate> I learned Hammer so I could make levels for it
[05:45:01] <expatriate> wire taught me programming
[05:45:08] * plushie_pegasus is too busy chatting on IRC and playing with my plushies to game
[05:45:35] <expatriate> I would set up a bunch of enemies and contraptions and shit and share the savegames with my friends for them to play
[05:46:02] <princesssluttershy> TF2 is my most played game with 357 hours
[05:46:10] <princesssluttershy> and that's accumulated over 3 years
[05:46:26] <princesssluttershy> Over half of that time was on scout lol

[05:50:46] <Vulpixbrew> Civ 5 at 175 hours KSP about to pass that number STO at according to Steam 111 hours which I know is more due to the fact I went to the ARC client for the freee ship
