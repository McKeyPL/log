[04:23:26] <IceFlurries> fallout is an rpg?
[04:23:31] <captainorange> What platform was Earthbound even on?
[04:23:42] <Plums> Yes
[04:23:46] <Plums> The original fallout
[04:23:47] <cloppyhooves> SNES
[04:23:59] <Plums> SNOS
[04:24:01] <IceFlurries> ahh :o
[04:24:02] * captainorange needs to find a snes emulator then.
[04:24:17] <IceFlurries> captainorange: SNES, and Super Famicom
[04:24:25] <captainorange> Only snes game I've ever played was Chrono Trigger and it didn't keep my attention.
[04:24:26] <Plums> Yeah
[04:24:39] <captainorange> I lost interest when I was overloaded with JRPG tropes.
[04:24:40] <Plums> Its luberly Juberly
[04:25:14] <Vulpixbrew> SNES librayr is hiuge I wish I hadnt sold mine...
[04:25:32] <captainorange> I may be weird but I can never get into JRPGs.
[04:25:50] <captainorange> It seems like they all just run together and are rehashed versions of the same game.
[04:25:56] <Vulpixbrew> FF 4 on the ds was the best one ver if you ask me
[04:26:15] <captainorange> But from what I've heard the SNES was one of the best consoles ever made.
[04:26:19] <Plums> Fallout. Where you can blow a massive hole in an enemy and laugh
[04:26:32] <Plums> Seriously it gets really gory at times
[04:27:01] <captainorange> Which is to be expected considering you're living in a grim and violent wasteland where everything goes.
[04:27:17] <Vulpixbrew> Snes was great wouldnt argue best library even though it allaged well
[04:27:49] <captainorange> I can't really say anything, all I know about the snes is that it existed. XD
[04:28:27] <Plums> And they were made by sega :^)
[04:28:49] <captainorange> Why would Sega make games for it's big competitor in the early to mid 90's?
[04:29:07] <Plums> Sega totes made the SNES :^)

[07:38:18] <scrunchface> i'm mighty tighty-whitey and we're smugglin' plums.
[07:38:19] <Quinn> yay he quit
[07:38:19] <RNGsus> Shiet
[07:38:30] <Quinn> no clue what was up with that dude
[07:38:35] <scrunchface> he has issues lol
[07:38:37] <RNGsus> a lot
[07:38:37] <cloppyhooves> He was uncomfortable with something
[07:38:42] <cloppyhooves> Which is something that he could have worked on
[07:38:45] <cloppyhooves> But y'all were pushing it
[07:38:45] <Quinn> with everything, it seems 
[07:38:46] <RNGsus> -something- Everything
[07:38:56] <cloppyhooves> It was specifically people talking about IRL sex stuff
[07:39:05] <cloppyhooves> Again, that's something to be worked on
[07:39:07] <Quinn> well I doubt we were gonna stop just for his sake
[07:39:10] <iamalion> ^
[07:39:11] <scrunchface> what did he expect from an 18+ channel :x
[07:39:17] <RNGsus> That sucks, too be he will have to man the fuck up
[07:39:17] <Giggles> Oh, I can realate to that.
[07:39:28] <Quinn> welp pack it up guys and gals, no more sex talk anymore
[07:39:29] <cloppyhooves> No, we didn't have to stop :o
[07:39:31] <Quinn> keep it to PM's
[07:39:32] <cloppyhooves> >.<
[07:39:39] <RNGsus> Yep its all ogre now
[07:39:43] <cloppyhooves> That's not what I meant D:
[07:39:48] <scrunchface> I would've banned him
[07:39:50] <RNGsus> one person who is annoying wants us to stop :p
[07:40:36] <Quinn> I betcha anything he was under 18
[07:40:43] <RNGsus> i wouldnt say that
[07:40:44] <cloppyhooves> They were not
[07:40:51] <RNGsus> i bet he is really really really really lonely
[07:40:51] <scrunchface> Maybe
[07:40:56] <scrunchface> no way to verify his age LEL
[07:40:57] <RNGsus> which is stupid to join a channel like this
[07:41:09] <RubyPinch> probably not best to continue on this topic x-x
[07:41:23] <scrunchface> CONVERSATION TERMINATED.
[07:41:24] <Quinn> some people just dont stick
[07:41:36] <Quinn> like Plums joined just a couple days ago and everyone loves him :3
[07:41:44] <IceFlurries> Who wants to talk about Россия?! :D

[07:44:27] <Plums> First time i've seen a shitstorm here so no big issue
[07:44:54] <iamalion> Quinn I didnt notice that then I got fineline and felina mixed up. i was working on the server felina is on so when it started doing stuff I thought I had broken my bot

[07:49:13] <Quinn> wait really? :o
[07:49:18] <Plums> 3 weeks-1 month
[07:49:19] <Quinn> I guess its cause I've been gone so much

[16:28:57] <Cel> that's when loosing most fights
[16:29:14] <Cel> if you win for an hour... 1 700 at least... and many 670s
