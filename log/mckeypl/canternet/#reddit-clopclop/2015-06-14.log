[01:11:47] <RNGsus> I found a pair that hasnt completely broken in a year, but they have a key weak spot on either side and both spots broke
[01:12:13] <RNGsus> it can be easily prevented with superglue to that spot, and fixed with.. superglue to that spot, but i didnt let the first time it broke set correctly so now its really messed up on one side
[01:12:23] <Toxotis> I'v went through 2 pairs this month 
[01:12:25] <RNGsus> When i get new ones im going to get the ones i have now, and superglue a weak spot

[01:13:06] <RNGsus> They are great because it only uses a standard small jack so i can use them with a cell phone if i wanted
[01:13:49] <RNGsus> Plus the jack can be disconnected from the headphones so it never twists, it just rotates in the socket

[05:48:07] <Quinn> we both have a huge celeb crush on him :3
[05:48:40] <expatriate> who doesn't?
[05:49:05] <samonuh> I don't
[05:49:24] <Toxotis> ^
[05:49:25] <Quinn> zomg when he first appeared on camera I heard my bf let out a little gasp 
[05:49:27] <Quinn> it was so cute
[05:50:10] <samonuh> He takes me out of any movie he's in now
[05:50:14] <samonuh> Too popular

[05:52:15] <Toxotis> What we need is an erotic romance movie about ponies 
[05:52:37] <samonuh> ^this
[05:52:48] <Quinn> ^ he's been in what, Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurasic World
[05:52:54] <Quinn> and a bunch of smaller movies nobody cares about
[05:52:57] <Quinn> how is that too popular
[05:53:09] <samonuh> The internet obsesses over him
[05:53:30] <samonuh> When I see him in a movie all I think is "that's Chris Pratt"
[05:53:36] <samonuh> Can't get into the character

[06:22:09] <Toxotis> ohh i get what you said now
[06:22:20] <samonuh> Looking through non-intentionally sexual pictures of a girl solely to look at boobs is objectificaion

[09:13:50] <cloppyhooves> "Sodomy Dog's Furry Pack" is the typical one, right? :o
[09:14:02] <iamalion> ya
[09:14:11] <cloppyhooves> It's a really good one :3
[09:14:34] <expatriate> I probably wouldn't  know most of the references

[09:14:49] <expatriate> since ponies, really

[09:30:53] <iamalion> aw damn i tried
[09:31:46] <expatriate> btw if you go to the grocery store and ask for paper in plastic or double paper you're literally satab
[09:31:49] <expatriate> satan*
[09:32:01] <iamalion> thats why I just use plastic
[09:32:03] <iamalion> kappa :v
[09:32:12] <cloppyhooves> Plastic bags are illegal here :o
[09:32:18] <expatriate> just plastic is the best thing you can do, as far as baggers are concerned
[09:32:28] <expatriate> do you get paper instead, or bring your own?
[09:32:36] <cloppyhooves> Bring your own or 10 cents for paper
[09:32:57] <expatriate> see I 110% support reuseable bags
[09:33:00] <expatriate> but fuck paper
[09:33:03] <expatriate> they suck as bags
[09:33:04] <Squirrelly> Dammit cloppy
[09:33:05] <expatriate> they're hard to pack
[09:33:13] <expatriate> and they're WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN PAPER
[09:33:17] * Squirrelly squirms a little in her seat
[09:33:35] <expatriate> I fucking had so many customers want paper because they thought they were helping the environment
[09:33:37] <expatriate> fuck no
[09:33:43] <Katiepony> We don't have paper bags, here.
[09:33:59] <expatriate> we recycle plastic, which results in a way better yield than recycled paper
[09:34:10] <expatriate> it takse 1/3 the energy to produce plastic than paper
[09:34:20] <expatriate> which means less coal being burned
[09:34:46] <expatriate> and paper is sourced by deforestation, plastic is sourced from some fucking rock in the ground
[09:35:00] <expatriate> plastic is way better for the enviroment than paper
[09:35:15] <expatriate> if you really care, you'll buy some reusable and use that

[20:54:07] <TheRedOne> overall meh, action was nice
[20:54:22] <Squirrelly> I really enjoyed it
[20:54:49] <TheRedOne> there was one scene that I gotta admit actually fired me up lol

[20:56:18] <TheRedOne> and then that giant sea monster just sprang up and downed them both in one glorious big gulp
[20:56:55] <TheRedOne> I do wonder if that's intentional, I think vore isn't too widespread.
[20:57:57] <RNGsus> so Vulpixbrew i think the reason why i was failing is because of my launch profile

[21:20:26] <TheRedOne> a, I got a station in lko
[21:20:28] <RNGsus> The only mod i use is kerbal engineer usually
[21:20:38] <RNGsus> I dont like using mechjeb
[21:20:49] <RNGsus> which is why i cant into other planets easily
[21:21:04] <TheRedOne> and I dock there, take either one or two tanks plus engines along, and off I go
[21:21:14] <TheRedOne> basically, engines to go
[21:21:25] *** Foxy is now known as Eeveey
[21:23:17] * Melon_Phone twitches
[21:23:27] <TheRedOne> the other is having a science/utility/whatever module parked in lko, dock the ssto, fly to wherever, so basically skipping the station
[21:24:02] <RNGsus> my plan is to get into orbit, dock with station, refuel and go
[21:24:14] <TheRedOne> yeah that's easy, fairly
[21:24:28] <TheRedOne> technically you don't need an actual ssto for that if you're awesome
[21:24:34] <TheRedOne> think sstt
[21:24:42] <RNGsus> sstt?
[21:24:48] <TheRedOne> single stage to tether
[21:24:55] <TheRedOne> basic concept
[21:24:58] <RNGsus> if you are tethered to a space statio your in orbit
[21:25:06] <TheRedOne> you got a station
[21:25:57] <TheRedOne> you got a plane that can reach the height, but doesnt have the Δv to reach orbit
[21:26:15] <TheRedOne> =less fuel
[21:26:24] <TheRedOne> time your launch with the station
[21:26:31] <TheRedOne> fly up, dock, refuel
[21:26:37] <TheRedOne> You're gold
[21:26:48] <RNGsus> if you are docked with a space station in orbit, you are in orbit
[21:27:06] <TheRedOne> yes
[21:27:36] <TheRedOne> but again, the plane can't reach orbit by its own
[21:27:48] <RNGsus> this makes no sense
[21:28:01] <TheRedOne> ofc it does
[21:28:19] <TheRedOne> think Apollo 11, flight back
[21:28:39] <TheRedOne> lem launches, that thing can't reach lunar orbit, iirc
[21:29:00] <TheRedOne> but they had the other module, Michael Collins was on there, they docked to that
[21:29:07] <TheRedOne> saves fuel on the lem
[21:29:24] <TheRedOne> and once docked fly back to earth
[21:30:00] <RNGsus> If the lem couldnt reach lunar orbit, but it docked with something going at orbital speed, then it was in orbit
[21:30:19] <RNGsus> unless michael slowed down to suborbital, but i dont think it worked like that
[21:30:20] <TheRedOne> do you know what prbit capability means
[21:30:27] <TheRedOne> orbit
[21:30:43] <RNGsus> maybe im not really sure what you are saying
[21:31:03] <TheRedOne> kk, I'll try to rephrase (not a native speaker, sorry)
[21:31:43] <RNGsus> geei sure do love it when ksp decides to not draw where my col is so i have no clue whatsoever if this craft is going to be stable
[21:31:55] <Vulpixbrew> I still havent mastered SSTO reentry
[21:32:13] <RNGsus> i dont know if its possible with reentry heating unless you slow down a lot
[21:32:20] <TheRedOne> you can build a plane, that isn't an ssto - it'd run out of fuel trying to reach orbit
[21:32:30] <RNGsus> yes
[21:32:58] <TheRedOne> doesnt have the Δv
[21:33:07] <TheRedOne> thing is
[21:33:28] <TheRedOne> it can reach the altitude of a station in orbit
[21:34:45] <TheRedOne> So the plane flies up, as the station races past.
[21:36:18] <TheRedOne> you try to dock, it'd be on a beam reaching out from the station (so that the plane can afford having less speed)
[21:36:36] <TheRedOne> the longer the beam, the better for the plane
[21:36:50] *** Joins: Toxotis (Mibbit@Pony-5cc.m84.52.184.IP)
[21:37:25] <Toxotis> Hey everyone 
[21:37:25] <TheRedOne> So you dock, and the station basically pulls the plane up to orbital speed
[21:37:29] <TheRedOne> hi tox
[21:37:35] <RNGsus> and the plane pulls the stations speed down as well
[21:37:47] <RNGsus> either way impossible or not useful in ksp
[21:37:47] <TheRedOne> yes
[21:38:04] <TheRedOne> point being the station is more massive and on a higher alt
[21:38:23] <RNGsus> why go through all the work and not just make a better ssto
[21:39:15] <TheRedOne> less fuel/more mass per plane, and potentially easier construction

[21:42:30] <TheRedOne> ain't got nothing to record with though
[21:42:37] <TheRedOne> eh?
[21:42:39] <Vulpixbrew> we all go clop on the moon to honor luna
[21:42:45] <cloppyhooves> I have a cooking question for those that are a pretty good at it :o
[21:42:57] <RNGsus> Im telling ya, get a dmp up and build a station together
[21:43:01] * Melon_Phone howls
[21:43:02] <Cel> pornhub wants to do a sex in space video... let's just join them
[21:43:19] <Melon_Phone> you guys seen that zero g cumshot?
[21:44:29] <TheRedOne> what is it cloppy
[21:44:33] <TheRedOne> no I haven't
[21:44:55] <TheRedOne> but yeah rng I'd be up for it too
[21:45:13] <cloppyhooves> I was just given a bottle of white wine and while I don't drink, I was told it could be good for sauteeing chicken or shrimp
[21:45:20] <cloppyhooves> The problem is I don't know how to do either of those things D:
[21:45:29] <cloppyhooves> With white wine, I mean
[21:45:31] <TheRedOne> Oh, a cooking related question
[21:45:32] <Eeveey> Interwebz?
[21:45:34] <Melon_Phone> it's awesome with shrimp
[21:45:39] <cloppyhooves> I can sautee chicken and shrimp, but don't know how to add white wine to the occasion
[21:45:42] <Eeveey> Alternately, use red wine for a steak
[21:45:43] <TheRedOne> I know a chef, but he ain't online right now
[21:45:52] <cloppyhooves> *equation
[21:45:58] <TheRedOne> helpful
[21:46:06] <Melon_Phone> [human|zero g] http://xhamster.com/movies/2485677/the_first_and_only_zero_gravity_cumshot.html
[21:46:18] <TheRedOne> can't right now, got shoulder surfers
[21:47:00] <cloppyhooves> I tried looking up on google about cooking with wine and most are basically like "Cook it seperately and then add it later"
[21:47:16] <Melon_Phone> yep
[21:47:27] <TheRedOne> we'll need a mission flag
[21:47:29] <Melon_Phone> shrimp take like -3 seconds to cook approx
[21:47:34] <RNGsus> I can do that TheRedOne 
[21:47:48] <Melon_Phone> make a sauce to have with it
[21:47:54] <TheRedOne> own mascot or a given pony?
[21:49:16] <RNGsus> What
[21:49:18] <Melon_Phone> you could make shrimp scampi
[21:49:29] <TheRedOne> for our mission flag
[21:49:42] <RNGsus> luna
[21:49:47] <RNGsus> and celestia
[21:50:27] <Eeveey> MMMmmmmm shrimp scampi
[21:51:14] <TheRedOne> ah yeah that makes sense
[21:51:48] <Melon_Phone> if you wanna have the wine not in a sauce
[21:52:13] <Melon_Phone> but kinda incorporated into the shrimpz
[21:52:22] <Vulpixbrew> I love that memory leak crash
[21:52:31] <RNGsus> i know right
[21:52:37] <Melon_Phone> with garlic and butter and parsley and mmmm
[21:52:47] <Melon_Phone> it's a beautiful dish
[21:52:51] <RNGsus> squad adds two main features in 1.0, and in the next patch nerfs them to fuck and one causes memory leaks
[21:53:06] <RNGsus> .9 was better than 1.0 except for mining and a couple of parts
[21:53:24] <RNGsus> pretty much any patch was better than this
[21:55:04] <Eeveey> Oh my god, Melon, that sounds delicious
[21:55:12] <Eeveey> If you have a specific recipe I'd love to have it
[22:00:05] <Melon_Phone> [yiff|mf] http://41.media.tumblr.com/4f514a25c549c051313648f5d6bdbd7c/tumblr_npftm99Mj41t8icefo2_1280.png

[22:01:53] <Vulpixbrew> RNGsus it's unity causing a lot of issues
[22:02:14] <Vulpixbrew> theres no 64 bit version of ksp once we get thatthe memory iussues shouyld be fine
[22:05:43] <iamalion> nnnnf
[22:05:46] <iamalion> i was just outside
[22:05:50] <iamalion> laying in the grass in the sun toasting
[22:05:51] <iamalion> mmmmm
[22:06:57] <thaostra> Vulpixbrew, Actually there is a 64-bit version, but it's installed alongside the 32-bit version which is probably chosen by default
[22:07:24] <thaostra> Deleting the 32-bit version or launching the 64-bit version manually might work though

[23:33:54] <Araiya> I need to find a buffet that's close to me and open on Sundays.
[23:34:04] <Connor> Chinese? 
[23:36:24] <Araiya> I'd take it if it were available.
[23:36:55] <Araiya> It's not that I'm crazy hungry or anything. I just like to have a place to go read a book and have food 'n drink nearby.
[23:37:10] <Araiya> And peopleses. Can't forget the peopleses.
[23:40:48] <Araiya> I think that's the one thing I miss about my home city -- knowing where the buffets are, even if there were only a few.
[23:43:43] <iamalion> mmm what a good lunch
