[07:43:42] <thaostra> Thanks

[10:10:56] <Squirrelly> By 1 PM
[10:11:02] <Squirrelly> Let's do this
[10:11:15] <Giggles> Hae fun
[10:11:28] * Wolfie steals Squirrelly's pencil case
[10:11:33] <Squirrelly> lol
[10:11:48] <Squirrelly> If by pencil case you mean computer, then awesome, gives me an excuse to not have it by tomorrow
[10:12:01] <iamalion> Squirrelly!!
[10:12:04] <iamalion> you can do it!
[10:12:06] * Wolfie steals the keyboard instead
[10:12:11] <Katiepony> I always felt, if I had to write that much in so little time, it would be so bad anyway that it's not even worth doing.
[10:12:19] <Katiepony> So I never did any work :3
[10:12:30] * Wolfie humps it behind the couch
[10:12:38] <IceFlurries> o.o
[10:12:41] * IceFlurries is weird though
[10:12:51] * IceFlurries actually would consider living in Alaska, pending employment
[10:13:23] * iamalion flops over on his back
[10:13:25] <iamalion> blargh .-.
[10:13:44] <IceFlurries> o.o
[10:13:58] * Wolfie sits beside iamalion with the keyboard in his maw, wagging his tail
[10:14:02] <Katiepony> Turns out a lot of problems in life don't go away when you move somewhere else o:
[10:14:14] <Squirrelly> Heh
[10:14:21] <Squirrelly> Yeah I work best under pressure
[10:14:32] <iamalion> same
[10:14:41] <iamalion> i always wrote my reports last minute
[10:14:47] <Squirrelly> I'm basically gonna do this thing, probably end up pulling an all nighter, and maaaaybe skipping my night class tomorrow or something.
[10:14:56] <iamalion> you can do it!
[10:15:08] <Squirrelly> Probably not skip completely, but just go there, take some notes for half of it, and get the rest of the notes from somebody else in class
[10:15:21] <Squirrelly> I have nothing on friday until like 7 PM so whatever
[10:15:28] <Squirrelly> I can sleep all day then
[10:15:44] <Squirrelly> And I don't really need to think once I've finished my paper
[10:15:48] <Giggles> I've never noticed a change in grades on apapers correlating to time spent on them.
[10:16:04] <Squirrelly> ?
[10:16:08] * Wolfie pouts and curls on his pillow
[10:16:17] <iamalion> i social engineer'd my way through school
[10:16:24] * Squirrelly pulls the puppy in for snuggles
[10:16:32] <Squirrelly> Yeah, I do that too, kitty
[10:16:40] <Squirrelly> Knowing how to talk to people is awesome
[10:16:51] <iamalion> yeeeep
[10:16:58] <Squirrelly> Is it bad that I can be extremely manipulative when I want to be?
[10:17:02] <iamalion> i should not have passed my seinior english class
[10:17:06] <iamalion> no Squirrelly i am the same away :)
[10:17:12] <Giggles> No it's ideal, cultivate that 
[10:17:25] * Wolfie squints
[10:17:26] <cloppyhooves> Consent is sexy :o
[10:17:59] <Squirrelly> well yeah, but being able to manipulate people like profs to help you get through school without harming them or your classmates seems okay
[10:18:16] <Wolfie> ok I'll ask the keyboard if I can hump it
[10:18:21] <Squirrelly> I mean, I'd say a nicer word, but it comes down to basically being manipulation
[10:18:24] <iamalion> but I met with her after class and I was like, look. Obviously I am really good with english, and have very good reading skills. I know I didnt do a lot of work, BUT Lets make a deal. I'll do this assignment, if you wave the past ones
[10:18:27] <iamalion> and she did \o/
[10:18:31] <iamalion> and i graduated high school
[10:18:42] <Squirrelly> lol nice
[10:18:49] <Squirrelly> Yeah I might have to do something like that with this paper
[10:19:17] <iamalion> nah
[10:19:19] <iamalion> do the paper
[10:19:22] <iamalion> doesnt have to be POLISHED
[10:19:26] <iamalion> but something is better than nothing

[13:08:57] <cloppyhooves> Yup!
[13:09:32] <Frosty> Man, I forgot they exist. I need to follow them on Facebook or something so I know when they start.
[13:12:01] <cloppyhooves> SGDQ starts on the 26th!
[13:12:03] <Frosty> They still have more events.
[13:12:11] <Frosty> Yeah, that one!
[13:12:13] <cloppyhooves> So you haven't missed the second one of the year :)
[13:12:20] <cloppyhooves> I'm really excited about it :D

[13:13:57] <cloppyhooves> Videos on Demand, I think it stands for?
[13:14:01] <cloppyhooves> Basically they have recordings on Youtube
[13:14:08] <cloppyhooves> Also, to watch it, go to https://gamesdonequick.com/ when it starts on the 26th
[13:14:28] <cloppyhooves> Which is about 1 PM Eastern time
[13:15:11] <cloppyhooves> And it'll have the Twitch stream!
[13:15:44] <cloppyhooves> Or you can go to their Twitch at http://www.twitch.tv/GamesDoneQuick

[13:37:23] <Frosty> So since the AGDQ thing didn't work out super, what else do you want to talk about?
[13:39:38] <cloppyhooves> Hmm
[13:40:46] <cloppyhooves> I feel like I should be tired but I could probably stay up a bit longer
[13:41:28] <Frosty> Yeah, I have a briefing at 1500. I'm on mid shift. Who the hell thought that shit up?
[13:42:00] <cloppyhooves> Oh geez D:
[13:42:16] <cloppyhooves> That sounds rough D:
[13:42:36] <Frosty> I should be asleep right now, but I want lunch w/ my lesbian girlfriend later and I don't wanna screw up my sleep schedule.
[13:42:56] <cloppyhooves> Right D:
[13:43:48] <Frosty> Yeah. I'm just gonna take a nap after lunch and see how it goes. The briefing can't be more than an hour, hopefully, so I'll sleep more after that.
[13:43:58] <cloppyhooves> Hopefully!
[13:44:02] <cloppyhooves> Soundsd like that'll work out c:
[13:44:20] <Frosty> You'd think.

[13:50:24] <cloppyhooves> Never tried :o
[13:50:26] <cloppyhooves> How is it?
[13:50:36] <Frosty> You ever have Chipotle?
[13:50:45] <cloppyhooves> Just had it today :o
[13:50:56] <Frosty> It's pretty much that, but better.
[13:51:22] <cloppyhooves> Better? :o
[13:52:21] <Frosty> I think it's better. But I'm also not a fan of Chipotle. People either think it's better or not as good, but never the same.
[13:52:41] <Frosty> Personally, I like Neato Burrito, but we don't have one of those here. :'(
[13:53:04] <cloppyhooves> Oh, I mean, what parts do you think are better? :o
[13:53:30] <Frosty> Oh, I just think the overall qualtiy of food is better.
[13:53:38] <Frosty> I like the sauces better, 
[13:53:43] <Frosty> Higher quality meat
[13:53:46] <cloppyhooves> Ah, okay c:
[13:54:55] <Frosty> The people that work there look like they want to suck-start a shotgun, but It'sMinot, who lives here and doesn't want to kill themselves, amirite?
