[02:42:40] <Vulpixbrew> yeah
[02:43:07] <Wolfy> Aren't the dlcs available on origin?
[02:43:08] <weisey> I had to go to EA and be like "yo i bought these on steam, can you add them to my origin so I can actually DLC"
[02:43:13] <weisey> And they did it 
[02:43:16] <weisey> But holy fuck
[02:43:25] <Vulpixbrew> EA customer supprt is awesome though

[02:45:49] <Vulpixbrew> yeah i've complained to EA and bioware several times about that
[02:46:30] <Wolfy> They can't hear you for all the moneyyy
[02:47:08] <Vulpixbrew> one of these days I shall just say f*** it and buy all the dlcs
[02:47:22] <Wolfy> I find it kinda annoying that when I play hardline it displays a "buy now" button directly under the play button
