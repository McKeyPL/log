[19:43:05] <Katiepony> I know. I also don't want to be tricked into a golden one, either.

[19:53:47] <Katiepony> How big is the hot spring?
[19:54:01] <Katiepony> Big enough to swim in, or are all our wet fuzzy bodies rubbing against each other? o:
[19:54:09] <Cel> big enough to fit everyone but small enough to be intimate^^

[20:11:02] <Katiepony> Well, once upon a time, everyone in this chat had a ponysona
[20:11:02] <princesssluttershy> So the new Battlefront game is actually really fun :/
[20:11:11] <Katiepony> And then everyone became furry and now there are no other ponies |:
[20:11:26] <Katiepony> So I'm better off using my fursona to fit in.
[20:11:54] <weisey> Katiepony don't cave to peer pressure!
[20:12:09] <weisey> But do this drug its super legit
[20:12:16] <Katiepony> It's okay. I prefer being a red panda.

[22:43:55] <Cel> betafront... now with more rubberbanding!
[22:45:02] <Wolfy> hah
[22:45:16] <Wolfy> I think Imma stream some
[22:45:35] <Wolfy> it says it's 3 hours to download 
[22:45:37] <Cel> hint... if you get a thermal imploder... watch the explosion once even if you die... so awesome
[22:45:51] <Cel> didn't you preload?
[22:45:56] <Wolfy> yeah. the sound is orgasmic
[22:46:09] <Wolfy> no, I haven't played my ps4 all week
[22:46:24] <Cel> D:
[22:46:32] <Wolfy> might preorder it though and get the preload thing on the actual game
[22:48:06] <Cel> currently I'm not impressed enough to consider buying it... they should give us a couple more maps... that'd help me decide
[22:49:00] <Cel> the spawnpoints are ridiculously stupid... i sat in a turret and in front of me spawned one rebel after another
[22:49:07] <Wolfy> Aah yeah that's understandable
[22:49:32] <Wolfy> I hope it's not gonna be like the other betas I've played
[22:49:43] <Cel> ?
[22:50:07] <Wolfy> destiny beta was so awesome, bought the game as soon as it came out, turns out it's an endless grind
[22:50:42] <Wolfy> hardline beta, absolutely loved it and bought the game soon after, although with 10% off. didn't think much of it afterwards
[22:50:53] <Wolfy> until now it's grown on me a bit
[22:51:03] <Cel> well that won't be that... and since you liked BF4 and hardline it's safe to say you won't be disappointed with that
[22:51:40] <Wolfy> yeah. I guess that's a benefit of the beta
[22:51:52] <Wolfy> it gives you the essence of what you're gonna end up with
[22:52:10] <Wolfy> along with a HUGE box of quality rubber bands
[22:52:13] <Wolfy> standard
[22:52:45] <Cel> it is good... and imo it is better than BF4 and BF4+... but currently I can't justify spending money on that^^
[22:53:08] <Wolfy> Aah yeah
[22:53:36] <Cel> even with the quality rubber bands^^
[22:54:01] <Wolfy> dice branded rubber bands
[22:54:11] <Cel> yea
[22:54:12] <Wolfy> highest of the qualities 
[22:54:49] <Cel> people again complain about it not being cross platform
[22:54:57] <Wolfy> eh that'd be unfair
[22:55:09] <Wolfy> m+k vs controller 
[22:55:54] <Wolfy> maybe xbone vs ps4 but sony and Microsoft are too busy sniffing their own butts to work on that 
[22:55:56] <Cel> yea but still complaining... and they say "aiming with mouse is too easy"
[22:56:07] <Cel> how is that easier than autoaim?
[22:56:12] <Wolfy> true 
[22:56:20] <Vulpixbrew> Cel It kept spawning my right under an AT-ST earlier
[22:56:30] <Wolfy> I didn't notice any auto aim in hardline though
[22:56:32] <Cel> that's great, too
[22:56:53] <Wolfy> mostly because I was using an ass rifle, spraying and praying
[22:57:17] <Cel> controllers get better, maybe it's not necessary anymore... the last time I played fps on console it was essentially "look in the general direction" = headshot
[22:57:41] <Wolfy> true
[22:58:04] <Wolfy> there's some attachment to the controller stick that makes aiming a bit easier 
[22:58:35] <Cel> the most disgusting feeling is autoaim on pc... and you can't turn it off... can't remember what game, but it made me quit after 5min
[22:59:23] <Wolfy> awww
[22:59:40] <Wolfy> I was watching a sniper montage in battlefront yesterday
[23:00:02] <Wolfy> you don't really get those on consoles
[23:00:18] <Wolfy> anyway, shower time 
[23:00:31] <Cel> I'm a great accidental sniper with the cycler rifle... I'm shit at aiming (that's why I always use the biggest gun^^)
[23:00:43] <Wolfy> hehe
[23:00:59] <Wolfy> actually, the rifle acts as a good shield penetrator it seems
[23:01:22] <Cel> it also punches through armor (as in ATST and turrets)
[23:01:55] <Cel> and a shot in the foot brings you down to 10hp
[23:02:25] <Wolfy> oof
[23:02:28] <Wolfy> oh shit!
[23:02:33] <Wolfy> 9 minutes!
