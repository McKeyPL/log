[02:51:47] <weisey> for FUCKING 60 A AMONTH
[02:51:53] <preeb> oh my god
[02:52:00] <preeb> i'd just go to the library all the time in that case
[02:52:04] <weisey> I DO
[02:53:16] <preeb> i did that for a while, until i realized that i probably shouldn't do online banking on a public connection
[02:53:26] <thaostra> preeb, Surely you could splurge the extra $15/month and get three times the speed

[02:55:13] <weisey> I have a good job now
[02:55:22] <weisey> i have no cashflow problems
[02:55:37] <thaostra> That $15 you saved gets you a lunch at a restaurant that isn't fast food, and in exchange you most likely spend quite a bit of time waiting for pages to lead and videos to buffer
[02:55:47] <weisey> i still get anxious about buying a can of red bull before work
[02:56:07] <preeb> that does make sense
[02:56:21] <preeb> but hey, i can just not go there. i mean, i barely watch anything
[02:56:25] <preeb> i mena stream
[02:56:34] <preeb> and i can just download if i really want, leave it on all day
[02:56:35] <preeb> i can live
[02:56:53] <preeb> my consumption is relatilvely light
[02:57:14] <thaostra> I used to be that way, until I got a decent data plan :)
[02:57:26] <thaostra> Now I can afford to not be miserly with downloads
[02:57:29] <preeb> i felt, either i should get the $40 (for 12 months) 15 mbps or the cheapest one
[02:57:36] <preeb> the middle one didn't make sense
[02:58:12] <MetalCoatEevee> I shouldn't mention I'm getting 300mbps for about $60

[02:59:05] <plushie_pegasus> MetalCoatEevee wouldn't that be 3Gbps?

[03:00:19] <cloppyhooves> https://i.imgur.com/5sX6GHm.png
[03:00:25] <preeb> anyway, yea maybe i will upgrade in a month or two. if i get frustrated enough
[03:00:51] <preeb> before i moved out i had 15, and i'm not driven crazy yet after 1 month, so we'll see
[03:01:06] <preeb> heck, i didn't get any home connection for 20 days
[03:01:22] <preeb> though i had my measley 1GB 4G phone plan
[03:01:32] <thaostra> I can only tolerate 2mbps speeds if it's a public hotspot. I should be able to stream HD video without any buffering in my own home
[03:01:35] <preeb> thought I didn't need it, but it is helpful in emergency situations
[03:02:26] <preeb> it's maybe a mental thing. it feels like a luxury i don't need

[03:12:04] <preeb> i have alwyas been this way. i didn't maximize the use of the 15mbps connection, so obviously i should cut back. and then i get frustrated and sometimes end up spending more. it is very short sighted. i should work for the military, this kinda how they think
[03:15:10] <plushie_pegasus> I checked, 11 min to download starbound
[03:16:00] <thaostra> Most people don't maximize their connections, instead the higher speeds are an assurance than load times finish quicker, streaming doesn't get interrupted by buffering, and you can have more than one person in your home using your internet without it slowing down so much
[03:16:52] <preeb> ah that's part of it too

[03:17:02] <preeb> i'm alone, so nobody will use it

[03:19:09] <preeb> it's a constant conflicted thing that happens

[03:46:48] <plushie_pegasus> cool it worked
[03:47:40] <thaostra> Good. It works up until you close your browser though, but this can be prevented if you sign up for an account so that it's saved to your profile. I don't believe plushie_pegasus is taken yet
[03:49:49] <thaostra> While it would be nice if you could view all of the porn by default, but Derpi isn't strictly a porn site
[03:52:06] <thaostra> But y'know, it still manages to have more clop than Paheal, so it's worthwhile
[03:54:29] *** Starzie is now known as Starburn
[03:56:28] <plushie_pegasus> Welcome! You have signed up successfully.
[03:57:06] <thaostra> Derpibooru: 104,298 explicit images or 217,938 none-safe images, Paheal: 78039 explicit images
[03:57:07] * Vulpixbrew has doritos and mountions dew
[03:58:38] <plushie_pegasus> When i go to google search, i just copy the links whether it is paheal, derpi, or other
[04:00:11] <thaostra> Google is literally one of the least effective search engines for porn. Bing is much better
[04:02:56] <Vulpixbrew> bing is only good for porn really
[04:07:44] <weisey> its true
[04:08:35] *** Joins: Nigiri (AndChat2442@Pony-1j4ll8.res.rr.com)
[04:10:03] *** RedHelper is now known as RedHelper|Shower
[04:10:42] <thaostra> With Derpibooru's search I can enter something like "explicit, derpy hooves, anthro" and get exactly what I want. Enter the same keywords in Google and I just get listings for Derpibooru and e621 posts
[04:12:01] <plushie_pegasus> google gives you random , unexpected but sometimes good results
[04:12:41] <thaostra> That's the exact opposite of a useful search engine in the context of porn
[04:13:19] <thaostra> Derpibooru has a structured tagging system so you get exactly what you're looking for, even very specific details like fetishes, background colors, clothing, etc
[04:13:43] <plushie_pegasus> I like surprises tho
[04:14:19] <thaostra> I like "surprises" too if it's a particularly high quality image that satisfies my current needs
[04:15:16] <thaostra> And the thing about Google search is that it's slow to index all of the new porn that comes out
[04:15:36] <thaostra> With Derpibooru new posts appear every few minutes
[04:16:20] <plushie_pegasus> For example, a search for "Halloween porn" gets me this http://rule34-data-000.paheal.net/_images/5cc6fa58ab269dbff3556738bd504e74/958195%20-%20El_Doc%20Friendship_is_Magic%20Meadow_Song%20My_Little_Pony%20Nightmare_Moon%20Princess_Luna%20Twilight_Sparkle%20Zecora.png and this http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/872/443/60b.png
