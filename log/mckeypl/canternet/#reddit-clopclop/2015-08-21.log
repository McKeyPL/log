[18:46:18] <Wolfy> smart* 
[18:46:41] <Cel> I don't know... but she seems happy with her trust capabilities
[18:46:47] <Wolfy> so she's equipped with a rusty rifle in a lab coat guarding the vault door 
[18:47:12] <Wolfy> come on Max, the water treatment needs you! 
[18:48:47] <Wolfy> ok, Andrea broke down and cried so I swapped her with Barbara 
[18:49:41] <Vulpixbrew> It's nice to be spending time with family

[18:50:45] <Wolfy> he's got dreadlocks 
[18:50:45] <Cel> :D
[18:52:54] <Wolfy> yeaaaaah

[18:56:02] <Wolfy> oh man he's got the vault clam
[18:56:20] <Vulpixbrew> hes got molerats
[18:57:10] <Wolfy> he likes to pour sand on his pubes so the crabs feel right at home 
[18:57:32] <Cel> molerats tend to spawn in my power room... all in military armor and with sawn-off shotguns... that's hardly fair for anyone
[18:57:51] <Vulpixbrew> rioght now in my radioroom
[18:58:14] <Cel> my radio room... full of hookers armed with laser pistols

[19:04:14] <Wolfy> Jim raided heather's womb
[19:04:24] <Vulpixbrew> Prot Pally, Guardian Druid, Blood DK, and Mpnk Brewmaster
[19:05:25] <Cel> someone likes tanks
[19:05:48] <Vulpixbrew> I like instant quenes
[19:06:01] <Vulpixbrew> and I got bored of healing
[19:07:21] <Cel> I never tank without a healer I know... I don't trust people^^
[19:07:40] <Cel> ok... one exception... I do tank in ashran
[19:08:04] <Vulpixbrew> Prot Pally comes with heals blood DK is a DK soo it's op, 
[19:08:40] <Cel> I know, but that's not enough for real action^^
[19:09:10] <Cel> I tanked during cata with everything except druid
[19:09:34] <Vulpixbrew> and my wariros of spec is guardian......
[19:10:03] <Cel> :D
[19:10:52] <Cel> for me usually everything that can heal is heal... so pala was always kinda annoying to equip... and also druid, but I never tank equipped a druid^^
[19:11:33] <Vulpixbrew> yeah I tend to do combos that look sismliar
[19:11:58] <Vulpixbrew> prot/ret, elem/resto ect
[19:12:28] <Vulpixbrew> I miss pre 5.2 ele shammies
[19:13:40] <Cel> I miss classic shaman... infinite windfury... use a battle staff... kill a tank onehit (or thousand hit with one button)
[19:13:57] <Vulpixbrew> yep
[19:14:48] <Vulpixbrew> I miss being able to move with a shhammy
[19:15:33] <Vulpixbrew> single target lightning spell could move against raid bosses and pvp it was so useful, now just feels like another caster with inifiitne chain lightning
[19:16:12] <Cel> I fist with shaman... hard^^
[19:16:46] <Cel> only while leveling though... then it goes heal again
[19:18:05] <Vulpixbrew> Man I do miss the old talent trees when you could do dang near anything wityh and class

[19:29:54] <Vulpixbrew> I wonder if bad dragon sill exist then, and makes super mutant dildos
[19:30:26] <Cel> deathclaw dildos... super mutants are too mainstream
[19:30:26] <Wolfy> probably like a drill bit
