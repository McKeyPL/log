[10:09:26] <cloppyhooves> Don't you hate when you're really tired and want to go to bed
[10:09:35] <cloppyhooves> But then you're too tired to brush your teeth so you can sleep
[10:09:53] <Vulpixbrew> that sounds annoying

[10:12:09] <cloppyhooves> That would probably result in choking

[14:08:32] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne:  it kinda looks like a meme
[14:08:52] <TheRedOne> Not helped by the jacket I suppose, but still
[14:08:53] <Cel> oh!... i thought you meant the transformend one^^
[14:08:56] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: well

[14:09:02] <bad_rooster> omg
[14:09:35] <bad_rooster> I think you need some shrinkwrap
[14:09:47] <bad_rooster> it looks like a solid tube
[14:09:47] <TheRedOne> shrinkwrap?
[14:09:55] <TheRedOne> OK?
[14:09:55] <bad_rooster> you need to make it tighter
[14:10:09] <bad_rooster> yea, I think that will make it look better
[14:10:17] <bad_rooster> but then again, I don't do drawing
[14:10:27] <Cel> I just sketched the other one to try it out... that I'd do like this https://i.imgur.com/S9EOIQv.png but the uniform... I'd hmm
[14:10:40] <bad_rooster> Cel: I like the collar
[14:10:47] <bad_rooster> and the eyes

[14:11:21] <bad_rooster> it's hawt
[14:11:34] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: but yea, if you bend the upper line and the lower one, too
[14:11:38] <bad_rooster> it will look better, I guess
[14:11:52] <TheRedOne> butbutphysics
[14:12:10] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: don't remind me of physics :X

[14:12:34] <bad_rooster> dude
[14:12:38] <bad_rooster> if you saw our tests
[14:12:40] <bad_rooster> you'd run away
[14:12:45] <TheRedOne> orly
[14:12:50] <TheRedOne> what was the topic
[14:12:55] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: all of them
[14:13:09] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: kinematics, dynamics, fluid dynamics, relativity theory
[14:13:16] <bad_rooster> some continnum stuff
[14:13:24] <bad_rooster> electric... um... stuff
[14:13:26] <bad_rooster> Keplers laws
[14:13:27] <bad_rooster> etc.
[14:13:31] <bad_rooster> 16 chapters
[14:13:33] <bad_rooster> 500 pages
[14:13:48] <bad_rooster> I'll give you a question, ok? :3
[14:13:54] <bad_rooster> given I can translate it
[14:13:59] <TheRedOne> shoot
[14:14:27] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: Prove Steiners sentence.
[14:15:43] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: induce Poissons theorem, including it's solution for non-damped oscillations for a linear harmonic oscillator
[14:15:59] <TheRedOne> steiner?
[14:16:14] <bad_rooster> lemme check it
[14:16:17] <bad_rooster> on wiki 
[14:16:22] <bad_rooster> oh
[14:16:27] <bad_rooster> Parallel axis theorem
[14:16:37] <bad_rooster> Steiners parallel axis theorem
[14:17:00] <TheRedOne> aint that the rotation one?
[14:17:09] <bad_rooster> yea :3 you smart
[14:17:15] <TheRedOne> gee thanks
[14:17:15] <bad_rooster> if you prove it, you get
[14:17:17] <bad_rooster> 2 points
[14:17:19] <bad_rooster> out of 50
[14:17:19] <bad_rooster> :C
[14:17:44] <TheRedOne> you know I'm not quite likely to do much differentials in chat
[14:17:50] <TheRedOne> let alone a clop chat
[14:18:00] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: write down the equations for Euler, Corialluum blah blah and ummmm
[14:18:21] <bad_rooster> centrifugal
[14:18:22] <bad_rooster> forces
[14:18:24] <bad_rooster> I guess
[14:18:24] <bad_rooster> lol
[14:18:37] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: but at least you know what differentials are
[14:18:43] <bad_rooster> that's kinda
[14:18:57] <bad_rooster> mmmm
[14:19:39] * Cel goes full tilt

[14:20:04] <bad_rooster> how do you saay uum
[14:20:07] <bad_rooster> conduct? or
[14:20:12] <bad_rooster> if you know some stuff
[14:20:20] <bad_rooster> and you deduce some other stuff from it
[14:20:26] <bad_rooster> how is it called?
[14:21:01] <TheRedOne> er
[14:21:04] <TheRedOne> ana
[14:21:07] <bad_rooster> l
[14:21:11] <TheRedOne> analytic?
[14:21:21] <bad_rooster> no, I mean the verb
[14:21:34] <bad_rooster> given assumptions, ___________ the theorem
[14:21:39] <bad_rooster> it's not like
[14:21:39] <bad_rooster> prove
[14:21:44] <TheRedOne> deduce?
[14:21:45] <bad_rooster> it's deduce from ass
[14:21:47] <bad_rooster> yea!
[14:21:55] <bad_rooster> not from ass
[14:21:58] <bad_rooster> from assumptions
[14:22:12] <TheRedOne> guessing?
[14:22:21] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: no, I think you are right
[14:22:23] <bad_rooster> deduce
[14:22:33] <bad_rooster> but
[14:22:35] <bad_rooster> it's not like
[14:22:41] <bad_rooster> deduce that something works
[14:22:44] <bad_rooster> or is it?
[14:22:46] <TheRedOne> I'm not quite sure of the transaction that's taking place here.
[14:22:49] <bad_rooster> is it a correct usage of the word?
[14:23:29] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: well I'm askin' if you can say "deduce pythagoras theorem given this image" 
[14:23:32] <bad_rooster> can you?

[14:35:52] <TheRedOne> there ya go melon
[14:36:02] <Cel> i don't think there's a difference... maybe people more often refer to hemorraging when it's internal
[14:36:04] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: he is changing his clothes
[14:36:11] <bad_rooster> Cel: oooooooh
[14:36:49] <bad_rooster> when I was just a filly

[14:37:11] <bad_rooster> i tried to buck a bottle

[14:40:06] <bad_rooster> Melon_Phone: I don't get it
[14:40:07] <Melon_Phone> that way I can pinch the end of my colon and fart to make a balloon

[16:59:57] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: can use those as a whip too
[17:00:00] <bad_rooster> a bit hardcore
[17:00:02] <bad_rooster> but whatever
[17:00:04] <bad_rooster> xD
[17:00:07] <Melon_Phone> I'd just go about and impregnate ponies
[17:00:09] <Melon_Phone> left and right in the dark of night
[17:00:24] <TheRedOne> Random Access to Pony Entrances
[17:00:41] <TheRedOne> nah a chain doesn't speed up so well
[17:00:50] <TheRedOne> you'll want a whip, or at least a rope
[17:01:06] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: well rope is easy to obtain
[17:01:08] <Melon_Phone> I prefer a mace
[17:01:11] <Melon_Phone> oh
[17:01:19] <TheRedOne> in that case the chain will ddo nicely
[17:01:35] <bad_rooster> or even a bare hoof
[17:01:42] <bad_rooster> when one is chained
[17:01:44] <bad_rooster> x3
[17:01:45] <Cel> I only have handcuffs... and not the fluffy kind
[17:02:05] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: I like those flexible rulers

[17:03:33] <bad_rooster> yea
[17:03:45] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: if you slap hard enough, it leaves a mark tho! 
[17:03:46] <bad_rooster> lol
[17:03:59] <TheRedOne> well anything does, really
[17:04:06] <TheRedOne> well not quite anything
[17:04:14] <bad_rooster> TheRedOne: brushes are awesome, too
[17:04:18] <TheRedOne> there was this wheel type of thing I gotta look up again
[17:06:48] <TheRedOne> actually, now I gotta look up king sombra fanart
[17:07:22] <TheRedOne> there's gotta be an image or two of him enjoying his pets
[17:07:30] <Melon_Phone> I wanna see queen zombra
[17:07:35] <Melon_Phone> sombra*
[17:08:06] <TheRedOne> so in the comics they had a backstory for him
[17:08:29] <TheRedOne> and there was something I felt they could've done better
[17:09:37] <TheRedOne> basically he wuz all alnoe, an then he befreindd a girl pony, and theyd grow close
[17:10:01] <TheRedOne> anyways and I was thinking, then he took over the crystal empire and made her his favourite slave
[17:10:27] <TheRedOne> ...instead, the retard lets her run off to tell Cakesink and Moonbutt on him
[17:11:01] <Melon_Phone> and moonboy for all I know
[17:11:11] <TheRedOne> lol
[17:11:17] <TheRedOne> u know who sombra i
[17:11:19] <TheRedOne> is*
[17:13:50] <Melon_Phone> a pony?
[17:13:59] <Melon_Phone> of eternal darkness! 
[17:15:04] <TheRedOne> did you miss season 3?
[17:15:18] <TheRedOne> I mean sure, it was short and easy to miss
[17:15:26] <Cel> the only darkness I need is nightmare rarity
[17:15:33] <Melon_Phone> maybe I was drunk 79% of the time
[17:15:37] <TheRedOne> lol
[17:16:37] <Cel> also... in another reality twilight would make a good mama (movie dredd)
[17:16:45] <TheRedOne> true
[17:17:46] <Cel> pinkamena using the twi-gatling to flush out those nasty judges^^
[17:18:36] <TheRedOne> villainous twilight sounds like a delightful concept
[17:18:47] <TheRedOne> I tried my hands at it, it wasn't very good
[17:19:43] <TheRedOne> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/184660/abrasion I think it might need a rewrite
[17:19:44] <FineLine> [ Abrasion - FIMFiction.net ]
[17:19:51] <Melon_Phone> tyrannical princess twirling is a hot fantasy of mine
[17:20:05] <TheRedOne> uh... warning, contains a bit of grimdark I guess
[17:20:11] <Melon_Phone> twilight.  fack off autocarrot
[17:20:22] <TheRedOne> twirling
[17:20:23] <TheRedOne> lol
[17:21:56] <TheRedOne> "Celestia Disapproves? Who cares! Why does everypony in Equestria think what they want is valid!"
[17:21:57] <Cel> I've read that before
[17:22:16] <bad_rooster> buckin dependencies tho
[17:22:18] <TheRedOne> I likely did a lot of shilling that story shortly after I wrote it xD
[17:22:25] <Cel> possible^^
[17:22:39] <TheRedOne> I still feel it needs improvement
[17:25:27] <Cel> maybe if it weren't crystal ponies... they feel like items anyways
[17:26:01] <TheRedOne> well... being a crystal pony does make for easier chiseling stuff off
[17:26:10] <bad_rooster> guys
[17:26:14] <TheRedOne> eh
[17:26:24] <bad_rooster> can you give me your sources.list
[17:26:37] <TheRedOne> sources for what
[17:26:37] <bad_rooster> ?
[17:26:53] <bad_rooster> etc/ap/sources.list
[17:26:55] <Cel> mine won't be much use for you... I'm using tails
[17:26:59] <bad_rooster> aw
[17:27:05] <bad_rooster> snips and snails
[17:27:11] <Melon_Phone> do crystal ponies cook up crystal meth?
[17:27:16] <bad_rooster> Cel: is it normal to only have 1 line in there?
[17:27:22] <Cel> I hope so
[17:27:24] <Cel> no
[17:27:28] <TheRedOne> crystal ponies are crystal meth
[17:27:34] <bad_rooster> Cel: I have been using Jolicloud
[17:27:35] <Cel> most of the time it's at least 2 lines
[17:27:39] <bad_rooster> when I didn't know better
[17:27:49] <bad_rooster> Cel: it's a cloud OS
[17:27:58] <bad_rooster> and it's a bucked up ubuntu
[17:27:58] <bad_rooster> aka
[17:28:03] <bad_rooster> bucked up bucked up ubuntu
[17:28:29] <bad_rooster> I've installed Lubuntu-desktop over it
[17:28:31] <Cel> I don't know... I've never used something like that... usually my system is arch based
[17:28:50] <bad_rooster> Cel: atm I have like 10 different window managers there

[17:29:58] <bad_rooster> Cel: the problem is it's using some bucked up sources
[17:30:04] <bad_rooster> that aren't even online any more
[17:30:15] <Cel> how about you just start over?^^
[17:30:29] <bad_rooster> oh my
[17:30:35] <bad_rooster> is it normal to have
[17:30:39] <bad_rooster> 10 sources.list files
[17:30:42] <bad_rooster> in one folder?
[17:30:47] <Cel> probably not
[17:30:49] <bad_rooster> named differently ofc
[17:30:53] <bad_rooster> but list files

[22:42:32] <princesssluttershy> Wow pre build companies have literally the worst cable management I've ever seen
[22:43:15] <princesssluttershy> His card can fit in the case but the cables are all bunched up in the middle of the case and it's making it really hard to get the card in
[22:46:25] <Flame> D:
[22:46:38] <Flame> I dislike pre-built for the most part...esp since the PSU isn't modular...
[22:47:06] <princesssluttershy> I don't have a modular PSU
[22:50:13] <Flame> Aww :c
[22:50:15] <princesssluttershy> This might be a problem
[22:50:16] <Flame> it's quite good :o
[22:50:18] <Flame> D:
[22:50:25] * Flame helps princesssluttershy somehow
[22:50:26] <princesssluttershy> He doesn't seem to have an 8 pin connector
[22:52:15] <Flame> D:
[22:54:04] <ConnorCat> You can buy 6-8 adapters but chances are psu isnt powerful enough if he doesnt have one
[22:54:46] <Flame> yeah...
[22:57:42] <princesssluttershy> Yeah
[22:58:18] <princesssluttershy> He might have to buy a new PSU :/
[22:58:21] <princesssluttershy> I hope not
[22:58:25] <princesssluttershy> well
[22:58:29] <princesssluttershy> no there's no way
[22:58:33] <princesssluttershy> he has to buy a new one
[22:58:46] <Flame> D:
[22:58:50] <Flame> aww :(
[22:59:12] <princesssluttershy> actually he has a 970 not a 980
