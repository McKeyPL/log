[00:59:06] <Wolfie> aaaaah..
[01:00:08] * ConnorCat is Falstead! 
[01:00:28] <Wolfie> whosat? 
[01:00:56] <RealClop> So he is very open and in your face about his attraction to clopclop which I find a bit weird to be honest but I'm not gonna judge him over it
[01:02:02] <RealClop> However the one thing really disturbing me is that he also sexually talks about real ponies and horses, what he would like to do them, and even done in the past
[01:03:08] <RealClop> I just was just wondering what people think about that and if it's a common thing, even if I'm pretty sure that it isn't
[01:05:00] <cloppyhooves> It's very uncommon for us to want to do stuff with IRL horses :o
[01:05:04] <cloppyhooves> Since they can't consent and it's illegal
[01:05:53] <RealClop> Yeah that's what I figured
[01:06:01] <Squirrelly> I mean beast fetish is one thing, but actually doing it is another
[01:06:18] <Squirrelly> beast fetish is fine, actually doing it is, like cloppy said, illegal and technically rape
[01:07:18] <Squirrelly> ttyl all :)
[01:07:24] <weisey> Well that was really really gross

[01:07:48] <RealClop> Me and a female friend once tried to talk to him about it after he showed us a discussion with a friend about how bestiality is technically rape 
[01:08:07] <weisey> i had what i thought was a pimple right above my butt where my beltline is
[01:08:12] <weisey> but it was kinda deep
[01:08:14] <RealClop> But he just blocks it off saying it would be to sad to give it up
[01:08:31] <weisey> so i poked it with a needle
[01:08:36] <Wolfie> ew
[01:08:42] <weisey> turns out, it was a cyst, not a pimple
[01:09:18] <weisey> so there was like, 5x the ammount of crap i thought was in it

[01:09:21] <iamalion> but some of us do
[01:12:05] <RealClop> Well anyway, thanks guys, I didn't expect it to really be related to clopclop, but i still wanted to see if i might find some insight here
