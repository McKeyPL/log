[10:06:23] <felina> Vulpixbrew: I'll pass that on when squirrelly is around.
[10:06:33] <Cel> me no impressed with battlefront beta... but that was expected
[10:07:34] <Wolfy> it's not out yet D: 
[10:07:55] <Vulpixbrew> tomorrow over here
[10:08:17] <Wolfy> 8th of oct
[10:08:38] <Wolfy> tomorrow here too
[10:09:41] <Cel> we should play together, maybe it's less dissapointing that way^^
[10:09:52] <Wolfy> aww ps4
[10:09:58] <Cel> but really, they've to fix all the things
[10:10:09] <Wolfy> it's a beta after all :P
[10:10:38] <Cel> if those were bugs I'd agree
[10:10:55] <Cel> but I think it's intentional stupidness^^
[10:11:32] <Cel> just like in BF4... the first BF I didn't like at all
[10:13:49] <Vulpixbrew> beta=bugs unless it's one of those betas that are nothing but  asneak peak
[10:14:50] <Wolfy> they've said its a server stress tester
[10:15:17] <Cel> the rocky thingy map is completely unbalanced... rebels always just quit because they can't possibly win
[10:15:56] <cloppyhooves> http://i.imgur.com/1D7FnCs.jpg
[10:17:10] <Cel> oh yes and people complain about the blaster sound... it sounds like the original... I guess they expected episode 1 sound effects
[10:17:38] <Wolfy> I find the sounds to be amazing 
[10:17:48] <Cel> me too
[10:18:28] <Cel> there is a blaster rifle that looks exactly like a mg42... is that canon?
[10:18:33] <Wolfy> yeah
[10:18:47] <Wolfy> all OTweapons were based on irl weapons 
[10:18:57] <Wolfy> I think ww2 stuffs
[10:20:21] <Cel> but most of the weapons don't look exactly like that
[10:20:51] <Wolfy> yeah
[10:21:01] <Wolfy> not all but some 
[10:21:55] <Wolfy> it's mentioned in the Bts stuff
[10:22:57] <Cel> sitting in an AT AT is quite useless but still funny
[10:23:32] <Wolfy> well it's easy kills for the given time
[10:23:47] <Vulpixbrew> I hope every falling death has the wilhelm scream
[10:23:49] <Wolfy> and as they're so big and clunky they only really move in one direction
[10:24:36] <Vulpixbrew> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a14RjFoAOUI
[10:24:39] <Cel> yea and everyone just jumps into an airspeeder or y-wing to destroy it
[10:24:56] <Vulpixbrew> use your harpoons and tow cables go for the legs
[10:25:08] <Wolfy> activate the harpoon! 
[10:25:21] <Wolfy> I like that mechanic in the game
[10:25:23] <Cel> that I haven't seen.. but switching into a tie interceptor is the best
[10:25:34] <Cel> pew pew
[10:26:09] <Wolfy> it's sorta like a balance stuff
[10:26:32] <Wolfy> you have to keep your mouse in the centre of a thing for an X time 
[10:27:04] <Cel> the one time I saw an ATAT fall was when it was shot down... took ages
[10:29:37] <Wolfy> took ages yeah 
[10:29:55] <Wolfy> each at at token gives like 2 minutes of gun time 
[10:30:02] <Wolfy> and then you're kicked out
[10:30:14] <Wolfy> I don't like the cards though
[10:30:25] <Wolfy> the ui could've been made better
[10:31:29] <Cel> also killing rebels is much easier than killing imps... just because of the color... I mean rebels still run around in brown when on hoth... stormtroopers are essentially stealth on hoth
[10:32:50] <Wolfy> don't blame the game, blame the Lucas
[10:33:21] <Wolfy> I agree though
[10:33:30] <Wolfy> and then there's Han in blue
[10:33:30] <Cel> I have to blame the game... rebels do have snow uniforms
[10:34:24] <Cel> also vader... so slow
[10:34:39] <Wolfy> because he is slow
[10:34:40] <cloppyhooves> Good night, you sexy ponies!
[10:34:46] * Cel waves
[10:34:55] <Cel> sure, but luke jumps around like yoda
[10:35:16] <Wolfy> because he's young! 
[10:35:57] <Cel> I vote for silly 3 edged lightsabers for everyone
[10:36:05] <Wolfy> I like how Vader hovers up stairs
[10:36:14] <Cel> :D
[10:37:10] <Wolfy> maybe kylo ren will be a playable hero in jakku
[10:40:10] <Cel> is there a good lore reason why the technology dropped when the imperium was created?
[10:40:19] * Wolfy braids Katiepony's tail
[10:40:24] <Wolfy> technology? 
[10:41:19] <Cel> well the droid tech of the republic is far superior to that of the imperium
[10:42:09] <Wolfy> cloning was dropped because the program on kamino was scrapped or because it was too expensive for the empire to keep it up so it turned to drafting citizens 
[10:42:15] <Wolfy> oh droids
[10:44:29] <Wolfy> the confederacy was disbanded pretty early on
[10:44:42] <Cel> especially droideka... they don't work well against jedi, but they'd work great against rebels
[10:44:54] <Cel> yea, but would they forget the tech?
[10:46:13] <Wolfy> the CIS legacy lived on in the form of the Death Star and imperial battle droiss
[10:46:18] <Wolfy> droids
[10:46:45] <Wolfy> same with cloning, I reckon it became too expensive to keep up so they retired to drafting citizens 
[10:47:37] <Cel> didn't the great george have had the audio replaced so episode 4-6 the troopers all sound the same?
[10:47:53] <Wolfy> yeah..
[10:48:15] <Wolfy> dammit why was the EU made uncanon
[10:48:25] <Cel> because george
[10:48:52] <Wolfy> darthvader-nooo.mp3
