[22:10:00] -ChanServ- ChanServ gives normal users the ability to maintain control
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- of a channel, without the need of a bot. Channel takeovers are
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- virtually impossible when a channel is registered with ChanServ.
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- Registration is a quick and painless process. Once registered,
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- the founder can maintain complete and total control over the channel.
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- Please note that channels will expire after 30 days of inactivity,
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- or if there are no eligible channel successors.
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- Activity is defined as a user with one of +FHORafhoqrsv being on the channel.
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- Successors are primarily those who have the +R flag
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- set on their account in the channel, although other
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- people may be chosen depending on their access
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- level and activity.
[22:10:00] -ChanServ-  
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- Commands can also be given on channel by prefixing one of '!'
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- and omitting the channel name. These are called "fantasy"
[22:10:00] -ChanServ- commands and can also be disabled on a per-channel basis.
