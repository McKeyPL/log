[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- ChanServ gives normal users the ability to maintain control
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- of a channel, without the need of a bot. Channel takeovers are
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- virtually impossible when a channel is registered with ChanServ.
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- Registration is a quick and painless process. Once registered,
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- the founder can maintain complete and total control over the channel.
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- Please note that channels will expire after 30 days of inactivity,
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- or if there are no eligible channel successors.
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- Activity is defined as a user with one of +FHORafhoqrsv being on the channel.
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- Successors are primarily those who have the +R flag
[14:52:23] -Pinkamena- set on their account in the channel, although other
[14:52:24] -Pinkamena- people may be chosen depending on their access
[14:52:24] -Pinkamena- level and activity.
[14:52:24] -Pinkamena-  
[14:52:24] -Pinkamena- Commands can also be given on channel by prefixing one of '!'
[14:52:24] -Pinkamena- and omitting the channel name. These are called "fantasy"
[14:52:24] -Pinkamena- commands and can also be disabled on a per-channel basis.
