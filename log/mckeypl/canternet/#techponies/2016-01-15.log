[00:11:32] *** Divide|Tech is now known as Divide
[00:12:50] <Colgate> the netflix thing is funny, they can't possibly know whether I went through a VPN or not

[00:15:52] <NyanCat> Colgate, sure they can 
[00:16:00] <Colgate> how?
[00:16:34] <NyanCat> Well, the IP address, of course
[00:16:43] <Phase> the usual trick is to try connect to a vpn/proxy on the ip your connecting from
[00:16:48] <NyanCat> I'm sure that netflix is determining if the iP belongs to a residental assignment or a hosting company
[00:16:51] <NyanCat> and if it is a proxy 
[00:16:59] <Colgate> Phase: that's why you secure it
[00:17:01] <NyanCat> *able to determine
[00:17:02] <NyanCat> sorry
[00:17:26] <Colgate> NyanCat: and you don't think that's going to become a thing? residential IP VPNs as a service
[00:17:37] <NyanCat> It already is a thing
[00:17:41] <Phase> Colgate, doesn't matter if it's secure or not, if they can syn/ack on common ports that's good enough
[00:17:47] <NyanCat> There's an ISP in I think sweden that does it
[00:17:50] <Colgate> Phase: change the port, done
[00:17:53] <Phase> it's not hard to work around that

[00:18:23] *** Creeps|AFK is now known as RedHelper
[00:18:42] <Colgate> although if they banned me from using it because I run a personal VPN on my own IP, I'd complain
[00:18:42] <Googie> If Netflix tried, they certainly could catch a large number of VPNs really easily
[00:18:45] <Phase> Colgate, they can't know in all cases though yeah
[00:19:00] <Googie> Not 100% effective, but 95% is probably good enough
[00:20:04] <johnsey> might be more the false positives they're worried about
[00:20:09] <Phase> you can make it costly on vpn hosts

[00:20:34] <johnsey> people might just switch to other streaming services if they get problems using netflix
[00:20:42] <Googie> Nah, I don't think so. False positives could easily be minimized a fair bit.
[00:20:43] <Colgate> depends on the ISP, I know a trick with mine to grab a new IP if I need to
[00:20:58] <Colgate> I'm sure the companies selling VPNs could do that too
[00:21:03] <Googie> I suspect they're just playing it up because they know it's in their interest not to have regional restrictions
[00:21:11] <johnsey> Googie: the thing is, you want to minimize the number of customers that gets banned incorrectly becuase they might just run away
[00:21:43] <JustAberrant> http://www.ponylang.org/ ?
[00:21:43] <PinkiePieBot> [ Pony - High Performance Actor Programming ]
[00:21:52] <johnsey> it's not like they're the only streaming service in town
[00:21:56] <Googie> Yeah, but I'm saying that 99% of commerical VPNs at the moment could be caught with something that has a fairly minimal false positive rate
[00:22:15] <Phase> johnsey, "might just switch to other streaming services" thing is every streaming service has a different set of shows
[00:22:19] <johnsey> i have a feeling they also want the customers behind VPNs ;)
[00:22:30] <Colgate> then those VPN services go down temporarily, then they find other methods that get around it, cat and mouse game that netflix can't win :P
[00:22:31] <Googie> Two people logged in at once from the same IP when they live at other corners of the globe ? Okay, might be family visiting. 5 people consistently at all hours...
[00:22:34] <Phase> because exclusively licensed shows and all that bullshit
[00:22:51] <johnsey> it's just the license holders who really care
[00:22:53] <Googie> Netflix knows where you live via the payment details you provide
[00:23:02] <Googie> Basically, that yeah
[00:23:04] <Colgate> I think by "other streaming service" they mean p2p ;)
[00:23:25] <johnsey> so all they're doing is "best effort" to keep those at bay
[00:23:28] <Googie> They /could/ easily cause a lot of issues to commercial VPN providers, but they won't
[00:23:31] <Phase> that works too
[00:24:11] <Phase> there's a provider here called presto that is slurping up every license it can now that netflix is offically here
[00:24:59] <Googie> It's hilarious that they realized that they couldn't directly beat Netflix, so they started advertising that they were a great companion to Netflix :V
[00:25:43] <Colgate> do they have much choice with netflix's size?
[00:26:02] <Colgate> netflix could probably pay double what this company is paying for those licenses and drive em under
[00:28:57] <Googie> IIRC I think Presto is supported by Telstra or Foxtel something, so they locally have pretty strong backing
[00:29:10] <wolfyshy> wooftel!
[00:29:20] <Phase> telstra and optus have their own services don't they?
[00:29:33] <Googie> Yeah, apparently it's Foxtel that owns it
[00:29:34] <Phase> i know they sell movies and music under some kind of terms
[00:29:46] <Googie> So they already have /all/ the contracts with media companies here
[00:29:51] <Phase> and they're really convinced people want that from them
[00:29:58] <Phase> Googie, true
[00:30:08] * Googie pat pats wolfyshy again. He doesn't want Foxtel. Foxtel is bad.
[00:30:29] <wolfyshy> what about wooftel!
[00:30:33] * wolfyshy wags tail
[00:30:37] * wolfyshy starts her own ISP
[00:30:50] <Phase> wolfyshy, i'd subscribe to wooftel
[00:30:57] <Googie> wolfyshy: Foxtel is a Satellite/Cable TV company. They don't do internet
[00:31:03] <HoneyDrops> Hopefully the whole idea of region-based licensing goes away.  I am glad netflix is working to kill it off.
[00:31:10] <Phase> ^ HoneyDrops
[00:31:18] <Moonlightning> wolfyshy: an ISP run by competent people? Yes please :D
[00:31:20] <HoneyDrops> That said, I am more interested in a download service for media.
[00:31:20] <Phase> then next on the chopping block is exclusive licensing
[00:31:22] * Googie would too, albeit he suspects that coverage may be limited
[00:31:24] <Moonlightning> and sane *
[00:32:23] <Phase> if people didn't pirate game of thrones it'd be nowhere near as popular as it is
[00:32:33] <HoneyDrops> I would rather pay say, 5$ for a movie or 10$ for a 24-26ep season and have a DRM-less file for me to watch as many times as I like on whatever device and no reliance on any company keeping some service alive.
[00:32:59] <HoneyDrops> I'm willing to negotiate on pricing, but not the rest of it.
[00:33:04] <Phase> i'd be happy to buy blu-rays if they weren't $50 each
[00:33:12] <Phase> and you could actually, you know, WATCH them
[00:33:27] * Phase used a licensed player once, unsuccessfully
[00:33:53] <Phase> it spent 2 hours updating itself before declaring that the video card was unsupported
[00:34:12] <HoneyDrops> Same with games, I'll buy a game, but that's all.  Paying for DLC is stupid and so are subscription fees.
[00:34:41] <Phase> DLC used to be called expansion packs and were a significant glob of content
[00:34:46] <HoneyDrops> If they want to charge to pay for server fine, but I then want to option to host things myself (actually regardless, I want to be able to host servers myself)
[00:35:02] <Googie> There's still some games that do DLC well, just a lot less.
[00:35:37] <Phase> generally don't have an issue with dlc
[00:35:52] <HoneyDrops> I think a better model is to let the community create content: modding games should be ubiquitous.
[00:35:57] <Googie> Same, as long as it seems like it took actual effort to make, and doesn't detract from the base game
[00:36:55] <HoneyDrops> A full expansion is fine, say 50% of the cost of the game to add new content and mechanics that is ~50%+ of the original game.
[00:38:19] <HoneyDrops> Also, while less specific to games, EULAs need to go.
[00:39:03] <HoneyDrops> Usage of a program should not be something the vendor has a say in, aside from setting limits for support agreements.
[00:41:56] <Moonlightning> So…for SSH keys…prefer ED25519, then RSA, right?
[00:45:19] <Ola> http://i.imgur.com/aZKaHmx.jpg
[00:46:28] * JustAberrant pictures HoneyDrops in the near future filling out a request form to adjust her screen resolution from the required standard 
[00:49:52] * HoneyDrops would totally just hack it.
[00:50:02] <HoneyDrops> I have absolutely zero qualms about breaking DRM.
[00:50:40] <Moonlightning> …uhh
[00:50:48] <Moonlightning> Are ed25519 keys /supposed/ to be that short?
[00:50:49] <HoneyDrops> Hell, if I had more time, I would break DRM on things I don't even want, just because it should be broken.
[00:51:03] <Moonlightning> I mean, I know they're shorter than rsa keys, but this is REALLY REALLY short O.o
[00:51:28] <JustAberrant> nothing to hack, it's all in the cloud, real computers have long since stopped being made, and the older ones can't connect to internet 2.0
[00:52:05] <JustAberrant> no storage or real processing power, just enough to run the global auth and drm monitoring stuff and of course the remote access stuff
[00:52:10] <HoneyDrops> I will build my own internet, a mesh network made of old routers and radio gear I and others build ourselves.
[00:52:41] <JustAberrant> but how will you avoid the RF triangulation drones, some kind of point to point system? :(
[00:53:08] <JustAberrant> and all the cameras would surely notice you running cables everywhere :(
[00:53:21] <Moonlightning> That's a dystopia now.
[00:53:29] <Moonlightning> It's /illegal/ to create your own networks?
[00:53:53] <JustAberrant> also better hurry up and complete your mandatory twitter posting  or they'll drag you off to the acid mines again :(
[00:54:09] <Moonlightning> That's not /near/future, either.
[00:54:11] <Phase> Moonlightning, ecdsa has much greater complexity in fewer bits than rsa
[00:54:15] <JustAberrant> Monochrome: `terrists could use those networks!
[00:54:20] <JustAberrant> * Moonlightning 
[00:54:24] <HoneyDrops> Wires can be buried, though it does make intercontinental networks harder :(
[00:54:44] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: sure, but that tends to be a fairly noticeable activity ;p
[00:54:57] <HoneyDrops> Local communication is useful, but pales into the idea of a global communication network.
[00:55:04] <HoneyDrops> to*
[00:55:11] * JustAberrant suddenly curious how hard it would be to make a mini tunnel boring machine.. just big enough to run conduit :>
[00:56:49] <Moonlightning> Phase: yeah, but this is literally 68 bytes of base64.
[00:56:53] <Moonlightning> /Wat./
[00:57:13] <HoneyDrops> VLF would work too, lower freq would be harder to triangulate.
[00:57:18] <Phase> 512bit key?
[00:57:27] <Phase> sounds about right
[00:57:33] <HoneyDrops> but the antennas would need to be larger
[00:58:38] <Moonlightning> Phase: 408-bit key (assuming I'm right about the base64)
[01:03:44] <Phase> Moonlightning, still it's something on the scale of rsa gives you 128 bits of complexity for a 4096bit key, ecdsa is closer to 4 to 1 or 2 to 1
[01:03:51] <Phase> i forget the details
[01:04:07] <Phase> it's far more implementation sensitive though, hence the plethora of standards
[01:04:12] <Moonlightning> Ahh.
[01:04:23] <Phase> because the best thing to do with something implementation sensitive is to have many implementations i guess
[01:04:40] <Moonlightning> Well, given that there's no option to choose the key length, I'm just gonna assume the devs know what they're doing :P
[01:05:25] <Phase> i believe it's also quantum safe, there's no know algorithm that breaks ecdsa, unlike rsa which can in theory be rapidly factored with enough qbits
[01:06:23] <Moonlightning> :D !
[01:06:42] <Phase> no ones actually BUILT enough qbits yet but it's a little closer than i'm comfortable with
[01:06:49] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[01:07:08] * Moonlightning is currently switching all his stuff over to ed25519
[01:07:13] <Moonlightning> Well, all the SSH stuff.
[01:07:25] <Moonlightning> And, well, I'll leave rsa enabled on my server server
[01:11:29] * Phase thinks someone's managed to factor 15 into 3 and 5 under experimental conditions
[01:12:18] <Colgate> it isn't close yet, but that's when we want to switch, before it does become close
[01:12:57] <Phase> i douno, it feels like we're one breakthrough away from rsa factoring
[01:13:18] <Phase> commercial quantum computers are decades out, but that's not a problem for many groups
[01:13:28] <Phase> lab conditions are good enough
[01:13:39] <Moonlightning> Hmm…how do I verify one host key using another, if I don't have shell access?
[01:13:48] <Moonlightning> If I /can/ get a shell, I can just log in and `cat` the key
[01:14:19] <Moonlightning> But if I /can't/, all I have to go on is the keys I'm presented with, which is before authentication, right?

[02:04:44] * Moonlightning whimpers…
[02:04:50] <Moonlightning> Now I have to rewrite the whole thing, again…
[02:04:59] <Moonlightning> ;-;

[02:05:35] <Moonlightning> I know.
[02:05:48] <Sour_Sweet> I keep at least 10 (one per week) of all important files on a backup server ;-)
[02:07:45] <Googie> You can simulate quantum computers. It's just exponentially slower as you add more qubits. (From my understanding anyway)
[02:08:01] <mniip> Googie, I'm no good at QM but pretty sure nondeterministic turing machine is not how QM works
[02:09:43] * HoneyDrops knows QM, but doesn't know enough about how computation is built off it.

[04:36:10] <mniip> aji, was it ey-jay-eye?
[04:37:16] * Moonlightning has been pronouncing it ahh-jhee in his head
[04:37:21] * Phase has been internally pronouncing it as aj
[04:37:32] <Moonlightning> As what?
[04:37:36] <Lapsus> a. j. or aj
[04:37:37] <Phase> a jay
[04:37:38] <mniip> Phase++
[04:37:48] <mniip> well
[04:37:51] <Phase> aji, how would you pronounce it?
[04:37:53] <mniip> more like ay-jee
[04:38:27] * HoneyDrops reads it ah-gee.
[04:39:07] <Moonlightning> Yeah, like that. Soft G.
[04:39:21] <Moonlightning> Stress on the first syllable.
[04:39:45] * mniip puts :^) face on
[04:39:48] <mniip> it's pronounced ayi
[04:40:01] <aji> @ everybody,
[04:40:13] <aji> "ay jay eye" is how it's intended since it's initials,
[04:40:24] <mniip> indeed +o everybody
[04:40:29] <aji> but everybody says "ah jee" or "eh jee"
[04:40:41] <Phase> "ay jay eye" is kinda awkward
[04:40:44] <aji> yeah
[04:40:47] <Moonlightning> Yeah
[04:40:52] <mniip> "edgy"
[04:41:04] <aji> and "ah jee" lends itself so well to pronunciation, based on the letters
[04:41:15] <aji> i secretly wonder if people think i'm eastern
[04:41:40] * Phase thought you were partially eastern
[04:42:01] <aji> nope, born and raised american from european-descended family
[04:42:02] <Phase> like a generation or two ago some eastern was mixed in
[04:42:17] * HoneyDrops only goes by HoneyDrops here, and the few voiced instances have been just "Honey"
[04:42:26] <Moonlightning> Honey. x3
[04:42:33] * HoneyDrops squeaks.
[04:42:40] <aji> HoneyDrops: did they know your name at the time or not :^)

[04:46:24] <Moonlightning> Moonlightning. There're three Ns; count them.

[04:46:47] <Moonlightning> Derp.
[04:46:59] <Moonlightning> How's yours pronounced? :o
[04:47:30] <Moonlightning> I've been pronouncing it /m-niihp/

[04:49:50] <mniip> yes

[23:06:38] <HoneyDrops> I think the only good news is that general relativity limits the amounts of suck that can exist in one place, so Apple + TWC will just implode completely into a singularity.
[23:07:03] <JustAberrant> man, TWC is like the village bicycle at this point, everyone gets a ride..
[23:08:12] <JustAberrant> either way, I forsee only good things with apple indirectly getting into the telecom stuff, cause you know, why not..

[23:33:25] <HoneyDrops> I see it ending badly
[23:34:19] <HoneyDrops> I don't think phone companies should ever be making the phones.
[23:34:49] <Phase> does TWC do phones?
[23:35:00] <Phase> fairly sure they don't have a mobile network
[23:35:46] <HoneyDrops> I dunno what they do, I have Comcast.  I despise them, but there are no better choices.
[23:36:17] <Phase> monopolies!
[23:37:37] <HoneyDrops> I argue the owners of the physical infrastructure shouldn't be the one's handling the services on the lines/fibers. 
[23:38:02] <Phase> i'm not sure why internet isn't using a system similar to power or water
[23:38:34] <Phase> you buy from the supplier and there's a network tarrif for the distribution provider
[23:39:14] <HoneyDrops> Because the right people have enough cash and know who to suck off to keep the systems in place that make them more money?
[23:39:55] <HoneyDrops> I think phone and internet should be treated like power & water.
[23:43:14] <CompuDesktop> what would be the easiest way to have ubuntu run a python script when a popup notification shows
[23:43:29] <JustAberrant> mm
[23:43:46] <JustAberrant> write a script (preferably not in python) that grabs the screen every second with import -window root
[23:44:19] <JustAberrant> then calls some tool to do a fuzzy image search for the popup window
[23:44:28] <JustAberrant> and if it finds it, runs your python script
[23:44:30] <Phase> should be able to search by window class
[23:45:04] <JustAberrant> or just scan through ram looking for some kind of key
[23:45:27] <HoneyDrops> Can you just not have whatever is doing the popup notice trigger the script instead?
[23:45:28] <CompuDesktop> JustAberrant: ubuntu has its notification system thingy, not popup windows
[23:45:56] <CompuDesktop> ubuntu uses notify osd
[23:45:57] <HoneyDrops> You should be able to access that via some dbus.
[23:46:00] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: meh, sounds complicated :(
[23:46:09] <CompuDesktop> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD
[23:46:13] <PinkiePieBot> [ NotifyOSD - Ubuntu Wiki ]
[23:46:14] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: right, and would you say the result of this is some kind of window
[23:46:23] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: compared to scanning live system memory? XD
[23:46:28] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: which might pop somewhere on the screen such that you can see it?
[23:46:38] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: like right UP in front..
[23:47:00] <CompuDesktop> JustAberrant: pretty sure its not a window, its in front of everything including system menus
[23:47:17] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: what exactly do you think it is?
[23:47:53] <CompuDesktop> i dont really know
[23:47:58] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: unless it's directly talking to the hardware to draw on top of X it's probably a window ;p
[23:48:01] <CompuDesktop> i know its called notify-osd
[23:48:10] <HoneyDrops> CompuDesktop: you should be able to access the signal that is being sent to the notification daemon
[23:48:29] <Quindo> Anyone manage Enterprise deployments of IOS apps and have issues with the new version of Xcode?
[23:48:41] <CompuDesktop> hmm
[23:48:41] <Phase> oh yeah, dbus-monitor
[23:48:45] <CompuDesktop> maybe this will be easier
[23:48:50] <Phase> could probably match against its output
[23:49:02] <CompuDesktop> is there a way i can run the script when hexchat gets a notification?
[23:49:10] * JustAberrant likes that we throw out the most obvious and direct answer and go for a middle ground :>
[23:49:43] <HoneyDrops> hexchat get or throws?
[23:49:46] <HoneyDrops> gets*
[23:49:48] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: an IRC notification or it's own?
[23:49:58] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: either way it's got a scripting interface so I have to assume so
[23:50:03] <CompuDesktop> HoneyDrops: when someone pings me or sends me a pm
[23:50:06] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: if it's not just an option somewhere
[23:50:12] <JustAberrant> yeah you can definitely do that
[23:50:18] <JustAberrant> at least I really hope you can..
[23:50:21] <CompuDesktop> ok........how?
[23:50:43] <JustAberrant> write a script?
[23:50:45] <HoneyDrops> Like every irc client can do it, except ii.
[23:50:55] * JustAberrant doesn't know the specifics, google it ;p
[23:51:03] <HoneyDrops> but ii could still use external scripts, trivially.
[23:51:08] <CompuDesktop> i have the script i want to run already written JustAberrant 
[23:51:21] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: I meant a plugin script for hexchat
[23:51:43] <CompuDesktop> oh
[23:51:46] <CompuDesktop> uh
[23:51:47] <JustAberrant> you could either adapt it to be a script for hexchat, or probably easier to just write a small script to call yours
[23:51:56] <CompuDesktop> >.>
[23:52:03] <CompuDesktop> i never written for hexchat before

[23:52:27] <PinkiePieBot> [ HexChat Python Interface — HexChat 2.10.0 documentation ]
[23:52:37] <CompuDesktop> ok 1 more thing about python
[23:53:29] <HoneyDrops> Surely you can hook to the ping event.
[23:53:37] <CompuDesktop> if i import a .py file from another directory and that .py file tries to import another .py file, which directory would it import from? the original directory or the one the .py file is in?
[23:54:04] * JustAberrant wrote a script for irssi that replaces "hate* java"  with "love* ponies" :>
[23:54:11] <JustAberrant> unrelated but just feel like mentioning this :>
[23:55:20] <HoneyDrops> Java, I hate.
[23:55:47] <CompuDesktop> no answer to my question?
