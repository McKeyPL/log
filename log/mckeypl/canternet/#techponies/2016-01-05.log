[01:22:29] <Phase> Sour_Sweet, if i were to guess, it's because are large number of businesses do what my current employer does
[01:22:42] <Phase> and never upgrade
[01:23:09] <Colgate> software licenses are extremely expensive
[01:23:11] <Phase> 365 is about the same price as office if you were upgrading every 3 years
[01:23:24] <Sour_Sweet> I'm currently at the point where I'd argue Libre Office works way better than MS Office for most tasks (especially word processing).
[01:23:38] <Phase> Colgate, especially with something like office where the upgrade gives you so little for its cost
[01:23:57] <Colgate> we still have some people at work using office 2000 >.>
[01:24:00] <Phase> Sour_Sweet, tried libreoffice, instantly broke an excel document and we lost a days work
[01:24:19] <Phase> rather, libreoffice worked perfectly, but when it saved the document office 2007 couldn't open it
[01:24:20] <Sour_Sweet> Office 2010 was a pain for power users if you ask me
[01:24:54] <Phase> we've got 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016 running concurrently on the same documents
[01:24:55] <Colgate> isn't office 2007 like, horribly standards incompliant?
[01:24:57] <Phase> i'm a little worried
[01:25:11] <Phase> Colgate, office complies to standards?
[01:25:12] <Sour_Sweet> And my last employer did things in Excel that simply don't belong there

[01:25:43] <Sour_Sweet> Like ordering house keeping services through Excel. NO. PLEASE DON'T
[01:25:48] <Phase> and i have no idea what the exact issue was
[01:26:10] <Phase> libreoffice opened, displayed, and edited the excel file *perfectly*

[01:27:56] <Phase> HoneyDrops, no ones complained
[01:28:03] <Sour_Sweet> 2007 is like the most broken version anyway

[01:29:02] * Phase kinda likes the ribbon, but hates the name
[01:29:25] <Phase> sounds like an internal codename that marketing somehow heard about
[01:29:26] * HoneyDrops still has not encountered this mythical ribbon thing.
[01:29:54] <Phase> HoneyDrops, it's the thing in office where you have a tabbed set of controls instead of toolbars
[01:30:32] <Phase> the real advantage is it's enumerable
[01:30:36] <Sour_Sweet> The only thing I credit Microsoft for is Exchange and it's integration in Outlook. That's actually awesome for larger companies if Outlook would decide to properly follow standards

[02:29:55] <JustAberrant> bleh, way too long, didn't read ;p
[02:31:43] <Sour_Sweet> It mentions Chromebooks. I always found that concept weird. That's a machine class where I believe Linux does indeed make more sense for every users (Might require a dumbed down distro though)
[02:32:27] <HoneyDrops> Well ChomeOS is basically Linux w/ a heavily customized userland (but more normal than Android)
[02:34:00] <HoneyDrops> The problem is every commercial OS vendor is designing their products with their interests superseding the user's -- that is the trend that needs to change.
[02:34:29] <HoneyDrops> (or the interests of other companies, eg: the adoption of DRM to satisfy media cartels)
[02:35:27] <Sour_Sweet> My problem with Chromebooks is that while the concept of a www only machine is great you should still be able to do basic tasks locally, which Chromebooks are not designed for. Also they're to tightly tied to Google's services.
[02:35:29] <HoneyDrops> Software should be built around the user's needs first, what is nice for anyone else comes after that.
[02:36:08] <Sour_Sweet> Even GNU software violates that from time to time which annoys me.
[02:36:49] <Sour_Sweet> E.g. graphical shells, proprietary drivers, firefox ...
[02:36:52] <HoneyDrops> But with the GPL you have the ability to fix it.  If not yourself, you can find someone to change it.
[02:37:28] <HoneyDrops> There are more possible GUI options for X11 than probably every other OS combined.
[02:38:12] <HoneyDrops> Proprietary drivers are a pox, though better provisions to sandbox them and provide support that way could be nice.
[02:38:25] <HoneyDrops> FF I agree with, though there are no better options.
[02:38:45] * JustAberrant prefers open drivers, but propriatary drivers are fine in my books if they work because hardware is still wrought with legit trade secrets
[02:38:46] <Sour_Sweet> It still bugs me that devs try to force you to use the OS/software their way. Another good example is LE
[02:39:22] *** Joins: Asoka_White (Asoka@Pony-5oiveo.net-htp.de)
[02:39:29] <HoneyDrops> My issue with closed drivers is there is too much potential for meddling.  I could see some very nasty stuff one could do with NIC firmware.
[02:40:22] <JustAberrant> sure, but it's not impossible to hide nasty code in plain sight either, and if openssl shows us anything, it's that just cause the source is there doesn't mean everyone (or anyone) is gonna look too hard
[02:41:05] <JustAberrant> either way, to the average person these are non-issues
[02:41:28] <Sour_Sweet> Political needs influence Linux development too much sometimes. While I agree with most of them they sometimes slow down progression heavily at the cost of useability

[02:42:42] <Sour_Sweet> Don't make decisions for the user; Let the user decide. That's what democracy is all about
[02:42:52] <JustAberrant> I've always liked gentoo and slackware for their mostly pragmatic viewpoint, debian leans more towards the ideology over functionality stuff
[02:43:16] <JustAberrant> old topic but I'm still blown away that they went with systemd because it goes against so much of their core mindset
[02:44:01] * HoneyDrops still is wary of systemd.  I still would much rather have seen it be 30(just making up a number) independent projects rather than tight ball.
[02:44:20] * JustAberrant nods
[02:44:36] <JustAberrant> it's the definition of functionality over flexibility
[02:44:56] <JustAberrant> one big cohesive blob to do everything in a smooth integrated way rather than a bunch of pieces that kinda work
[02:45:18] <JustAberrant> more usable and more keyed to the masses, but cuts against the grain 
[02:45:21] <HoneyDrops> I think there are some good ideas in systemd, and there are some utterly stupid ones.  I just wish we could pick and choose what we want and leave the rest.
[02:45:43] <JustAberrant> I just wish it wasn't designed to basically become a defacto requirement
[02:45:59] <Sour_Sweet> I can see benefits of systemd. Not the least of which is that it unifies the Linux experience
[02:46:03] <HoneyDrops> The problem is it "just works" for only a single definition of "works" and not everyone has the same one.
[02:46:10] <Sour_Sweet> But yeah there is always a tradeoff
[02:46:32] <HoneyDrops> See, to me unification is intrinsically bad.  While I have distro's I favor, I like that there are dozens more.
[02:46:41] <HoneyDrops> Diversity is a great thing.
[02:46:49] <JustAberrant> problem is, for the masses it isn't
[02:46:52] <HoneyDrops> Though we could do without the billion ubuntu clones.
[02:47:08] <JustAberrant> at some point the goal became to get linux into everyones hands
[02:47:14] <JustAberrant> and most people don't like flexibility
[02:47:22] <HoneyDrops> If nothing else it makes binary software more painful :D
[02:47:26] <JustAberrant> so we've been losing flexibility in an effort to make linux more accessible
[02:47:31] * Phase finds systemd-based boots far easier to customize
[02:48:07] <JustAberrant> it's not just systemd, in general everything is becoming more about big tightly integrated blobs
[02:48:09] <HoneyDrops> I like OpenRC and BSD style init myself.
[02:48:21] <Phase> i do dislike the systemd/udev merge though
[02:48:26] <JustAberrant> gnome and kde went that way awhile ago, now even lightweight WMs are 
[02:48:40] <Phase> when the reason for merging is pretty much "why shouldn't we merge?"
[02:49:03] <JustAberrant> and yeah, I'm also salty because the systemd stuff broke my gentoo install multiple times ;p
[02:49:26] <JustAberrant> I ended up having to use the damn blacklist for the first time in awhile to prevent shit from getting pulled in
[02:49:47] <HoneyDrops> I've had to do that to keep pulse out
[02:49:55] <Sour_Sweet> I know why I'm not running gentoo/bleeding edge xD
[02:49:59] <HoneyDrops> I capitulated on dbus
[02:50:23] <Phase> dbus is annoying
[02:50:35] <HoneyDrops> I'm still not sure why dbus exists, I swear it's the answer to the question no one ever asked.
[02:50:57] <Phase> ^ and it came about when we already had ipc libraries
[02:50:59] <HoneyDrops> IPC is /solved/ on unix-like systems
[02:51:06] <JustAberrant> pff, tis not ;p
[02:51:19] <JustAberrant> streams havn't been enough since the early 90s ;p
[02:51:25] <JustAberrant> but dbus is still terrible
[02:51:33] <Phase> then use datagrams :P
[02:51:49] <HoneyDrops> Streams, files, pipes/fifo, sockets... etc.
[02:52:07] * JustAberrant can see the benifits of a well designed IPC standard, but dbus ain't it
[02:52:32] <JustAberrant> all those are fine within an application suite
[02:52:43] <JustAberrant> but they suck for chaining together different types of applications
[02:52:57] <JustAberrant> streams are very limited
[02:53:30] * Phase wonders what happened to the old rpc libraries
[02:53:38] <JustAberrant> much as I hate to admit it, OLE (again, not great implementation) is a major asset in windows
[02:53:40] <Phase> i mean was there really something wrong with them?
[02:54:01] <Phase> [rpc idl] -> [language of choice]
[02:54:09] <JustAberrant> I'd actually love to see a more OLE styled IPC 
[02:54:33] <JustAberrant> so you can have a standard list of content types and tell a program "here's a chunk of content of type x" 
[02:54:43] <JustAberrant> it doesn't need to know where it came from, just that it's type x, and it can do its thing
[02:54:54] <JustAberrant> dbus requires too much knowledge of the interface
[02:55:10] <JustAberrant> and is just stupidly complicated for tightly coupled stuff
[02:55:18] <Phase> dbus is weakly typed and everything exists in 3 namespaces
[02:55:51] <JustAberrant> with dbus it feels like you have to trick it into doing what you want, which is just stupid :>
[02:56:14] <mniip> fef
[02:59:44] * HoneyDrops read up on OLE.  meh, I don't see the appeal.  Then again, "drag and drop" was never something I wanted/found use for.
[03:00:09] <Phase> embedding stuff in other stuff
[03:00:26] <Phase> such as videos in powerpoint presentations
[03:01:03] * HoneyDrops refrains from commenting on what she thinks of powerpoint.
[03:01:52] <JustAberrant> well, drag and drop is the obvious
[03:01:59] <JustAberrant> but even for command line stuff it could have uses
[03:03:09] <Phase> journald is nice
[03:03:27] <HoneyDrops> Binary logging just seems like a bad idea to me.
[03:04:08] <HoneyDrops> There are some neat things it can do, I admit, but nothing that couldn't be done with other existing tools.
[03:04:39] <Phase> i douno, the metadata is nice
[03:04:52] <Phase> knowing what wrote what, when, from what scope/unit/selinux context
[03:05:05] <HoneyDrops> You could have every log entry signed, and you can just log that info too in the line.
[03:05:37] <HoneyDrops> How does it handle corruption?
[03:06:03] <Phase> fairly well, it'll skip corrupted lines and won't try append to an improperly closed log
[03:07:13] <HoneyDrops> Can you force it to print out whatever I can get from corrupted entries?
[03:07:20] <HoneyDrops> s/I/it/
[03:07:58] <Phase> don't know
[03:08:29] <Phase> if you can the man page doesn't show it
[03:08:59] * JustAberrant can see the appeal of a binary log for things like meta data
[03:09:01] <HoneyDrops> Is the tool used to handle logs staticly linked?
[03:09:02] <Phase> regardless of storage format being able to query logs is really nice
[03:09:11] <HoneyDrops> Or just links vs libc?
[03:09:13] <JustAberrant> binary tends to be better than text at that in general
[03:09:14] <Phase> you could build a statically linked version
[03:09:22] <JustAberrant> because you don't have to worry about formatting and special chars
[03:09:30] <JustAberrant> you can just say "this next field is x number of bytes"
[03:09:50] <mniip> and now we're discussing handcuffs >_>
[03:09:53] <HoneyDrops> But it makes it hard to use standard tools like sed/awk/grep/less
[03:09:55] <mniip> with freenode staff over skype >_>
[03:10:04] <Phase> HoneyDrops, just pipe out of journalctl
[03:10:22] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: right, which is another reason why an OLE type thing would be nice ;p
[03:10:52] <HoneyDrops> I'll have to remember to build a staticly linked journalctl if I am using systemd…
[03:10:57] <JustAberrant> text streams are limited to one type of information unless the other side knows the format
[03:11:23] <Phase> HoneyDrops, honestly found it easier since it normalizes log retreival, instead of having to know where it puts them
[03:11:27] <JustAberrant> even a binary format that had a concept of channels would be nice
[03:12:04] <Phase> and by default it'll capture stdio
[03:12:18] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[03:12:40] <Phase> so anything you write to run as a service doesn't need anything special for logging, you just printf
[03:15:53] <HoneyDrops> Wait, what does OLE have to do with sed/grep/awk?
[03:17:03] <JustAberrant> the limitations on stream based things are what I said, you're generally limited to one type of data unless you want to do a lot of hackery
[03:17:20] <Phase> o_O
[03:17:34] <JustAberrant> if a programs output could be broken out into multiple channels and some kind of notation to select which channel to work on
[03:17:49] <JustAberrant> it would make inter-app stuff a lot nicer imo
[03:18:11] <JustAberrant> right now this is achieved by making the first program output what the second one is expecting
[03:18:19] <JustAberrant> which is fine if it can do that and if that's all the info you need
[03:18:37] <HoneyDrops> But trying to sed an image makes no sense?
[03:19:59] <JustAberrant> sure, but the meta data output from the image maybe not
[03:20:02] <HoneyDrops> How would one even go about trying to craft a command to do something like that?  `foo ch1> bar, ch2> baz`?
[03:20:31] <HoneyDrops> ( meaning process channel1 with bar, and channel2 with baz )
[03:20:43] <JustAberrant> something like that probably
[03:20:46] <HoneyDrops> But then what if you want baz to use output from bar?
[03:21:14] <JustAberrant> at that point I figure they'd act more like a mesh then a stream of commands
[03:21:15] <HoneyDrops> I think you probably could do that with some combo of tee and grep
[03:21:21] <JustAberrant> where order doesn't really matter any more
[03:21:32] <JustAberrant> you are basically just linking inputs to outputs
[03:21:33] <HoneyDrops> Or fifo's
[03:22:00] <JustAberrant> sure, you can hack it together, but it's messy and fragile and the apps generally have to support it
[03:22:17] <JustAberrant> or it gets even more hacky and fragile with redirecting stdio 
[03:24:12] <HoneyDrops> I guess I'm not seeing how something like OLE would make it any nicer.  Tools still would have to support the input type, at best it means tools might not have to auto-detect the type of the input, but that also means they would have to trust that metadata to be correct.
[03:25:24] *** Quits: Gladiolus (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[03:25:32] <JustAberrant> then input type could easily be text, you just have the option of having multiple of them
[03:28:11] <JustAberrant> also would make error handling a lot more pleasant, which is currently the huge failing point of stringing commands together
[03:29:09] *** Joins: Feld0 (Feld0@Pony-tlsc6h.bchsia.telus.net)
[03:29:17] <HoneyDrops> I can see some neat options having multiple text streams, but I also then immediately see having to make tools to split and merge streams to glue commands together... resulting in a next-gen sed/awk XD
[03:29:51] <JustAberrant> well, ideally there would be an abstract concept of a work item that would be consistent across all streams
[03:30:00] <JustAberrant> and you wouldn't need those kinda glue commands, but yeah, it would happen
[03:30:58] <JustAberrant> so the image data, error data, test meta data, etc would all be tied to work item 1 which represents an image 
[03:33:42] <HoneyDrops> How is the image encoded?  Is there a standard?  Does a tool need to support some set of types?  Does the metadata have a well defined set of fields?  etc.  
[03:35:16] <JustAberrant> sure, but only the tools that care about images need to worry about any of that
[03:35:36] <JustAberrant> also if you came up with such a standard, things like images would probably be part of it due to how common they are
[03:35:43] <JustAberrant> we already have metadata standards for that
[03:39:10] <JustAberrant> either way, definitely makes more sense for graphical desktop applications
[03:39:11] <HoneyDrops> But now tools have to be aware of what they are being passed, you just move the complexity from the "glue" to the programs being strung together.  I would think that added complexity would be more than what is saved in the "glue" as it would have to handle a larger set of cases.  Not saying it can't work, but I see it would impose limits.
[03:39:21] <JustAberrant> where like it or not, people want to be able to drop a thing into a thing and have it just work ;p

[03:45:45] <Sour_Sweet> Mhh is there any standard way to tunnel TCP based traffic through a different protocol for the local machine while preserving the source address for whatever service is spoken to?
[03:47:58] <Sour_Sweet> The only thing I can think of is using a VPN which would not preserve the source address, but at least make the peer somewhat unique. That isn't really a pratical approach for unknown users though.

[03:56:36] <JustAberrant> trying to prevent side channel attacks ?
[03:56:48] <Sour_Sweet> I can't believe we there isn't any development there really. What meta data tell us about the user isn't really new and the best things we have is a VPN or SSH tunnel
[03:57:03] <Sour_Sweet> tells*
[03:57:51] <Sour_Sweet> JustAberrant: Yeah. It's scary what even encrypted traffic can tell people.
[03:57:54] <JustAberrant> well you have to consider where the threat is coming from though
[03:58:14] <JustAberrant> I mean, the internet is gonna add a lot of noise
[03:58:21] <JustAberrant> if your talking within your lan, ok, but even then
[03:58:34] <JustAberrant> not saying it can't be filtered out, it probably can, but good grief ;p
[03:59:22] <Sour_Sweet> I always assume worst case targeted attacks without "them" having physical access
[04:00:22] <JustAberrant> aside from some kind of encrypted tunnel I can't think of any other way to hide that kind of data
[04:00:33] <HoneyDrops> Ideally we'll change the basic protocols and structures to thwart metadata collection, but in the mean time not sure :/
[04:00:34] <JustAberrant> if your talking about just knowing that something is a new session, etc
[04:00:47] <JustAberrant> * you're
[04:01:04] <Phase> Sour_Sweet, ip address alone kinda gives away what you're doing though
[04:01:05] <Sour_Sweet> It's not hard to believe imho that say the Chinese government would do something like that do gain information (even partially automated) for unpleasent people
[04:01:27] <JustAberrant> sure, but as Phase said, just the Ip alone does that
[04:01:43] <HoneyDrops> I still think a keypair "phone" system would be cool.  I could see being able to effectively have a unique "number" to use to communicate with each contact being nice.
[04:01:49] <Phase> and they're not terribly concerned with what you're saying, just who you're talking to
[04:02:01] <Sour_Sweet> Phase: Yeah, but with the encrypted traffic I can probably even tell what sites you're looking at
[04:02:11] <Sour_Sweet> Based on images sizes on articles for example
[04:02:32] <JustAberrant> also, and this is definitely not a popular topic, but law enforcement does kinda need to do their job
[04:02:35] <Phase> true
[04:02:36] <Sour_Sweet> HTTP/2 solves parts of that problem though
[04:03:09] <JustAberrant> if we actually do enter HoneyDrops's dream world where we have untracable private communications and untracable currency, there's lots of bad people out there who will do lots of bad things with those tools
[04:03:11] <Phase> JustAberrant, law enforcement should need probable cause, not unrestricted access which is basically what the US just gave them
[04:03:30] <JustAberrant> oh I agree, it's a balance, just saying they do need _something_
[04:03:32] * Phase remembers hearing CISPA pass
[04:03:35] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: they could do it before computers, they have it better than at any point in human history.  Hell forensic science gives them things they couldn't even dream over decades ago.
[04:03:47] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: right now money is the big thing they've got
[04:03:58] <JustAberrant> i.e. they can trace the money
[04:04:03] <JustAberrant> that's wht BTC is a bit scary
[04:04:13] <JustAberrant> although BTC is still tracable
[04:04:17] <JustAberrant> but if it wasn't
[04:04:22] *** Joins: Valiant (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there)
[04:04:26] <Phase> BTC is a giant public ledger
[04:04:37] <Phase> they would have direct access to every single transaction
[04:04:51] <Phase> it's pseudonymous, non anonymous
[04:04:53] <HoneyDrops> Yes, I know bad people will do bad things and use whatever tools are around, however that upside of private, secure communications overwhelmingly outweights the downsides.
[04:04:59] <Sour_Sweet> I could probably write a protocol on top of HTTPS, but my knowledge on networrking is not good enough to do IP spoofing on a local interface to establish the initial TCP connection
[04:05:20] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: I think only to a certain point
[04:05:32] <JustAberrant> this is why the warrant system exists
[04:05:36] <JustAberrant> which again, is totally broken
[04:05:51] <JustAberrant> but we can't go fully in the other direction
[04:06:01] <Phase> honestly i think we can and should
[04:06:03] <JustAberrant> you only need to look at the UK pre-scotland yard to see how that goes
[04:06:16] <Phase> whats the point of security without liberty
[04:06:22] <JustAberrant> basically if a cop literally wasn't in the room when it happened, you got away with it
[04:06:47] *** Quits: Gladiolus (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:07:05] <JustAberrant> Phase: inspiring quote, but most people want some of both, not all or one or the other
[04:07:25] <Phase> yes but one of these extremes is a police state
[04:07:27] <HoneyDrops> Law enforcement has plenty of tools now.  The US justice system was not intended to be 100% effective.
[04:07:35] <JustAberrant> and most people these days lean towards security (see most people being ok with warrantless wiretaps)
[04:07:47] <HoneyDrops> It's not zero sum.
[04:08:04] <Phase> from what i've seen it considered letting a potentially guilty person go preferable to imprisoning an innocent
[04:08:14] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: not disagreeing, but some of those tools are the ability to trace things
[04:08:20] <HoneyDrops> The problem is we're being "asked" to give up privacy for the appearance of security.
[04:08:44] <HoneyDrops> Like 99% of what the TSA does is pure theater.
[04:08:51] <JustAberrant> well sure
[04:09:01] <Phase> pretty much everything it does is
[04:09:11] <JustAberrant> but that's not really the point
[04:09:16] <Phase> customs has an important job, TSA are pretty much pointless
[04:09:24] <JustAberrant> there is real law enforcement work going on out there alongside the theater
[04:09:51] <JustAberrant> we don't need to give them full access, but we can't shut them out completely
[04:09:58] <HoneyDrops> And they will keep doing their job.
[04:10:43] <HoneyDrops> I'm not saying that they can't get a warrant and try to physically plant a bug in someone's phone.  But there is no excuse to track every phonecall made for any reason.
[04:10:59] <JustAberrant> right, I agree
[04:11:00] <HoneyDrops> End to end encryption is still weak at the ends
[04:11:13] <HoneyDrops> They get a damn warrant and then have to directly compromise one end.
[04:11:36] <JustAberrant> but an untracable system where you can't tell from one end where the other end came from is I think too far
[04:11:44] * HoneyDrops shrugs.
[04:12:25] <JustAberrant> (and yes, burner phones..)
[04:12:25] <HoneyDrops> To me it's the ultimate essence of the first amendment: it is the assurance of free speech/expression and free association.
[04:12:45] * JustAberrant is Canadian, we're a bit more pragmatic ;p
[04:13:24] <Phase> JustAberrant, but why is this system available before there's even a crime?
[04:13:43] <HoneyDrops> Again, will it be abused?  I expect it to, I don't like it as much as the next person, but that's the same for everything.
[04:13:53] <JustAberrant> again, I'm not saying we need to give them any more access or even that the access they have now is justified
[04:14:14] <HoneyDrops> I think the proper way to combat crime is to focus on removing the circumstances that cause people to engage in it.
[04:14:19] <JustAberrant> just saying I don't think the whole "make everything anonymous and untracable" is what we want either
[04:14:37] <Phase> HoneyDrops, for proactive prevention yeah
[04:14:43] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: part of those circumstances is the ability to get away with it
[04:14:55] <HoneyDrops> that's the only long term solution, once people are committing crimes you're just cleaning of the mess rather than fixing things to avoid it to begin with.
[04:14:58] <JustAberrant> there's always going to be an element that will do it because they can
[04:15:18] <JustAberrant> poverty etc drive a lot of crime, but some of it is opportunity
[04:16:16] <HoneyDrops> Well yes, but one can reduce the opportunity or, provide more appealing ones.
[04:17:49] <HoneyDrops> For example, the best fix to illegal immigration is we should help make the other place(s) better enough that there is no incentive to come to $YOUR_COUNTRY.
[04:18:25] <HoneyDrops> Fix the actual problem, not try to paper over the symptoms.
[04:20:19] <Sour_Sweet> No, no, no listen to German politicans. A fixed limit to how many refugees can come to Germany that is illegal and nobody will ever care about totally is the solution. </sarcasm>
[04:22:17] <HoneyDrops> The best way to fix any problematic behavior is always to reduce/remove incentives that cause people to engage in it.  More carrot, less stick -- if you insist on operating at the basest level of moral development.
[04:23:33] <HoneyDrops> But if people don't do something just for fear of punishment, it's a rather pitiful success.
[04:23:47] <Sour_Sweet> That is sadly also the reasoning behind our complete digital agenda. They (and that's very similar in other countries) make decisions that give you a warm fuzzy feeling and will actually not solve anyone's problems
[04:24:59] *** Quits: Valiant (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:27:42] <HoneyDrops> Well the problems are hard, complex and messy, thus the fixes are long, hard, similarly complex, and most importantly: expensive.  At some level we have to decide to we'd rather invest in a true fix rather than do just enough to say we're doing something.  We're going to have to learn "too expensive" isn't a good enough reason to not try harder.  Though we can also keep going and burn
[04:27:44] <HoneyDrops> tomorrow to pay for today and things will take care of themselves, maybe not the way we'd generally like.

[04:32:20] <Sour_Sweet> Sadly democracy is not designed for long term solutions as people demand easy answers and fixes. We're getting a little deep into politics here maybe ;-)
[04:34:16] <JustAberrant> right, but not unreasonably so either @ now and today
[04:34:30] <JustAberrant> long term thinking is important, but there are problems that do need to be solved within a reasonable time period
[04:37:00] <HoneyDrops> There aren't many major problems that require immediate solutions.  Nor is a long term fix mutually exclusive with short term patches.  However, it might be mutex with a subset of short-term options.
[04:37:34] <JustAberrant> people not wanting to be mugged/stabbed walking home from work is a good short term problem
[04:38:53] <HoneyDrops> I would say, at this moment, the centralization of wealth and power is the primary problem that needs addressing shortly.  After that, I would say environmental problems are next (realistically a year or three doesn't make a big difference, at least not one that couldn't be made up for).
[04:39:15] <HoneyDrops> Yes, people shouldn't have to worry about that, and there are both short term fixes and long term ones.
[04:43:11] <HoneyDrops> Short term: do they really need to be physically present for work?  No?  Stay home.  Could public transit be provided to give them a safer trip if they really do have to schlep around daily?  Could law enforcement look into the areas that are problematic and watch them, and yes they have to go to the "not-white" parts too.  What about when the police are the muggers?  Well no quick fix, but
[04:43:13] <HoneyDrops> implement protocols of accoutnability and transparency (which would go a long way to fixing LE).  A bit longer term work on helping those who are mugging to find more productive things to do with their time.

[05:43:25] <Soarin> My TV supports dnla but my phone isn't seeing it as a device.

[09:48:19] <Moonlightning> I do it fairly frequently, and I NEVER mean /toggle full screen/
[09:48:41] <Moonlightning> If I /meant/ toggle full screen, I would've said control-command-f!

[10:10:47] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: hehe, smilies can be rediculously concise to people who know each other well enough ;p
[10:10:54] <Moonlightning> On the Web, I expect it to toggle pause twice in rapid succession.
[10:10:55] <AppleDash> Agreed!
[10:11:32] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: so what you're really saying is you either don't believe in double clicking as a concept, or frequently double click by accident when you mean to single click
[10:11:40] <Moonlightning> In other words, don't treat it specially. Just do whatever singleclick does twice.
[10:11:44] <JustAberrant> in which case wut, and see a neurologist
[10:11:53] <Moonlightning> No?
[10:12:07] <Moonlightning> It just doesn't make sense to me in this context.
[10:12:21] <Moonlightning> Why double-click, and why fullscreen?
[10:12:27] <JustAberrant> it makes sense to everyone else on the planet ;)
[10:12:42] <Moonlightning> Fullscreen is already bound to both a button and another keyboard shortcut (f or control-command-f)
[10:13:15] <JustAberrant> sure, but everything you can do with a mouse is already bound to something
[10:13:20] <JustAberrant> plus touchscreens
[10:13:28] <Moonlightning> Touchscreen? Tap the button!
[10:13:45] <Moonlightning> It's easier to tap a button on a touchscreen. You don't have to move a pointer. >.>
[10:14:08] <Moonlightning> also, that argument is terrible
[10:14:37] <JustAberrant> well yes, we're arguing a ui design element that has been around since the late 80s ;p
[10:14:41] <Moonlightning> “Let's bind `h, h, h, h, h` in rapid succession to `sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /`! I mean, everything you can do with the keyboard is already bound to something!”
[10:15:00] <Moonlightning> We had video in the 80s? >.>
[10:15:44] <JustAberrant> hehe, actually the idea of a pointer device has been around since like the 40s
[10:15:51] <JustAberrant> I don't know if they had a double click back then
[10:15:53] <Moonlightning> …so?
[10:16:15] <JustAberrant> but Douglas Engelbart's probably did ;p
[10:16:36] <Moonlightning> If you're making a leap from /the double-click is well-established/ to /double-clicking a video should /clearly/ be bound to toggle-full-screen/, then //you// need to see a neurologist :V
[10:16:41] <JustAberrant> and the alto was from around the 70s
[10:17:18] <JustAberrant> double clicking is established as being a separate control from single clicking
[10:17:32] <JustAberrant> I'm arguing that it's logical that double clicking on anything will do something different then single clicking
[10:17:42] <JustAberrant> and that going full screen is a reasonable and logical thing to do 
[10:17:49] <JustAberrant> play/pause is the logical single click action
[10:17:50] <Moonlightning> …okay, this is actually two seperate issues.
[10:18:22] <Moonlightning> 1. /double-click/ should not be bound to /toggle full screen/; 2. /double-click/ should be interpreted as two /single-click/s in this context
[10:18:25] <JustAberrant> and by crazy coincidence, just about every video player out there will play/pause when you single click and go fullscreen/get bigger when you double click ;p
[10:18:43] <AppleDash> I just tried it with VLC, this is the case
[10:19:04] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: right, because it's entirely logical and sane ;p
[10:19:14] <JustAberrant> unlike Moonlightning ;)
[10:19:26] <Moonlightning> Just tried QuickTime. Neither is true.
[10:19:33] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: WHY?
[10:19:49] <Moonlightning> I'm looking for /reasoning/ here
[10:19:59] <JustAberrant> because you have two controls, may as well use them for something, and there's little better to use them for
[10:20:03] <Moonlightning> not just “omg it's obviously the right thing what are you crazy”
[10:20:24] <JustAberrant> why have it repeat the single click action, that serves nothing
[10:20:43] <JustAberrant> unless your users frequently double click when they mean to single click, in which case, why are they doing that
[10:20:52] <Moonlightning> That's what always happens when there isn't a double-click action!
[10:21:17] <JustAberrant> right, but why would anyone depend on that
[10:21:19] <Moonlightning> Got any push buttons handy? Try double-clicking on one and tell me what happens.
[10:21:49] <Moonlightning> I frequently hit the spacebar in rapid succession when I'm looking for something in a video that's only in a few frames
[10:22:01] <JustAberrant> there's nothing logical for a push button to do as a second action
[10:22:12] <JustAberrant> for controls where there is a second action, double clicking usually triggers it
[10:22:19] <Moonlightning> And there's nothing logical for a VIDEO to do as an action.
[10:22:23] <Moonlightning> That's what /buttons/ are for.
[10:22:45] <JustAberrant> well I guess the universe and you will have to agree to disagree
[10:25:10] <Moonlightning> You're making awfully broad claims without sufficient justification :V
[10:25:29] <JustAberrant> that's how one argues on the internet!
[10:25:45] <Moonlightning> Not when one is trying to have an actual discussion!
[10:25:58] <Moonlightning> Also, clearly, at least a few people at Apple agree with me, given the behavior of QuickTime
[10:27:05] <JustAberrant> I can't have serious conversations about these sort of topics :(
[10:27:14] <Moonlightning> -.-
[10:27:37] <AppleDash> I bet the one guy 20 years ago who wrote QuickTime 1.0 agrees with you
[10:27:47] <AppleDash> It's the same app, they've just been updating the skin
[10:28:02] <Moonlightning> The UI changed rather significantly in Snow Leopard (IIRC)
[10:28:03] <JustAberrant> :>
[10:28:10] <Moonlightning> since then, it's been minor, but that was pretty big
[10:28:52] <Moonlightning> As of then, videos take up the entire window, including the title bar; controls are overlaid towards the bottom
[10:29:12] <Moonlightning> It would not have been /possible/ for the single-click binding to exist prior to that change.

[11:25:08] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Austin Computers says it should be compatible with the PSU I bought from them.
[11:25:34] <JustAberrant> doesn't mean it's true ;p
[11:25:43] <JustAberrant> what PSU do you have
[11:27:06] <JustAberrant> plug your machine into a killowat or similar with the old vid card and see how much wattage it draws on post, if it's close-ish to the rating on your PSU might be the problem
[11:27:21] <JustAberrant> could also be some kind of firmware issue, bus issue, etc
[11:27:30] <JustAberrant> but my first guess would be insufficient power
[11:28:14] <JustAberrant> if you look up the manual for your mobo it should tell you what 5 beeps _actually_ means, but the actual meaning can be misleading
[11:28:24] <JustAberrant> because it'll give you the detected symptom, which isn't always the actual cause
[11:28:45] <JustAberrant> i.e. you might get a "processor error" because your overloading your PSU 
[11:29:01] <RazorSharpFang> How would I get the power from the PSU?
[11:29:12] <RazorSharpFang> Am I looking for numbers?
[11:29:18] <JustAberrant> look up the spec on the model
[11:30:09] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: the PSU will usually have the wattage on it, if not look for something model-number-ish

[11:30:42] <RazorSharpFang> I was the 'assister'
[11:31:03] <JustAberrant> a lot of box store computers have borderline PSUs
[11:31:22] <RazorSharpFang> The PSU is a Cooler Master Centurion 5
[11:31:39] <RazorSharpFang> 500 Watts, it says
[11:32:02] <JustAberrant> what vid card?
[11:32:10] <RazorSharpFang> Graphics card is a Nvidia GeForce GTX 950
[11:33:06] <JustAberrant> mm, probably draws around 90W
[11:33:35] <JustAberrant> silly question but does it have an aux power input that you didn't hook up?
[11:33:40] <RazorSharpFang> It's got a couple of hard-drives in there, along with a DVDReader
[11:34:53] <JustAberrant> yeah, 500W should be plenty for that vid card and processor (assuming it's not a top of the line i7 or something)
[11:35:01] <RazorSharpFang> It's an i5
[11:35:07] <JustAberrant> yeah should be fine
[11:35:16] <RazorSharpFang> i5 2400
[11:35:37] <RazorSharpFang> Would it behave better if I unplugged a HDD?
[11:35:51] <JustAberrant> probably not, HDD's actually don't use a lot of power
[11:36:03] <JustAberrant> processor and vid card are the big users
[11:36:10] <JustAberrant> mobo might draw 50 to 100
[11:36:17] <JustAberrant> processor probably draws 100

[11:37:31] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, I've plugged it in, and it glows white instead of red when plugged in.
[11:37:45] <RazorSharpFang> It had these issues with the old graphics card too, but they are worse now.
[11:38:14] <RazorSharpFang> Like, it had 50% boot failure, and now it's 100%
[11:38:21] <JustAberrant> that just screams power issue to me :(
[11:38:26] <JustAberrant> look on the mobo for leaking caps?
[11:38:34] <RazorSharpFang> leaking caps?
[11:38:40] <JustAberrant> could also be ram and the vid card could just be coincidence
[11:38:53] <RazorSharpFang> Nah, error code is specifically for video output.
[11:39:05] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: the little canister like things dotted around the motherboard, when they go bad they often leak
[11:39:24] <JustAberrant> it's a sign or cause of bad power ;p
[11:39:28] <RazorSharpFang> Do you mean leak power of physically leak?
[11:39:48] <JustAberrant> physically, you'll see a brown like crust on the top
[11:39:58] <JustAberrant> or the top will be ballooned out
[11:40:09] <RazorSharpFang> If I do see this, what should I do?

[11:40:30] <JustAberrant> not much you can do, minimum replacing mobo, possibly PSU if it was the cause
[11:40:54] <JustAberrant> ideally if you have a second PSU would be worth hooking it up and seeing if the problem persists
[11:42:01] <JustAberrant> also if you have another free pci slot, switch to that
[11:42:05] <JustAberrant> pci slot could just be garbage
[11:44:07] <Divide> Or, of course, you might have just had the extremely bad luck of getting a bad video card.
[11:44:27] <Divide> But with errors on the old video card, that's unlikely...
[11:44:49] <Divide> You could try cleaning the contacts on the PCI slot.
[11:47:05] <JustAberrant> definitely at the grasping at straws stage ;p
[11:47:27] <JustAberrant> I'd guess bad psu, bad mobo in that order ;p
[11:47:38] <Obaskyr> PSU's popped?
[11:47:49] <JustAberrant> but without parts to swap in/out it's hard to diagnose that
[11:48:00] <Divide> Yeah, the PSU sounds the more likely culprit, when you put it that way.

[11:48:51] <JustAberrant> if you can borrow a friends PSU (assuming you don't have one laying around) I'd recommend it, short of some serious electrical gear it's hard to actually test a PSU under load ;p
[11:49:43] <JustAberrant> and a lot of times they don't straight up die, they just put out dirty power which causes parts to not work properly and eventually the mobo to not post at all (the mobo basically waits for power to stabilize before actually turning on)

[11:53:10] <JustAberrant> a failing drive or vid card can still totally cripple all the things :>
[11:53:25] <Moonlightning> if it's the root fs, that's fairly understandable
[11:53:27] <JustAberrant> not to mention that regardless of mount options, nfs dropping will also fuck all the things pretty good
[11:53:37] <Moonlightning> but the BACKUP filesystem?
[11:53:39] <Moonlightning> fuck no.
[11:53:54] <Moonlightning> or, y'know, anything that isn't root or basic support (/usr, /var, etc)
[11:54:07] <JustAberrant> in theory sure, in practice no ;p
[11:54:17] <Moonlightning> :/
[11:54:19] <JustAberrant> do you have anything on the path or in the environment referencing the backup volume?
[11:54:25] <JustAberrant> cause the path will totally do that
[11:54:27] <Moonlightning> Um, no?
[11:54:30] <Moonlightning> why would I do that?
[11:54:35] <Moonlightning> it's not even mounted all of the time
[11:54:52] <Moonlightning> still, any lockups should be limited to the tmux /subprocesses!/
[11:54:52] <RazorSharpFang> Some progress: It is now failing to boot at all with the old graphics card
[11:55:09] <Moonlightning> like all those shells I broke and then killed their panes
[11:55:16] <Moonlightning> All that was fine; I'd been doing it for days!
[11:55:27] <Moonlightning> but then I did it with Python, and tmux just lost its mind
[11:55:41] <JustAberrant> :>
[11:55:55] <JustAberrant> it's python, who knows :>
[11:56:05] <Moonlightning> that's not how this works!
[11:56:10] <Moonlightning> that's not how any of this works!
[11:56:30] <Moonlightning> tmux is broken somehow :\
[11:56:35] <Moonlightning> I should file a bug report
[11:57:30] * JustAberrant closes, works4me
[11:57:40] <JustAberrant> actually not true, I use screen ;p
[11:57:48] <JustAberrant> tmux is for hipsters and lawyers
[11:57:51] <Moonlightning> on an unrelated note, everything is so smooth and responsive now <.<
[11:57:55] <Moonlightning> :I
[11:58:11] <Moonlightning> It's ridiculous how laggy and…shitty, shit gets with long uptimes
[11:58:16] <Moonlightning> I really need to drop OS X…
[11:58:34] * JustAberrant doesn't have many boxes with a serious uptime any more
[11:58:57] <Moonlightning> This one was respectable.
[11:59:03] <JustAberrant> I used to have an old 486 that I kept alive when moving it across a room by moving rhe UPS it was connected to with it
[11:59:06] <Moonlightning> It was late August, IIRC
[11:59:17] <JustAberrant> which involved dismantling a shelf that the cord was looped through ;p
[11:59:42] <Moonlightning> What's the program I'm thinking of that shows past sessions and reboots?
[11:59:53] <Moonlightning> It's a relative of `w` or `who` or something, uses ?tmp…
[12:00:14] <JustAberrant> arg@lyra ~ $ ssh lick.int uptime
[12:00:14] <JustAberrant> arg@lyra ~ $  06:59:37 up 177 days,  8:57,  0 users,  load average: 0.03, 0.17, 0.08
[12:00:18] <JustAberrant> best I've got
[12:00:26] <Moonlightning> well, that doesn't help AFTER I've rebooted <.<
[12:00:29] <JustAberrant> also that box would make you weep

[12:03:02] <JustAberrant> it's a file server with no connection to the internet
[12:03:03] <JustAberrant> but still
[12:03:07] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: you want last
[12:03:27] <JustAberrant> I probably should kill ssh on it and just do anything on local console, but meh
[12:03:37] <RazorSharpFang> Oh shoot. I took off the heat sink to clean it, but several plastic parts fell off - it's not going back in.

[12:04:02] <JustAberrant> niiccee :>
[12:04:14] <Moonlightning> Thanks, AppleDash
[12:04:16] <JustAberrant> yeah best I ever had was that 486, and that was only like 2 years and something
[12:06:04] <Moonlightning> 2015, August 26. 11:30 UTC.
[12:09:15] <Divide> Boot time of my desktop... 19th November, after a long power outage.  So not bad.
[12:14:11] <AppleDash> johnsey: I had ~900 days on a box once and then the host node had a hardware failure
[12:18:15] <JustAberrant> well, at least I can say my file server has been up since the day I moved into this house ;p
[12:18:26] <AppleDash> UPS it

[12:18:43] <wolfyshy> one day off from beating JustAberrant's e-peen
[12:18:44] <AppleDash> And then keep that true for years
[12:19:00] <Moonlightning> ugh, now weechat can't listen
[12:19:01] <JustAberrant> hehe, UPSen are only good for short term power failures
[12:19:07] <AppleDash> Chain UPS
[12:19:07] <Moonlightning> can't assign requested address
[12:19:16] <AppleDash> And/or use a car battery with your UPS
[12:19:25] <JustAberrant> the one we have at work will keep the whole damn server room going for about an hour
[12:19:30] <AppleDash> o.o
[12:19:32] <JustAberrant> but the fucker costs more than my car
[12:19:34] <Moonlightning> …EADDRNOTAVAIL?
[12:19:36] <AppleDash> lol
[12:19:41] <Moonlightning> who came up with these names?
[12:19:43] <JustAberrant> at that point you need a backup generator ;p
[12:19:50] <Moonlightning> They're, like, arbitrarily limited.
[12:19:58] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: the POSIX committee
[12:20:03] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: C programmers, it's how they speak
[12:20:08] <wolfyshy> and it's because they have to interop with pre-ANSI C
[12:20:24] <wolfyshy> that's older than uh, probably everyone in here
[12:20:32] <AppleDash> Not JustAberrant
[12:20:37] <AppleDash> Legend has it he is older than time itself
[12:20:42] <Moonlightning> You have EPERM and ENOENT
[12:20:47] <JustAberrant> I'm only old in spirit
[12:20:47] <Moonlightning> and then this fucking thing, EADDRNOTAVAIL
[12:20:51] <AppleDash>  read that as EPEEN
[12:20:56] <wolfyshy> No Entity
[12:21:18] <Moonlightning> yeah, but they could've //spelled out// /no entity/ in the space they took for EADDRNOTAVAIL
[12:21:31] <wolfyshy> I think that one was introduced in BSD Sockets
[12:21:41] <wolfyshy> so that's closer to 1989 or 1990
[12:21:44] <wolfyshy> or was it 87?
[12:21:47] <wolfyshy> when WAS 4.3?
[12:22:20] <Moonlightning> …FUCKING DAMMIT
[12:22:29] <Moonlightning> I lost all those fingerprints I took way too long to verify
[12:22:32] <JustAberrant> hehe, I was alive but hadn't welcomed unix into my life ;p
[12:22:44] <Moonlightning> could've SWORN I'd `/save`d after that
[12:23:07] <Moonlightning> fucking uplink
[12:23:16] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: you were alive in 1970s? :o
[12:23:17] <Moonlightning> it should not take an hour and a half to download an OS
[12:23:18] <wolfyshy> oooooold
[12:23:33] <JustAberrant> I meant mid/late 80s ;p
[12:23:55] <wolfyshy> oh I was talking about pre-ANSI C
[12:24:03] <JustAberrant> yeah no, I'm not that old ;p
[12:24:04] <AppleDash> I always thought ENOENT was No Entry
[12:24:10] <AppleDash> Like a directory entry or something
[12:24:22] <Moonlightning> oh, that'd make sense too!
[12:24:31] <Moonlightning> it also means that :P
[12:24:55] <Moonlightning> Just not /no entry/ as in /this is a one-way street/
[12:25:00] <AppleDash> lol
[12:25:07] <Moonlightning> or /this building is condemned/
[12:25:17] <Moonlightning> or /authorized personnel only/
[12:25:57] <AppleDash> I have a comment but I will withold it in this channel
[12:26:16] <Moonlightning> …okay, I moved /var/tmp and /usr/local back into place, so I have to remember to move them aside again before I start the update
[12:26:30] <Moonlightning> or else I'm gonna lose a ton of stuff and it's going to take several times longer than it needs to
[12:27:16] <Moonlightning> copy-verify-delete only applies across volumes, dumbasses…on the same volume, all it does is waste everyone's time and thrash the disk.

[12:40:20] <wolfyshy> you know, on #EvilInitPackage the other day, someone was ranting about "why do people anthropomorphise software"
[12:40:30] <wolfyshy> "why do you like or dislike software, it's just software, you can't like or dislike it"
[12:40:34] <AppleDash> That brings me to some page that my browser seems to have filtered for some reason
[12:40:44] <AppleDash> I'm not really sure how you expected that link to work for me
[12:40:47] <wolfyshy> and I was like "so your box is dead?"  "yeah"  "dead like something that was alive, something anthropomorphised?"

[12:44:12] <mniip> christel has hinted at it, and a bunch of people like adran are sure of it
[12:44:32] <mniip> and the fact that uptime, too, has gotten a funny cloak 2 days before
[12:46:14] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: if you haven't figured it out yet, I /remembered/ that, and typed it out :P
[12:46:41] <mniip> shrug

[18:41:23] <Moonlightning> Well, stop. This is IRC, not Twitter.
[18:41:58] * HoneyDrops still doesn't get twitter.
[18:42:12] <Moonlightning> Unless there's a lot of concurrent conversations that make following them individually hard, nopony's going to ping everypony involved with every message.
[18:42:14] <Sour_Sweet> "grep Sour_Sweet irc.canternet.#techponies.weechatlog | tail -n 10" :P
[18:42:31] <Sour_Sweet> I'm way too lazy to download the baclog.
[18:42:45] <Sour_Sweet> back*
[18:43:06] <HoneyDrops> I consider it a bit rude, unless it's and RP and the tempo is 10+ minutes between posts.
[18:43:12] <HoneyDrops> an*
[18:44:25] <Sour_Sweet> Weechat says there are more than 4k lines I didn't read. No way I'm going to go through all of that
[18:44:59] <Sour_Sweet> I scim read backlogs if there is time, but currently I don't have much
[18:44:59] <Moonlightning> There are about two dozen lines relevant to this conversation.
[18:45:01] <Moonlightning> No more than three.
[18:45:52] <Sour_Sweet> When I change my nickname indicating I'm not here people will have to deal with me not reading their messages
[18:47:18] <Moonlightning> When you reply to a conversation that you weren't previously in, you will have to deal with people not repeating everything that you missed, just so you don't have to scroll up. :V
[18:48:32] <HoneyDrops> I woke to 500 lines in here, I skimmed.
[18:48:38] <Sour_Sweet> No. You mentioned my name. That's why I replied and I only replied to that message
[18:48:46] <HoneyDrops> I didn't bother with most of esper or freenode.
[18:49:04] <Sour_Sweet> I have no iday what the topic was before I joined. I didn't read a single line
[18:50:09] <Sour_Sweet> 2016-01-05 08:17:23	Moonlightning	Sour_Sweet|BNC: How does LE try to force you into their way? Isn't the ACME API completely open?
[18:52:09] <Moonlightning> …oh.
[18:52:35] <Moonlightning> CAs having $n-day policies is “forcing you into their way”?
[18:57:47] <Sour_Sweet> A CA forcing you to renew/reissue a cert every 90 days is pretty new. Industry standard is somewhere between 1 to 3 years
[18:58:32] <Moonlightning> So it's not a bad thing for `n == 365`?
[18:58:37] <Moonlightning> When /is/ it a bad thing?
[18:58:46] <Sour_Sweet> Considering the longest topic on their forums is just about that topic one would imagine an awful lot of people disagree.
[18:59:44] <Sour_Sweet> Moonlightning: It's not a problem for all applications, but for some it is. How large the minimum time interval must be depends on your application.
[19:00:55] <Sour_Sweet> For IRC servers 90 days (60 if you want a reasonable time frame for failure safety) is too low.
[19:01:11] <Sour_Sweet> But that's just one example out of many.

[20:54:28] <Sour_Sweet> "Wireless" "Home Security" that's already enough for a fail
[20:55:43] <Sour_Sweet> Signal jammers are a thing for ages. ....
[20:58:24] <Googie> It wouldn't bad quite as bad if it failed closed; if the signal is lost for X amount of time, set off the alarm
[21:00:26] <Sour_Sweet> Except for the sensors are battery powered.
[21:01:38] <JustAberrant> hehe, the house I bought had an ADT smartwatch system
[21:01:39] <JustAberrant> yeahhhhh
[21:02:06] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah sure one could implement sanity checks (Is it likely that all devices fail at the same time? Battery status protocol etc.), but if you ask me everything security related should be wired.
[21:02:11] <JustAberrant> wireless sensors, default installer password, box and siren clearly visible from the front entrance
[21:02:15] <AppleDash> lol
[21:02:40] <JustAberrant> I mean I don't use it anyway, though am considering wiring it up toa pi or something to send me a message when doors are opened
[21:02:49] <JustAberrant> fuck paying for monitoring :>
[21:05:21] <HoneyDrops> just hook it up to a nice surplus civil defense raid siren
[21:05:44] <HoneyDrops> someone breaks in and everyone in 5 miles will know
[21:13:47] <RazorSharpFang> I'm pretty sure that might violate some noise rules.
[21:14:23] * JustAberrant honestly more concerned about annoying the neighbours with false alarms
[21:15:23] <RazorSharpFang> Pretty sure you forgot 'is' there with your /me. But yeah, makes sense.
[21:15:26] <JustAberrant> but yeah, most residential alarm systems are a joke

[23:23:12] <Quindo> HAZZA!  My test load is crashing my phone!
[23:28:12] <RazorSharpFang> Is that success or failure?
[23:29:46] <Quindo> yes
[23:30:00] <RazorSharpFang> Is that a bug or intended? XD
[23:30:38] <Quindo> technically it is a bug, but that is what you get for extending a single frame that long.
[23:31:15] <Quindo> So I just need to shift it to generating a portion of the test load for each frame until it hits the volume I want.
[23:31:30] <Quindo> I am trying to simulate the state ofthe device after a week or so of use.
[23:34:34] <Quindo> but that involves quite a bit of data randomization and read/writes.

[23:43:25] <RazorSharpFang> So, simulate how the device responds to typical use, but you'd not want to wait X duration, so you use an increased load?
