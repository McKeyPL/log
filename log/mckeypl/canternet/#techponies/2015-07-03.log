[21:57:09] <Dew> hello
[21:57:51] <Dew> any one here
[21:57:57] <Dew> to help with botserv`s bots. 
[21:58:40] <Colgate> what of them?
[21:58:49] <Colgate> oh, that's yo
[21:58:51] <Colgate> no
[21:58:52] <Moonlightning> While you can ask here as IRC stuff is generally within the #techponies scope (at least as I understand it), that question is also eligible for #help
[21:59:24] <Moonlightning> Note that the BotServ bots are glorified instances of ChanServ. You can't make e.g. custom triggers.
[21:59:36] <Moonlightning> They'll handle what you can do through ChanServ and that's about it.
[21:59:41] <Colgate> Moonlightning: no, they want 100s of botserv bots in a channel to make it look active
[21:59:49] <Colgate> "active"
[21:59:49] <Moonlightning> Oh.
[21:59:52] <Moonlightning> Yeah, no, that's not happening.
[21:59:56] <Colgate> which is stupid and no, not happening
[21:59:57] <Dew> how can i make them, join into channel?
[22:00:08] <Colgate> /botserv assign #channel botname
[22:00:10] <Moonlightning> Well, you can only have one at a time, and you can't have one /and/ ChanServ
[22:00:15] <Moonlightning> But yeah, use `assign`
[22:00:27] <Dew> i want to make them join  in my own network bro
[22:00:29] <Dew> not here.
[22:00:40] <Dew> here i understood already your rules
[22:00:57] <Moonlightning> Same restrictions, unless you fork the services package.
[22:01:00] <Moonlightning> With Atheme at least
[22:03:24] <Dew> like we make them join via this command in anope.
[22:03:30] <Dew> ./os client bsjoin #channel
[22:03:33] <Dew> they all join there.
[22:03:41] <Colgate> then use anope
[22:03:44] <Dew> which module can support atheme to do like this?
[22:03:46] <Colgate> none
[22:03:48] <Colgate> use anope
[22:04:57] <johnsey> you could write one :p

[22:56:30] <Webster> Main thing is how many users it can support and coverage. Not sure if they list coverage or just power output.
[22:58:48] <MistVeil> The dbm, right?
[22:59:43] <MistVeil> Along with the antenna gain, yup. I found a calculator
[23:00:54] <MistVeil> Oh, wait, the site lists the coverage already
[23:04:55] <Webster> Yeah. Want the coverage to be a little more than the size of the restaurant. You can go for more, if you can't match it up all that well.

[23:12:36] <MistVeil> This one has 600ft of coverage, more than enough to cover the whole place: http://masadmin1.erpweb.mx/mwcrm/sys/inttelecnt/store/unico.php?funk=VerDetalles&par=40&cantactual=2
[23:12:58] <MistVeil> It's in spanish, but the important terms are in english. I think I'll get 2 of those
[23:14:43] *** Joins: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-a49cc7.bigpond.net.au)
[23:14:44] <MistVeil> Or maybe 2 of the previous model to avoid too much interference between both, although both would still be at reach...
[23:15:02] <Webster> B/G/N is good. Only does 2.4GHz, though. Which is not bad, but in crowded areas can be problematic.
[23:15:16] <Webster> 5GHz has a lot less interference from neighboring access points.
[23:17:55] <MistVeil> Hmm... The 5Ghz one is considerably more expensive...
[23:18:18] <Webster> Yeah, Ubiquity is pretty pricey.
[23:18:38] <MistVeil> Is it worth it?
[23:18:51] <Webster> Depends on what you're doing.
[23:19:12] <Webster> Were I doing it for a restaurant, personally I'd probably get a higher-end wireless router with DD-WRT or OpenWRT firmware, and use that.
[23:19:33] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-llq41f.optusnet.com.au)
[23:19:39] <MistVeil> Hmm... Maybe it's worth to invest on the pro one, though: http://masadmin1.erpweb.mx/mwcrm/sys/inttelecnt/store/unico.php?funk=VerDetalles&par=251&sDesdeLista=sok&sDesdeListaPar=a_buscar&sDesdeListaVal=UBNF&nArticulo=251
[23:19:43] <MistVeil> 200 concurrent clients
[23:19:50] <Webster> If you're expecting say 50+ people, it's probably worth it to get a dedicated access point.
[23:20:11] <MistVeil> Definitely
[23:20:14] <Webster> Oh, that's really nice. MIMO for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz.
[23:20:25] <MistVeil> Maybe a single one of those might be enough
[23:20:46] <MistVeil> The coverage is also pretty good
[23:20:52] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn|2 (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:21:20] <Webster> Yeah, a single one would be fine for any restaurant I've ever been to. It's not like if it fails it's going to be an extreme problem.
[23:22:29] <MistVeil> It's a local one, but 50-ish people online at the same time sounds like a suitable reference
[23:22:57] <MistVeil> I'll get one of those, then, and perhaps another for the office, one of the low-end ones
[23:22:59] <Webster> Yeah. That AP is probably overkill, but you likely won't need to touch it for a decade.
[23:28:21] <MistVeil> Worth it
[23:28:41] <MistVeil> After all the masking tape I had to use during the previous management, I'm going all overkill on stuff here
[23:29:35] <MistVeil> Cat6, Routerboard rack router, GBit TP-Link enterprise switch, replacing PCs with fairly decent hardware as they go bad (the old ones), etc.
[23:30:03] <MistVeil> Somewhat proper cable management at the server room (since I had no real experience save what I'm doing to it)
[23:32:43] <Colgate> cable management on racks takes a lot of effort
[23:32:48] <Colgate> but it really helps
[23:33:09] <Moonlightning> reddit:r/cableporn, MistVeil
[23:33:34] <Webster> Heh, nice.
[23:33:40] <MistVeil> Moonlightning: I always check it on my free time, although I can't manage such tidy work
[23:34:10] <MistVeil> Gimme a moment, I'll snap a photo of how it looks right now (I have no point of comparison, though)
[23:34:24] <Moonlightning> I just gave you one. xD

[23:56:53] <MistVeil> IMGUR, why don't you let me create a link to this album!?

[23:58:47] <Moonlightning> If you upload an album, don't you just get 303d to the /a URI?
[23:59:32] <Moonlightning> oh, wow, yeah…that's not good.
