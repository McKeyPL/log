[00:19:22] <AppleDash> Guys, help
[00:19:27] <AppleDash> I have a microwave
[00:19:36] <AppleDash> USually I do things for like 2 or 3 mins, works fine
[00:19:49] <AppleDash> I tried to cook something for 5:30 yesterday, it blew a fuse, I replaced it
[00:20:11] <AppleDash> I tried to cook something for 5:30 today, it blew the fuse again, I replaced it like 1 min later and then tried to cook something for 2:30
[00:20:14] <AppleDash> It blew the fuse again
[00:20:25] <AppleDash> Any idea what could be going on?
[00:20:41] <AppleDash> I have no idea what point along the line it blows, I've been out of the room the whole time but the food hasbeen hot after the blowing
[00:28:05] <HoneyDrops|Half> The breaker is tripping?  Or is an in-appliance fuse blowing?
[00:28:37] <Moonlightning> I hope you don't still have fuses :(
[00:34:12] <Gladiolus> maybe it's fucked somewhere deep inside and trying to draw dangerous amounts of power as such
[00:35:15] <HoneyDrops|Half> My guess is the magnetron is going (gone) and eventually overheats and shorts.
[00:38:33] <Moonlightning> Magnetron? Isn't that a villain from Transformers or something?

[00:42:11] <AppleDash> HoneyDrops|Half: The fuse in my house
[00:43:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> Ok, in any event... if an appliance is tripping breakers (or blowing fuses), it's a good indication that you should stop using it. >_<
[00:44:05] <AppleDash> Yes
[00:44:11] <AppleDash> But I'm not going to!
[00:44:52] <Gladiolus> pls don't die
[00:45:14] <Gladiolus> there's funner and less stupid ways to die than insisting on using a broken microwave
[00:46:37] <Moonlightning> Dumb ways to die~!
[00:46:41] <Moonlightning> So many dumb ways to die~
[00:47:08] * Gladiolus dies
[00:47:27] <HoneyDrops|Half> A microwave ovenis a serious device, microwaves are harmless at low intensity (wifi, cellphones), but a microwave oven is pumping out 300-1600 watts.
[00:49:20] <Gladiolus> that's why they've got that fun shielded door and thickass metal chassis
[00:50:53] <Moonlightning> And yet, there's one in every home! :O
[00:51:05] <Moonlightning> #DownWithMicrowaves #DWM2015
[00:51:32] <Gladiolus> and they're well protected!
[00:51:44] <Gladiolus> Much like everything else, a properly used microwave will kill you if you don't.
[00:52:15] <Moonlightning> I can't parse that sentence
[00:52:20] <AppleDash> I'm well aware of how a microwave oven works
[00:52:26] <Moonlightning> I'm not :(
[00:52:38] <AppleDash> I'm not going to die, though
[00:52:45] <AppleDash> It's been like this for at least a year, maybe 2
[00:52:47] <Moonlightning> Something about using microwaves to excite water molecules, thus making things hotter

[00:53:54] <Gladiolus> again!??!
[00:54:24] <Gladiolus> Moonlightning: "a properly used microwave will kill you if you don't" as in if you don't use it right- ur dead.
[00:54:39] <Gladiolus> i had fun making that sentence o3
[00:55:26] <HoneyDrops|Half> Actually it doesn't just agitate water.
[00:56:51] <HoneyDrops|Half> At it's most simple, you are exposing the food to high intensity RF, it is absorbing that energy.  The general mechanic is dielectric heating.
[00:56:53] <Moonlightning> Gladiolus: a properly-used microwave will kill you if you don't [missing a verb here]
[00:57:08] <Gladiolus> the verb is properly
[00:57:12] <Gladiolus> the sentence is a circle
[00:57:13] <Gladiolus> o3o
[00:57:28] <Gladiolus> i mean the verb is use
[00:57:30] <Gladiolus> whatever
[00:57:43] <Moonlightning> Usually, the verb would be inferred to be the same as the previous verb
[00:57:55] <Moonlightning> i.e. /kill you/
[00:57:59] <Moonlightning> But that wouldn't make sense
[00:58:09] <Moonlightning> > A properly-used microwave will kill you if you don't kill yourself.
[00:58:24] <Gladiolus> well
[00:58:38] * Gladiolus horse shrug
[00:58:41] <johnsey> A verbally abused microwave will abuse you if you don't verb yourself.
[00:58:49] <Moonlightning> [15:57:28] < Gladiolus> i mean the verb is use
[00:58:49] <Moonlightning> As in, /A properly-used microwave will kill you if you don't use it properly./?
[00:58:58] <Gladiolus> yes
[00:59:18] <Moonlightning> That's a self-contradiction.
[00:59:24] <Gladiolus> i am okay with that

[03:22:34] <JustAberrant> I dunno anything about ext4 :(
[03:22:47] * Moonlightning yawns
[03:22:51] <JustAberrant> main reason I used xfs is because at the time it was the only real sane choice for large file systems
[03:22:59] <Moonlightning> I'm trying to make dnsmasq be a dhcp server for eth0
[03:23:21] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: How large is large?
[03:23:28] * HoneyDrops|Half uses ext4.  Good option for ssds.
[03:23:59] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: 20TB ?
[03:23:59] <Moonlightning> My dnsmasq.conf is four lines
[03:24:02] <Moonlightning> port=0
[03:24:02] <Moonlightning> interface=enp1s0

[03:24:08] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: 20TB is too many
[03:24:44] <HoneyDrops|Half> AppleDash: what use case are we talking about?
[03:24:52] <JustAberrant> either way, ext4 could probably handle it fine
[03:24:53] <Moonlightning> oh, I need to reconfigure the…
[03:25:04] <JustAberrant> but when I set up my file server, ext3 couldn't ;p
[03:25:55] <AppleDash> HoneyDrops|Half: Does it matter :P
[03:26:28] <Moonlightning> Where's the network config in Gentoo, again?
[03:26:29] <HoneyDrops|Half> Yes
[03:26:34] <Moonlightning> The equivalent of /etc/network/interfaces or whatever
[03:26:44] <AppleDash> Why are you using Gentoo?
[03:26:47] <HoneyDrops|Half> /etc/conf.d/net.[interface]
[03:26:52] <AppleDash> Especially on a server
[03:27:05] <JustAberrant> you make a copy of net.eth* 
[03:27:08] <Moonlightning> Ah, right, thanks
[03:27:20] <Moonlightning> Mine is just an /etc/conf.d/net, but thanks
[03:27:30] <AppleDash> HoneyDrops|Half: RAID 10 of 4 3TB drives
[03:27:36] <JustAberrant> yeah :>

[03:27:42] <JustAberrant> :D
[03:28:18] <Moonlightning> missed opportunity
[03:28:23] <JustAberrant> but you also need to either copy or symlink /etc/init.d/net.whatever for each interface

[03:29:35] <Moonlightning> Where's the docs for this file? x.x
[03:34:34] <HoneyDrops|Half> AppleDash: so file server?  low load? (private use vs public hosting)
[03:34:52] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: this is my secondary laptop

[03:36:47] <Moonlightning> wat
[03:36:59] <HoneyDrops|Half> AppleDash: I would say either, iirc the main bonus of xfs is with lots of small file requests, which shines for servers.
[03:38:22] <AppleDash> I have lots of small files :P
[03:39:04] <JustAberrant> yeah but that's negated because NFS sucks at that ;p

[03:40:42] <AppleDash> Not really
[03:40:47] <AppleDash> maybe sometimes?
[03:45:00] <HoneyDrops|Half> From what I recall, xfs is recommended for >10TB, it is less tolerant of things like sudden power loss, and performs better with large numbers of small operations.
[03:45:40] <HoneyDrops|Half> or wast it 100TB

[03:46:07] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i'm not a fan of whatever micro$oft uses for 3TB and larger drives
[03:46:44] <AppleDash> It's still NTFS
[03:47:26] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> not for 3TB drives
[03:47:58] <AppleDash> Uhh
[03:47:58] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> for my 3TB drive i purchased when i tried to format NTFS it formatted it 2.5tb and refused to let me access the other 500 gigs it was leaving as unformatted
[03:48:00] <Gladiolus> yes it is
[03:48:11] <AppleDash> because your partition table type was incorrect
[03:48:12] <Gladiolus> lol that's not a microsoft thing
[03:48:18] <Gladiolus> it has to be gpt to support a 3tb drive
[03:48:21] <AppleDash> Yeah, that's an everything thing
[03:48:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> thats it, GPT
[03:48:35] <Gladiolus> microsoft has sweet fuck all to do with that, good work immediately blaming them with no research :I
[03:49:02] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> in Debian i was able to format the drive EXFat, NTFS or EXT4
[03:49:05] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> with no problems
[03:49:28] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> in win7 i get "error, drive size too large for file partition table, you must use GPT to use the full size of this drive"
[03:49:30] <Gladiolus> It's a limitation with the oldass MBR standard, windows must've been trying to format it as that instead of GPT
[03:49:46] <Gladiolus> so it even told you ntfs had nothing to do with it
[03:49:54] * Gladiolus throws up arms and also AppleDash 
[03:50:06] <AppleDash> o.o
[03:50:10] * AppleDash is thrown?
[03:50:18] <Gladiolus> yus
[03:50:28] <AppleDash> :D
[03:51:04] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> does the microsoft implementation of GPT seem a little..... "unstable" to anyone else?
[03:51:22] <Moonlightning> Gladiolus: yes, Microsoft has sweet fuck all to do with the MS-DOS partition table not supporting partitions > 2.5 SI TB.
[03:51:33] <Moonlightning> That just kinda happened. IT totally wasn't their doing.
[03:51:45] <Gladiolus> That was more IBM but comeon son.
[03:51:54] <Gladiolus> They couldn't have predicted this in the 80s lol
[03:52:04] <Moonlightning> But it was their doing./
[03:52:13] <Gladiolus> It's more a fault of both hardware and software developers sticking with ancient standards like BIOS.
[03:52:19] <Gladiolus> was it on purpose th
[03:52:29] <Gladiolus> andno, it doesn't DJ-C0L7[CSS]? Works for me v0v
[03:52:52] <HoneyDrops|Half> DJ-C0L7[CSS]: does MS do anything in a non-"unstable" way ;)
[03:53:15] <Gladiolus> Like, it's fine to say the standard is dumb or something but to just immediately flip a table and scream MIIIICROOOOSHAAAAAFT is a little unfair
[03:53:57] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i'm using a 3tb full size 2.5" desktop hdd in a mobile application, i tell windows to remove (eject) hardware, windows says "safe to remove" i turn off enclosure, next day i turn the enclosure back on, connect to windows, "ERROR: this drive must be scanned before you can continue" if i tell it to scan, it takes 4 hours to scan the drive, if i tell it to continue without scanning "ERROR drive corrupt or unreadable"
[03:54:10] * Moonlightning immediately flips a table and screams “MIIIICROOOOSHAAAAAFT!”
[03:54:16] <Gladiolus> That's a dumb thing yeah I dunno why windows does that.
[03:54:23] <Gladiolus> I just don't scan shit lol.
[03:54:23] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> same drive, formatted EXT4, no problems

[03:56:05] <Gladiolus> yeah windows is really bad wrt portable drives
[03:56:16] * DJ-C0L7[CSS] nods
[03:56:35] <Gladiolus> Legit complaints are good, but complaining first and providing a reason for it later is silly. It just makes them ignore you.

[04:06:38] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> the "what's your favorite linux distro" question? and the answer generally being "the right one for the job"?
[04:06:57] <Cepheid> Indeed.
[04:07:41] * Moonlightning unplugs this Ethernet cable, waits a coupel seconds, and plugs it back in.
[04:07:46] <Cepheid> There are hardened distros for security-minded people.  Distros meant for hosting web servers.  Distros for hosting source code versioning systems.  General purpose distros.  Recovery distros.  Desktop distros. Etc, etc, etc.
[04:07:58] * DJ-C0L7[CSS] nods
[04:08:19] <Cepheid> Still no cat-oriented distros.
[04:08:36] <Cepheid> Where everything is handled via cat themed commands.
[04:08:47] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i use a forensics distro when i'm working with drives/raw data, i use a recovery distro when i'm repairing damages caused by m$ taking a dump on the drive, or some doofus deleting an important file
[04:09:05] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> Cepheid have you looked into LFS?
[04:09:31] <Cepheid> Looked into it.  Debated it.  I'm really only joking about a cat-themed distro, by the way. :P
[04:09:39] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> lol
[04:10:13] <Cepheid> By the way, assuming only MS takes a dump on hard drives is a bad idea.  I've heard horror stories of Linux doing the same, yo. :P
[04:10:21] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> a couple of friends of mine ended up with a freaking pallet of HP Thin Client terminals, and we were looking into possibly building a hilariously small distro that just fired up and would play games like doom
[04:10:43] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> oh dear god @_@ you are bringing back a bad experience i had durring my forensics training
[04:10:44] <Cepheid> Bugs in filesystem drivers ruining the drive, or that recent(few months ago) RAID module issue that was corrupting the drives.
[04:10:51] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> oh god
[04:10:58] <Cepheid> Any OS can fault a drive.
[04:11:04] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> unfortunately
[04:11:19] <Cepheid> It's just easy to pick on MS, I think.
[04:12:51] <Moonlightning> YAY~
[04:12:57] <Moonlightning> Got the IP by looking at the routing table
[04:13:12] <Moonlightning> It was just .129 instead of .2, which is what I assumed it'd be
[04:13:24] <Cepheid> Having fun with a new router?
[04:13:41] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> hea Moonlightning have you ever tinkered with "smoothwal"?
[04:13:42] <Cepheid> I had fun with a modem that wouldn't report a device it was assigning a DHCP address to the other day.
[04:13:57] <Cepheid> Well, gateway/modem.
[04:14:06] <Cepheid> It reported every other device on the network, but not the one I needed.
[04:14:29] <Cepheid> And of course, the UI for the device was slow as molasses, and didn't support SSH, because it's a piece of trash.

[04:26:49] <Moonlightning> And then I'll ssh-keyscan Silverspeed from there
[04:27:00] <Moonlightning> Silverspeed is plugged into Caramel with a goddamn Ethernet cable
[04:27:12] <Moonlightning> There's no way anyone is MitMing that, right? :I
[04:27:36] <Moonlightning> At the same time…damn, I swear I got the right key when I had a monitor for Silverspeed
[04:27:41] <Moonlightning> I wonder if maybe I was wrong

[04:30:18] <JustAberrant> I like to think all the latest revelations are just a smoke screen
[04:30:33] <JustAberrant> they've actually been embedding monitoring device on bare PCBs for years
[04:31:12] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> the NSA has backdoors to almost all networking equipment now a days anyways
[04:31:49] <Moonlightning> But not something that would let them remotely hijack a wired connection? :/
[04:31:54] <Moonlightning> Between two Linux boxes?
[04:33:22] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> unless they have somehow set another box on your network on the same chain in permiscuous mode and has somehow managed to set it to broadcast all transmitted packet stream captures upstream to a waiting server
[04:33:26] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i doubt it
[04:34:22] <JustAberrant> are you talking direct connection as in literally no switch/anything between the boxes
[04:34:38] <JustAberrant> cause if there's a switch *pulls up pants* that's how they getcha
[04:34:45] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> no, i'm talking about a backdoor packet capture interface inserted into the router itself
[04:34:53] <JustAberrant> that was aimed at Moonlightning 
[04:34:58] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> if its an x-over though ;3
[04:35:48] <Moonlightning> It goes like this
[04:35:53] <JustAberrant> clearly what must be done is to end the practice of using switches/hibs
[04:36:01] <JustAberrant> and just build out networks as huge meshes
[04:36:10] <JustAberrant> where everything connects to everything in a big tangle of cables
[04:36:30] <JustAberrant> or maybe implement a token ring type thing that goes through machines

[22:20:35] <init3> I wonder why....
[22:20:47] <init3> Damn gubment
[22:21:48] <Finwe> init3: There's a copy of the study here: https://keysduplicated.com/~ali/helmet/
[22:23:21] <Midnight_Tinker> got-dam gubment
[22:23:59] <init3> Rite?
[22:24:21] <Midnight_Tinker> dey tuk r jerbs
[22:26:07] <init3> der druk urr jerbzz
[22:43:35] <Lapsus> can someone help me identify some chips?
[22:43:58] <Lapsus> I'm cleaning out the attic and found a reasonably large stash and my google-fu is weak
[22:44:22] <Lapsus> that and some of the markings return no google results at all
[22:45:42] <Lapsus> it looks like the model number is KM44C258AZ-10 and it's a zip package
[22:46:58] <Lapsus> They're /probably/ ram expansions of some sort for an amiga 500

[22:48:31] <Lapsus> so it's some sort of small ram
[22:48:34] <Lapsus> thanks Finwe
[22:50:30] <Finwe> Yes, 1 MB CMOS dynamic RAM.
[22:51:48] <Lapsus> must be a hella-old samsung logo on this
[22:51:48] <Lapsus> lol
[23:10:41] <wolfyshy> Lapsus: is it the three stars
[23:10:41] <AppleDash> lol
[23:10:54] <Lapsus> yes :3
[23:11:06] <wolfyshy> https://samsungsituationanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/samsung-old.gif
[23:11:15] <Lapsus> yeah, that's the one
[23:11:17] <wolfyshy> I have a Samsung CGA monitor from 1988 with that logo on it
[23:11:38] <Lapsus> I think these chips are around my age
[23:11:42] <Lapsus> lol
[23:12:16] <Lapsus> I can't help but wonder what my brother paid for them when they were new

[23:12:48] <Lapsus> I want to see if I can get an arduino to read/write from them if I can figure out the pinout
[23:14:31] <AppleDash> lol
[23:14:35] <AppleDash> Have fun :P
