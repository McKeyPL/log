[05:05:42] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: like what?
[05:06:06] <Moonlightning> enums are first-class in Rust, up there with structs
[05:06:21] <Moonlightning> &str vs String can be confusing, I guess
[05:07:00] <Moonlightning> but I don't think it's that bad
[05:07:21] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: I dunno, I just remember them abusing the hell out of enums
[05:07:27] <AppleDash> but like I said it might've been another language
[05:07:35] <Moonlightning> `&str`s are either slices of `String`s or string literals (which have a static lifetime, so `&'static str`)
[05:07:43] <Moonlightning> enums are used a lot
[05:07:46] <Moonlightning> remember any examples?
[05:08:15] <Moonlightning> optionals in Rust are `enum Option<T> { Some(T), None }`
[05:08:28] <Moonlightning> there's also an `enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E) }`
[05:09:25] <Moonlightning> There's a copy-on-write type implemented as an enum
[05:10:59] <HoneyDrops> What are the weird strings?  You mean char*?
[05:15:19] <AppleDash> Right, Moonlightning, that is the enum abuse I was referring to
[05:16:25] <AppleDash> I like my enum dicks { SOMETHING, OTHER_THING } to be the same as #define SOMETHING 1 | #define OTHER_THING 2 but with more type safety
[05:20:24] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: this is Rust; there is no `char *` :p
[05:20:35] <HoneyDrops> D:
[05:20:42] <Moonlightning> it's either `* const char` or `* mut char`, and using either is `unsafe`
[05:21:10] <Moonlightning> Those are /Unicode/ `char`s, by the way. If you want an eight-bit integer, you want `u8` or `i8`.
[05:21:36] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: yeah, well…`enum`s in Rust are their own types.
[05:21:54] <Moonlightning> It's better that way; you can't `Foo::A == 1`—oh, wait, you said that
[05:22:12] <Moonlightning> well, too bad. :P
[05:22:21] <Rylee> a better term is tagged union, not enum
[05:22:26] <Moonlightning> it's not abuse, just elevated enums
[05:22:27] <Rylee> or sum type
[05:22:40] <Moonlightning> Why?
[05:22:48] <Rylee> because that's what they are, obviously
[05:23:25] <Rylee> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union
[05:23:26] <PinkiePieBot> [ Tagged union - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[05:23:29] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning: so they are 16bits per char?
[05:24:06] <Rylee> meanwhile, an enum is an enumerated type, which is just a set of names which are a type
[05:24:08] <Moonlightning> Haven't the foggiest!
[05:24:11] <Rylee> no associated data
[05:24:44] <Moonlightning> You never directly use array(-like)s of `char`s, though. That's what `String` and &str are for.
[05:25:01] <Moonlightning> Rylee: taggedunion is a horrible keyword. :(

[18:31:35] <AppleDash> Does `git reset --soft HEAD~` to undo a commit leave anything in git history?
[18:32:11] <AppleDash> I accidentally committed (but didn't push) an SSL private key and want to redo the commit without the key, and don't want any risk of a leak
[18:33:50] <roflincopter> AppleDash: I believe you want to use "git reset --mixed HEAD^" 
[18:34:35] <AppleDash> What would that do?
[18:37:56] <roflincopter> it will reset you head to the previous commit (HEAD^) in a mixed manner, which will set everything you changed between HEAD^ and HEAD in your workind directory.
[18:38:10] <roflincopter> if you want to be sure read "man git reset" and look up mixe.d
[18:38:35] <roflincopter> then you can re-add and commit 
[18:39:09] <roflincopter> you can also use git rebase -i and marked your last commit with "edit" then you be thrown in the state you were just before you git commited.
[18:39:47] <roflincopter> then you can unstage your changes you don't want, and git commit again.

[22:31:29] <Sour_Creep> O.K. the client is dumb ...
[22:32:59] <Sour_Creep> It scans the sites-available directory instead of the sites-enabled dir. My sites-available is organized in subfolders and it cannot handle them -.-

[22:59:06] <Sour_Creep> I don't even have words for that piece of crap LE client. ... So it messed with my config files. I've probably lost SSL configs for some domains. Luckily I made a backup. It's auto setup created ONE cert for all domains, placed it in the wrong config file, and left other config files completely untouched.
[23:00:20] <Sour_Creep> God I wish they were going for a standard CA model.

[23:02:55] <Colgate> but this is "easier"!
[23:04:00] <Colgate> every sysadmin is going to handle ssl certs differently, having a generic automated client try to handle that is just going to have problems
[23:04:20] <Sour_Creep> It put my statements where to log things in /etc/letsencrypt. Also in this file are a lot of statement that the client should never touch (e.g. CipherSuit, ServerSignature, ...)
[23:04:53] <Sour_Creep> Actually you could to it quite easy
[23:05:20] <Sour_Creep> Parse the config files, look where the keys are, make a backups, replace with LE cert/keys
[23:05:43] <Sour_Creep> Write a config file for the LE client when to renew them
[23:05:49] <Sour_Creep> DONE
[23:07:47] <Colgate> but then your LE client has to parse who knows how many different formats of config files, for many different versions of those software, and be kept up to date with any changes to those formats in the future
[23:08:29] <Colgate> would just be simpler to have a config file that says, "key for X here, cert for Y here, renew Z"
[23:08:46] <Colgate> and more generic too
[23:09:01] <Sour_Creep> I'm currently thinking about just switing back to StartSSL even if creating one cert for each domain is a pain
[23:11:21] <Sour_Creep> In the SSL config it did <VirtualHost *:80> WTF
[23:11:47] <Sour_Creep> How is that even possible to mess up
[23:14:15] <Sakura> Nyu
[23:15:07] <Colgate> let's encrypt port 80!
[23:16:52] <Sour_Creep> Oh I get what it did. It created (incorrect) configs for domains where I didn't enable SSL. So it's now encrypting traffic on port 80 for domains where I don't need ssl?!
[23:22:13] <Sour_Creep> Thankfully it wasn't smart enough to put them into sites-enabled. My apache still restarts :D
[23:23:31] <Sour_Creep> Let's see if this manual mode works any better before I throw the client out of my filesystem

[23:59:33] <Sour_Creep> Turns out the beta whitelist only cotains the domain itself (e.g. example.com) and the www subdomain if you did not explicitly include any other. I'm done with my rant for today. In it's current state LE doesn't make ANY sense for me.
