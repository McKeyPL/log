[02:27:41] <Moonlightning> `stroke-linecap: square` doesn't seem to be having any effect in <rect:style>
[02:29:04] <Webster> Well, a rectangle doesn't have ends to cap.
[02:29:51] <Moonlightning> …oh. *facehoof*
[02:30:11] <Webster> At least I assume not.
[02:30:12] <Moonlightning> Welllll…the stroke is kind of…clopping, through the edge of the image?
[02:30:15] <Moonlightning> It kinda gets cut off.
[02:30:26] <Moonlightning> You can especially see it with the stripe in the middle
[02:31:11] <Moonlightning> …actually, I'm not sure I want to use stroke for this
[02:31:29] <Moonlightning> I think I'll just break these out into separate rectangles. Never mind.
[02:36:58] <Lapsus> clopping through the edge of the image?
[02:37:06] <Moonlightning> …clipping *
[02:37:12] <Lapsus> aw :p
[02:37:23] <Moonlightning> anyway, what would be /really/ nice is if I could say “make this rectangle 1920x1080, but cut it off 24px from the top and bottom and show what's underneath”
[02:40:31] <Moonlightning> Layering is just, whatever comes first goes on the bottom, and subsequent things get stacked on top of everything else, yeah?
[02:40:34] <Webster> Can you do 'margin:24px 0 24px 0' with it? I always forget which bits it supports or not.
[02:40:48] <Webster> Unless you mess with the z-layer settings.
[02:42:07] <Moonlightning> Maybe.
[02:43:04] <Moonlightning> nope, no `margin`
[02:44:03] <Moonlightning> I can't figure out why the stripe in the middle isn't behaving
[02:44:32] <Moonlightning> The darker <rect> has a larger height value and a lower y value
[02:44:44] <Moonlightning> So it should start farther up and end farther down than the lighter <rect>
[02:45:04] <Moonlightning> yet…no matter what I've done, I've never been able to see them overlap. I always only see one of the brown stripes or the other, never both at once

[02:49:11] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[02:49:42] <Moonlightning> It's supposed to go short dark yellow, yellow, short dark brown, brown, short dark brown, yellow, short dark yellow
[02:49:51] <Moonlightning> the darker versions being outline colors

[08:08:20] <AppleDash> Hmm?
[08:08:22] <Moonlightning> let me look up the motherfucking RFC for this
[08:08:45] <Googie> Incidentally, that Perl module posted states (in its documentation) that it isn't fully complete.
[08:08:54] <Moonlightning> RDC 2822, yes?
[08:08:57] <Moonlightning> RFC *
[08:08:58] <Googie> "The specification for an email address allows for infinitely nestable comments. That's nice in theory, but a little over done. By default this module allows for one (1) level of nested comments."
[08:10:16] <AppleDash> I just go for the ([^ ]+@[^ ]+\.[^ ]{2,}) or something like that
[08:10:24] <AppleDash> It will do for most email addresses anyone will enter
[08:10:47] <Moonlightning> or how about just do basic fuckkin' sanity checks and VRFY
[08:10:56] <AppleDash> VRFY?
[08:11:02] <Moonlightning> anyway, if you'll excuse me, I was trying to get shit done over here
