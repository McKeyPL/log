[00:08:56] * JustAberrant shakes head
[00:09:20] <JustAberrant> the vendor is the ultimate authority, the user should feel privileged at the opportunity to participate in the experience :(
[00:09:41] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, fuck that entire idea.
[00:09:51] <HoneyDrops> The vendor can take that product and shove it.

[00:10:41] <HoneyDrops> Yeah and they are too dumb to know they are being abused.  Doesn't make it right.
[00:11:05] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: 's why I want a proper Linux phone
[00:11:15] <JustAberrant> uh huh ;p
[00:11:15] <HoneyDrops> Well to be fair, more accurately they are ignorant.  It isn't the user's fault.
[00:11:22] <JustAberrant> I don't think they are either
[00:11:34] <JustAberrant> they just don't share your particular set of priorities or interests
[00:11:45] <JustAberrant> they arn't being "abused", they are being given exactly what they want
[00:11:52] <JustAberrant> a guided experience that works
[00:12:04] <HoneyDrops> For a very narrow definition of "works"
[00:12:14] <JustAberrant> for the definition of works that they care about
[00:12:27] <JustAberrant> which again, while it differs entirely from yours, is still what they want
[00:12:32] <JustAberrant> and not what they "think" they want
[00:12:36] <JustAberrant> what they actually, legitimately, want
[00:12:38] <HoneyDrops> For most I think they don't even conceive that it would work ways other than how it does.
[00:13:35] <HoneyDrops> Which is the result of a lack of understanding of the tech and imagination.
[00:14:10] <JustAberrant> sure, but not only do people not care about the kind of control you talk about, they specifically don't want it
[00:14:18] <JustAberrant> and again, I don't see that as invalid
[00:14:32] <Moonlightning> I want, like, Gentoo, but with a package-manger app-store with a lot of actually good stuff, and like well-designed built-in stuff for things like phoning
[00:14:34] * Phase is in JustAberrant's side here
[00:14:40] <Phase> ^ Moonlightning
[00:14:44] <HoneyDrops> I watch people manually scan files for keywords because they don't know that computers can search things for you.  I've seen people type the same stuff in over and over because they don't know of copy & paste.
[00:14:55] <Phase> you can have easy to use and freedom
[00:15:12] <Moonlightning> Ubuntu kinda does this well!
[00:15:20] <Phase> ubuntu is terrible
[00:15:24] <Moonlightning> No, listen,
[00:15:30] <Phase> as someone who maintains a ubuntu install for someone not tech savy
[00:15:33] <Phase> don't use ubuntu
[00:15:33] <Moonlightning> There's the GUI “Software Center”, and the somewhat-limiting preference pane for repository selection
[00:15:42] <Moonlightning> But you can ignore all that and use apt-get and /etc
[00:15:48] <Moonlightning> That's what I want!
[00:16:04] <Moonlightning> …actually, GUI|CLI duality in /everything/ would be nice
[00:16:06] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: right, because it hasn't been made intuitive enough for them
[00:16:22] <JustAberrant> and people don't want choice in their app permission set any more than I want precise control over the ignition timing in my engine
[00:16:37] <JustAberrant> they want people to make the decisions for them and tlel them it's secure like I want my car to just work
[00:16:43] <HoneyDrops> You have to meet tools half-way.  You can't drive a nail without swinging a hammer.
[00:16:43] <Moonlightning> phone +1-202-867-5309
[00:16:56] <JustAberrant> * tell
[00:17:01] * Phase would love to see mixed cli/gui setups
[00:17:15] <JustAberrant> ever worked with CAD? ;p
[00:17:21] <Phase> once
[00:17:25] <JustAberrant> it's pretty much that
[00:17:33] <HoneyDrops> Always make cli tool, and just put a GUI wrapper around it.
[00:17:46] * Phase wants a shortcut that grabs the corner of a window for resizing
[00:18:18] <JustAberrant> either way, point is people have different priorities in life
[00:18:30] <JustAberrant> most see computers as a tool to accomplish the things they _actually_ care about
[00:18:31] <HoneyDrops> The upside there is you can have multiple UI wrappers, so the interface can focus on different use cases.
[00:18:40] <JustAberrant> the computer is important to them, but in the sense that they want it to work
[00:18:47] *** Joins: Webster (Webster@Pony-benl74.fios.verizon.net)
[00:18:53] <Moonlightning> …like…cars.
[00:18:55] <JustAberrant> and usually in the simplest and most direct way possible
[00:18:58] <JustAberrant> exactly
[00:19:07] <Moonlightning> Okay, yeah, that's legit.
[00:19:11] <Moonlightning> BUT
[00:19:14] <JustAberrant> wanting everyone to be a computer nerd is as bad as wanting everyone to be a gear head
[00:19:16] <Moonlightning> it doesn't mean that the rest of us should be limited :V
[00:19:53] <JustAberrant> no, but that's what happens, just as cars are gradually being more locked down and less tunable for the benefit of most users and detriment of the gear heads, same is and will keep happening for computers
[00:20:15] <JustAberrant> there's never going to be some great renaissance where everyone suddenly actually cares how their computers work and wants total control
[00:20:17] <Moonlightning> :/
[00:20:27] <JustAberrant> that's always going to be a small group of users who are going to be largely ignored
[00:20:32] <HoneyDrops> I'm not saying a user needs to be able to code a kernel and a display manager, no more than I expect a driver to be able to design and machine a precision engine, but a driver should have a basic grasp of a 4-cycle engine and the principles of a transmission.
[00:21:02] <JustAberrant> why?
[00:21:21] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: like the kind you could get from an agif?
[00:21:22] <JustAberrant> if you turn the key and it starts, press the gas and it does, etc.. why would you think that's necessary?
[00:21:27] * Moonlightning saw one on Imgur a few weeks back
[00:21:49] <HoneyDrops> Knowing how a car (or any device) works tells you it's limits, and it better helps you predict it's behavior.
[00:21:59] <JustAberrant> but you don't need to know either to use it
[00:22:04] * Moonlightning (steals HoneyDrops' apostrophes)
[00:22:27] <HoneyDrops> You will be a more proficient user with the additional knowledge.
[00:22:29] <JustAberrant> all you need to know is it gets you to work until either the red light telling you something is wrong lights up, it makes a really loud noise, or the gas guage gets low
[00:22:34] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: but you don't need to be
[00:22:36] <Googie> It can also lead to a false sense of understanding.
[00:22:57] <HoneyDrops> Until something goes wrong.
[00:23:00] * Googie has seen many many people, who because they are above average at using Windows, seem to think that they /know/ computers
[00:23:06] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: at which point you call a mechanic
[00:23:19] <HoneyDrops> Who can take advantage of your ignorance…
[00:23:25] <JustAberrant> right, but even if they do
[00:23:28] <JustAberrant> even if you get ripped off
[00:23:31] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] is a mechanic
[00:23:44] <JustAberrant> it's still probably cheaper in most ways than the time spent developing the proficiency not to be ripped off
[00:24:00] <JustAberrant> in terms of investment of time and the value of that time
[00:24:05] <HoneyDrops> You need to know enough about the tech that surrounds you to know what it can do, and what it cannot do.  You should be able to know when someone is pulling BS on you.
[00:24:25] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: see, I'd argue that while it's a would be nice, it's not necessary
[00:24:42] <JustAberrant> you can get by without knowing anything about cars
[00:24:54] <JustAberrant> drive it till it breaks, then pay someone to fix it, repeat
[00:25:06] <HoneyDrops> Otherwise you will be damned to just listening to whatever others tell you and you are not equipped with either the requisite knowledge or reasoning skills.
[00:25:19] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: right, but you can still get by just fine that way
[00:25:38] <JustAberrant> and this extends to just about everything
[00:25:43] <HoneyDrops> Yes, but you know what's better?  Identifying an issue /before/ failure and addressing it.
[00:26:07] * Moonlightning mumbles about pure-electric cars.
[00:26:14] <JustAberrant> not arguing it's not a good thing to have the knowledge, just arguing that you don't need it to live a reasonably happy life
[00:26:26] <Stik> they'll find new and exciting ways to break :)
[00:26:28] <JustAberrant> and that deciding to just leave it in the hands of others is a valid choice
[00:26:30] <HoneyDrops> You can afford to, yes, but how much is collectively pissed away just to coddle ignorance?
[00:27:09] <JustAberrant> honestly in terms of the value in the time spent learning something you don't care about, I don't think much
[00:27:17] <HoneyDrops> How much less work would we make for ourselves if we just paid for that ounce of prevention to save the pound?
[00:27:37] <JustAberrant> I don't think the scales are balanced that way, especially when it comes to cars
[00:28:15] <JustAberrant> you need a fair bit of car knowledge to really be able to say more than "I think it's the wheel bearings"
[00:28:18] <Stik> and computery stuff! you must have all encountered the elderly family member who hasn't a clue :)
[00:29:00] <JustAberrant> right, getting grandma to where she can navigate her facebook is worth while, teaching her about TCP/IP isn't ;p
[00:29:17] <JustAberrant> anything more complicated than "it didn't do the thing when I clicked it" probably isn't worth her time
[00:29:47] <JustAberrant> even if she didn't have grandchildren to bug it's probably worth it to have geek squad come in and rip her off as long as it gets her up and running again
[00:30:40] <JustAberrant> and again I don't feel that's ignorance or abuse or anything
[00:30:49] <JustAberrant> I think it's a valid decision based on priorities and interests
[00:31:47] <HoneyDrops> The problem is ignorance is only going to be more costly, as the complexity of our artifacts increases, the losses of failing to learn about them is only going to grow.  Then danger of people wielding tools they do not adequately understand becomes a graver risk.
[00:31:48] <Stik> agreed
[00:32:13] <Stik> hmm i disagree HoneyDrops 
[00:32:23] <JustAberrant> I don't really agree with that either
[00:32:27] <Stik> if anything the increasing complexity makes it even less important to learn about things
[00:32:42] <Stik> or less feasible rather
[00:32:50] <JustAberrant> I think the opposite really, tools are becoming more complex to a point where they need to be simpler to actually use because you won't really be able to understand it significantly
[00:32:58] <JustAberrant> which is already happening
[00:33:23] <Stik> at some point you have to choose to put your trust in someone else to have worked out how to make a thing do it's stuff
[00:33:36] <JustAberrant> people won't need or want to understand the inner workings, they'll have to understand the high level mechanics which will have to just work
[00:33:38] <Stik> so you can focus on your own things
[00:34:03] <JustAberrant> .. a.. another rational pony.. I.. never thought I'd see the day.. :D
[00:34:08] <JustAberrant> *cough* ;p

[00:34:22] <Stik> sorry to dissappoint, but i'm no pony ;)

[00:34:45] <Stik> you know what would solve all this, would be living forever
[00:34:52] <Stik> then we would have all the time in the world to learn stuff
[00:34:57] <Stik> i'd love to know how things work more
[00:35:06] <JustAberrant> or all have time to stop caring about basically everything :>
[00:35:15] <Stik> yeah that too
[00:35:22] <Stik> winning the lottery would free up 90% of my time!
[00:35:38] <Stik> and also give me the freedom to stop worrying about breaking things by tinkering :)
[00:35:54] <JustAberrant> hehe, much as I hate to admit it, would probably be the worst thing to happen to me
[00:36:03] <JustAberrant> I'm _way_ to content to sit around and do nothing
[00:36:15] <Stik> i'd love to do my own work on cars for instance, but i'm too afraid of losing time in there, and ending up with a large immobile and expensive object in my driveway :(
[00:36:19] <JustAberrant> I can tell myself I'd involve myself more with my own projects..
[00:36:34] <Stik> haha, maybe, i'd go into it with good intentions..
[00:36:35] <JustAberrant> but I'd probably just browse the net all day
[00:36:45] <JustAberrant> and then like 50 years would go by and I'd be like.. "well fuck"
[00:36:46] <HoneyDrops> why would that be bad?
[00:37:09] <Stik> hmm that is actually not a bad question
[00:37:15] <Stik> what *is* wrong with just doing that?
[00:37:31] <JustAberrant> weird as it sounds, I think because it makes time go by to quickly
[00:37:34] <Stik> i think my fear would be the "after 50 years" thing and realising i'd achieved nothing, then spending my final few years being really depressed :)

[02:14:24] <Moonlightning> I thought xkcd's random button was giving me the same few comics over and over again
[02:14:46] <Moonlightning> so I started generating random IDs with Python
[02:14:51] <Moonlightning> and the first eight or so were comics I'd seen today
[02:15:09] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning: the tags, they are bound to Mod4+[shift/control]+F1-F12
[02:15:29] <Moonlightning> mod4? >.>
[02:15:35] <HoneyDrops> I can rename them, hence the IRC, IM, MUD
[02:15:46] <HoneyDrops> The super/flag/windows key?
[02:16:17] <HoneyDrops> Every binding of my WM uses Mod4+[other mods]+some key.
[02:17:35] <HoneyDrops> That top bar is normally hidden, if I have a terminal open, it's full screen w/o any border.  If multiple windows are displayed each get a 1px border to show focus.
[02:17:36] <CompuDesktop> HoneyDrops: do u use vlc?
[02:17:42] <HoneyDrops> I use mpv
[02:17:51] <JustAberrant> mplayer for life
[02:18:00] <CompuDesktop> i like vlc
[02:18:07] <HoneyDrops> mpv is mplayer + mplayer2, more or less
[02:18:08] <CompuDesktop> also my theme changes vlc as well
[02:18:14] <CompuDesktop> changes banshee too
[02:18:16] <CompuDesktop> cuz gtk
[02:18:23] <JustAberrant> yeah, never really looked into mpv
[02:18:48] <HoneyDrops> mpv have an overlay, though I always just use keybindings.  There isn't really anything to "theme"
[02:19:01] <HoneyDrops> s/have/has/
[02:19:24] <CompuDesktop> one thing tho, u have to edit ubuntu software center's theme file cuz it likes to keep its light background for some dumb reason
[02:19:30] <JustAberrant> yeah, and mplayer doesn't even have that, best it has is the OSD, which is just white text :>
[02:19:37] <JustAberrant> never really liked vlc
[02:19:43] <CompuDesktop> JustAberrant: why?
[02:19:57] <JustAberrant> I mean I'll use it on windows or to play a DVD with menus, but I really don't like it
[02:20:19] <CompuDesktop> theres always xbmc tho its now called kodi media center
[02:20:23] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: I find it's significantly slower for things like seeking, mplayer has really smooth seeking
[02:20:53] <JustAberrant> plus for a long time it really didn't handle multiple monitors well
[02:21:10] <CompuDesktop> the current "stable" version of kodi is kinda broken since for some reason it doesnt like the version of libtag in ubuntu 14.04
[02:21:15] <JustAberrant> you'd full screen it and the controls would end up maximized (though not scaled) and disjointed on one screen and the video on another
[02:22:07] <CompuDesktop> ah
[02:22:22] <CompuDesktop> i dont have anything powerful enough for multiple monitors so not an issue for me
[02:22:46] <JustAberrant> I'm not normally a minimalist, but I like mplayer because it does exactly what it's supposed to do
[02:22:48] <CompuDesktop> anyways heres what that media player menu thingy looks like when something is actually playing http://screencloud.net/v/du90
[02:22:52] <PinkiePieBot> [ Screenshot at 20:21:48 | ScreenCloud ]
[02:23:22] <JustAberrant> CompuDesktop: bleh, yeah, I hate that style for media players
[02:23:32] <CompuDesktop> why?
[02:23:48] <JustAberrant> I've never liked all the album art/library stuff
[02:23:57] <CompuDesktop> oh
[02:24:07] <CompuDesktop> i like having and album art wall
[02:24:12] <CompuDesktop> but u might like clementine
[02:24:29] <CompuDesktop> i dont like it cuz everything has to be a playlist in it and it has no album art wall
[02:24:39] <JustAberrant> I generally just use mplayer -shuffle
[02:25:09] <CompuDesktop> i like seeing all the album art that i make sure is in every file i can get album art for
[02:25:33] <CompuDesktop> i use puddletag to make sure all my music file tags r set properly
[02:25:38] <JustAberrant> whatever you're into I guess
[02:25:58] <JustAberrant> most of the time I just have music on in the background
[02:26:08] <CompuDesktop> then i let banshee import and organize everything into folders by artist/album/song
[02:27:17] <CompuDesktop> well damn
[02:27:30] <CompuDesktop> i gotta change my theme back cuz skype for linux is fucking stupid

[02:51:23] <Compu> so when trying ubuntu from the live dvd where does it save the files u download to the home folder
[02:52:15] <mniip> in the memory iirc
[02:52:18] <HoneyDrops> ^
[02:52:28] <mniip> it's an overlayfs of a squashfs over a tmpfs
[02:52:36] <HoneyDrops> ^
[02:52:37] <mniip> iirc
[02:52:41] <HoneyDrops> It is
[02:54:10] <Moonlightning> /wat./
[02:54:12] <Moonlightning> > iTunes can’t verify the identity of the server “applesguschi000001.blob.core.windows.net”.
[02:56:49] <Compu> mniip: so it takes up RAM? i never noticed it taking up RAM when i checked the system manager thingy (the ubuntu equivalent of windows task manager)
[02:57:30] <Compu> Moonlightning: maybe expired certificate?
[02:57:31] <mniip> it's in the cache section of the RAM
[02:57:41] <Compu> cache section?
[02:58:04] <HoneyDrops> Open a terminal, run the command free
[02:58:06] <mniip> http://i.imgur.com/jCX8r2p.png
[02:58:25] <Compu> i figured that either the ram usage would have gone up or there would be less total ram or something
[02:58:26] <mniip> the green part is the ram used by programs, blue - various buffers, yellow - filesystem caches
[02:59:03] <mniip> see how the indicator says 2997MB used, thought that's just the size of the green part
[02:59:09] <Compu> k
[02:59:34] <Compu> so the total ram and the used ram wouldnt change in the system manager program?
[02:59:41] <mniip> yes
[02:59:46] <Compu> i see
[02:59:57] <mniip> one of the reasons why it isn't counted is that normally, when the system is low on ram, the caches are flushed to disk
[02:59:59] <HoneyDrops> Normally cache is consider "freeable"
[03:00:00] <mniip> freeing up the ram
[03:00:13] <Moonlightning> Compu: yes, but why is an /Apple/ product trying to //anything// with windows.net.?
[03:00:36] <Compu> Moonlightning: but if its normally flushed to disk then what does the live dvd do in that case?
[03:00:36] <mniip> that isn't the case for tmpfs however, because tmpfs has no storage backend
[03:00:40] <Compu> Moonlightning: no idea
[03:01:00] <Moonlightning> You can't read either of the lines printed by `free`
[03:01:27] <HoneyDrops> Since it can't purge the cache to disk, the OOM killer will come out to play.
[03:01:31] <Moonlightning> because the first one counts file cache as used, and the second one counts shared memory (e.g. /dev/shm!) as free
[03:01:47] <Compu> OOM killer?
[03:02:00] <HoneyDrops> out-of-memory killer
[03:02:11] <Compu> so it just starts deleting files?
[03:02:13] <HoneyDrops> It will kill processes to free up memory.
[03:02:24] * Moonlightning puts on a sheet and stalks around Compu. “OOM! OOOOOOM! OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!”
[03:02:24] <Compu> oh
[03:02:41] <Compu> *pounces on Moonlightning and snuggles*
[03:02:57] <Moonlightning> Ack! Get off me! I am the OOM!
[03:03:06] <mniip> yeah no
[03:03:08] <Compu> i am the snuggly robot pone!
[03:03:09] <mniip> it can't delete files
[03:03:16] <Compu> ah
[03:03:30] <Compu> so it would force close firefox and stuff
[03:03:41] <Moonlightning> It would SIGKILL Firefox.
[03:03:58] <Moonlightning> no chance for a clean exit or anything, just DED
[03:04:00] <Compu> wouldnt it risk sigkilling unity or something?
[03:04:26] <Compu> or even worse, x
[03:04:42] <Moonlightning> It prefers to kill processes using a lot of memory, and those deemed unimportant based on some in-kernel structures.
[03:04:47] <HoneyDrops> ^
[03:04:53] <Compu> ah
[03:04:59] <mniip> I had this happen to me recently
[03:05:05] <Moonlightning> init, for example, has a very high /avoid oomkilling this/ value.

[03:05:21] <Moonlightning> If you're root, you can change those values.
[03:05:22] <Compu> mniip: what did it kill?
[03:05:27] <mniip> apache has eaten 48GB of RAM
[03:05:31] <mniip> but no it had to kill lwresd
[03:05:32] <Compu> pfft
[03:05:33] <Compu> wat
[03:05:38] <Compu> why
[03:05:39] <Moonlightning> …seriously?
[03:05:46] <mniip> yes

[03:05:55] <Compu> also u have 48 GB of RAM?
[03:06:07] <Moonlightning> 64, probably
[03:06:10] <Compu> and what is lwresd?
[03:06:12] <HoneyDrops> Generally it will kill younger processes over older ones, iirc.
[03:06:18] <Moonlightning> That, too ^
[03:06:24] <Moonlightning> lwresd? No idea, but it sounds important!

[03:45:58] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: That describes many things :(
[03:46:17] <HoneyDrops> I keep the stuff around to clean up brushes, remove perm marker marks, and clean up epoxy resins when fiberglassing.
[03:46:19] *** RedHelepr is now known as RedHelper
[03:46:41] <HoneyDrops> Also cleaning up flux residue.
[03:47:01] <JustAberrant> kidding aside I do have the usuals
[03:47:11] <JustAberrant> acetone, rubbing alcohol, etc..
[03:47:31] <JustAberrant> mineral spirits..
[03:48:30] <HoneyDrops> I really want some benzene, but I'm already probably on some watchlists.

[03:55:39] <AppleDash> Amazing
[03:55:41] <AppleDash> lol
[03:55:43] <mniip> what in the living fuck
[03:56:03] <Compu> HoneyDrops: what is it
[03:56:17] <mniip> looks like a binary -> 7 segment decoder
[03:56:37] <HoneyDrops> It's a BCD to 7-Seg decoder, aka a 7447
[03:56:46] <Compu> whats it for
[03:56:53] <mniip> for decoding binary
[03:56:55] <HoneyDrops> ^
[03:57:07] <Compu> cant that be done in software?

[03:57:45] <Compu> y u gotta decode binary to a 7 segment display
[03:58:35] <HoneyDrops> You could do it in software, in the same sense you can swat flies with ICBMs.
[03:58:37] <JustAberrant> also neat @ pic
[03:58:50] <Compu> ICBMs?
[03:59:05] <HoneyDrops> intercontinental ballistic missiles
[03:59:07] <JustAberrant> you can also do it with a tiny discrete IC, but I get the appeal of doing it for the hell of it
[03:59:15] <Compu> nya
[03:59:30] <mniip> Compu, "software" requires a processing unit that would interpret your code
[03:59:31] * JustAberrant kinda wants to make his own NIC some day.. that sounds good and masochistic
[03:59:41] <mniip> this design is clearly too small for such a processing unit
[03:59:49] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: and write a driver for it
[03:59:58] <Compu> *points to raspberry pi* u sure its too small?
[04:00:01] <mniip> a windows driver MAHAHA
[04:00:07] <JustAberrant> oh god
[04:00:12] <Lapsus> Compu: sometimes software is overkill
[04:00:21] <mniip> Compu, raspberry pi is huge
[04:00:26] <Compu> is nawt

[04:00:42] <JustAberrant> though it would be kinda awesome to have this like huge box next to my computer and just be like.. "yeah, that's my 10 base T network interface"
[04:00:44] <Compu> but if u must u can go with an intel compute stick or some such
[04:00:45] <mniip> you can fit a bcd to 7seg encoder on a 1 sq mm of silicon
[04:00:51] <JustAberrant> 'so it can do 10 mbit?'

[04:02:03] <HoneyDrops> Compu: the point is the logic can be wired up.  Even that whole circuit is just a TTL 7447 chip for any actual project.

[04:02:46] <JustAberrant> hehe, yes, this one!
[04:02:52] <Compu> i wish i had a raspberry pi, i could wire it up to control my lightify hub
[04:03:09] <mniip> Compu, you clearly have no understanding how integrated devices work
[04:03:09] * JustAberrant has 6 rasp pi's and a rasp zero :(
[04:03:23] <HoneyDrops> The point is to test one's knowledge of circuit design and boolean logic.
[04:04:02] * HoneyDrops loved making a little 4-bit CPU in undergrad, even if it was just in a circuit simulator.
[04:04:19] <AppleDash> The sound is amazing
[04:04:20] * Lapsus made one in minecraft D:
[04:04:30] <mniip> that reminds me
[04:04:32] * Googie has also made an 8-bit CPU in a simulator!
[04:04:35] <mniip> I still haven't designed my own CPU
[04:04:36] <Lapsus> I want to recreate it in an fpga just to see it run at some speed
[04:04:39] <mniip> nor my own OS
[04:04:54] <Googie> At some point, the OS is going to be coursework for me :P
[04:05:05] <mniip> I have an idea for an os though

[04:08:53] <HoneyDrops> I love the layers of components-gates-logical units-ALUs-CPUs-instruction codes-Assembly-C
[04:09:15] <HoneyDrops> best part of my CS electives.
[04:09:58] <HoneyDrops> worst part was java :S
[04:16:16] <JustAberrant> I can imagine, I mean that's a useful real world skill so you want to avoid that as much as possible in university ;p
[04:17:27] <Phase> i think i've only met one weirdo that enjoyed java
[04:17:44] <JustAberrant> pff, I didn't enjoy java in school either, or even when I first started coding professionally
[04:17:47] <Moka> hey fuck you Phase that weirdo is my boyfriend
[04:17:48] <HoneyDrops> First CS course was Scheme, which was odd, but fun.
[04:18:02] <mniip> zozzle
[04:18:06] <JustAberrant> I only learned to appreciate it when I finally clued in to _why_ it was so popular
[04:18:07] <mniip> >actually enjoying java
[04:18:11] <AppleDash> I have never enjoyed java
[04:18:17] <JustAberrant> and after seeing metric shitloads of crappy c++ projects 
[04:18:25] <HoneyDrops> Then Java, and the third (and last I took) was transistors to C.
[04:18:41] * HoneyDrops doesn't like C++ either.
[04:18:57] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: right, and of all those, java is probably the one most likely for someone to pay you to do ;p
[04:19:14] <JustAberrant> I can appreciate c but it doesn't scale imo
[04:19:37] <JustAberrant> the larger the project gets, unless you're really careful, the more of a clusterfuck it becomes
[04:19:47] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: all of my CS courses were electives, I took them for no other reason than I liked it.  Then again, I majored in physics because I liked it XD
[04:19:49] <Phase> Moka, :P
[04:20:11] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: fair enough
[04:20:28] * Phase just finds java to be such a dull language
[04:20:36] <Phase> it's a very thin layer over the jvm
[04:20:42] <HoneyDrops> So technically I can go from Maxwell's equations to C.
[04:20:59] <JustAberrant> Phase: hehe, it is a dull language, it's a business language ;p
[04:21:37] <JustAberrant> Phase: it's geared at writing important but often dull systems needed to make businesses work ;p
[04:21:45] <HoneyDrops> I just found it to be clunky and verbose.
[04:22:05] <Phase> ^
[04:22:14] <JustAberrant> it is, but that's part of what makes it work
[04:22:19] <HoneyDrops> I was spending more time just adding the required fluff than the actual functionality.
[04:22:25] <Phase> you don't have a lot of tools, and maybe that's for the best given its target market
[04:22:39] <JustAberrant> and I know we've had this discussion before, but it's definitely a language that's best written with an IDE
[04:22:58] <HoneyDrops> yeah, and I've already said: I don't like IDEs ;)
[04:23:16] <HoneyDrops> We should bring back LISP machines.
[04:23:17] <AppleDash> Me neither :(
[04:23:43] <JustAberrant> the fluff serves a purpose, but it does necessitate a tool to deal with it for you
[04:23:57] <Phase> the fluff i've seen is mostly noise
[04:24:11] <JustAberrant> it trades verbosity and boilerplate code for consistency and flexibility when you need it without having to resort to hacks
[04:24:15] <Phase> manually specifying what in other languages would be implicit, default arguments, traits, so on
[04:24:34] <HoneyDrops> Though to be fair, even the most advanced tasks were well below the complexity that OO would even begin to pay off.
[04:24:45] <JustAberrant> right, but no serious java coder specifies them manually, they hit ctrl+ag and have it all generated for them
[04:24:57] <HoneyDrops> I did code a fun little checkers game w/ an AI that could reliably beat me.
[04:24:59] <Phase> again it's such a thin abstraction, and for some reason they were against syntactic sugar
[04:25:07] <Phase> except for +
[04:25:10] <Phase> it gets to be special
[04:25:18] <JustAberrant> right, but I agree with that
[04:25:28] <JustAberrant> perl is the extreme other example and best case for why more syntax is bad
[04:25:30] <AppleDash> pfft, who uses +
[04:25:37] <AppleDash> stringBuilder.append() all the way
[04:25:42] <JustAberrant> java has such a small set of language mechanics it's easy to follow any code
[04:25:48] <AppleDash> Fun fact: + with strings is compiled to a StringBuilder and calls to .append()
[04:25:49] <HoneyDrops> Perl is fun, but not intended for anything past a short little tool.
[04:26:08] <JustAberrant> you don't need to know a bunch of weird shortcuts and arcane syntax that saves 10 seconds of typing but adds a half an hour of reading to the next dev
[04:26:13] <HoneyDrops> I use perl when sh + awk/sed gets to be too much.
[04:26:52] <Phase> AppleDash, yeah, it's magical syntax sugar which they're adamant is bad, but string gets to be special in so many ways
[04:27:06] <AppleDash> I wish they made == special for that too :P
[04:27:07] * JustAberrant does the same.. I write a lot of perl scripts, but I'd never use it for anything serious or that I wasn't going to actually throw away
[04:27:10] <Phase> AppleDash, ikr
[04:27:49] <JustAberrant> well string literals are also kinda syntactic sugar ;p
[04:27:53] <Phase> i wish they supported macros
[04:28:02] <Phase> JustAberrant, oh you have no idea
[04:28:04] <JustAberrant> oh god
[04:28:07] <Phase> ever heard of javacard
[04:28:07] <JustAberrant> macros are the devil
[04:28:19] <Phase> not text replacing macros, hygenic macros
[04:28:32] <JustAberrant> ok, but still, bad word ;p
[04:28:35] <Phase> http://sweetjs.org/ this thing
[04:28:35] <PinkiePieBot> [ sweet.js ]
[04:28:39] <JustAberrant> macros are why we can't have nice things
[04:28:52] <JustAberrant> also javascript makes me want to cry blood
[04:28:59] <Phase> or template classes instead of generics
[04:29:03] <Phase> as well as even
[04:30:06] <Phase> and support for imperitive functions would be nice
[04:30:19] <Phase> you can do static functions on a static class, and then a static import of that class
[04:30:34] <Phase> which is ugly as fuck but about the only way to not have a 'this' in your scope
[04:31:09] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn|2 (Alcoholicor@Pony-bfp.0d7.20.67.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:31:36] <Phase> we have had this conversation before
[04:33:42] <Phase> AppleDash, but that's an artifact of how thin the abstraction is imo
[04:34:06] <Phase> operators only work on primitives (except + with string which isn't actually +)
[04:34:18] <Phase> with references being one of the primitives
[04:34:47] <Phase> wonder if they do autoboxing yet
[04:34:57] <Phase> also autoboxing being a thing we need is a horrible stupid piece of crap
[04:36:22] <AppleDash> I think Java 8 does that
[04:36:41] <AppleDash> I switched from 7 to 8 and got a ton of "Unnecessary boxing" warnings in a large codebase
[04:36:44] <Phase> that primitives are exposed to the language is a huge flaw imo
[04:37:39] <Phase> but again thin abstraction, so things like javacard can work
[04:38:13] <Phase> JustAberrant, javacard only supports primitives, so no string. and no macro for assmebling 'strings', so you have to use byte arrays
[04:40:53] * HoneyDrops hugs char*
[04:41:13] <Phase> i really like how python 3 handles strings
[04:41:25] <HoneyDrops> I didn't like the lack of pointers in Java.
[04:46:05] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[04:46:17] <Phase> literal pointers wouldn't make sense
[04:46:28] <Phase> references or other container alias would be nice
[04:46:58] <Phase> but that would ultimately have to be added as a new class and sugar
[04:47:24] <JustAberrant> ?
[04:47:31] <JustAberrant> java is pretty much all references
[04:47:44] <JustAberrant> I can't really think of a legitimate reason to need a pointer in java
[04:47:51] <Phase> JustAberrant, no way to do out parameters
[04:48:03] <Phase> unless you pass some kind of mutable object
[04:48:13] <JustAberrant> could use an AtomicReference ;p
[04:48:16] <JustAberrant> or similar
[04:48:24] <HoneyDrops> Pointer arithmetic
[04:48:27] <Phase> so they were added as a new class :P
[04:48:38] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: doesn't make sense in java
[04:48:50] <HoneyDrops> I know :(
[04:48:59] <Phase> ah
[04:49:30] <Phase> would be iterators i guess
[04:49:31] <JustAberrant> either way, out parameters are bad imo anyway
[04:49:35] <Phase> with an exception as the exit condition
[04:50:00] <JustAberrant> rather return a result object
[04:50:22] <Phase> JustAberrant, it depends on what you're doing
[04:50:25] <JustAberrant> I use them in c++ but only because of the annoying overhead of creating a new class in c++
[04:50:26] <AppleDash> I like a success boolean and an out param that's null if success is false
[04:50:55] * Phase doesn't remember how truthiness works on references
[04:51:06] <JustAberrant> Phase: I like the idea of parameters being instructions to the method, return value being the results ;p
[04:51:14] <JustAberrant> technically "put the results here" is an instruction
[04:51:18] <JustAberrant> but it doesn't feel in that spirit
[04:51:44] <Phase> if you have multiple results for a function then you need some unpacking boilerplate
[04:51:54] <Phase> along with the extra type to do the packing
[04:52:00] <Phase> no tuples
[04:52:01] <JustAberrant> right, but in java that's trivial
[04:52:16] <Phase> it's very noisy
[04:52:34] <JustAberrant> right but that comes back to verbosity vs comprehensibility
[04:52:52] <JustAberrant> it's verbose (though the IDE can do 90% of the work), but anyone can follow and understand it
[04:53:03] <Phase> there's no verbosity/comprehensibility dichotomy
[04:53:16] <Phase> you can have both
[04:53:16] <HoneyDrops> As opposed to C++ that is verbose and incomprehensible~
[04:53:25] <Phase> or lack both
[04:53:26] <JustAberrant> out parameters add ambiguity
[04:53:57] <JustAberrant> how many times do you have to look up "does this return a new x or update the x I just gave it"
[04:54:57] <AppleDash> a lot
[04:55:17] <Phase> JustAberrant, you call functions without looking up what they do?
[04:55:18] <AppleDash> You could totally have out params
[04:55:31] <Phase> and ideally out params have an explicit syntax
[04:55:39] <Phase> & being the convention in c
[04:55:44] <AppleDash> class Out<T> { private T t; public T get() { return t; } public void set(T t) { this.t = t; } }
[04:55:56] <AppleDash> public void OutParamFunc(Out<SomeClass> out)
[04:56:03] <AppleDash> { out.set(something); }
[04:56:13] <AppleDash> you probably want a constructor
[04:56:16] <AppleDash> you get the idea though
[04:56:30] <Phase> you still need to unpack
[04:56:34] <AppleDash> yeah, I know
[04:56:40] <AppleDash> but I'm just saying you can hack it in :LP
[04:56:41] <AppleDash> :P
[04:56:54] <Phase> you're just using a generic instead of a new type, but it's still the same thing
[04:58:11] <JustAberrant> Phase: java methods tend to be verbose enough and consistent enough that yeah, occasionally
[04:58:42] <Phase> JustAberrant, thats gonna cause you problems
[04:59:05] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn|2 (Alcoholicor@Pony-bfp.0d7.20.67.IP)
[04:59:06] <JustAberrant> obviously you need to know what the class does, but because java only has one way of passing things in, you don't need to look up which particular method each method you use is using
[04:59:47] <Phase> and while you may know it doesn't mutate your reference, it may mutate the object
[04:59:58] <JustAberrant> it might, but that's very non-typical

[05:03:00] * Phase wanted to overload string equality in an irc bot
[05:03:13] * Phase found that every avenue for doing so was carefully and knowingly blocked

[05:03:52] <AppleDash> Java agent
[05:04:00] <AppleDash> when String.class is loaded, transform String#equals
[05:04:01] <AppleDash> lol
[05:05:56] <Phase> string is built so it can be defined within the vm, string.class is just a reference implementation
[05:06:29] <Phase> so the class is marked as final and you can't alias to it in any other way
[05:06:43] <Phase> do you want some other way to store strings? some extra methods?
[05:06:56] <Phase> overload equality for a particular systems idea of case sensitivity?

[05:24:50] <HoneyDrops> If something is running clientside, the client should have complete control over it's execution and the ability to easily inspect its operation, at least as easily as the intrinsic complexity of the task allows for.
[05:24:51] <Sombra> I got a box thing.
[05:24:55] <Sombra> And I plugged it into my steam link
[05:24:59] <HoneyDrops> its*
[05:26:43] <HoneyDrops> In general, clientside scripting should be used minimally, when there is no other option.
[05:30:29] <JustAberrant> pff, moar scripts obfuscating not just the script itself, but the content on the page ;p
[05:31:00] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, that.  Stop that!
[05:31:05] <JustAberrant> actually directly serving up content is passe, it's gotta be pulled via ajax and built up dynamically
[05:31:22] <HoneyDrops> -_-
[05:33:26] * HoneyDrops wants static HTML to come back.
[05:34:16] <HoneyDrops> If hosting images, should just be the direct file.  Video should be a direct URI to the stream or file.
[05:34:16] <JustAberrant> I wouldn't hold my breath ;p
[05:34:41] <HoneyDrops> So you can mpv URI and /done/
[05:35:23] <JustAberrant> right, which is a detriment to the content producer normally
[05:35:44] <JustAberrant> they don't go out of their way to prevent it (usually) because it doesn't represent a big chunk of the audience, but they certainly arn't going to make it easier
[05:36:27] <JustAberrant> they want you viewing the video on their site surrounded by ads in their player which probably also jams more ads in there, not to mention all the various tracking 
[05:37:46] <HoneyDrops> I still say we write tools to poison web tracking, blocking is not enough.
[05:38:41] <JustAberrant> meh, I'm sure people are trying
[05:38:45] <HoneyDrops> :3
[05:38:56] <JustAberrant> probably not very effectively though

[08:14:58] <Moonlightning> Wat.
[08:17:27] <HoneyDrops> Negative temps are a quirk of systems with limited state space.
[08:17:43] * JustAberrant places Moonlightning on a hot plate
[08:18:19] <HoneyDrops> It makes perfect sense if you think of it from a entropy/statistical mechanics perspective.
[08:18:31] * Moonlightning hovers above the plate instead.
[08:18:58] * tiwake crawls under Moonlightning and curls up on the plate
[08:19:43] <JustAberrant> this did not go as I had planned
[08:21:45] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning: "Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system. Systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system."
[08:23:50] <HoneyDrops> You have to stop thinking of temperature in a purely classical sense and consider what goes on in systems with limited degrees of freedom and how adding energy can lower rather than raise the number of possible states.

[21:01:03] <Sour_Sweet> Linux is such a mess sometimes ... The action my notebook should perform on crtical battery life is broken. I guess it's trying a suspend even though the power manager GUI says hibernate, which I cannot change for whatever reason (Ubuntu GNOME). So I change it via dconf to shutdown which is ignored. Both suspend and hibernate work if I perform them maunally (suspend via GUI, hibernate via
[21:01:05] <Sour_Sweet> terminal). I don't even know where to start looking for a solution now 6_9
[21:01:34] <mniip> Sour_Sweet, ooh I had that happen

[21:07:43] <Sour_Sweet> No suspending as in standby. It doesn't go to the EFI / BIOS screen for that (It would for hibernate, that's why I think even if the GUI says hibernate it acutally does a suspend)
