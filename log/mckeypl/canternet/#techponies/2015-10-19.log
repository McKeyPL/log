[22:50:14] <Moonlightning> …hmmmmmm.
[22:50:31] <Moonlightning> So uploads always seem to start at like 4 MiB/s, and then slow down quickly to the usual ~20 KiB/s
[22:50:43] <Moonlightning> I wonder if I could exploit that by uploading chunks of a file one at a time >.>

[22:56:47] <johnsey> "I have a PC myself but I really want that mac/linux stretch goal just for the fact that there will be more people to play this game with."
[22:57:03] <johnsey> as laudable as that is, I wonder where along the road PC became equal to windows
[22:57:53] <johnsey> i know it's commonly used synonymously by the industry
[22:58:09] <johnsey> but i just can't stop wondering
[22:58:59] <Moonlightning> personally, I think we should all dump /PC/ in favor of /box/ or /machine/, optionally with an OS prepended, and go back to using /PC/ for /politically correct/.
[22:59:13] <Moonlightning> “yeah, I have this Windows machine here”
[22:59:32] <johnsey> but i wanna use it for peacock :<
[23:01:57] <Moonlightning> …hay, I'm seeing double!
[23:02:05] <Moonlightning> 62%  601MB   9.3MB/s   9.1MB/s   00:38 ETA
[23:02:10] <johnsey> I guess it's apple's fault though, coining "Mac" as antonym of "PC" and most windows using not knowing where to place linux, so they just put it in the mac corner
[23:02:11] <Moonlightning> What's with this scp progress line?
[23:02:32] <Moonlightning> What about all the other *nixes :P
[23:02:51] <Moonlightning> Actually, that's kind of fair!
[23:02:55] <Moonlightning> You have Windows on the one hand
[23:03:03] <Moonlightning> and all the sane OSes (mostly *nixes) on the other
[23:03:09] <Moonlightning> I do that, myself. :p
[23:15:34] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: left is overall, right is current
[23:15:45] <wolfyshy> so say you are doing a transfer on wireless, it is going a 2MB/s
[23:15:53] <wolfyshy> you are moving around and hit a place where signal is poor
[23:16:00] <wolfyshy> left will go down slightly 1.9MB  1.8MB
[23:16:05] <wolfyshy> right will show 10kb/s
[23:16:29] <wolfyshy> go back to a place with good signal, now the right shows 2MB/s again and left goes up slightly 1.9 2.0
[23:16:35] <wolfyshy> hopefully that makes sense
[23:20:05] <Moonlightning> wolfyshy: left one is an average of the entire transfer; right one is just an average of the recent bit.
[23:20:20] <wolfyshy> yes
[23:20:27] <Moonlightning> cool. ^^
[23:20:29] <wolfyshy> so the right is what you are used to
[23:20:47] <Moonlightning> :P
[23:21:01] <Moonlightning> I feel like most things just do a naïve overall estimate.
