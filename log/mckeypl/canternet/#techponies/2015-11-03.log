[02:34:10] <Midnight_Tinker> which one?
[02:35:20] <Seoson> What do you mean?
[02:35:22] <Moonlightning> Okay. So I'm implementing a simple -login- authentication webpage (no client-side technology except HTTP, HTML, and CSS—in particular, no cookies or JavaScript). On authentication failure, I want to basically serve them the same webpage with a textual error message added and a different HTTP status code.
[02:35:36] <Moonlightning> I'm using Flask server-side. Is there a way I can do that without repeating myself?
[02:36:35] <Moonlightning> The thing that comes to mind is to put an {{ error_message }} placeholder in the auth page template and if they fail to authenticate, replace it with HTML for the error message and serve it again
[02:36:42] <Moonlightning> but that means hardcoding HTML into a Python file, which is bleh
[02:37:02] <Moonlightning> I need, like…conditional HTML.
[02:38:36] <Moonlightning> Maybe I could put code for the error in a separate file, as an HTML fragment (as opposed to a full document), and conditionally include it? Nest Flask render_template() calls?
[02:39:21] <JustAberrant> no idea about python, but there's template engines that let you do conditional html for perl, php, etc..
[02:39:44] <Moonlightning> Flask uses Jinja
[02:39:52] <Moonlightning> …OH Jinja has conditionals!
[02:39:53] <Moonlightning> duh
[02:40:00] <Seoson> How to use a legitimate security service to do evil things: 1) Go to haveibeenpwned.com 2) Request them to send you any e-mail in a breach 3) Set domain to a one time e-mail provider. (e.g. trash-mail.com) 3) Choose verification via non admin standard e-mail security@domain.tld 4) Profit!
[02:40:10] <JustAberrant> usually they even support stuff like loops.. so you can give it an array of error messages and it'll html-arize it

[04:37:03] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: for $99/year you get discount tickets to linuxcon, and lenovo employee discount (15% off anything they sell)
[04:37:13] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: in addition to a lil badge you can put on your site and résumé
[04:37:23] <wolfyshy> it's well worth it for me
[04:37:26] <Moonlightning> …wait, what?
[04:37:28] <wolfyshy> yes
[04:37:34] <Moonlightning> No, wait.
[04:37:35] <wolfyshy> joining the Linux Foundation has SERIOUS perks
[04:37:42] <Moonlightning> …oh.
[04:37:46] <Moonlightning> See, all I got was a 403.
[04:37:50] <wolfyshy> yes.
[04:37:52] <wolfyshy> that's my point
[04:37:54] <wolfyshy> I want to join
[04:37:56] <wolfyshy> that's the form
[04:37:58] <wolfyshy> it's a 403
[04:38:02] <wolfyshy> I can't actually join
[04:38:04] <Moonlightning> So I thought you were making a j—oh.
[04:38:35] <wolfyshy> hence, nobody with their Enterprise Linux Certifications™ can actually RUN the server so I can give them my money
[04:38:42] <Moonlightning> XP
[04:38:54] <Moonlightning> Do you know lots about webservers?
[04:38:58] <Moonlightning> I has a questions
[04:39:11] <wolfyshy> I have patches in lighty but I have been getting back into apache since 2.4 has LOTS of nice security features
[04:39:42] <wolfyshy> I've been doing web dev on linux since 1999 (apache on red hat)
[04:40:16] <wolfyshy> so I would say... 'somewhat'.. honestly even with all these years, I'm still learning new stuff every day.  there's so much to it.  one reason I like it I guess.  never boring.
[04:40:22] <wolfyshy> ask away though

[04:46:07] <Moonlightning> Is there not a better status code than 400 for authentication failures when I'm not using the HTTP authentication mechanism (which rules out returning 401)?
[04:46:23] <wolfyshy> 403.
[04:47:05] <Moonlightning> 403? Isn't that for when authenticating won't make a difference?
[04:47:30] <Moonlightning> like when it's a static file with no read permission to the webserver. No matter what happens, it's not gonna serve it to you.

[04:48:07] <Seoson> 403 is a generic permission denied error code.
