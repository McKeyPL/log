[21:01:23] <AppleDash> Starthunder: the problem is I need advice on writing a web app :P
[21:03:28] <Starthunder> Specifically?
[21:09:40] <Starthunder> On an unrelated note…#techponies, how do you pronounce CIDR things?
[21:10:48] <Starthunder> Like 192.0.2/24
[21:10:53] <Starthunder> Or 10/8
[21:10:56] <Starthunder> Or /12
[21:12:18] <Colgate> 10 slash 8
[21:12:44] <Colgate> ten dot zero dot zero dot zero slash eight
[21:13:00] <Colgate> since if I don't say the whole thing, people don't understand :P
[21:13:30] <Starthunder> Isn't that an accepted format, though?

[21:21:08] <Starthunder> Of a /what/ host?
[21:21:29] <AppleDash> A website
[21:21:32] <AppleDash> that you upload file to
[21:21:36] <AppleDash> and you get a direct link to that file
[21:22:43] <Colgate> tls? what kind of security? :P

[21:26:11] <Starthunder> cool, I have a three-part plan just for this
[21:26:17] <Starthunder> 1. Don't use Windows
[21:26:20] <Starthunder> 2. Don't be an idiot
[21:26:29] <Starthunder> 3. There is no part 3. It's that fuckkin' simple.
[21:26:43] <AppleDash> Number 1 fits under 2
[21:26:46] <AppleDash> now define the rest of 2
[21:27:11] <Starthunder> I'm too lazy to do that.
[21:27:20] <AppleDash> :(
[21:27:23] <Starthunder> You know enough about tech to handle it yourself. :V
[21:27:37] <AppleDash> I'm just looking for any oversights
[21:27:41] <Starthunder> the least intuitive thing about it is that it implies not using anything created by idiots
[21:27:50] <AppleDash> My current plan is having a separate nginx server { } block to serve the files
[21:27:57] <AppleDash> And have that block not handle anything like PHP
[21:28:22] <Starthunder> for example, don't use some shitty PHP script for password authentication, because PHP does weird coersion shit that considers half of the hashspace equal to zero or something
[21:28:36] <AppleDash> just add more ==
[21:28:38] <AppleDash> use ===
[21:28:45] <AppleDash> But I'm not using PHP here
[21:28:50] <AppleDash> I'm using Python
[21:29:39] <AppleDash> Also, there's no password authentication because we're keeping it simple
[21:29:42] <AppleDash> press the button
[21:29:44] <AppleDash> choose file
[21:29:45] <AppleDash> upload
[21:29:47] <AppleDash> get link, done
