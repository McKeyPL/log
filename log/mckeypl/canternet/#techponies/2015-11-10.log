[01:34:23] <Seoson> This is a joke, right? http://www.ghacks.net/2015/11/08/mozilla-plans-to-remove-support-for-heavyweight-themes-in-firefox/ -.-
[01:37:33] <Googie> They've been moving away in general from giving extensions/themes as much in depth control as they have had
[01:38:08] <Googie> I think they might be planning to eventually move away from chrome (Confusing name... Firefox's GUI system)
[01:38:22] <Googie> Right now the whole API is based on chrome
[01:38:58] <HoneyDrops> So they are taking away what makes FF great
[01:40:28] <Googie> Well, I think they have to replace that component at some point, it's holding them back. It wouldn't be an issue if they had a plan to replace properly with the replacement having an equally powerful extension system though :/
[01:41:20] * Googie doesn't want to lose Pentadactyl :(
[01:41:27] <Eclipse> Googie: PENTADACTYL
[01:41:29] <Eclipse> :D :D :D :D :D 
[01:41:43] <Eclipse> rip in peace xul
[01:41:50] <HoneyDrops> Pentadactyl should be the default UI
[01:42:33] <Googie> No, no it shouldn't :P It needs to be an option though
[01:42:52] <Eclipse> I really hope they don't utterly slay pentadactyl
[01:42:56] <Eclipse> vimium is just sad
[01:42:59] *** Joins: Webster (Webster@Pony-jrej46.fios.verizon.net)
[01:43:57] <HoneyDrops> I would also accept the rednering engine just providing an API to let you wrap it in whatever gui you want
[01:45:25] <HoneyDrops> Sadly webkit's API is somewhat lacking, last I checked.
[01:45:48] <HoneyDrops> I loved luakit, but the inability to do things like noscript and uMatrix/RequestPolicy was a dealbreaker.
[01:48:05] <Seoson> You could build that of Chromeium though
[01:48:57] <Seoson> I've not looked into webkit's api, but it's commonly used inside apps as well, so one would guess it works fine
[01:49:49] <HoneyDrops> It doesn't have as many hooks for internal stuff.  It is easy to wrap it in stuff, but you're fairly limited on controlling its internal behavior.
[01:50:39] <HoneyDrops> My understanding is it's getting better, but still behind what FF allows.
[01:52:04] <Seoson> I personally use firefox only because of the addons. I'm shifting more and more things to Chrome already. Mozilla is on a very bad course that started with the rapid release bullshit
[01:53:20] <HoneyDrops> I guess ideally complete and fine-grained control over resource requests and script permissions would be /default/ functionality.  However, NoScript and uMatrix work well at the moment.
[01:54:34] <Seoson> No thank you you can keep FF Hello and the new sync. I prefered the old one where I could host my own server.
[01:55:16] <HoneyDrops> I don't even know what those are XD
[01:56:42] <Seoson> Sync as in syncing your history, passwords, bookmarks, settings, addons (never actually worked). FF Hello is a VoIP/Video chat thing

[02:06:35] <Lapsus> well, a couple months to a couple years I guess
[02:06:44] <Lapsus> depends on the fan
[02:07:02] * Seoson prefers huge fans with a minimal rpm setting
[02:07:46] <Lapsus> Agreed, but there's nothing really wrong with his choice having a 92mm fan instead of something larger
[02:08:09] <Lapsus> Deathpony: for reference, larger fans = lower pitched noise
[02:08:31] <Lapsus> also you tend to need less rpm for larger fans to get the same airflow
[02:08:46] * Lapsus prefers passive cooling, but that's not always possible
[02:09:04] <Lapsus> Speaking of fans, I need some 40mm ones D:
[02:11:16] <Lapsus> I'd love to get noctua ones, but I don't know if I can justify $20 for one 40mm fan

[15:16:40] <DataByte> because you can apparently estimate how long someone will talk down to the second
[15:17:26] <Moonlightning> Always nice to have that extra bit of precision, without the accuracy for it. c:
[15:18:25] <DataByte> it's a % of error they throw on top to make you feel they're running quick, apparently
[15:18:34] <DataByte> was picked up much quicker than that
[15:19:45] <DataByte> most live distros have a memtest.. not all make it easy to access, though
[15:20:37] <DataByte> ubuntu started booting straight to the live os instead of giving you the menu
