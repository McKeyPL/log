[00:01:05] <HoneyDrops> Web browsers were designed to be document viewers, not application platforms, trying to shoehorn applications into a document viewer is like programming games in Excel... you can do it, but there are so many better options.

[00:02:20] <RazorSharpFang> For small applications, it works though. A lot of people don't like downloading and installing software from the web. Others though... "Safe Installer.exe? Yes plz"
[00:03:44] <RazorSharpFang> But that said, I don't understand why web-applications need AJAX.
[00:04:43] <HoneyDrops> The solution is a package manager.
[00:05:03] <Quindo> but which package manager!  oh!  Safe_package_manager.exe!  that should work.
[00:06:30] <HoneyDrops> At some point the user must decide what software they will trust.  There is no escaping that fact.

[00:11:38] <RazorSharpFang> Some people (especially semi-computer-literate people) prefer web-applications for smaller stuff, such as games. I think they may take comfort in knowing that it's all sandboxed in the browser (except for flash, but that's a whole another story).
[00:12:52] * Moonlightning (is playing Minecraft, if anypony wants to try their hoof at a hundred-minute challenge)
[00:14:58] <RazorSharpFang> That, and there's a lot of convenicence in clicking on a link, and playing right then and there. No installation, or any of that guff involved. That, and users may not be able to install software.
[00:15:36] <RazorSharpFang> Or run unauthorized software for that matter, especially in schools/uni and the like
[00:16:08] <HoneyDrops> In theory it's sandboxed, or you assume that nothing harmful can be done entirely within the sandbox.
[00:16:31] <HoneyDrops> web tracking works entirely within the sandbox
[00:17:17] <RazorSharpFang> I'm still not sure how web tracking works.
[00:17:36] <RazorSharpFang> Cookies, right? Or something else?
[00:17:53] <HoneyDrops> there are several ways

[00:45:03] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Something wrong?

[00:45:49] <RazorSharpFang> well, I want to block all but *.twitch.tv
[00:46:16] <JustAberrant> mm, that may be tricky because I imagine they have several different hosts
[00:46:49] * JustAberrant shruggles
[00:47:07] <RazorSharpFang> twitch.tv resolves to {192.16.71.165, 192.16.71.176, 192.16.71.180, ... }
[00:47:56] <JustAberrant> right, but possible subdomains might resolve elsewhere
[00:48:05] <RazorSharpFang> True.
[00:48:07] <JustAberrant> either way, can always try and see what happens
[00:48:24] <RazorSharpFang> I'm new to windows firewalling, I'm just guessing at the moment

[01:07:28] <Phase> HoneyDrops, windows containers~
[01:07:55] <Phase> real glad they did that, + docker gives you a nice interface
[01:08:40] <Kinsley> When I rebuild my computer, I might do that.
[01:08:43] <Divide|Tech> This particular problem: after upgrading to a new modem, the customer noticed that their laptop could no longer connect to the internet.  BOTH network devices were off, showing no connectivity - both wifi and ethernet.  After performing preliminary troubleshooting, I finally deduced that it was a malformed update which caused the issues, and threw the customer into a system restore.
[01:08:58] <Kinsley> But I also need to get like, 4 more TB of storage.
[01:09:12] <Phase> and you can in theory socket activate the whole setup
[01:09:25] <Phase> so windows only exists while stuff is running
[01:09:41] <Kinsley> I do remember a combination of driver and Windows updates killed XCOM: EW for me.
[01:09:54] <Kinsley> System restore to an earlier state fixed it.

[06:47:53] <RazorSharpFang> I've currently got all port 80 outbound traffic blocked, which is close to what I want.
[06:48:13] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, don't think you can filter by domain
[06:49:10] <RazorSharpFang> I'm prepared to filter by what the nslookup says the domain's address is.
[06:49:22] <RazorSharpFang> I haven't seen them change, they've pretty much always been that
[06:50:01] <Phase> well you can use the ui from compmgmt.msc, or open powershell and run get-command *Firewall* to set it up from there
[06:50:47] <RazorSharpFang> Well, I meant how to get a none-by-X type thing going. I've already set up a custom rule to block port 80 traffic, but I can't get it to allow from some.
[06:56:33] <RazorSharpFang> What happens if your rules conflict?
[06:58:55] <ShivalWolf> that sounds liek soemthing your better off using a proxy for. dont have a default gateway out and require a proxy and have a whitelist on the proxy

[07:06:54] <JustAberrant> sounds like a job for squid ;p
[07:07:32] <HoneyDrops> squid works, but I was thinking for the firewall
[07:08:00] <JustAberrant> he clearly said he was using windows, last I checked there wasn't an iptables port yet
[07:08:39] <JustAberrant> if I was doing it though I'd probably have a linux or bsd vm acting as my router/gateway and possible filtering proxy
[07:09:07] <HoneyDrops> Windows Guest on a Windows Host?  *runs screaming*
[07:09:09] <JustAberrant> and set up a virtual network so that the windows vm can only talk to it
[07:09:45] <Phase> HoneyDrops, i'm running that at work RIGHT NOW!
[07:09:46] <JustAberrant> and I'd use shorewall because screw messing with iptables directly, life is too short for that shit ;p
[07:09:58] * HoneyDrops uses shorewall too >_>
[07:10:03] <JustAberrant> :>
[07:11:33] * ShivalWolf has to screw with iptables directly. ive not yet found a firewall manager app that handles custom source natting rules
[07:12:09] * Moonlightning has yet to use an iptables wrapper
[07:12:39] <JustAberrant> we just have a big ol` iptables script at work because yeah, we do some pretty funky stuff and it's easier to go direct
[07:12:39] <Moonlightning> except for fail2ban
[07:12:56] <HoneyDrops> Shorewall might?  It's really just some scripts that wrap around iptables.  No UI, just edit come config files that are parsed to generate the iptables commands.
[07:13:04] <JustAberrant> but for stuff at home where I'm basically saying "let this from here go there", shorewall is beautiful ;p
[07:13:41] <ShivalWolf> at home i have ip range 1-20 go out a specific external ip. 21-30 out a 2nd specific external ip and continued on for each of my housemates
[07:13:47] <ShivalWolf> i have a /29 routed to home
[07:13:50] <Phase> hyper-v isn't too bad but if you're doing anything slightly outside microsofts vision of virtualized infrastructure be prepared for problems
[07:14:04] <ShivalWolf> so each housemate gets their own external ip but its not routed directly to their machiens but source natted
[07:14:40] <Phase> ShivalWolf, why not have dhcp hand them out directly?
[07:15:05] <ShivalWolf> Phase: no way in hell would i want windows boxes with publicly accessable IP's
[07:15:13] <ShivalWolf> also tehres not enough public ips for all the clients
[07:15:21] <Moonlightning> ShivalWolf: ewwwwww
[07:15:30] <Phase> by mac address :P not for arbitrary clients
[07:15:35] <Moonlightning> why you have block-sized-ish ranges that aren't actual blocks
[07:15:49] * Moonlightning reorganizes ShivalWolf's LAN into neat little blocks
[07:16:00] <ShivalWolf> dhcp handles the ip allocations but iptables has to handle the source natting
[07:16:19] <JustAberrant> my network is relatively simple but still not dead simple ;p
[07:16:40] <ShivalWolf> i used to ipsec my lan
[07:16:50] <ShivalWolf> convolutedly evil
[07:17:45] * JustAberrant kinda wants to play around with ipsec
[07:17:55] <JustAberrant> I only vaguely know the basics
[07:18:05] <ShivalWolf> its got its uses
[07:18:06] <JustAberrant> I wonder what kind of performance hit there would be
[07:18:28] <ShivalWolf> i used to use it to tunnel ipv6 to home
[07:18:35] * Phase wonders if dhcp can hand out multiple addresses to a client
[07:18:40] <Moonlightning> why do we even need IPSec?
[07:18:43] <ShivalWolf> Phase: last i looked no
[07:18:48] <Moonlightning> I mean, we have IP, and we have TLS
[07:18:52] <ShivalWolf> i tried
[07:19:05] <Moonlightning> what usecases are there for IPSec that aren't already covered
[07:19:25] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: the obvious? software that doesn't and won't support TLS?
[07:19:30] <Phase> Moonlightning, securing things without code changes, authentication without encryption
[07:19:46] <Phase> it's more of an enterprise thing really
[07:19:56] <Moonlightning> I see.
[07:20:00] <ShivalWolf> yeah ipsec is really enterprise mainly now
[07:20:21] <Phase> stuff like running unencrypted but authenticated traffic so it can be audited by a firewall
[07:20:22] <JustAberrant> might be nice for NFS depending on how much of a pain it is ;p
[07:20:39] <Moonlightning> TLS can do that, though, can't it?
[07:20:45] <Moonlightning> Just negotiate a null cipher
[07:20:49] <Phase> don't know, and that needs code changes
[07:20:56] <Phase> ipsec works with litterally everything
[07:21:17] * JustAberrant still annoyed that NFS lacks a middle ground between "tell me who you are and I'll take your word for it" and "full on kerberos based system"
[07:21:41] <ShivalWolf> JustAberrant: yeah nfs is weird like that
[07:21:45] <ShivalWolf> but it does have very low overhead
[07:21:55] <Phase> ^ JustAberrant
[07:22:04] <Phase> nfs would be such an application for ipsec
[07:22:43] <JustAberrant> I wonder if it's more pain to make nfs secure directly or just wrap it up in ipsec ;p
[07:23:42] <Phase> inter-site vpn is another nice use
[07:23:52] <Moonlightning> openvpn ftw
[07:24:01] <Phase> granted this sorta stuff will only really work on ipv6
[07:24:21] * Moonlightning wants native v6 ;-;
[07:24:25] <Phase> behind a nat you need l2tp, at which point openvpn is probably easier unless you need to support windows clients

[09:13:12] <tiwake> I havent had the chance to use android
[09:13:33] <tiwake> well sorta I suppose
[09:13:54] <Moonlightning> :P
[09:14:00] <Moonlightning> I was very disappointed.
[09:14:16] <Moonlightning> It seems to pride itself on customizability, and it uses Linux
[09:14:27] <Moonlightning> so, naturally, I thought it would ship as a usable Linux system
[09:14:33] <Moonlightning> I was very disappointed when it didn't
[09:14:47] <tiwake> I've had an android capable cellphone for a few weeks now... the first thing I did was multi-rom boot with sailfishOS
[09:15:37] <tiwake> havent really had a chance to really use either OS though
[09:16:04] <tiwake> first 5 minutes with iOS was a lot more painful than the first 5 minutes with android XD
[09:16:32] <tiwake> 5 minutes is my entire life time experience with iOS BTW
[09:16:48] <RazorSharpFang> Couldn't stand it?
[09:16:56] <tiwake> and will probably stay that way for the rest of my life
[09:17:03] <Moonlightning> I like iOS better, in general
[09:17:11] <Moonlightning> the UI is just so much better to me
[09:17:11] <tiwake> its a horrible UI though
[09:17:16] <Moonlightning> … :P
[09:17:25] <Moonlightning> The permissions, too
[09:17:39] <Moonlightning> Android requires you to accept an app's permissions to install it
[09:17:52] <Moonlightning> iOS lets you install the app, btu deny its permissions
[09:18:04] <tiwake> the only way you can do simple things like close programs is to look up the gestures online
[09:18:17] <tiwake> that pretty much defines a bad UI
[09:18:26] <JustAberrant> yeah that annoys me @ permissions
[09:18:38] <Moonlightning> Android does the same thing, on certain devices
[09:18:45] <Moonlightning> I have a Nexus, which has virtual buttons, so okay
[09:19:00] <Moonlightning> But my friend got an old smartphone…to get the list of apps, you hold down the home button
[09:19:05] <tiwake> donno, I have a nexus 5 running android 6
[09:19:11] <Moonlightning> how is that better than iOS' double-press-the-home-button
[09:19:26] <tiwake> its probably not
[09:19:27] <tiwake> lol
[09:19:36] <Moonlightning> also: even with the virtual buttons, you have to either mess around with it, or look it up
[09:19:44] <Moonlightning> like, how are you supposed to know what the square means
[09:19:54] <tiwake> android is customizable on the vendor side from what I've read about it
[09:20:06] <Moonlightning> That doesn't mean shit.
[09:20:17] <tiwake> well
[09:20:22] <Moonlightning> Whopdee fuckkin' do
[09:20:24] <tiwake> sure, I suppose
[09:20:35] <Moonlightning> it's all about user customizability
[09:20:50] *** Quits: RazorSharpFang (mnsbrekkdup@sharpest.of.all.fangs) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[09:20:52] <Moonlightning> as HoneyDrops says so frequently, stuff should be at the sole discretion of the user
[09:21:07] <tiwake> when there are three obvious buttons, what shape they are does not really matter
[09:21:30] <tiwake> like the top right or left corner of every window of any given desktop operating system
[09:22:02] <Moonlightning> Touché.
[09:22:03] <tiwake> not saying thats a good UI design either
[09:22:20] <Moonlightning> I mean, personally, I'm okay with having to fuck around with stuff
[09:22:24] <Moonlightning> that's what I'm gonna do, anyway
[09:22:30] <tiwake> but its a pretty universal UI design
[09:22:32] <tiwake> right
[09:23:23] <tiwake> I just should have to learn to swirl my finger around counter-clockwise and say "take me to narnia" to get it to switch between open programs
[09:23:24] <JustAberrant> android is definitely it's own thing that takes a bit to get used ti
[09:23:42] <JustAberrant> * to
[09:24:11] <JustAberrant> and imo the default programs are stupidly unintuitive, especially stuff like contacts/making phone calls :(
[09:24:21] <tiwake> Moonlightning: do you have a nexus 5?
[09:24:49] <JustAberrant> also not a fan of the whole not explicitly closing programs thing and everything just running in the background until it needs the resources
[09:25:03] <tiwake> yeah
[09:25:10] <Googie> Moonlightning: A lot of what is good about Android from a power user's perspective is basically that you have a lot more control than iOS.
[09:25:19] <tiwake> switch to the terminal to actually close the program
[09:25:21] <tiwake> lol
[09:25:48] <JustAberrant> well, you can also manually kill programs with android in dev move
[09:25:50] <JustAberrant> * mode
[09:25:53] <Googie> Once rooted especially, you basically do have access to a basic GNU userland if you really want.
[09:25:53] <JustAberrant> but it's not the norm
[09:26:09] *** Quits: Melanosuchus (quassel@Pony-vj1146.as13285.net) (Connection closed)
[09:26:18] <tiwake> I still need to figure out how to make the text smaller
[09:26:20] <Googie> Also stuff like F-Droid exists, which is a FOSS package manager for Android.
[09:26:25] <Moonlightning> Googie: yeah, except rooting breaks OTA updates, kind of.
[09:26:55] <Googie> I've not really needed to root yet. Most of what I've wanted doesn't need root these days.
[09:26:58] <Moonlightning> at least iOS is upfront about its hard abstractions
[09:27:04] <Moonlightning> there we go, that's my beef with Android
[09:27:10] <Moonlightning> it /pretends/ to be super open and customizable
[09:27:21] <Moonlightning> but if you actually want to get into that, it bends you over and fucks you
[09:27:26] <tiwake> yeah
[09:27:30] <Googie> Kinda, but it's still a lot better than iOS.
[09:27:33] <Moonlightning> iOS is like…nah man. my way or the highway.
[09:27:39] <Moonlightning> you want the filesystem? HAHAHA no.
[09:27:47] <Moonlightning> use the abstractions or gtfo
[09:28:06] <JustAberrant> I've had no problems in that regard, but I have a nexus 5 and a carrier that doesn't tend to mess with stuff
[09:28:14] <Googie> ^
[09:28:14] <Moonlightning> Android is like…sure, you can mess with the filesystem if you want, but first you have to do a factory reset, and then you won't be able to install updates afterwards
[09:28:16] <Googie> Nexus 5 as well.
[09:28:33] <tiwake> you should try out SailfishOS if you have a nexus 5
[09:28:35] <Moonlightning> Nexus 5, Play Store edition
[09:28:40] <Googie> Access to the filesystem is perfectly fine without root.
[09:28:48] <JustAberrant> isn't sailfish proprietary in parts
[09:28:56] <tiwake> sure
[09:29:00] <Googie> No reset required.
[09:29:01] <Moonlightning> Except that half the shit is mounted readonly, and you can't remount it readwrite without *ahem*
[09:29:24] <Googie> Well, yeah, if you're modifying the system itself, you certainly need root.
[09:29:25] <JustAberrant> in fairness though, probably for a reason
[09:29:48] <Moonlightning> You shouldn't have to fucking //explot security flaws// to get root, though
[09:29:51] <Googie> Even the reason for the factory reset to get access to root is actually for a good reason.
[09:29:52] <Moonlightning> that's fuckkin' ridiculous
[09:29:56] <Moonlightning> it also means that shit's insecure :V
[09:29:58] <Googie> You're not though.
[09:30:17] <Moonlightning> AFAIK that's what it is :I
[09:30:20] <Googie> The bootloader can have secure booting disabled easily, /but/ if you do so, it'll wipe all the user data.
[09:30:24] <Moonlightning> reggardless, it's a HOOP
[09:30:26] <Googie> For security purposes.
[09:30:37] <Moonlightning> a HOOP you have to JUMP THROUGH to gain control over the device
[09:30:45] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops, little help here? :P
[09:30:51] <Googie> It's actually honestly decent policy from a security perspective.
[09:31:09] <Moonlightning> I have no issue with secure boot.
[09:31:17] <JustAberrant> meh, given the scope of the device, seems a reasonable hoop
[09:31:22] <Moonlightning> My issue is that the OS that is booted securely doesn't let you sudo.
[09:31:26] <JustAberrant> and as Googie said, it's not completely arbitrary
[09:31:26] <Moonlightning> That's insane.
[09:31:28] <Googie> If someone gets access to your phone, they can't just flash their own code to bypass the lock screen, and gain access to your stuff.
[09:31:32] <Googie> Moonlightning: It does
[09:31:42] <Moonlightning> Really? How?
[09:31:45] <Googie> You can renable secure boot once you've made your modifications
[09:32:11] <Googie> (Well, not really "secure boot", but more of a "I won't let you flash the system partition anymore")
[09:32:11] <Moonlightning> I believe my mane points stand :V
[09:32:24] <tiwake> lol
[09:32:27] <Googie> Honestly... I don't really think so.
[09:32:39] <Googie> If you want to be able to flash code at any time to the device, you can.
[09:32:59] <Googie> If you just want to gain access to root securely, configure it that way and then set it back to being secure.
[09:33:00] <Moonlightning> 1. It advertises itself as customizable and such, but makes you jump through hoops to get actual control
[09:33:33] <Googie> Well, if it allowed you to flash custom software at any time, it'd be trivial to take someone's device for just a few minutes and flash a nice little backdoor onto it.
[09:34:00] <Moonlightning> you can do that with desktops, too
[09:34:04] <Moonlightning> it's called an evil-maid attack
[09:34:15] <JustAberrant> yeah, but it's a far greater risk with phones
[09:34:15] <Googie> Yeah, but generally speaking, you don't bring desktops with you everywhere you go.
[09:34:47] <Moonlightning> lots of people travel with laptops
[09:34:55] <Moonlightning> also, my threat model includes nationstates
[09:35:00] <Moonlightning> so, ahem
[09:35:35] <HoneyDrops> (is sleeping, but...) who leaves their phone unattended in an insecure place?
[09:35:50] <JustAberrant> the vast majority of the population at some point? ;p
[09:36:12] <JustAberrant> phones are a major security vs convenience argument
[09:36:38] <JustAberrant> people take them out and use them for very short periods of time
[09:36:51] <JustAberrant> and don't want to enter a huge secure password every time they do so
[09:37:10] <Moonlightning> fingerprint auth plox
[09:37:12] <Googie> The thing is, you can still flash software onto the device whenever you want, they don't lock you out of that.
[09:37:21] *** Phase4 is now known as Phase
[09:37:25] <Googie> Also, fingerprint authentication is terrible :V
[09:37:26] <Moonlightning> Lightning was surprised at my password :p
[09:37:35] <HoneyDrops> I would never leave my phone (or any device, or hell even regular mundane things) unattended in a public place.
[09:37:37] <Moonlightning> He was like, “…that's your password?”
[09:37:38] <Googie> You just have to turn a setting off first.
[09:37:44] <Moonlightning> I was like…“yeah…gotta be secure, yo”
[09:37:47] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: yeah, but your not the vast majority of people
[09:37:52] <Moonlightning> Why's fingerprint auth terrible :<
[09:38:12] <Phase> easy to forge fingerprints
[09:38:18] <Googie> http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/30/hacker-fakes-german-ministers-fingerprints-using-photos-of-her-hands
[09:38:18] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: cause you can't revoke auth, not easily ;p
[09:38:18] <PinkiePieBot> [ Hacker fakes German minister's fingerprints using photos of her hands | Technology | The Guardian ]
[09:38:20] <Googie> CCC last year.
[09:38:21] <Phase> turns out people touch things with their fingers
[09:38:29] <Phase> and leave their prints everywhere
[09:38:43] <Moonlightning> I thought that was a solved problem. :/
[09:39:04] <Phase> touching things?
[09:39:11] <Phase> yes but not leaving fingerprints isn't
[09:39:25] <Googie> Those aren't hand-fetish photographs, those are just regular press photos, and they were /still/ able to extract the fingerprints from them.
[09:39:31] * tiwake rolls over for Moonlightning to do a "finger print testing"
[09:39:45] <Phase> and yeah, can't revoke your own fingerprint
[09:39:45] <Googie> So... if you're getting photos taken of you, there you go :P
[09:39:49] <Googie> Don't even need to touch stuff now.
[09:39:50] <Moonlightning> like, what's used for authentication is more than what you could get from a picture or dusting
[09:40:15] <JustAberrant> it seems to be the opposite ;p
[09:40:25] <Googie> Moonlightning: There was a nice big talk at CCC last year about just how you /could/ get the quality needed for authentication just from photos.
[09:40:39] <JustAberrant> they have to account for shit on the lense, changes due to whatever, etc
[09:40:56] <Phase> biometrics work to confirm the identity of the person right infront of you
[09:41:03] <Phase> they're not a password
[09:41:07] <Googie> The got the prints of the German defence minister just from her PR photos.
[09:41:24] <Moonlightning> so how do I authenticate securely but conveniently :<
[09:41:32] <tiwake> eye scan?
[09:41:34] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: you don't, not yet anyway ;p
[09:41:40] <Phase> Moonlightning, when you figure it out i'd love to know
[09:41:54] <Moonlightning> tiwake: are you sure you can't just like take a picture of someone's face and use that :P
[09:42:01] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: you either do like HoneyDrops probably does and type a 30 digit alphanumeric password in every time you want to check something
[09:42:01] <tiwake> pretty sure
[09:42:11] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: or use a shitty lockscreen pin/swipe thing like everyone else ;p
[09:42:20] <Phase> eye scans would be more expensive to forge, but i'm sure it could be done
[09:42:32] <tiwake> an eye scan notices where blood vessels in your eye are, and maps that
[09:42:45] <Phase> you'd need to scan their eye of course but it only has to happen once before it's useless
[09:42:57] <Googie> Not to mention that the biggest issue with all this is that if its stolen, it can /never/ be revoked.
[09:43:04] <Googie> *it's
[09:43:09] * Moonlightning whines loudly ;-;
[09:43:10] <JustAberrant> that's kinda the problem with any biometric, it can't be revoked
[09:43:34] <JustAberrant> so someone gas station gets popped that used bio auth for whatever and bam, you're compromised forever
[09:43:46] <tiwake> well, like any given system, it can be broken
[09:43:57] <tiwake> it would be a lot more difficult to break an eye scan
[09:44:10] <Phase> someone lifts prints off the fuel thing at a gas station and you're compromised forever
[09:44:15] <Googie> If you /need/ secure authentication that's always with you at the moment, probably your best bet is to just implant a 2FA token :V
[09:44:28] <Phase> you use someone elses glass and they lift the fingerprint, compromised forever
[09:44:40] <Googie> At least then it can be replaced.
[09:44:42] <Moonlightning> Googie: …that actually sounds kind of like a good idea.
[09:45:00] <Moonlightning> flesh that out some?
[09:45:12] <JustAberrant> then all the various scanner in a briefcase attacks come out ;p
[09:45:16] <Googie> There's already people with USB flash drives implanted in their fingers.
[09:45:26] * Phase isn't sure the problem is bad enough to require mass implanting of rfid chips
[09:45:28] <tiwake> Googie: eww
[09:45:38] <HoneyDrops> I actually have no lock on my phone, but it never leaves my side (and has no info on it, aside from vaguely names contacts and my call history, and one ssh key that /is/ passworded).
[09:45:42] <JustAberrant> also the problem with implants is it's hard to upgrade ;p
[09:45:50] <Phase> painful to upgrade'
[09:45:53] *** Quits: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21) (Quit: quit)
[09:46:06] <Phase> and given the state of the us health system
[09:46:08] <Googie> Easier than switching your fingerprints or retina scans though :P
[09:46:56] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: the "no info" part of it is the security vs convenience failing
[09:47:04] <Phase> so for now we're stuck with human memory as a secure element
[09:47:04] <Googie> It's the only solution IMO for "biometric" authentication though.
[09:47:08] <Moonlightning> Googie: when you say /2FA token/…
[09:47:14] <JustAberrant> having access to email / bunch of other important stuff all the time is kinda the point for most people
[09:47:32] <Googie> Doesn't have to be a 2FA token as such, what I mean is basically just anything that can do private/public key crypto for authentication purposes.
[09:47:33] <JustAberrant> most people will choose that even knowing the security implications
[09:47:34] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: that is what ssh is for
[09:47:45] <Phase> 2FA tokens work but need to be combined with a secret to prevent compromise via theft theft
[09:47:49] <JustAberrant> ssh doesn't do push notifications ;p
[09:47:51] <Phase> >theft theft
[09:48:09] <Googie> Yeah, which doesn't work if they are physically a part of your body.
[09:48:33] <Googie> Anyone in that position could rubber hose any password authentication out of you anyway :V
[09:48:46] <Phase> someone brushes an rfid reader by your hand...
[09:48:47] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: I don't want push notifications.  If someone needs me /now/ they can call me, else they wait until I have time to check and respond.
[09:49:06] <Moonlightning> Phase: that's not how those things work
[09:49:18] <HoneyDrops> And if you call and I am busy, or don't feel like talking, well that is what "mute ring" is for.
[09:49:19] <Moonlightning> They have to be challenge-response, not static-secret (i.e. password)
[09:49:24] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: sure, but most people want push notifications
[09:49:33] <Phase> i'm sure the only reason we haven't heard of people stealing via the contactless credit card thing is credit fraud is so bad anyway
[09:50:00] <Moonlightning> Someone brushes an RFID reader against your hand…they get a signed one-time secret. Yay?
[09:50:04] <Googie> Moonlightning: Well, hypothetically they can basically just relay the challenge from whatever they are authenticating to, and brush against you at just the right time...
[09:50:04] <Moonlightning> er
[09:50:07] <Moonlightning> a signed nonce *
[09:50:12] <Phase> Moonlightning, they can authenticate against at least one service
[09:50:20] <Moonlightning> Googie: needs more crypto
[09:50:49] <Moonlightning> use TLS between client and server :P
[09:50:55] <Phase> it's more than possible for someone to take your phone and brush it past wherever the implant is
[09:51:21] <Phase> unless you want it in your hand with a connectivity check or something
[09:51:33] * Phase isn't confident that would work

[09:53:55] <Googie> Moonlightning, yes and no.
[09:53:59] <Phase> if people feel there's profit in pickpocketing and unlocking phones they'll do it
[09:54:02] <Googie> How does TLS apply to signing into your phone for example ?
[09:54:20] <Moonlightning> Your phone is a TLS server; your implant is a client…
[09:54:28] <tiwake> alright, I'm going to bed
[09:54:30] <Googie> With a relay attack, the attacker doesn't even need to decrypt the encrypted communications
[09:54:45] <Moonlightning> But they're useless to the attacker.
[09:54:49] <Googie> Your RFID device and phone communicate securely, and you're just extending the range
[09:54:54] <Googie> Yeah, but think of the end result ?
[09:55:04] <Googie> What happens after you've authenticated to your phone without knowing ?
[09:55:16] <Phase> careful assuming how useful something is to an attacker
[09:55:19] <Googie> The phone unlocks itself.
[09:55:27] <Moonlightning> …oh, grrr.
[09:55:39] <Phase> timing information for example used to be considered useless to attackers
[09:55:53] <Moonlightning> …okay! So it just has to always be voluntary.
[09:55:57] <Googie> The attacker doesn't need to actually know was communicated to cause it to unlock, just the end result.
[09:56:11] <Googie> Yeah, though that starts to get harder with implanted RFID :P
[09:58:00] <Googie> Though you could always have a physical socket, (such as with the implanted USB flash drives) as opposed to RFID.
[09:58:12] <Moonlightning> there goes your convenience though
[09:58:23] <Phase> exactly
[09:58:28] <Moonlightning> and then it's more intrusive
[09:58:30] <Phase> so really it depends on what you're defending against
[09:58:44] <Googie> It's not too bad, sticking your finger in a socket to authenticate seems pretty easy still.
[09:59:07] <Phase> if you assume your attackers can't use your fingerprint, apples thumprint home button is brilliant
[09:59:29] <Moonlightning> Phase: if you're gonna do that, security becomes trivial.
[09:59:40] <Phase> that it does
[09:59:42] <Moonlightning> Just assume attackers can't use your passwords.
[09:59:55] <Googie> It's not really /that/ much more annoying than finger print auth.
[09:59:57] <Phase> that's kinda what a password is, has to be secret
[10:00:52] <Moonlightning> I wouldn't want liek a visible socket in my finger though

[10:01:16] <JustAberrant> what about some kind of light thing through the skin ;p
[10:01:30] <JustAberrant> that would be kinda nifty ;p

[10:01:48] <Moonlightning> Googie?
[10:02:03] <Googie> Could communicate via slight changes in voltage through your skin.
[10:02:05] <JustAberrant> and only activated when you are pressing on the "reader"
[10:02:19] <Moonlightning> Ooh, I like that ^2
[10:02:38] <Moonlightning> Are we sure those couldn't be detected without actual contact, though?
[10:02:52] <Moonlightning> Like, what if you had a very very very very sensitive magnetic field detector thingy
[10:02:54] <Phase> JustAberrant, watch the video i linked
[10:03:08] <JustAberrant> maybe tommorow, I've got to bed ;p
[10:03:14] <Googie> It'd have to be very very sensitive I imagine.
[10:03:30] <Googie> Sensitive enough that TBH, I suspect you'd have issues with basically any solution :P
[10:03:53] <Moonlightning> Hmm?
[10:04:13] <Googie> Though I don't know enough about electrical engineering to really state for sure about that side of things, I'm only guesstimating.
[10:04:33] <Moonlightning> Okay.
[10:04:56] <Moonlightning> So do we post this to InfoSec.SE or Biology.SE?
[10:07:38] * Googie ideally searched for "Capacitive low bandwidth communication": http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~gruteser/papers/sigring.pdf

[10:15:09] <Googie> In any case, I still think Android is way more customizable than iOS, to a degree that makes sense :P
[10:16:45] * Googie is using an open source IRC client deployed using a FOSS package manager. On iOS, FOSS basically can't exist, at least not in the general sense. Is it really FOSS if you can't compile the software yourself ?
[10:16:51] * Moonlightning just builds bedrock jails around all the attackers!
[10:17:15] <Moonlightning> Well, is it really their fault if the platform doesn't support that?
[10:17:55] <Moonlightning> We need, like, ways to prove that a given binary is a faithful compilation of given source code
[10:18:03] <Googie> No, but that's kinda my point.
[10:18:14] <Moonlightning> …I guess nobody does that, in favor of just compiling it themselves
[10:18:41] <Googie> On iOS you /have/ to use the app store, which costs $100 a year, just to be able to deploy iOS apps
[10:18:53] <Googie> Android you can just build and install your own APKs
[10:19:13] <Googie> (Also, you can do that, it just takes a bit of work to get reproducible builds. Debian does it)
[10:19:37] <Phase> i thought they were still working on reproducible builds
[10:19:51] <Moonlightning> Right, but I'm saying, you shouldn't /need/ reproducible builds
[10:19:59] <Moonlightning> just, like, document the build process or something
[10:20:03] <Moonlightning> somehow
[10:20:24] <Googie> I think it works on Debian, kinda, but you can't apply it to the whole distro
[10:20:55] <Googie> https://reproducible.debian.net/reproducible.html
[10:20:57] <PinkiePieBot> [ Overview of various statistics about reproducible builds ]
[10:22:28] <Googie> Moonlightning: But you can't do that on iOS, because you can't compile your own code to run on it without going through the whole app store process
[10:22:48] <Googie> It's why FOSS and power user tools in general are way better on Android
[10:23:05] <Moonlightning> yeah, you couldn't even pull the downloaded app to check it against anything, because hard abstractions

[23:09:26] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: that doesn't work in a world where most people don't share your opinions ;p
[23:09:40] <Crimson_Tail> And then a riot happens
[23:09:55] <HoneyDrops> A bill must have some central there, and all portions should be directly, or at least very closely related.
[23:10:00] <Moonlightning> ^
[23:10:01] <HoneyDrops> s/there/theme/
[23:10:05] <Moonlightning> in short: no riders allowed
[23:10:12] <HoneyDrops> Basically
[23:10:20] <JustAberrant> well that at least I agree with
[23:10:43] <HoneyDrops> Yes, it makes passing some things harder, as you can't tie enough carrots onto it.
[23:11:03] <Crimson_Tail> Most of the time
[23:11:14] <Crimson_Tail> They don't allow public opinion into that
[23:11:20] <Crimson_Tail> They just try to pass it in
[23:11:34] <Moonlightning> > They don't allow public opinion
[23:11:37] <Moonlightning> what do we pay them for
[23:11:55] <Crimson_Tail> Bullshit things
[23:11:56] <Quindo> we don't
[23:12:17] <Quindo> That is the heart of the problem, we do not pay our pols.
[23:13:34] <Crimson_Tail> Also it wasn't entirely the government that tried to take down net neutrality
[23:14:02] <Crimson_Tail> The monopolitic cable companies we don't like were behind that
[23:14:41] <Quindo> We would need to make it illegal for polititions to become lobbysts if we want the pols to do their job.

[23:14:57] <HoneyDrops> Pay shouldn't enter into their decisions, as money doesn't make right any more than might does.
[23:16:15] <HoneyDrops> You need to collect data, creat and test predictive models and properly study policies using a fact and science based framework.
[23:16:35] <Crimson_Tail> Oh yeah
[23:16:47] <Crimson_Tail> Two feminazis /tried/ to mess with the entire internet
[23:17:45] <Crimson_Tail> Isn't there anything more important than the internet in general? Like how women are treated in the middle east? Come on.
[23:19:23] <Moonlightning> The Internet is very, //very// important, Crimson_Tail.
[23:19:43] <Crimson_Tail> Yeah, but one does not simply mess with it
[23:19:43] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> xP we're finally getting a comp and access to the cameras out here in the guard shack at work
[23:19:47] <Moonlightning> Currently, it provides for essentially arbitrary free communication.
[23:19:54] <Moonlightning> That must not be taken away.

[23:20:06] <Crimson_Tail> When I meant when they tried to mess with the internet
[23:20:16] <Crimson_Tail> Censorship
[23:20:21] <Crimson_Tail> Fuck that.
[23:20:28] <Moonlightning> Indeed.
[23:20:34] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: the problem there is the majority doesn't share your views, such an approach would probably produce an answer you don't want ;p
[23:20:34] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: are you involved with represent.us.?
[23:20:39] <Crimson_Tail> You're too squeamish about some things on the internet
[23:20:51] <Crimson_Tail> Ignore it
[23:21:02] <Sour_Sweet> The internet is way too powerful to remain in our hands. They'll eventually find a way to screw with it
[23:21:11] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: the majority probably do prefer safety over privacy, inspiring quotes aside
[23:21:52] <Crimson_Tail> Also when I meant on what's more important than trying to mess with the internet.
[23:21:53] <HoneyDrops> And they are wrong, and will end up paying for it down the line.

[23:21:58] <Sour_Sweet> Terrorists use encryption: Ban encrpytion! You have nothing to hide, do you?
[23:21:59] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: such a study would probably conclude that clipper-chip v2 does make sense it it can be implemented to reasonably mitigate widescale exploitation
[23:22:09] <Crimson_Tail> Big deal
[23:22:14] <Crimson_Tail> We use encryption
[23:22:20] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: …we'll ALL end up paying for it…
[23:22:45] <JustAberrant> that's the problem with the "they'll see in the end damnit!" argument
[23:22:47] <Crimson_Tail> If there's no encryption, then what's the point of online payments?
[23:23:09] <Sour_Sweet> As long as they don't mess with peoples facebook accounts they'll get it through eventually
[23:23:20] <JustAberrant> Sour_Sweet: pretty much that
[23:23:24] <Sour_Sweet> The average human doesn't care
[23:23:29] * Quindo things it would be funny if facebook just vanished one day...
[23:23:41] <mniip> quite
[23:23:42] <HoneyDrops> I'm not worried, honestly I see only two eventual outcomes... either we get out act together and start making the right choices or or species will create it's own end.  I really don't care either way what happens, it will fix itself.
[23:23:51] <JustAberrant> it's not even an unreasonable viewpoint, which is kind of the problem that I think Moonlightning, HoneyDrops, and similar can't and will never see ;p
[23:24:09] <Sour_Sweet> And as much as I hate how much power companies like Google and Facebook have: As it is now they sometimes really protect us
[23:24:10] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: justify plox
[23:24:26] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: “protect us” as in…?
[23:24:47] <Sour_Sweet> Google spents a lot of money to ensure the internet remains mostly as it is
[23:25:00] <Sour_Sweet> Because it is in their interest
[23:25:03] <Moonlightning> Mmm.
[23:25:08] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: your viewpoints are all based on the idea that privacy is inherently some really important thing
[23:25:17] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: and that people who don't think so are "wrong"
[23:25:36] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: it may not be, //inherently//
[23:25:45] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: But in today's global society, it is critical.
[23:25:50] <Quindo> I saw an insteresting post... Democrocy works because of the ability to break the law.
[23:25:53] <Moonlightning> See: all the backwards countries that murder people for being gay.
[23:25:57] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: in your opinion
[23:26:05] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: I have justification.
[23:26:07] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: which was my point ;p
[23:26:15] <Crimson_Tail> I wonder how much Google spent..
[23:26:32] <Crimson_Tail> Possibly millions, it is quite a big company
[23:26:42] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: If you can't openly be gay (on pain of torture and eventual death), and you can't hide it (for lack of privacy), what's left?
[23:26:49] <Sour_Sweet> The average user doesn't realize that toogether with privacy democrazy falls.
[23:27:09] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: that only impacts the minority 
[23:27:15] <HoneyDrops> without*
[23:27:16] <Crimson_Tail> So what about privacy in general?
[23:27:19] <Sour_Sweet> together*
[23:27:31] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: if you legitimately don't have anything to hide, which most people don't, privacy is not important
[23:27:36] <Crimson_Tail> The gov't needs to stop trying to peep on us
[23:27:39] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: at least not to the individual
[23:27:52] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: but basically all of us legitimately have things to hide.
[23:28:05] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: from our friends, bosses, etc
[23:28:15] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: not usually from the government or law enforcement
[23:28:19] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: from society at large.
[23:28:28] <Moonlightning> Which includes nationstates. :V
[23:28:32] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: I disagree, you might, I might, but many people don't
[23:29:03] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: /lots/ of people are into weird shit.
[23:29:37] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: sure, but if it's not illegal people tend to be less concerned with the government knowing about it
[23:29:47] <Sour_Sweet> Just to give you an idea: http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/4/4394234/google-eight-biggest-record-lobbying-washington
[23:29:47] <PinkiePieBot> [ Google's lobbying budget is eighth largest in US, surpassing even Lockheed Martin | The Verge ]
[23:29:51] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: in many places, being gay IS illegal…
[23:29:55] <Sour_Sweet> That article is ooooold though
[23:30:06] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: sure, but if you don't live in one of those places..
[23:30:11] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: which also proves that we can't trust governments to be reasonable
[23:30:17] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: thus, we must be able to hide things from them
[23:30:19] <johnsey> sometimes, the realization that you had something to hide comes when it bites you in the ass much later
[23:30:21] <Moonlightning> thus, privacy
[23:30:23] <HoneyDrops> The problem is what is legal now, might not be later. 
[23:30:29] <Moonlightning> ^
[23:30:32] <Crimson_Tail> Due to the fact that some religious people are butthurt over a supreme court ruling that gay marriage is legalized entirely in the US is laughable.
[23:30:43] <JustAberrant> sure, but most people worry about now not later
[23:30:48] *** Joins: Gladiolus (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there)
[23:31:04] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant and they are the doom of us all.
[23:31:20] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: besides, we should not HAVE to trust governments.
[23:31:25] <JustAberrant> my point is, trying to argue from the standpoint that privacy is assumed really important to people who don't view it that way, then saying "you'll see in the end", is a poor approach
[23:31:27] <HoneyDrops> You have to worry about later, later is what really matters.
[23:31:43] <HoneyDrops> now means jack shit 99.999% of the time
[23:32:37] <mniip> Crimson_Tail, being gay is legal =/= gay marriage is legal
[23:32:43] <mniip> there's a big leap inbetween
[23:32:56] <Crimson_Tail> >being gay being illegal
[23:33:19] <Crimson_Tail> What the hell is their problem?
[23:33:31] <Gladiolus> hate of difference
[23:33:32] <Quindo> Then compare it to pot instead
[23:33:44] <HoneyDrops> I'm not worried about tomorrow, I'm worried about 10, 100, 1000 years from now.
[23:33:51] <mniip> I don't know a country where pot marriage is legal
[23:34:06] <Quindo> If no one was using pot, safe to assume that it would never had been legalized.
[23:34:17] <HoneyDrops> tomorrow is going to be mostly the same level of suck as today, with some random variance/noise.
[23:34:26] <Crimson_Tail> If it's just the hatred for the sexuality, that's just bullshit.
[23:34:51] <JustAberrant> meh, most people are just looking to get through the day/week/year/etc
[23:35:06] <Kinsley> JustAberrant: some people don't get that opportunity.
[23:35:26] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: yesp and I could go on as to how economics has trapped people into that, but that is another topic.
[23:35:40] <JustAberrant> either way, I'm not arguing that privacy isn't important, just that it's not unreasonable for others to not view it as the top priority in their lives
[23:35:41] <Kinsley> It's important to protect everyone's rights all the time, or else it becomes easier and easier to say, "Oh, but we allowed it that one time, once more isn't going to hurt."
[23:35:57] <HoneyDrops> No human, anywhere, for any reason should worry about getting thugh the day, or even year.
[23:36:19] <JustAberrant> well yes, and no one should ever die, etc..
[23:36:48] <mniip> disagree
[23:37:01] <HoneyDrops> No one should be in an existential struggle over food or shelter or access to medical care.
[23:37:05] <mniip> death is an essential component of development of the humanity as a whole
[23:37:05] <Gladiolus> yis
[23:37:09] * Gladiolus hugs HoneyDrops 
[23:37:14] <Crimson_Tail> People die
[23:37:21] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: I'm not even talking about the poor, I'm talking about the middle class
[23:37:23] <Crimson_Tail> There are many causes
[23:37:28] <Crimson_Tail> Not like anyone is immortal
[23:37:41] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: you mean poor-lite ;)
[23:37:50] <JustAberrant> not even that
[23:38:09] <JustAberrant> I'm reasonable well off financially, job, house, car, etc.. but I still have more than enough stuff to worry about
[23:38:21] <HoneyDrops> Death will exist, but the fact is a lot of it could be deferred.
[23:38:22] <Moonlightning> mniip: you're kidding, right?
[23:38:41] <mniip> no?

[23:39:03] <HoneyDrops> But I think it will be mostly moot once we just ditch the frail meatbags.
[23:39:09] <mniip> it is biologically required
[23:39:30] <Gladiolus> Death is an important part of a temporal beings existance, we would be pretty lost without it.
[23:39:37] <Crimson_Tail> One person dies every couple seconds around the world
[23:39:41] <Gladiolus> We start, we end.
[23:39:52] <mniip> everything that has a beginning, has an end
[23:39:54] <Gladiolus> I just wish all had access to a death on their own terms.
[23:40:08] <Gladiolus> Be that in an exciting ring of fire, or surrounded by loved ones quietly.
[23:40:35] <Gladiolus> Canada's supreme court ruled that terminal patients assisted suicide is a human right, it was a good judgement.
[23:40:36] <HoneyDrops> No certainty of death would change things, but to consider it essential puts the current human expeirence on a pedestal.
[23:41:25] <HoneyDrops> Humans are, at best, just another stepping stone to something better.  The alternatuve is to be a dead end.
[23:41:54] <Moonlightning> we ain't good yet
[23:41:56] <Moonlightning> not in this state
[23:42:53] <Gladiolus> We still rely a lot on generational shifts to progress us, without death we would stagnate pretty hard. 
[23:42:56] * Gladiolus stares at the boomers
[23:45:50] <HoneyDrops> mniip: heat death of the universe will eventually come, so yes, things will end, but it's just a question of how soon.
[23:46:16] <mniip> not neccessarily
[23:47:20] <mniip> we might exploit closed timelike curves to send entropy into the past
[23:47:35] <HoneyDrops> I think it would be fun to watch the last stars nova, and the lingering white dwarfs cool slowly to the ambient temp.  There is a peacefulness in that.
