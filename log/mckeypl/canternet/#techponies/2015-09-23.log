[00:20:49] <Starthunder> [14:56:31] < HoneyDrops> If you still had the drive, I would have happily mailed you a flash drive.  I have a bin of about a dozen 512MB-1G ones I got for free.  They are branded with some bank/legal firm logos, and have awful I/O speeds, but make nice give-aways for utility/emergency boot disks.
[00:20:54] <Starthunder> > awful speeds
[00:20:57] <Starthunder> > good for boot disks
[00:20:59] <Starthunder> wat
[00:21:26] <Compu> the car drive (o3o) has decent speeds
[00:21:46] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: For when you need something to boot off of for a rescue env, not for normal use.
[00:22:12] <Starthunder> HoneyDrops: that still doesn't sound like it would make for a very good experience
[00:22:17] <Starthunder> I mean, in a pinch, it'd do, sure
[00:22:18] <HoneyDrops> Or for things like debian net install, who cares about the extra 15 seconds?
[00:22:31] <Starthunder> For netinstallers, sure
[00:23:02] <HoneyDrops> They are 1G drives, net install, or a small live env is all that will fit.

[04:09:36] <Starthunder> If DNS is only for websites…then why do you send mail to names instead of IPs?

[04:11:00] <nscoots> you know that part after the @.... the whole domain name part...
[04:12:36] <Phase> Starthunder, clearly there's some kind of Mail Name Server for mail names
[04:14:39] <Starthunder> Phase: …that's actually not too bad an assumption
[04:15:21] <Phase> it's what i imagined they'd think, considering how many widely used systems are monolithic cathedrals

[10:18:47] <init3> I mean though, making an open electronics system I can totally see. I'd love that for my car. But having the entire platfrom open source seems super unfeasable if you want it customizable. 
[10:19:12] <tiwake> why?
[10:19:29] <init3> Because of how manufacturing works. 
[10:20:18] <init3> THough if you can do 3d printing for like steel and other parts I guess the paradigm can change. 
[10:20:34] <Starthunder> Isn't the idea in modular X to mass-produce various different parts, which can then be assembled by the user into a working X?
[10:20:45] <init3> Maker bots can't print steel beams though. 
[10:21:02] <tiwake> init3: I'm confused about what you are talking about
[10:21:11] <Starthunder> init3: I understood that reference
[10:21:14] <init3> I was making a stupid joke.
[10:21:24] <init3> o3o
[10:21:42] <tiwake> <init3> Because of how manufacturing works.
[10:21:48] <tiwake> not comprehending
[10:21:58] <init3> Well I mean mass production wise. 
[10:22:03] *** Joins: locodash11[server] (locodash11@Taco.eating.Anthro.Batpony)
[10:22:29] <init3> If it is modular like Starthunder says sure, it means more feasable.
[10:22:54] <init3> However you would be suprised the tolerances there are when you are talking today's cars. 
[10:23:04] <tiwake> oh, customizable does not work if its mass produced
[10:23:09] <tiwake> unless its modular
[10:23:23] <tiwake> gotcha
[10:23:40] <ShivalWolf> anyone know any android apps that have rediciously stupid permision requests
[10:23:55] <johnsey> almost all of them?
[10:23:57] <tiwake> neh, I just want my own core system thats customizable
[10:24:16] <init3> I mostly just want to customize the software. 
[10:24:48] <tiwake> hmm
[10:25:06] <tiwake> are aluminum dashes manufactured?
[10:25:14] <init3> I'me perfectly content with buying a car from a big manufacturer so long as I can make it shift when I want, use as much gas as I want and so on. 
[10:25:38] <tiwake> init3: right
[10:25:43] <tiwake> but that does not exist
[10:25:54] <tiwake> partly because the government says so
[10:26:00] <init3> But it isn't hard to swap out the ECU with a custom one. 
[10:26:11] <Starthunder> ShivalWolf: depends on what you consider stupid. I have several that have permissions that I would not have granted.
[10:26:14] <init3> BUt of course, those are just reversed engineered. 
[10:26:31] <Starthunder> ShivalWolf: in particular, many of my games have permission to see call status and Wi-Fi network status
[10:26:33] <init3> But still.
[10:27:00] <init3> My car the ECU is actually contained on a little thing that looks like an NES cartridge. 
[10:27:13] <init3> Could swap in another in about 30 seconds. 
[10:27:20] <tiwake> I keep forgetting about automatic transmissions... I've never owned one, and forget that most people have such a monstrosity
[10:27:49] <init3> (after paying out th ass for the chip, precisely because it is reverse engineered)
[10:28:21] <init3> I like manual transmissions but it is rare to find a car with one here. 
[10:28:36] <tiwake> yeah
[10:28:40] <init3> If you want a new car with one you have to special order it. 
[10:29:19] <init3> And some cars with autos deal with the drawbacks rather nicley. 
[10:29:22] <tiwake> they have gotten better in recent years, but still its that many more complicated things to break
[10:29:27] <Starthunder> ShivalWolf: Agar.io has permission to retrieve running apps, network-based location, and all Wi-Fi and other connection information; and has full network access
[10:30:06] <init3> Yeah, they are more complex but can save you a hell of a lot of gas now that there are 6 speed autos pretty much standard. 
[10:30:38] <init3> I am a big fan of what BMW did with my car's trans. THere is a little button under the gas pedal. 
[10:30:44] <tiwake> I dont think it really does any different
[10:30:54] <tiwake> for gas millage
[10:31:05] <Starthunder> ShivalWolf: Crossy Road similarly has permission to make arbitrary network connections and read from and write to /sdcard; as well as permission to retrieve network and Wi-Fi connection information, device ID, call information
[10:31:14] <init3> When you push the pedal to the floor and therefore push the button it moves the shift points to the red line. 
[10:31:30] <Starthunder> I consider all of this ridiculous. None of it is necessary.
[10:31:34] <tiwake> oh lol
[10:31:37] <init3> tiwake: I mean vs a 3 speed auto.
[10:32:37] <tiwake> init3: by customizable I mean, what if I want to wirelessly control the throttle?
[10:33:00] <init3> Also over a long ourney a well-tuned 6 speed auto is going to shift more consistently and probably use less fuel (if it is programmed to do so) than an operator of a manual could. 
[10:33:15] <tiwake> oh yeah
[10:33:41] <tiwake> well for transmissions there is the continuously variable transmission...
[10:33:51] <init3> Shit, I could do that with parts from a model airplane 
[10:33:59] <init3> :p
[10:34:05] <init3> but I get your point. 
[10:34:30] * init3 kinda wants to hook up an airplane servo to a throttle cable though
[10:35:16] <tiwake> if using linux for a controller, could just read in the remote values and apply it to the car throttle
[10:35:41] <tiwake> a servo is kinda clunky
[10:36:18] <tiwake> a servo of some sort would be necessary for steering
[10:36:33] <tiwake> literal back seat driving
[10:36:40] <init3> Haha yes
[10:36:58] <init3> I was just being a smartass re: the throttle servo. 
[10:37:42] <init3> but I do think mythbusters made RC cars with the guts of model airplanes though.

[20:41:34] <Starthunder> I meant about the lockscreens, not the %00 bug
[20:41:47] <Lapsus> oh :v
[20:50:34] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: well a properly secure locking screen must be able to reliably capture all input, and take control of the display.  To do it, you'd need to hook into the kernel and preempt input going to the /dev/input/* or have some mechanism to ensure no other process could access them while the locking process is running (which is one reason why X screen lockers are insecure).
[20:52:57] * Colgate has always assumed screen locks are just for keeping the honest out
[20:53:15] <Starthunder> HoneyDrops: That sounds like a model where the user is still basically authenticated, and the lockscreen is really just an overlay, rather than the lockscreen actually replacing the user's session with nothing “behind” it.
[20:53:28] * Starthunder has always trusted screen locks…
[20:55:13] <HoneyDrops> In that case it must reliably seize control of the display server, or the display hardware itself, ensuring nothing else show anything.  A "lock" must be built into either the graphics stack, or into the display server.
[21:03:41] <Starthunder> HoneyDrops: in the same way that any display manager “must reliably seize control”?
[21:04:44] <HoneyDrops> Yes, which X doesn't do, so any X11-based screen locker is mostly just to slow someone down, or as Colgate said, keep the honest, honest.

[21:06:42] <HoneyDrops> I have no reason to believe that whatever Android or iOS uses is any more secure.  Also if they have debug ports/pads/pins, I doubt the tty's are locked down too.

[21:07:34] <HoneyDrops> Though popping open the phone and connecting to an internal UART, while keeping the phone running is non-trivial.
[21:08:20] <HoneyDrops> You didn't know X screen lockers were mostly for show?
[21:08:22] <Starthunder> Why doesn't it just work like detaching from tmux and logging out of a tty does?
[21:08:33] <Starthunder> You're talking about more than just X, though

[21:09:45] <Starthunder> There //should// be only a cosmetic difference
[21:09:54] <Starthunder> in both cases, the active user should be deauthenticated
[21:10:01] <HoneyDrops> Well yes, a proper lock, would save the session state, and cut it off from i/o, then create a locking session that only handles authentication.

[21:11:15] <HoneyDrops> The display manager then must have a way to suspend itself from taking input and displaying, As you said, a "detach" mode.  X doesn't have this, not do I know nay display manager that does.

[21:12:23] <Colgate> does wayland?
[21:12:49] <HoneyDrops> You would need a display manager to have a detach function built into it, and toolkits/applications would also probably need to be aware too.

[21:16:31] <HoneyDrops> Also no idea how well graphics hardware enforces permissions and protections on mem segments.  Otherwise the display manager needs to clean itself off the GPU or whatever it hands things over to could just read whatever is left.
[21:17:35] <Starthunder> That seems more like a kernel than a hardware issue.
[21:18:03] <Starthunder> The kernel needs to wipe GPU memory before allocating it to a new process, like it does with general RAM.
[21:18:51] <HoneyDrops> Likely both, however what will some application do that using an OpenGL context do?  it would have to clean up, and know hwo to restore itself.
[21:19:57] <Starthunder> …wait a sec. Back up one step. That whole /thing/ is a kernel issue.

[21:37:49] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder ^
[21:38:22] <Starthunder> What? The kernel should have 100% control over hardware.
[21:39:36] <HoneyDrops> Microcode, GPU firmware, etc, and the kernel normally uses the MMU
[21:41:39] <Starthunder> What, a physical MMU?
[21:43:30] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, though modern systems use a IMC (in the processor), rather than a MCU in the northbridge.
[21:43:57] <Starthunder> I thought memory address mapping was the kernel's job. :|
[21:46:28] <HoneyDrops> Both work together.
[21:47:27] <HoneyDrops> µCLinux was a fork that emulated the MMU for microcontrollers that didn't have one.
[21:47:45] <Starthunder> But in no case should hardware besides the CPU be given access to memory without the kernel's approval.

[22:57:28] <RazorSharpFang> Suppose I have a class Baby: {int age, String name}. How much space will the following code allocate: 
[22:57:53] <RazorSharpFang> Baby b[] = new Baby[10];
[22:58:29] <RazorSharpFang> I've seen answers varying from 10 times the space of the Baby class, plus the space for 10 pointers, to just the space of 10 pointers.
[23:01:09] <Stik> depends a little on the language
[23:01:18] <Stik> but mostly it'll be 10x pointer + array overhead
[23:01:28] <Stik> which is usually pointer+length (int)
[23:02:03] <Stik> although depending on language the array might not have its own pointer
[23:02:31] <Stik> then there's reference counting, if it supports that
[23:02:44] <Stik> vtables, if it's an oldish language, etc
[23:05:55] <RazorSharpFang> So, that implies that the constructor doesn't get called in that.
[23:06:18] *** zz_CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob
[23:08:45] <Stik> yeah, you're allocating an array of 10 references (pointers)
[23:08:51] <Stik> not creating any instances of Baby
[23:09:25] <Stik> so b[0] == null, b[1] == null, b[2] == null, etc
[23:09:45] <Stik> you'd have to have a loop after that declaration to create 10 Babies and assign them to the elements of that array
[23:10:25] <Stik> i am assuming here that you're talking about something like java, and not a language i don't know about that constructs 10 instance of Baby given that syntax :)
[23:10:42] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, java/C++, basically the same.

[23:11:07] <Stik> yeah lets not have that argument right now :P

[23:12:44] * Lapsus ducks
[23:13:28] <Seoson> Is Cadence thrown again? :D
[23:13:32] <Stik> heh
[23:13:34] <Shutter> Stik: A C++-programmer would probably allocate std::vector<Baby> babyStorage(10); :P
[23:13:38] *** Lapsus sets mode: -qo Lapsus Lapsus
[23:14:04] <Shutter> Or if fixed array, std::array
[23:15:07] <RazorSharpFang> What's with the :: ?
[23:15:43] <Shutter> Specifying namespace
[23:16:20] <Stik> yeah
[23:16:34] <RazorSharpFang> I don't actually know what's a namespace.
[23:16:40] <Stik> if Baby was a struct, am i right in thinking that new Baby[10] would be 10* sizeof(Baby)?
[23:16:43] <Seoson> I love how windows needs to auto install and mount each and every device. I just want to load it. The content is non of your business
[23:17:15] <Stik> tbh i can barely remember how C works and i've never been particularly good at c++ :)
[23:18:06] <Shutter> Stik: Java doesn't have structs, in C++ structs and classes are the same but with struct's default visibility being public
[23:18:23] * Shutter goes back to playing games with Lapsus before Lapsus gets too annoyed ^^
[23:19:02] <Stik> yeah i mean in c++
[23:19:09] <Stik> thought it was something like that

[23:28:10] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: so you're trying to raise this Baby?
[23:29:14] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: oh, yeah. For C++, you should probably use std::vector or at least std::array, I guess.
[23:29:20] * Starthunder hasn't touched C++ in ages.
[23:29:41] <RazorSharpFang> I haven't learned C++ yet.
[23:29:54] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: C++ has this thing called namespaces. When header files declare things, they don't declare them in a global namespace (like C); instead, they use `namespace` blocks
[23:30:10] <Starthunder> So in a header file somewhere, you have `namespace std { /* definition of array goes here */ }`
[23:30:31] <Starthunder> That way, you can make your own `array`, and other libraries can make their own `array`s, without clashing with std::array
[23:30:54] <Starthunder> In C, the convention is to prefix every name with something to avoid clashes
[23:31:03] <Starthunder> So if I made my own array, it'd be called blackl_array or something
[23:31:19] <Starthunder> openssl stuff all starts with `openssl_` etc etc
[23:32:30] <RazorSharpFang> Ah, I see.
[23:32:57] <Starthunder> namespaces are definitely the way to go.
[23:39:59] <Shutter> Stik: Yes, you're right. But please don't do that :P - To store babies a container would be better than raw-allocated storage. Even if you wrapped it in an owning pointer you'd be prone to errors as you now can't access info about size to places you pass it, and you'd lose out on container-snacks like iterators and ranged for.

[23:40:14] <RazorSharpFang> That's kinda like java.util.*, where you can create your own scanner class, and use it's qualified name to tell it from the default scanenr.
[23:40:52] <Starthunder> Python has namespaces through its modules.
[23:41:00] <Starthunder> Java similarly has namespaces through its packages.
