[03:07:29] <Gladiolus> I don't get why Dell and HP and whoever the fuck don't do this.
[03:08:25] <Moonlightning> Unrelated question: given a file and a bunch of environment variables, and maybe a function or two, how do I do all the shell substitutions and write out the result to a new file?
[03:08:31] <Webster> Gladiolus: They'd have to pay for bandwidth.
[03:08:35] <JustAberrant> what's the advantage of that?
[03:08:38] <Webster> And pay to support the feature.
[03:08:46] <JustAberrant> @ install from firmware
[03:08:50] <Gladiolus> They still host drivers and stuff, and this wouldn't be used often.
[03:09:06] <Gladiolus> Installing when the HDD is totally bonked on a computer with no disk drive is pretty great.
[03:09:27] <Moonlightning> …there you go. They don't need that, because optical disc drives. :p

[03:36:25] <Gladiolus> Yeah but why don't they try? Like, it could be selling point.

[03:39:54] <Compu> Gladiolus: only upgrades within the first year of the release get windows 10 for free, new installs and stuff r still paid
[03:40:01] <JustAberrant> don't most consumer desktops come with some kind of "recovery partition"
[03:40:03] <JustAberrant> I know dell used to
[03:40:05] <HoneyDrops|Half> Lenovo actually sort does something like that... well the firmware automatically installs stuff after you install an OS.
[03:40:16] <JustAberrant> I mean it's not grabbing it over the internet, but still
[03:40:19] <Compu> JustAberrant: not needed anymore
[03:40:44] <HoneyDrops|Half> But most of my OS installs don't even die with the hardware.
[03:41:01] <JustAberrant> either way, how many people who buy consumer desktops are going to reinstall the OS anyway
[03:41:30] <JustAberrant> few times they do, they can use a cheap usb stick ;p
[03:41:40] <Compu> i just thought of a conspiracy theory
[03:42:23] <Compu> what if all processors and stuff is twice as powerful as reported but the other half is used remotely for whatever the OEM wants to use it for o3o
[03:42:49] <Moonlightning> Answer, by the way: there's a program called envsubst. It's in Debian's gettext-base package, which happened to be already installed on my system.
[03:42:55] <Moonlightning> see also http://mywiki.wooledge.org/TemplateFiles

[03:43:07] <Colgate> Compu: uh, it would be detected super easily
[03:43:14] <Compu> Colgate: how?
[03:43:26] <JustAberrant> power usage?
[03:43:29] <Colgate> "used remotely"
[03:43:34] <JustAberrant> network traffic? :>
[03:43:35] <Colgate> that means it has to go over a netowrk
[03:44:09] <JustAberrant> yeah, enough people out their scrutinizing the network traffic from boxes that someone would probably notice that ;p
[03:44:12] <Colgate> unless EVERY oem is in on this, in which case the documents would be leaked so fast
[03:44:12] <Compu> what if it was all designed to be undetectable from the beginning, when computers started to be sold to the general populace
[03:44:22] <Gladiolus> Oh yeah, Compu- but the licence is stored on MSFT servers.
[03:44:27] <Colgate> it is impossible to undetetectable...
[03:44:29] <Gladiolus> So since I upgraded once this machine is activated.
[03:44:35] <Gladiolus> I can format or whatever it's all good.
[03:44:49] <Compu> Colgate: it is if its done outside of the OS
[03:44:54] <Gladiolus> also Compu- HP SECRET BITCOIN MINING o3o
[03:44:56] <JustAberrant> Compu: you'd have to somehow make it undetectable from a network tap outside the PC
[03:44:59] <Colgate> Compu: are you reading?
[03:45:09] <Colgate> because I don't think you can
[03:45:14] <JustAberrant> Compu: which is basically impossible ;p
[03:45:19] <Gladiolus> Honestly though as funny as a theory as that is- what would the use be?
[03:45:26] <Compu> Colgate: and the router is designed to not report these bits of data
[03:45:28] <Gladiolus> Like you have a weird worldwide botnet but now what are you gonna do with it.
[03:45:33] <Compu> like i said, from the beginning
[03:45:35] <Gladiolus> Whatever you do with it has to be secret.
[03:45:38] <Colgate> Compu: every router ever? aahhahaha good luck
[03:45:59] <Compu> Colgate: sure its not possible if it started now, but if it started at the beginning of computers?
[03:46:14] <JustAberrant> not just every router.. every NIC .. and even then..
[03:46:25] <Colgate> Compu: and that entire thing would be thwarted by a single hobbyist who decides to make their own NIC
[03:46:27] <HoneyDrops|Half> This sort of thing could never work because Turing-complete - 1 does not exist.
[03:46:27] <JustAberrant> you could still get someone hooking up a protocol analyzer to the lines
[03:46:42] <Compu> Colgate: i did say conspiracy theory
[03:46:59] <HoneyDrops|Half> Hell, a scope an physicall access to a wire is enough to foil it.
[03:47:04] <HoneyDrops|Half> physical*
[03:47:19] <JustAberrant> there's also people who reverse engineer chips
[03:47:21] <Compu> Colgate: would still have to use premade parts like chips of some sort
[03:47:22] <JustAberrant> they'd probably notice
[03:47:39] <Colgate> Compu: why? they could fab their own, it doesn't have to be fast
[03:47:50] <Compu> fab?
[03:47:54] <Colgate> fabricate
[03:48:06] <Colgate> or just use fpgas or something
[03:48:29] <Compu> i dont know if its possible to fabricate integrated circuits and microchips without some sort of factory
[03:48:31] <Colgate> I'm sure there are guides on how to make a hub from scratch out there
[03:48:35] <JustAberrant> not to mention would be some pretty damn intense logic for chips to be able to detect code designed to store/interpret ethernet traffic and somehow "hide" parts of it while allowing others
[03:48:40] <JustAberrant> like.. we're talking AI level stuff there ;p
[03:49:17] <Compu> JustAberrant: well it is a conspiracy theory, by definition we're allowed to assume anything is real
[03:49:27] <Colgate> Compu: what's a microchip besides a bunch of transistors? you can make them a lot larger
[03:49:32] <Gladiolus> Conspiracies are funny.
[03:50:06] <Colgate> I bet you could make a hub out of a bread board :P
[03:50:07] <Gladiolus> hey Colgate, why are most consumer CPU dies the same size? Is there some sort of heat disspitation thing going on? Like, why aren't i5s smaller than i7s.
[03:50:16] <JustAberrant> even if such a thing existed, you would need ridiculous amounts of processing power on your $7 PIC ;p
[03:50:17] <Compu> so lets assume AI has been figured out a long time ago
[03:51:07] <JustAberrant> also first hobbiest to decap one would be like.. "hmm, why is there star-trek style neural-circuitry in here..
[03:51:08] <Colgate> Gladiolus: probably heat related
[03:51:12] <Compu> JustAberrant: what if years and years ago they figured out some way to make an AI run on very little power
[03:51:21] <JustAberrant> see above ;p
[03:51:24] <Colgate> but I really don't know
[03:51:57] <Compu> JustAberrant: what if the circuitry already is neural and we just dont know it cuz it always looked that way o3o
[03:51:58] <JustAberrant> there's plenty of people out there into taking the caps off chips and looking at them with microscopes/x-rays etc.. they'd probably notice ;p
[03:52:16] <JustAberrant> Compu: except that people understand what it does ;p
[03:52:30] <Compu> then we shall assume mind control!!!!!

[03:53:33] <JustAberrant> vaguely related: hardware level DRM is the next step :(
[03:53:47] <Compu> i probably spelled that wrong
[03:53:49] <HoneyDrops|Half> JustAberrant: it will fail too
[03:53:59] <JustAberrant> sure, but it'll stall things for awhile
[03:54:07] <JustAberrant> software is easy to poke at
[03:54:16] <JustAberrant> currently RE'ing chips isn't
[03:54:21] <JustAberrant> and they arn't even really trying either
[03:54:29] <HoneyDrops|Half> It will require harder tools to crack, but DRM will /never/ work.  Math will win every time.
[03:54:51] <JustAberrant> they just rely on the difficulty/inaccessibility of doing it.. once they start making the chips hard to tamper with.. it'll be interesting
[03:55:25] <AppleDash> Could someone help me diagnose this? https://www.dropbox.com/s/42bmiwwzh6wzi8k/VIDEO_20150814_213347.mp4?dl=0 Setup: Dual R9 296x2s, i7 5930k, 64GB of DDR4, Windows 8.1.

[13:24:03] <RazorSharpFang> I've been recommended netbeans as an IDE. Any opinions on that IDE?
[13:24:38] <Googie> What language are you working in ?
[13:24:44] <RazorSharpFang> Java
[13:25:11] <Googie> For Java, IntelliJ IDEA is pretty good.
[13:28:28] <Phase> netbeans > eclipse, haven't used intellij
[13:29:47] <RazorSharpFang> Is there a network port 0?
[13:29:59] <Googie> No
[13:30:03] * JustAberrant prefers eclipse
[13:30:09] <Phase> kinda'
[13:30:18] <Googie> Officially no though
[13:30:22] <JustAberrant> netbeans is kinda.. I dunno.. netbeans-y :>
[13:30:23] <johnsey> http://i.imgur.com/XION2Ho.jpg
[13:30:45] <Googie> I mean... you could maybe abuse it in a security context I imagine, but per the latest RFCs, IIRC port 0 is invalid
[13:31:06] * Phase 's understanding is that 0 was technically valid
[13:31:08] <Googie> There's nothing stopping you from sending it down the wire though
[13:31:12] <RazorSharpFang> What port should I have as a default port for a program? 
[13:31:42] <Phase> but bsd sockets used it to specify ephemeral ports, so it's unusable in practice
[13:31:42] <Googie> Phase: Same, but then I got into an argument about it and got schooled :P
[13:32:01] <Googie> Yeah.
[13:32:32] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, unless you care, 0, which will pick a semi-random port
[13:33:15] <johnsey> >1024 is always a good idea
[13:33:32] <RazorSharpFang> What about 1040?
[13:35:21] <johnsey> you can also check the IANA for registered ports and use one that is not in the list yet, if you really care

[13:36:56] <Googie> There's a lot of officially registered protocol names/ports.
[13:37:11] <Googie> Honestly though, just pick something above 1024
[13:37:18] <RazorSharpFang> Am I not permitted to use any officially registered port number?
[13:37:37] <Googie> It's fine.
[13:37:37] <johnsey> no, it's a federal offense
[13:37:43] <Googie> Well, that too
[13:38:08] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, the reason you want something above 1024 is a unix thing, it's otherwise a meaningless number
[13:38:10] <Googie> The internet police will kill you. International court of internet law has a standing order for shoot on sight.

[13:39:40] <RazorSharpFang> See, I thought johnsey was serious at first.
[13:40:23] <Phase> XD
[13:41:02] <Googie> Basically just pick any port you want. Ideally something not too well known, though it doesn't really matter. If the port number is <= 1024, you'll need root to bind to it on *nix, so best to avoid that, but otherwise it's fine.
[13:41:32] <RazorSharpFang> 1040 is probably fine then.
[13:41:39] <Phase> 1040 is fine

[14:18:11] <RazorSharpFang> Hmm. My java program looks like it's a C-program that just happens to use java's names. Is that an indication that I'm using the language wrong?
[14:19:24] <Googie> It depends on what you are writing
[14:19:33] <Googie> Java's syntax takes a lot from C.
[14:21:23] <Compu> gah this optimizing takes forever
[14:22:05] <RazorSharpFang> Yes
[14:26:51] <RazorSharpFang> I don't understand. Javac is asking for an identifier for a variable already statically identified.
[14:30:17] <RazorSharpFang> Is it okay to have blocking calls in the main thread, or is that a bad idea?
[14:31:17] <Googie> It depends on what you are doing.
[14:32:27] <RazorSharpFang> I'm writing a server, but it's only supposed to handle one connection at a time.
[14:34:21] <Compu> alright so the update was to patch stagefright
[14:36:32] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: you pretty much have to have at least one blocking call in main ;p
[14:36:55] <JustAberrant> well, I guess technically you don't, you can spawn off other threads and let main exit
[14:37:10] <JustAberrant> but.. I usually like to have main stick around until the end 
[14:37:13] <RazorSharpFang> Well, I've got socket.accept() in main, which will block until a connection is made.
[14:37:41] <JustAberrant> honestly, unless you have a really good reason not to, you really should thread processing on the client sockets
[14:37:54] <RazorSharpFang> sockets? No, just one socket.
[14:38:04] <JustAberrant> i.e. every time you accept a connection, spawn off a thread for it
[14:38:27] <RazorSharpFang> There's only one socket.
[14:38:54] <JustAberrant> there should be at least two :(
[14:39:06] <JustAberrant> you have your server socket listening on port whatever
[14:39:17] <JustAberrant> then when you accept a connection, you create a socket for the remote client
[14:39:33] <JustAberrant> and _typically_ you spawn a thread off to deal with it so you can go back to accepting connections
[14:39:48] <JustAberrant> or do some new-age async bs ;p
[14:39:58] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: I only want to have one connection at a tim.

[14:40:23] <JustAberrant> so you'll have two

[18:38:29] <firestream> got my red bull my trail mix and im rddy to start to porgram a new website
[18:47:38] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not sure how to proceed.
[18:47:54] <RazorSharpFang> I've got this DataBuffer that I need to turn into byte[] so I can send it across this network.
[18:48:01] <RazorSharpFang> I have no idea how to do that.
[18:48:13] <RazorSharpFang> Google is unhelpful right now. : /
[18:48:47] <RazorSharpFang> (This is in java)
[18:51:15] <RazorSharpFang> Wow. Just... wow.
[18:51:25] <RazorSharpFang> notepad++ spazzed out and deleted the file, AND the backup.
[18:56:25] <Webster> Either do the conversion manually, or see if there's an array method built in you can (ab)use.
[18:58:21] <RazorSharpFang> Webster: :'( Notepad++ crashed and deleted my file.
[18:58:31] <firestream> allways have a backup of a backup
[18:58:47] <Webster> Well, now you can redo it with a better buffer. >_>
[18:59:01] <RazorSharpFang> firestream: I should have transferred it offsite, eh?
[18:59:07] <firestream> yep
[18:59:17] <Webster> Local git repo would be a start.
[18:59:19] <firestream> i have it saved on my HHD > backup driv > nas > offsite
[18:59:34] <firestream> for anywork i do it auto saves for me like that 
[18:59:43] <firestream> heck even my webserver gets a copy and stuff 
[19:00:01] <firestream> Been making a site for someone in node.js  *  kill me *
[19:00:09] <Webster> Speaking of NAS, I should try fixing mine.
[19:00:20] <firestream> 3mines dieing a slow dath
[19:00:24] <firestream> death *
[19:00:37] <firestream> i dont care about it anymore its  running on Xp hard ware
[19:00:46] <firestream> waiting for thje sucker to die
[19:00:57] <firestream> havent cleaned the system fans in 2 years and it will not die :/
[19:00:58] <Webster> Mine's an old desktop I turned into a server. I installed FreeNAS, and now it can't find the partition it installed to.
[19:01:25] <firestream> i forgot what porgram will tell you :/
[19:02:07] <firestream> this nas is on a old shitty hp  with amd 3200 cpu
[19:03:23] <Webster> My hardware is decent enough, but if it ever dies I'll either get a pre-made NAS or make another from something with ECC memory.
[19:07:55] <firestream> one mine does im building from scratch
[19:08:19] <firestream> i have it in a dusty everment hopeinbg tyhe fans die or it over heats so it will be dead
[19:08:20] <Webster> I kind of want a Drobo, though more than that I'd prefer a scratch-built system that can do the same thing.
[19:08:54] <firestream> i perfer scratch
[19:09:29] <Webster> I've yet to see a way to provide multi drive redundancy without having a fixed-size RAID.
[19:10:35] <JustAberrant> what's the matter with that?
[19:10:52] <JustAberrant> and what do you mean fixed size?
[19:11:06] <Webster> Like, with a Drobo you can put larger drives in and the system will take advantage of the extra space.
[19:11:13] <JustAberrant> ah
[19:11:24] <JustAberrant> well, you can do that with raid usually
[19:11:33] <Webster> Oh?
[19:11:38] *** Joins: Moonlightning (blackl@property.of.lightningcrash)
[19:12:01] <JustAberrant> kinda, depends how you have things set up and how you want to add the space
[19:12:20] <JustAberrant> but yeah, usually you can add a new drive and grow the array/underlying file system to use it
[19:12:43] <JustAberrant> with linux software raid it's trivial
[19:13:05] <firestream> my gaming system is running in raid 
[19:13:08] <Webster> So even if the drives are different sizes it can use the extra space?
[19:13:17] <JustAberrant> with hardware raid it can be a bit more complicated, most decent controllers support online content expansion/etc.. but you often have to do some trickery to get the OS to see the new space
[19:13:36] <Webster> Hrm. I'll have to look it up.
[19:13:38] <JustAberrant> Webster: depending on the raid level
[19:13:58] <Webster> Do you know off-hand which ones support it?
[19:14:06] <JustAberrant> Webster: but usually if you have redundancy at all, you'll only get the equivalent space of the smallest drive in your array
[19:14:35] <JustAberrant> not sure how drobo gets around that (or if they do).. because you need a certain amount of space for parity information
[19:14:38] <Webster> That's the thing with Drobo is it divvies up the space so you can use most of it. There are limits, but if you have enough drives it can do that.
[19:15:10] <JustAberrant> yeah I don't get how that would work
[19:15:26] <JustAberrant> maybe it stores a bit more parity info in the other drives *shrugs*
[19:15:40] <Moonlightning> So today I learned that `option routers` is pretty important. :p
[19:15:40] <Webster> Like, 500/500/1000 with 1 drive redundancy would give you 1000 to use. 500/500/1000/2000 would give you 1000 still until you add more.
[19:16:08] <Moonlightning> I guess dnsmasq doesn't have an option for it, and just always hands out the server's address for that interface.
[19:16:12] <Webster> Or maybe 1500 for the second.
[19:16:21] <Webster> But yeah.
[19:16:25] * JustAberrant just keeps things simple and uses equal sized drives :>
[19:16:32] <JustAberrant> it's possible linux supports something like that, no idea
[19:16:34] <JustAberrant> zfs may also
[19:17:11] <JustAberrant> speaking of zfs.. I really want to use it, but I'd need way more ram than I have, and my current file server can't support the amount I'd probably want :(
[19:17:26] <Webster> Yeah, from a high level it's a fairly simple idea, but I've not seen it implemented anywhere yet other than with the Drobo office units.
[19:18:22] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, I've decompiled the class file, and I'm /about/ where I left off.
[19:20:10] <JustAberrant> :)
[19:21:03] <JustAberrant> Webster: yeah, I could see that being drobo specific, I've never heard of being able to do that
[19:21:51] <JustAberrant> either way, I prefer to just roll my own anyway, don't like the idea of using some weird propriatary raid implementation, plus I encrypt it, which I don't (think) drobo does
[19:21:59] <Webster> I'd just buy the Drobo but for that much I could upgrade my server.
[19:22:11] <JustAberrant> and drobo is pretty expensive for what you get imo
[19:22:36] <Webster> Exactly.
[19:23:02] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: where'd you leave off :(
[19:23:24] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: I needed to convert my dataBuffer into bytes so I could send it across the network.
[19:23:54] <Webster> Turn it into XML. :D
[19:24:04] <JustAberrant> mm
[19:24:29] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[19:24:52] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: what kinda databuffer?
[19:24:59] <RazorSharpFang> So, it's a java.awt.image.DataBufferInt@14c265e
[19:25:56] <JustAberrant> no idea, you could iterate through it and getElem* or whatever
[19:26:19] <JustAberrant> or maybe serialize it with xstream or jaxb (if you're a massochist)
[19:26:39] <JustAberrant> seems like an odd thing to do either way
[19:26:49] <JustAberrant> what are you actually trying to do?
[19:27:41] <JustAberrant> typically when I've done network code, you want to define some kind of protocol
[19:27:48] <JustAberrant> which usually had some kind of packet/package
[19:28:30] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: I want to capture the screen and transmit it across the network.
[19:28:48] <JustAberrant> <sync word><length of package (always x bytes)><package data (arbitrary size)>  is usually the basic
[19:29:07] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: so now oyu're re-inventing vnc? ;p
[19:29:12] <JustAberrant> * you're
[19:29:13] <RazorSharpFang> Yes.
[19:29:20] <RazorSharpFang> because RDP isn't supported
[19:29:32] <JustAberrant> isn't supported in what?
[19:29:40] <RazorSharpFang> WinXP Home
[19:30:11] <JustAberrant> use tightvnc or something?
[19:30:15] <Webster> Why not use VNC or TeamViewer or similar/
[19:30:29] <Webster> Unless you just want to do it yourself. That's cool, too.
[19:30:52] <JustAberrant> yeah if you want to do it for the hell of it, go for it.. always fun to do things like that
[19:30:59] <JustAberrant> but definitely a solved problem here ;p
[19:31:20] <RazorSharpFang> Last time I tried VNC, it caused the OS to crash.
[19:31:43] <JustAberrant> either way, keep in mind rdp/vnc do a lot of stuff to make it sane.. transmitting full res images of a desktop at any kind of decent fps isn't trivial ;p
[19:32:01] <RazorSharpFang> I was gonna deflate it.
[19:32:47] <JustAberrant> deflate?
[19:33:01] <JustAberrant> as in like, gzip?
[19:33:03] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah
[19:34:48] <JustAberrant> so the databuffer is the output from whatever you are using to grab the image?
[19:34:54] <RazorSharpFang> Yep
[19:35:29] <RazorSharpFang> I can't seem to convert the dataBuffer into byte[]
[19:35:43] * JustAberrant shrugs.. aside from just iterating through it and converting each individual element.. no idea

[19:46:52] <RazorSharpFang> Well, there's more than binary data going across it.
[19:47:20] <JustAberrant> if you have a mixture, usually makes sense to use binary

[19:52:40] <JustAberrant> i.e. is it accepting the connection, is it grabbing a screenshot, is it trying to write anything, etc..

[23:17:12] <HoneyDrops|Half> I am still baffled by people not getting net neutrality.  It is not a difficult concept: you pass packets to where they ask to go, you don't worry about where they came from or where they are going (aside from literally to the extent needed to route them).  You ignore whatever is in them, and you treat all all sources and destinations the same. 
[23:18:44] <HoneyDrops|Half> We'll ignore the entirely distinct issue that censorship is universally bad, and there is no effective way to ever effectively enact it.

[23:33:39] <Gladiolus> lol HoneyDrops|Half there's idiots on the 2600 facebook page that are /mad as hell/ about net neutrality being a thing
[23:33:46] <Gladiolus> like, not that it's being supported
[23:33:58] <Gladiolus> that it's not being banned because FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES

[23:34:19] <JustAberrant> Ayn Rand types on 2600 .. you don't say ;p
[23:35:20] <HoneyDrops|Half> I mean, I'd rather it not need to be enforced via regulation.  I would prefer it to be how everyone operates because /that is the right thing to do/.
[23:35:50] <LightningCrash> HoneyDrops|Half: People usually need an analogy to get it. 
[23:35:59] <HoneyDrops|Half> However, if everyone did what they /should/ then we'd have a lot fewer laws XD
[23:36:11] * JustAberrant pretty much anti-free market at this point
[23:36:27] <JustAberrant> free market only works up to a point, where providing better products and services produces more money
[23:36:46] <JustAberrant> eventually it tips over and other (far less beneficial) behaviours generate more money
[23:37:05] <Gladiolus> I would rather that too HoneyDrops|Half lol.
[23:37:15] <Gladiolus> If capitalists weren't jerks I would be right wing as heck, but they tend to.
[23:37:24] <JustAberrant> outsourcing jobs to places without pesky workers rights, cutting corners, monopolies, etc
[23:37:38] <LightningCrash> JustAberrant, but graft and corruption causes just as much inequality and just as many problems
[23:37:40] <HoneyDrops|Half> I'm pro-free, anti-market.  Freedom is good.  However markets invariably devolve into profit seeking, at the cost of the actual value of the products/services/endeavors.
[23:38:09] <JustAberrant> indeed, there's basically no way to have the best of both
[23:38:13] <LightningCrash> The short answer is that there's no /easy/ solution because there are so many different people with different goals and different spending habits that one system can't be the most efficient.
[23:38:13] <JustAberrant> you need a middle ground
[23:38:18] <JustAberrant> which is really what I want
[23:38:19] <Gladiolus> I believe similarly but I don't wanna get into politics :|
[23:38:35] <Gladiolus> Basically tho Lenin's NEP was a brilliant middle ground, too bad /somebody/ derailed it.
[23:38:36] <HoneyDrops|Half> The point is an ISP's primary focus should be on providing the best possible service.  If they make money, fine, but it shouldn't be a factor when making a decision.
[23:38:36] <LightningCrash> A middle ground would be nice 
[23:38:48] <JustAberrant> reasonable flexibility for people to compete, rules to keep things in the interests of society
[23:38:55] <JustAberrant> (which yeah, is _way_ easier to type than do
[23:39:20] <LightningCrash> That's just too nebulous
[23:39:27] <Gladiolus> Government should have total ownership of natural resources and developing them should be for the whole of the nation state, not any specific corporation doing the development.

[23:39:56] <LightningCrash> "the interests of society" is just a completely undefinable idea
[23:41:58] <Gladiolus> That's why you don't say "society" you define as national or statewise.
[23:42:53] <LightningCrash> The problem with government owning the means of production is that it's too broadscale for maximization of efficiency
[23:43:29] <Gladiolus> Not all the means of production, like I just said "direct natural resource development"
[23:43:29] <LightningCrash> The best thing about capitalism is that you know everyone's motive. Profit. 
[23:43:48] <Gladiolus> Now how you distribute those resources is ungodly complex and I won't get into it lol
[23:43:53] <Shutter> The government don't need to own means of production, just natural resources. E.g. you don't let a corporation own a river; you merely allow them to rent the right to use that river for power.
[23:43:55] * LightningCrash laughs
[23:43:59] <Shutter> Or whatever resources.
[23:44:20] <Gladiolus> I would basically draw a line at "If a citizen doesn't have access to this, do they die? If so that's nationalized".

[23:44:56] <PinkiePieBot> [ HackRF One - WRL-13001 - SparkFun Electronics ]
[23:45:20] <Gladiolus> I would also very heavily regulate said river-using corporation with a provision that they can run a profit, but they don't get to gouge and if someone is too poor to pay the bills then... well the state has failed them one one hand, but don't cut them off that's rude.
[23:45:52] <LightningCrash> Or they could have failed themselves
[23:46:19] <Gladiolus> They could but there should always be a bare-minimum "bread and water" safety net.
[23:46:37] <Shutter> I don't think detail regulating it like that is the best. Rather, you regulate the market in a way to ensure proper competition between private entities and thus ensure power isn't more expensive than it needs to be.
[23:46:55] <LightningCrash> ^
[23:46:59] <Shutter> Also, it's important to regulate wages. No one working 8 hours per day should be living in poverty.
[23:47:14] <Gladiolus> Yeah but with something like this a monopoly is natural- having 6 power plants in the same city is ineffficient.
[23:47:16] <LightningCrash> Eh 
[23:47:28] <Gladiolus> and yes agreed
[23:47:29] <LightningCrash> It's a dangerous trap though 
[23:47:39] <Shutter> Why is that dangerous?
[23:48:06] <Shutter> Gladiolus: Obviously you don't hand out permits to do that. It's not like you allow people to build critical infrastructure without going through an approval process.
[23:48:07] <Gladiolus> I actually think that it should be a living wage and that people that live at home should be paid slightly less. Like, when I was in HS I got 15 an hour working retail due to luck.
[23:48:08] <LightningCrash> A lot of business require cheap and unskilled labor to stay afloat
[23:48:34] <LightningCrash> What isn't right is that people live their lives at that cheap and unskilled labor level.
[23:48:46] <Gladiolus> Eh we're kinda silly about that.
[23:48:50] <LightningCrash> 4^ That's kinda what I'm getting at
[23:48:58] <Shutter> We need unskilled labour as a society. Which is why we need to subsidise it, like it or not.
[23:48:59] <Gladiolus> If you're happy with your manual labour job, you should be able to live off it.
[23:48:59] <LightningCrash> If someone's a teenager still living at home, they don't need a living wage.
[23:49:22] <Shutter> People in well paying jobs have to earn less, but I think that's a small price to pay, as people in well earning jobs generally have interesting jobs.
[23:49:53] <Gladiolus> I wouldn't advocate for a lower min. wage though since my thing would only work in heavily socialized society.
[23:50:22] <Gladiolus> Its' like "this is just part of a muuuch wider social overhaul where every citizen works manual labour now and then."
[23:50:23] <LightningCrash> Another problem, Shutter, is that by saying "people who work 40 hours a week should have a living wage"
[23:50:33] <Shutter> They should.
[23:50:36] <LightningCrash> Then, as an employer, you just cut back on their hours.
[23:50:45] <LightningCrash> which makes it difficult for people in that position to even find work for 40 hours a week.
[23:50:59] <Gladiolus> every citizen should have the right to work and a living wage from that work.
[23:51:06] <LightningCrash> Underemployment is probably a bigger problem than unemployment. 
[23:51:10] <Shutter> I don't see that logic. It's not cheaper to have 5 workers working 8 hours per week than 1 working 40
[23:51:22] <Gladiolus> it is if you can suddenly pay them 2 dollars an hour
[23:51:34] <LightningCrash> Usually is, when you live in a place with regulations like "if they work this much for you, you have to provide these benefits"
[23:51:35] <Shutter> Also you have employer's fees, which means it's cheaper for an employer to have 1 full time than several part time
[23:51:54] <Gladiolus> Like we're making assumptions here now that there aren't exploitable holes with your 40 hours thing.
[23:51:57] <Gladiolus> There are and they will.
[23:52:10] <LightningCrash> The problem here is that you also have to descriminate by employer.
[23:52:13] <Gladiolus> Give them 38 hours womp womp.
[23:52:20] <LightningCrash> discriminate*
[23:52:32] <LightningCrash> Because a local small business could get hammered by a minimum wage increase.
[23:52:39] <LightningCrash> Where a large megacorp would barely feel the effects.
[23:52:58] <Moonlightning> Gladiolus: that's difficulr, though.
[23:53:07] <Moonlightning> If a citizen doesn't have access to the Internet, do they die?
[23:53:15] <LightningCrash> No, ask 26% of Americans. :p
[23:53:17] <Moonlightning> Not immediately. Not like food or water.
[23:53:29] <Moonlightning> But…what if it was essentially a requirement for finding a job?
[23:53:30] <Gladiolus> no and therefore the government shouldn't be directly in control of internet access
[23:53:37] <Gladiolus> well regulated companies can do so
[23:53:41] <Moonlightning> It isn't, really, (/yet!/), but…what if?
[23:53:43] <Gladiolus> and they can compete for better access

[23:53:53] <PinkiePieInsane> so whats habbenin here?
[23:53:54] <Moonlightning> If a citizen doesn't have access to electricity, do they die?
[23:54:04] <Moonlightning> PinkiePieInsane: #econponies
[23:54:12] <Gladiolus> i would argue yes because cooking and using a fridge
[23:54:26] <Gladiolus> We're getting into specifics though and I said before that we could go down that road for hours.
[23:54:27] <PinkiePieInsane> oh, Usa econ, that never ends well
[23:55:58] <Gladiolus> much like real life!
[23:56:07] <LightningCrash> In a perfect world, everyone would be doing something they love and could live on it.
[23:56:18] <PinkiePieInsane> I need to sumerize US ec in a single sentence, but there is so much to say
[23:56:21] <LightningCrash> But that's totally unfeasible, atm. 
[23:56:23] <Gladiolus> anyway Moonlightning the distinction would change over time, the most important part of economics and politics is adaptation.
[23:56:39] <LightningCrash> Go 300 years down the road where all the crappy jobs are automated, then maybe. 
[23:56:40] <Gladiolus> The worst mistake a country can make is idle worship of laws to the point of refusing to ever change them.
[23:56:59] <Gladiolus> basically what I'm saying is the US needs to stop worshipping the constitution and realize everything is flawed forever and change is good
[23:57:18] <PinkiePieInsane> See here, 20 years ago, minimum wage was a viable way to live, now a day it's not, who to blame? Previous generation, long story short, blame your parents.
[23:57:20] *** GigaCity is now known as Gigabit
[23:57:24] <LightningCrash> 'course we do. The constiution was 230 years ago. 
[23:57:25] <Moonlightning> Gladiolus: butbut, free speech!
[23:57:29] <Gladiolus> The US in a single sentence: A roller coaster ride where some people fall off.
[23:57:38] <PinkiePieInsane> Also, one of the biggest problem US have is, it's big
[23:57:43] <PinkiePieInsane> it's stupidly big
[23:57:47] <Moonlightning> PinkiePieInsane: meanwhile, the previous generation is complaining about how the next generation is so fucked up.
[23:57:52] <LightningCrash> Its size is one of its largest assets too.
[23:57:56] <Gladiolus> Didn't stop you from building the interstate.
[23:58:12] <Gladiolus> Massive infrastructure investment is a hell of an economic boost and you've got ample opportunties
[23:58:19] <Gladiolus> which you don't do because it would require...
[23:58:20] <Gladiolus> ~gasp~
[23:58:22] <Gladiolus> TAX INCREASES
[23:58:26] * Gladiolus screams
[23:58:29] <LightningCrash> When you take the USA as a whole, it has a brighter economic outlook than most of the rest of the developed world, mostly because of its resource diversity and skillset diversity.
[23:59:06] <Gladiolus> Srsly tho we need to stop being so damn stupid about taxes.
[23:59:09] <LightningCrash> Now, "taking the USA as a whole" essentially just means GDP growth. Factoring inequality in there and things take a sharp downhill turn. 
[23:59:14] <Gladiolus> Sometimes they need to go up, sometimes they need to go down.
[23:59:26] <Gladiolus> The idiotic perpetual "LESS TAX" thing we're on right now is moronic.
[23:59:42] <PinkiePieInsane> it's also the main reason it's failing. Currently it's political system is essentially based on corruption, and the economy is based around the rich. Not only that, but the fundemental laws that governs the country, the fact that each republic governs it self as a sovreign nation is part of the problem.
[23:59:53] <PinkiePieInsane> US tax is fine, problem is it's not being spent correctly.
[23:59:56] <Gladiolus> Yeah basically the US is broken on literally every level lol.
