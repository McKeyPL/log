[03:00:30] <Sour_Sweet> Thanks to LE this is now part of my crontab :P " sudo -u ircclient screen -S weechat -p 0 -X stuff '/relay sslcertkey\n' " Yay dirty solutions for self created problems
[03:07:36] <Moonlightning> You're using a browser-trusted certificate for your weechat relay now? :P
[03:07:55] <Moonlightning> …actually, I suppose that's fair, given that the relay clients don't all have very good non-browser-trusted-cert handling
[03:08:01] <Sour_Sweet> I always did. Why not? I'm accessing it from I browser after all
[03:08:37] <Moonlightning> /browser-trusted/ isn't literal.
[03:08:39] <Sour_Sweet> my*
[03:11:17] <Sour_Sweet> Wait the letsencrypt-auto thing doesn't know the renew param?! How is this going to work?!
[03:11:30] <Sour_Sweet> Their documentation is a piece of crap
[03:11:46] <Moonlightning> It is. :/
[03:12:06] <Moonlightning> Where's Schism?
[03:12:18] <Moonlightning> I think they were also complaining about the LE client and stuff. You should work with them to make a better one. :p
[03:16:46] <Sour_Sweet>  --renew-by-default (which I already used) works
[03:17:05] <Sour_Sweet> It will not create a new cert if the domains are identical
[03:17:26] <Sour_Sweet> I wasted one try to see if that works :P
[03:19:27] <Sour_Sweet> The cert transparency logs are going to be unreadable by any humand being with the frequency of updates
[03:34:25] <Sour_Sweet> When you renew it creates a new private key -.- bye bye key pinning
[03:34:44] <Moonlightning> yeah, I want more control over the CSRs.
[03:35:04] <Moonlightning> 4096-bit keys, pick which of them becomes the common name
[03:35:25] <Sour_Sweet> Common name is always the first domain
[03:35:40] <Sour_Sweet> I use that trick for labeling certs
[03:35:53] <Moonlightning> I know.
[03:36:13] <Sour_Sweet> (Since weechat, apache and postfix/dovecot use different certs on my setup)
[03:36:19] <Moonlightning> But I'm generating a different cert for each server+service pair, and it makes more sense to me to have the CN be the server's name, not the service name
[03:36:47] <Moonlightning> But if I did it naively, I would be replacing the cert, because they would all be put under /etc/letsencrypt/archive/sugar-belle.blackl.net
[03:37:19] <Moonlightning> So I end up symlinking that directory (and its `live` counterpart) to /etc/letsencrypt/archive/irc.blackl.net, etc, and /then/ requesting a new cert
[03:37:21] <Moonlightning> which is annoying
[03:37:33] <Moonlightning> should just be a --common-name option
[03:38:13] * JustAberrant places Moonlightning 
[03:38:38] * Moonlightning is…placed?
[03:40:51] <Moonlightning> …except, I don't think I've actually been able to successfully /get/ a cert like that
[03:40:56] <Moonlightning> the -auto script has hung on me
[03:42:03] <Sour_Sweet> You could always use a pseudo valid common name and add the actual domains as SANs

[03:42:54] <Sour_Sweet> Yes it's silly
[03:43:24] <Sour_Sweet> And I want freaking key pinning and while they state that it's possbile with LE their client doesn't support it
[03:43:46] <Sour_Sweet> Yay it's possible in theory but not implemented in the reference implementation
[03:43:46] <Moonlightning> I wonder how hard it would be to just do it all by hoof.
[03:44:34] <Colgate> look into what the LE client actually does
[03:44:58] <Colgate> I imagine it is open source... right? :P

[03:45:59] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-lu48ce.lnk.telstra.net)
[03:46:06] <Colgate> we were wondering if it was worth using LE for canternet's certs
[03:46:41] <Colgate> some silly ideas we had was having the website use LE, and then the website would host a copy of a self-signed cert that the irc servers used, lol
[03:47:10] <Sour_Sweet> Maybe I can get it to run as an unprivileged user that way as well. Colgate: Unless Inspircd supports graceful restarts don't even think about it
[03:47:32] <Sour_Sweet> And I highly doubt it does
[03:47:32] <Colgate> inspircd can rehash ssl certs without restarting
[03:47:45] <Sour_Sweet> Oh, that's actually quite nice
[03:47:53] <Colgate> and probably private keys as well? never tried that one though
[03:48:05] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah drop root and things
[03:48:23] <Colgate> that was another option
[03:48:33] <Colgate> we would have LE run and replace inspircd's certs and such
[03:48:50] <Colgate> then have a local client connect and oper up to run a /rehash -ssl command
[03:49:18] <Colgate> either that or add a signal handler for sigusr1 or something for /rehash -ssl
[03:49:28] <Colgate> that would have to be a core change however
[03:49:43] <Moonlightning> > inspircd can rehash ssl certs without restarting
[03:49:57] <Moonlightning> Well, sort of. You have to reload the TLS module, though, which kills everypony connected using it.
[03:50:14] <Sour_Sweet> Can't you inject that simply through screen?
[03:50:23] <Colgate> Moonlightning: that's a personal problem, works for us :P
[03:50:47] <Colgate> inject what through screen?
[03:50:48] <Moonlightning> Colgate: well, it doesn't work for me, so…
[03:50:57] <Sour_Sweet> The rehash command
[03:50:57] <Colgate> the rehash command?
[03:51:00] <Sour_Sweet> Yes
[03:51:06] <Colgate> inspircd server doesn't have a local term
[03:51:14] <Sour_Sweet> Oh :D
[03:51:29] <Sour_Sweet> I should maybe try it some time ^^
[03:51:32] <Moonlightning> pgrep inspircd | xargs kill -HUP
[03:51:56] <Colgate> Moonlightning: that doesn't rehash ssl config stuff, only the config files
[03:52:10] <Moonlightning> …right, you can't do that with a signal x.x
[03:52:25] <Colgate> that's what I mentioned before with the core change to make a signal do that
[03:53:27] <Colgate> I should try changing the private key though
[03:53:35] <Colgate> I don't think it will cause an issue, but it is untested by me
[03:54:15] <Sour_Sweet> I'm personally fine with ssl certs on canternet as they are. Adding the fingerprint manually in weechat isn't exactly nice, but to be very honest random windows clients are more of an issue. I don't know wherever or not they like selfsigned/CAcert certs
[03:55:01] <Colgate> that's the downside of LE certs for irc, they aren't long lasting, so fingerprints are useless
[03:55:28] <Sour_Sweet> You cannot run different certs for different ports?
[03:55:32] <Moonlightning> two months -> fingerprints are useless?
[03:55:42] <Colgate> I don't think inspircd supports that, no
[03:55:48] <Colgate> not without multiple daemons
[03:55:51] <Moonlightning> What about the TLS-profile thing?
[03:56:00] <Colgate> TLS-profile?
[03:56:06] <Moonlightning> <sslprofile>?
[03:56:12] <Moonlightning> it's not documented >.>
[03:56:25] <Colgate> that might be why I don't know about it :P
[03:56:46] <Moonlightning> yeah, I only know about it 'cos I was poking around in the m_ssl_* sources
[03:56:49] <Colgate> same with this /modenotice command, lol
[03:56:58] <Colgate> learned about that a few days ago
[03:57:10] <Moonlightning> /modenotice?

[03:58:14] <Colgate> that's the only reason I know about it XD
[03:58:18] <Moonlightning> well, there's also—
[03:58:33] <Moonlightning> wait…there isn't an /infoserv send-to-all-opers-now importance, is there

[04:06:58] <Sour_Sweet> It's in the support forum on the beta thread
[04:07:03] <Moonlightning> Note that they mean /hostname/, not /domain/
[04:07:09] <Colgate> "If you would like certificates for subdomains, you must include each subdomain separately."
[04:07:13] <Colgate> :V
[04:07:13] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[04:07:18] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[04:07:29] <Sour_Sweet> Yes. And silly me had to forget exactly one
[04:07:37] <Colgate> that's a tiny field for like, 40 hostnames
[04:07:51] <Moonlightning> what's the charlimit?
[04:07:51] <Sour_Sweet> So I'm using LE now for everything except for one hostname
[04:08:17] <Sour_Sweet> I did enter 33 names I believe
[04:08:22] <Colgate> I think I'm just gonna wait until it goes to public beta, which is supposedly in december
[04:08:23] <Sour_Sweet> It works ;-)
[04:08:36] <Colgate> hopefully they will have a better system by then
[04:08:45] <Colgate> cause a google forms doc is pretty terrible
[04:09:02] <Moonlightning> Well, the charlimit is at least 685
[04:09:16] <Sour_Sweet> You won't need a whitelist entry after the closed beta
[04:09:35] <Sour_Sweet> It still bugs me that they don't just whitelist all subdomains
[04:09:43] <Colgate> I'll just wait, I'll be gone this weekend anyways :P
[04:09:59] <Colgate> and then weekend after that is thanksgiving weekend, will be gone again...
[04:10:17] <Sour_Sweet> Also the ratelimits are stupid

[06:54:08] <Moonlightning> Hmmmm, this is weird
[06:54:57] <Moonlightning> I don't have a dedicated modem; I've just been using my ISP's combo box, in bridge mode
[06:57:16] <Moonlightning> before, I was able to access its configuration website by adding an address on a /24 to my router (which also automatically added a route for that /24)
[06:57:45] <Moonlightning> and I'm assuming NAT would've also been done for that (because the condition in iptables is just --out-interface=eth0)
[06:58:09] <Moonlightning> After the power outage yesterday, I added the address (and route) back, but it's not working anymore.
[06:58:21] <Moonlightning> I can't ping the combo box from the router or from a client
[07:00:53] * Moonlightning `tcpdump`s.
[07:01:27] <Moonlightning> hmm, the NAT's wonky.
[07:01:49] <Moonlightning> Packets bound for that /24 are getting rewritten to use my global v4 address, not the address /on/ that /24
[07:02:03] <Moonlightning> I don't know if that's how it was last time, but I have a feeling it's not :P
[07:08:08] <Moonlightning> I don't understand. There's a route for this /24, with a good source IP, and no other routes that overlap it (besides the default route)…shouldn't packets originating from the router use that source IP, and packets from clients bound for that network get NATted to use that source IP?

[17:52:29] <Colgate> outlawing encryption, wonderful
[17:53:41] <Colgate> hmm it doesn't mention VPNs... can tor be considered a VPN network?
[17:53:48] <Colgate> it kind of is right?
[17:59:05] <Colgate> oh hmm, apparently that would outlaw tor nodes in the UK too, hmm
[17:59:23] <Colgate> but not exit nodes
[17:59:35] <Colgate> only relays, interesting
[18:00:26] * HoneyDrops expects it to pass, expects it to utterly fail to do anything it supposedly is supposed to do.  Banning things that are easy for, well everyone, to make tends to not work.  There is absolutely no viable way to restrict access to strong encryption, nor enforce such a ban.  That leaves aside how idiotic the goal itself is.
[18:01:41] <Colgate> open source even if it does work somehow, and encryption is somehow banned
[18:02:04] <Colgate> things will just move to stenography
[18:02:23] <Colgate> good luck finding that aes encrypted message hidden in all those vine videos
[18:11:57] <HoneyDrops> I suspect that it will quickly be discovered it's a bad idea.  I can envision the financial or political fallout when one of those keys gets leaked or just cracked...  What worries me is that how many groups will be archiving whatever they can before the inevitable.  How much damage will years of everyone's comminications being released do?
[18:16:52] <johnsey> you should not mistake the goal for what it really is. it's not for catching terrorists. it's a nightmare for the secret service that the general public can do things they can't keep track of
[18:20:57] <HoneyDrops> Well yes, the internet is a panopticon w/o encryption.  Which is what they really want.
[18:21:40] <Colgate> without encryption, you would be able to listen to every conversation in the world at once from your chair
[18:22:08] <Colgate> I don't see how they could do that, what about financial transactions?
[18:22:15] <Colgate> wouldn't the banks fight this?
[18:22:26] <Sour_Sweet> No
[18:22:35] <johnsey> it's not about having no encryption
[18:22:49] <johnsey> it's about being able to decrypt everything at will
[18:22:57] <Colgate> which is the same thing?
[18:23:01] <johnsey> nope
[18:23:03] <Sour_Sweet> At least the bank I've been working for is more than cooperative
[18:23:28] <Colgate> if someone else that isn't the intended recepient can decrypt my things, it isn't encrypted imo
[18:23:29] <HoneyDrops> As is I wish there were better measured to inhibit the monitoring even who's taking to who.  The entire idea of a third party being able to discern who's taking with who (even if the contents are secure) is broken in my eyes.
[18:23:39] <johnsey> if only a "trusted entity" aka the government can decrypt.everything, it is safe
[18:23:49] <johnsey> you are safe against criminals
[18:23:55] <Colgate> I don't feel any safer
[18:23:58] <Colgate> :(
[18:24:02] <johnsey> but why would you want to protect against the government?
[18:24:09] <HoneyDrops> Yes, they will devise the magic number what can only be uttered by the pure of heart. XD
[18:24:31] <Colgate> what happens when said key is leaked?
[18:24:38] <johnsey> pssh do you have anything to hide from tbe government? :P
[18:24:52] <johnsey> it won't be because everything will be certified!
[18:25:05] <HoneyDrops> Because, so far, until we have our AI overlords, the government is make up of people: the same weak, scared, and petty ones that comprise the masses.
[18:25:25] <Sour_Sweet> As far as I know the NSA is monitoring swift messages. Those are used for any international bank to bank money trasnfer
[18:25:27] <Colgate> inb4 this system only works on standard http ports
[18:25:30] <johnsey> and obviously, government security is much higher than your personal security, hence keys are safer with them than with you
[18:25:45] <johnsey> ;)
[18:26:47] <Sour_Sweet> That being said swift messages are encrypted. Doesn't seem to stop them though
[18:27:15] <johnsey> of course not, there is an agreement to share the data
[18:27:23] <Colgate> can I go back to being oblivious
[18:27:27] <Colgate> that was a nice time

[18:33:27] <PinkiePieBot> [ Terrorist Finance Tracking Program - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[18:36:32] <HoneyDrops> Too bad we don't have a reliable and easily accessible, recordless, financial system.
[18:37:33] <HoneyDrops> (recordless in the sense that no one but the parties involved in the transaction know the details, including the very existence of the transaction itself)
[18:37:33] <Sour_Sweet> johnsey: Yeah the thing is some of the data is end-to-end encrypted. I know that because we needed to exchange keys with foreign banks from time to time.
[18:38:44] <Sour_Sweet> And since authorities had only very limited access to our systems I don't know if they're able to decrypt every message
[18:40:38] <Sour_Sweet> It's entirely possible though that the whole SWIFT PKI is compromised, but from what I've read the NSA targeted certain banks directly which wouldn't make sense then.
[18:41:59] <Sour_Sweet> I'm almost certain U.S. banks share their data with the government, but I don't believe we did to some same degree
[18:42:04] *** Joins: Sin (Sin@is.hustlin.everyday)
[18:42:12] <HoneyDrops> Still, you can be compelled to divulge information.  The problem with banks is they necessarily have data on the transaction to give.  Need a way to seal that vulnerability.  I could envision a system where each transaction is appended to a customers record by the bank, and the record is encrypted such that only the customer can decrypt it.  Sadly that still leaves real-time monitoring, but
[18:42:14] <HoneyDrops> would make after-the-fact data accessible only with the consent and knowledge of the customer.
[18:42:36] <johnsey> it's simple. the NSA requests the data, the NSA gets the data.

[18:45:01] <Colgate> HoneyDrops: I'm not sure that kind of thing is possible to make(recordless transaction system), certainly not possible with cryptocurrencies
[18:46:26] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, cryptocurrencies don't solve the problem.  Cash still is the best option, but even then they have nastyness like physical trace and serial numbers.  Also cash requires physical proximity.
[18:48:04] <Sour_Sweet> One example: We needed to check transactions against OFAC matches: https://sdnsearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=376

[18:48:10] <HoneyDrops> This is about the only time I'd laud it as a currency, but gold or silver at least mostly deal with two of those.  No silly numbers, metal is metal.  And you can process them in ways they will destroy physical trace.
[18:48:57] <Sour_Sweet> Oh you have no idea.
