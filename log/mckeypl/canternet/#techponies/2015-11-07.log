[06:40:23] <Googie> Moonlightning: "The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring
[06:40:25] <Googie> the entity-body itself."
[06:41:15] <Googie> The idea is for it to be identical to the headers from a GET. We already know the COntent-Length of a HEAD request is going to be 0, that's not useful. It could be useful to find the size of a file before downloading it though.

[11:21:45] <Moonlightning> This lets me see if something just recently became active
[11:21:56] <Moonlightning> also, I definitely care about the number of pings >.>
[11:24:16] <Moonlightning> Aaaa
[11:24:18] <Moonlightning> It's not going away
[11:24:33] <Moonlightning> Okay, there we go.
[11:24:34] <aji> but do you actually care about the *number*, or just the fact that you got pinged?
[11:24:46] <aji> is there a certain number that would change the way you think about being pinged?
[11:25:02] <Moonlightning> yes :p
[11:25:21] <Moonlightning> In particular, more than two pings in Mozilla/#rust probably means it's just rustbot and I can defer checking indefinitely
[11:26:07] <Moonlightning> …that's not a good example. I generally ignore pings from there anyway, because it's seriously /always/ just rustbot.
[11:26:24] <Moonlightning> Here's a better one. If I get pinged a lot in rapid succession, it's probably a spammer.

[11:33:06] <Moonlightning> aji: I often collect pings while I'm away, though.
[11:33:27] <Moonlightning> So being able to tell roughly what happened without /actually/ checking is nice.
[11:35:39] <aji> i guess!
[11:35:44] <aji> anyway,
[11:35:52] <aji> you can configure the hotbar to only show the number of pings too i think
[11:36:00] <Moonlightning> Probably.
[11:36:27] <Moonlightning> But, despite having a monitor on the smaller end of the scale, the rows really aren't at a premium here c:

[21:31:56] <roflin> *squeeks* I have very little knowledge about dns or anything network related. so can't help you there.
[21:32:22] <Moonlightning> Still, I feel that all transfer requests via UDP should be denied.

[21:33:11] <roflin> firewall do the trick*?
[21:33:22] <Moonlightning> UDP is more efficient, though.
[21:33:27] <Moonlightning> It should be allowed for other queries.
[21:33:41] <Moonlightning> You avoid TCP's setup-teardown affair and just get two packets, most of the time.
[21:34:00] <Seoson> Also zone tranfers can expose hidden subdomains you don't want others to know
[21:34:11] <Moonlightning> I don't have any hidden subdomains I don't want others to know about?
[21:34:51] <Seoson> Also zone trasnfers can cause heavy load without an actual use
[21:34:57] * Moonlightning doesn't see why he can't leave this, for the curious.
[21:35:12] <Moonlightning> Seoson, my whole SERVER has no actual use.
[21:35:33] <Moonlightning> Blacklnet started as a box I ran out of my place because I wanted to have +Y on IRC somewhere. XP
[21:35:35] <Seoson> The normal resolver infrastructure doesn't use zone transfers anyway. Only from master to slave
[21:35:57] <Seoson> So there is no reason to allow it
[21:36:04] <Moonlightning> For the curious!
[21:36:27] <Seoson> They get packets telling them to fuckoff from me ;-)
[21:36:39] <Moonlightning> >:(
[21:37:18] <Moonlightning> I don't like this mentality.
[21:37:53] <Moonlightning> It's very cynical. And against individuals, not against institutions.
[21:38:16] <Seoson> Attempts to use disallowed operators are logged on my server. There is no fail2ban rule yet, but you can get that I will implement one
[21:39:23] <Seoson> Get banned by any service 5 times (does not need to be the same service) a day and your ip is blocked completely
[21:39:48] <Seoson> ^2 get = bet*
[21:40:29] * Seoson is quite paranoid
[21:41:29] * Moonlightning is, too, but amplification attacks don't pose a risk to privacy…
[21:44:11] <Seoson> No they only get my traffic null routed
[21:44:21] <Seoson> Which is worse ....
[21:44:32] <Seoson> (... than as risk)
[21:45:17] * Moonlightning still hasn't decided whether exposure or isolation is worse.
[21:45:54] <Seoson> I would disallow queries of the any type as well if there would be a pratical approach
[21:46:10] <Moonlightning> what, why?
[21:46:35] <Seoson> practical* Sadly bind doesn't have that yet. Because it's a risk
[21:47:03] <Seoson> I don't want to deal with my hoster's abuse team
[21:47:51] <Seoson> With DNSSEC enabled the response to ANY is huge
[21:48:14] <Seoson> I'll probably put a rate limit in place instead
[21:48:28] <Moonlightning> Ratelimiting is good.
[21:48:54] <Seoson> Maybe 20/s I'm not 100% sure yet
[21:55:30] <Moonlightning> …wait a second.
[21:55:38] <Moonlightning> Isn't it trivial to get around this?
[21:56:09] <Moonlightning> …oh, wait, but you can't exploit that for an amplification attack.
[21:56:29] <Seoson> Yep, because your target will only have one, maybe 2 ips
[21:56:55] <Phase> there waas a patch that would rate limit responses to a particular address
[21:58:43] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Pony-osmcfg.co.comcast.net)
[21:58:58] <Seoson> Nice bind comes with rate-limit options
[21:59:34] <Seoson> questions is do I have the right version? Let's see
[22:02:32] <Seoson> Looks like I might be behind one version :P
[22:04:13] <Pocky> beep boop
[22:04:52] <Seoson> Debian was so kind to include the backported patch - it works ;-)
