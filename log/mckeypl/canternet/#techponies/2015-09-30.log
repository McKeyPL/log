[01:58:23] <Sour_Sweet> I hate it when applications decide to change file permissions when updating ....

[01:59:52] <JustAberrant> hehe
[01:59:56] <JustAberrant> problem -> solution
[02:03:40] <Sour_Sweet> I'd imagine this is a bad idea
[02:06:35] <Kinsley> As long as your device isn't available to any potential attack vectors, you don't need to worry about security updates.
[02:07:29] <Kinsley> 'Course, any device like that is pretty fuckin' useless, but it still solves the updating problem and doesn't introduce a new security one!
[02:07:34] <Moonlightning> :P
[02:08:52] <Sour_Sweet> Running a server useally comes with the problem that other people access it *derp*
[02:09:39] <Sour_Sweet> I could use ACLs to circumvent the problem I guess, but they are a pain to setup
[02:16:27] <JustAberrant> depends on how they access it

[09:20:19] <Moonlightning> I ran a one-server network off an old box I had at home for…uhhh…a year? A few months?
[09:20:26] <Moonlightning> Then I got a VPS and moved it there

[21:42:35] <Moonlightning> I think maybe it should compile a list of files to delete and a list of candidate directories to delete, before actually deleting everything
[21:42:52] <Moonlightning> because it seems to never actually delete directories, and I think it's because the mtimes get updated when it deletes files inside of them

[23:37:23] <init3> tiwake: It is as Colgate said. I was arguing with someone who was calling me unethical for maintaining a porn block at a school district I worked for like 10 years ago.
[23:37:42] <init3> Saying it is literally as bad as the nazis.
