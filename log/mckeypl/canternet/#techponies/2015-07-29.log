[01:48:10] <ShivalWolf> one day il get my prnter working that well
[01:48:17] <ShivalWolf> and by working that well i mean working at all
[01:48:29] <Lapsus> ShivalWolf: How can I help? :3
[01:48:39] <ShivalWolf> Lapsus: rebuild it from scratch?
[01:48:43] <ShivalWolf> thats what it needs
[01:48:57] <Lapsus> okay cool, when are you coming over?
[01:48:58] <Lapsus> :p
[01:49:01] <ShivalWolf> i bought a very early revision of the prusa mendal 3 
[01:49:10] <ShivalWolf> the Y carrage was laser cut wood
[01:49:13] <ShivalWolf> its warped baddly
[01:49:25] <ShivalWolf> i need to replace the entire y carrage
[01:49:39] <Lapsus> that's not super difficult, or shouldn't be, at least.
[01:49:51] <Lapsus> does it print at all?
[01:50:00] <ShivalWolf> right now
[01:50:01] <ShivalWolf> no
[01:50:09] <ShivalWolf> i may have got mad at it
[01:50:18] <ShivalWolf> and need to replace afew things
[01:50:21] <Lapsus> okay so that's a little harder, you'd need a new frog plate :p
[01:50:29] <Lapsus> okay so you need a few more pieces :v
[01:50:39] <ShivalWolf> also i need a new heatbed
[01:50:45] <ShivalWolf> i may have accidently crashed the hotend into it
[01:50:47] <Lapsus> where's that ragequit image from the reprap channel lol
[01:51:21] <ShivalWolf> Lapsus: when i was 1st assembling the thing
[01:51:27] <ShivalWolf> one of the heatsinks slipped off the stepper driver
[01:51:37] <Lapsus> haha found it! http://imgur.com/a/MjTRe
[01:51:37] <PinkiePieBot> [ ROBO SHIT - Album on Imgur ]
[01:51:57] <ShivalWolf> LOL
[01:54:32] <Lapsus> so long as your printer looks better than that, we can probably save it :3
[01:54:44] <Lapsus> as far as a heatsink coming off, ouch?
[01:54:44] * JustAberrant wants disolvable plastic to be cheap and practical
[01:54:51] <JustAberrant> then bridges like that won't be required :>
[01:55:04] <Lapsus> might have blown a driver but that's not too hard to replace assuming RAMPS electronics
[01:55:17] <Lapsus> JustAberrant: it's available at least
[01:55:28] <JustAberrant> yeah, but it's neither practical nor cheap ;p
[01:55:30] <ShivalWolf> Lapsus: already replaced it
[01:55:32] <ShivalWolf> this was years ago

[01:56:10] <Lapsus> jesus
[01:56:11] <Lapsus> lol
[01:56:25] <ShivalWolf> it toasted bad
[01:56:39] <Lapsus> I haven't gotten any injuries off of my printer except a few very painful plastic splinters while cleaning off a print

[01:57:00] <JustAberrant> mm.. damn
[01:57:02] <ShivalWolf> my printer is probably easily fixable
[01:57:08] <ShivalWolf> i just need an entire new y carrage
[01:57:14] <ShivalWolf> just need to find a compatable one
[01:57:17] * JustAberrant plans on buying a 3d printer once I have the funds for it
[01:57:24] <Lapsus> IIRC y is the bed on the prusa 3?
[01:57:25] <JustAberrant> now that I've got room for one
[01:57:32] <ShivalWolf> Lapsus: yeah
[01:57:42] * JustAberrant more or less broke right now from.. well.. buying a house
[01:57:48] <ShivalWolf> i was looking at afew laser cut plastic ones
[01:57:54] <ShivalWolf> which were a much nicer design
[01:57:55] <Lapsus> JustAberrant: The PVA is just glue like in elementary school and dissolves in water, the HIPS dissolves in limonene
[01:58:18] <ShivalWolf> but i cant remember where i found it
[01:58:25] <ShivalWolf> and cant remmeber if it was compatable or not but it looked right
[01:58:35] <Lapsus> JustAberrant: Give folgertech a look, they're really unbelievably cheap but have good reviews and documentation
[01:59:04] *** Quits: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[01:59:06] <Lapsus> ShivalWolf: The carriage should be compatible with any linear rail prusa 3 carriage
[02:00:20] <ShivalWolf> yeah
[02:00:25] <ShivalWolf> just need to hunt one down
[02:01:02] <ShivalWolf> wood was a terrible choice for a printbed though
[02:01:08] <ShivalWolf> it warps soo bad
[02:01:16] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: well, I don't necessarily want cheap.. I'd rather wait till I can afford a decent one
[02:01:26] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: very least I want one that can handle two "colors"
[02:01:39] <Lapsus> JustAberrant: Any one can, it's just a matter of adding another hotend :v
[02:01:50] <Lapsus> ones that can do it stock are probably harder to find
[02:02:04] <JustAberrant> well sure, but that would see harder on some than others ;p
[02:02:12] <JustAberrant> I was looking at the mendle pro 2 at one point
[02:02:12] <Lapsus> but look into e3d hotends, they even have a one-nozzle one now
[02:02:17] <ShivalWolf> ive been tempted to part the entire printer out salvage what i can and try and go for a delta style one
[02:02:42] <Lapsus> ShivalWolf: I want a delta also but it's going to be a total bitch to calibrate :v
[02:02:56] <ShivalWolf> Lapsus: yeah but theres some real nice auto calibtration designs
[02:03:10] <JustAberrant> either way, I don't even have curtains yet.. or a furnature.. so it's a long ways off :>
[02:03:20] <ShivalWolf> im also waiting on my peachy printer to arrive
[02:03:22] <ShivalWolf> one day lol
[02:03:30] <Lapsus> autolevel isn't a bypass for good calibration :v
[02:03:38] <Lapsus> it's handy as fuck past initial calibration though
[02:03:42] <ShivalWolf> ueaj
[02:03:43] <ShivalWolf> lol
[02:03:44] <ShivalWolf> yeah
[02:04:00] <Lapsus> deltas need to have all the towers and arms exactly alike is the main problem
[02:04:08] <ShivalWolf> yeah
[02:04:14] <ShivalWolf> thats why i havent really gone for it
[02:04:19] <Lapsus> I'm thinking of printing the parts for a GUS Simpson because it'd be super neat
[02:04:42] <Lapsus> but I don't have a brain for the mathematics of making a firmware that can do the translation
[02:05:10] <ShivalWolf> one of the other problems ive had also with printing
[02:05:12] <ShivalWolf> is temp control
[02:05:23] <ShivalWolf> my room is either far too hot or far to cold
[02:05:33] <ShivalWolf> i need a nice box to put around the printer
[02:06:06] <One-Trick> we made a clear box with a heat lamp on the top and a fan control with a simple thermometer to adjust the fan speed

[02:50:27] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> mine is an '88
[02:50:36] <Caerdwyn> how many miles?
[02:50:48] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> 185k
[02:50:52] <Caerdwyn> not bad
[02:50:56] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[02:51:05] <Caerdwyn> just rolled over 210,500 something on mine a week or so ago
[02:51:10] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> nice
[02:51:17] <Caerdwyn> ..poor old thing is due for an oil change again, cba to do it
[02:51:26] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i've seen a few of them with 300+k on them
[02:51:29] <Caerdwyn> ..hate doing an oil change, laying on my back on a gravel driveway, hurts like hell
[02:51:36] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[02:51:43] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> anymore i've been taking mine to have it done
[02:51:54] <Caerdwyn> heh, my neighbor has one that has over 487k on it and it he claims its all stock parts...
[02:51:57] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> >.< mostly because i've not had time or a place to put the old oil
[02:52:00] <Caerdwyn> i have a hard time believing him lol
[02:52:19] <Caerdwyn> heh, dont you have a local landfill around? most of them have an oil recycling thing near the front gate somewhere
[02:52:20] <frackster> Caerdwyn: you can have a car repair place change the oil for you
[02:52:22] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> those old 4.0's will run forever as long as you keep maintaining them
[02:52:23] <Caerdwyn> at least the ones up here do
[02:52:43] <Caerdwyn> yeah, you got that right...I cant kill mine, no matter what I do xD
[02:52:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> just recently i've replaced the ignition coil (upgraded to an accel super coil) then had to replace the ignition control module
[02:53:17] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it blew every cap, thankfully it was right in my front yard
[02:53:22] <Caerdwyn> frackster: I would, but that costs money, money I dont have right now. I can buy an oil filter and 6 quarts of 10w-40 and do it myself for about $50 or so, plus its my "i'm bored" activity in the summer

[02:53:58] <Caerdwyn> my next project is getting the heater core replaced in the dashboard, which from what Ive seen online is a major pain in the ass
[02:54:00] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> before that i was using Castrol 20W50
[02:54:26] <Caerdwyn> the entire dashboard has to come out and the a/c has to be discharged, because apparently chrysler thought it was funny to put both the a/c evaporator and the heater core together in the same box
[02:54:37] <Caerdwyn> so....yeah, thatll wait for cooler weather to tear apart
[02:55:07] <Caerdwyn> some shop quoted me over $1000 or so to do it...I only paid $1250 for the damn thing over 5 years...no way im gonna dump that kind of money back into it
[02:55:35] *** Joins: Kiyiko (Kiyiko@Pony-c9ma3u.dsl.netins.net)
[02:56:08] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> actually you can service the heater core without discharging the hvac
[02:56:15] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i've done it
[02:56:24] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> but the heatercore is a bitch and a half to get to
[02:56:42] <Caerdwyn> ..i'd love to know how...from the various videos and stuff I've seen online, it looks almost impossible, involves cutting into the little black box that houses the parts, etc etc etc
[02:57:05] *** Quits: Asoka (Asoka@Pony-a20nqi.net-htp.de) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:57:21] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> actually you dont have to cut into the box at all, there are about 6 nuts in the engine compartment on the firewall that hold it in, then there are two self tapping screws up under the dash, and a ziptie (band)
[02:57:40] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the heater section with the evap seperates from the blower/baffle housing assy
[02:57:50] <Caerdwyn> no way
[02:57:52] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the heater core is in front of the evap
[02:58:04] <Caerdwyn> oh thank god
[02:58:09] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol ;3
[02:58:20] <Caerdwyn> still, that sounds like its gonna be a bitch to get to if its up under the dashboard
[02:58:21] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> its a pain to do, but its alot easier than discharging the hvac and having to recharge it
[02:58:48] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the heater box drops out, and the evap is pretty easily accessed after you have the main (large) part of the box out of the way
[02:58:57] <Caerdwyn> people have told me at various shops the dashboard has to come out, seats have to be unbolted and taken out, and so does the center console with the shifter, since its all somehow connected...that's been my main holdoff on doing it

[02:59:18] <Caerdwyn> :o ^
[02:59:23] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the only thing that has to be removed asside from the heater box is the bottom plastic under the dash
[02:59:24] <Caerdwyn> someone b&
[02:59:56] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i had to do the heater core in my '84 XJ after doing a motor swap
[03:00:12] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> took 2 days, one day to get the heater assy out, and another day to put it back
[03:00:17] <Caerdwyn> heh not bad
[03:00:23] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the heater core once seperating the box only took about 20 minutes
[03:00:36] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it drops with the baffle assy
[03:00:53] <Caerdwyn> i have the patience to do it, im just worried that if something goes wrong and i cant fix it, i have to have the money to fix it at a shop, time to get it there and leave it, and not worry about having a ride to get back and forth
[03:00:55] <Caerdwyn> :\
[03:01:09] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[03:01:42] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> worst thing i had happen, was a couple of the nuts jammed while removing them and cracked the box, and i had to use epoxy to re-attach the stud to the box plastics
[03:01:49] <Caerdwyn> :s
[03:01:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> WD-40 is your best friend
[03:02:02] <Caerdwyn> aint that the truth xD
[03:02:20] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> just like Liquid Wrench and PB Blaster penetrating oil
[03:02:32] <Caerdwyn> any experience with fixing a stuck blend door for the hvac control?
[03:02:57] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> not exactly O_O i'm still trying to find a replacement keeper for the cable that goes to the blend door on mine
[03:03:20] <Caerdwyn> one night driving home from work, i had the a/c on high and recirc, hit a pot hole, and heard a loud thud and then suddenly, all the air from the face is now shooting out the side defroster vents, and will only work on defroster or def+floor now
[03:03:38] <Caerdwyn> its a pain in my ass....stupid thing fogs up my windshield when i drive now because the a/c is so cold lol
[03:03:51] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> hmm, the lever for it is next to the heater box on the passangers side
[03:04:07] <Caerdwyn> i can hear the blend door moving when i turn the control, but it seems like the vacuum line might be busted or something, it doesnt have enough force to open it all the way
[03:04:14] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> right off of the bottom, the keeper might have dropped (or if its like mine, broke)
[03:04:18] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ah
[03:04:24] <Caerdwyn> ..yeah, im hoping thats not what it is
[03:04:34] <Caerdwyn> the only thing mechanical afaik on mine is the hot/cold adjustment
[03:04:42] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> okay thats actually a pretty simple fix, you'll have to pull the plastic from under the dash to get to it
[03:04:55] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[03:05:03] <Caerdwyn> the actual vent adjustment is all vac controlled with a billion little lines off the main switch...looks like a freaking spider nest of wires >_<
[03:05:06] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'm actually considering converting mine to manual controls
[03:05:15] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> nod
[03:05:20] <Caerdwyn> i wish mine had manual controls...itd be easier xD
[03:05:33] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you probibly hit a bump and knocked the vacc loose at the servo
[03:05:56] <Caerdwyn> ..thats what im hoping
[03:06:10] <Caerdwyn> though, if its loose, why can i still switch between def/floor and whatnot, but nothing else?
[03:06:28] <Caerdwyn> it literally sounds like the door is dragging on something, it makes a scratching sound a bit when you turn it from defroster back to off, like its stuck or something
[03:06:32] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> right
[03:06:41] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> or one of the hoses popped loose
[03:06:55] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i hate that they used the hard plastic lines that are so brittle
[03:06:59] <Caerdwyn> hmmm... any easy way to get to whatever those hoses are connected to?
[03:07:14] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> remove the plastic kick panel from the bottom of the dash
[03:07:15] <Caerdwyn> i can see some of them on the backside of the hvac control thing in the dashboard, but i cant tell where they actually wind up going
[03:07:24] <Caerdwyn> ah
[03:07:36] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the servos are all accessable from behind that knee panel
[03:07:59] <Caerdwyn> and thats on the passenger side?
[03:08:21] <Caerdwyn> ..sorry to sound dumb...I'm mechanically minded, but not a mechanic xD
[03:08:26] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> right
[03:08:35] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> yeah, the hvac control servos are all on the passangers side
[03:08:47] <Caerdwyn> all I see on my passenger side normally is what looks like the other half of a black box, and next to it is the blower; i see the backside of the motor poking out a bit from the dashboard
[03:10:25] <Caerdwyn> ..shit, if this is as easy as it sounds, i may take a look at it tomorrow and see if its not a broken hose like you said, or just a stuck control, w/e
[03:10:30] <Caerdwyn> i want my working a/c back ;~;
[03:10:30] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> generally the blower fan motor is under the hood on the passangers side, thats likely one of the vacuum servos
[03:10:40] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> nod

[03:14:46] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> and in so doing, completely disabled it, so it was filling the air box with crank case oil
[03:15:17] <Caerdwyn> oh geez... *insert obligatory "well there's your problem" joke here*
[03:15:26] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i upgraded the breather line from the 1/4" line he had put on it to a piece of 1/2" hose, and put an actual PCV valve for a chrysler V8 where the little mickey mouse vacuum hose was running before

[03:16:35] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> most peole on forums i've read about they were talking about cutting the flutes in the valve cover down so it is above the "splash zone" to prevent oil from getting into the air cleaner
[03:17:01] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i changed to the old but tested and known to work positive crank vent
[03:17:10] <Caerdwyn> both the little air inlets on the dome cover on my 4.0 are just plastic snap in elbows attached to the air hoses, and all its doing is recirculating the air in through the intake, no valves or anything 
[03:17:59] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> nod
[03:18:31] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> thats the way it was before, it had a 1/8" plastic hard line, and a 1/4 to 3/8" hard line going to the front with a rubber elbow to the front of the valve cover

[03:19:43] <Caerdwyn> way it was before? when did they stop that, because my jeep is a 97 and it has it, and my landlord has an 03 that still does that..
[03:20:50] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> my '84 had a PCV
[03:20:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> as did my '81 Chevy Pickup
[03:21:10] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> and the '84 after swapping in the V6 i went back to a PCV
[03:21:32] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> actually the jeep Wrangler had a PCV
[03:23:12] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> heres my '88 XJ
[03:23:17] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> after i did the lift and tires

[03:26:33] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i dont know where those pictures of the engine went O_o
[03:26:59] <Caerdwyn> hey, beautiful jeep, needs a wash though, good lord XD
[03:27:12] <Caerdwyn> i can tell you enjoy muddin :P
[03:27:32] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol, actually, i went out to go fishing and slid into someones rut
[03:27:42] <Caerdwyn> :o
[03:27:58] <Caerdwyn> you got mud on your windshield and roof, good god how fast were you going into a rut? XD
[03:28:03] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> yeah, someone had been through with what looked like either a tractor, or some 50+ inch tires
[03:28:04] <Caerdwyn> 50? 70?
[03:28:15] <Caerdwyn> oh, one of those ruts...ouch
[03:28:17] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> yeah
[03:28:21] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> think tank trap
[03:28:38] <Caerdwyn> o.o
[03:28:40] <Caerdwyn> nothx
[03:28:43] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> 4Low and rocking the wheel side to side
[03:28:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> took a few tries but got unstuck without needing the winch
[03:29:18] <Caerdwyn> only ever got my poor jeep stuck in the snow one time in 4l and it was because i ran into a pile of snow so high that the front diff got stuck and picked the tires off the ground
[03:29:25] <Caerdwyn> ever since then, ive been real careful of where it goes xD
[03:29:32] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> sounds like what happened to me before i did the lift/tires
[03:29:49] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[03:30:09] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> o_o driving along, and a city plow for some reason had the blade oriented to push the snow INTO traffic
[03:30:57] <Caerdwyn> he probably got tired of being passed by other people :\
[03:31:13] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i just had the stock suspencion and street tires >.<
[03:31:42] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> no, i'm pretty sure it was a new hire to the city, and i'm also pretty sure he nolonger works there, i made an anonymous angry phone call to a friend of mine who works for the city maint dept
[03:31:47] <Caerdwyn> wasn't fun was it? :P
[03:31:55] <Caerdwyn> lol
[03:32:11] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it took us 20 minutes of digging, and it took a tractor (literally) to pull me out
[03:32:26] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it lifted the front end and pushed the whole jeep into the ditch
[03:32:54] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'm about to step up from 32 to 33 inch tires, just to go wider
[03:33:22] <Caerdwyn> heh, when I got stuck before, I ran next door to my friends house and got out a 6 wheeler from the shed and a tow chain and pulled my jeep out...it was the funniest thing ever xD
[03:33:36] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[03:34:03] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'm considering buying an M35A2-D for my "winter vehicle" while i'm rebuilding my engine in my cherokee
[03:34:34] <Caerdwyn> heh cool
[03:34:35] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> though, i dont know how the neghbors would react to a deuce and a half parked in my front yard xP not that i really care tbh
[03:35:09] <Caerdwyn> know anyone that's willing to part with an old 350 that I can drop in place of the 4.0? :P
[03:35:22] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i was actually considering doing a 5.3 swap
[03:35:37] <Caerdwyn> oooh, making me jealous already
[03:35:46] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> but then again, the Renix Fuelinjection system can do forced induction oob ;3
[03:35:56] <Caerdwyn> gtfo
[03:35:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> so i might do a supercharger or a turbo w/intercooler
[03:36:32] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> 27# Injectors, and a 3bar map are factory equipment on some peugot cars
[03:37:13] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> brb patrol
[03:37:15] <Caerdwyn> the next major upgrade of any kind would probably be some sort of turbo...that old motor could use a few psi of boost to get it up and moving again...too bad it only gets like 16 mpg as it is
[03:37:19] <Caerdwyn> ok
[03:37:49] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> OEM specs you can run up to 7# of boost on a stock 4.0, you can run up to 10 with an upgraded head gasket
[03:38:14] <Caerdwyn> yeah, I've been looking at that
[03:38:32] <Caerdwyn> 7 psi would make this old thing feel like it's got some life in it again

[03:58:28] <Caerdwyn> what'd ya bring me? :P
[03:58:29] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i was playing with desktop dyno (dyno 2k) and with just 2PSI boost its an extra 100 horsepower and 100 LbFt torque
[03:58:44] *** Gigaway is now known as GigaZzz
[03:58:48] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[03:58:59] <Caerdwyn> wait, is that supposed to be simulating something, or is that actually tested on your jeep? :o
[03:59:12] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> thats an engine simulator
[03:59:20] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it simulated an engine dyno
[04:00:06] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> adjusting valve timing only moved where the torque came in and where the peak horsepower was along the RPM scale
[04:00:20] <Caerdwyn> 2 psi boost...can i just strap a fan on my air intake and call that a turbo then? xD
[04:00:26] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[04:01:08] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> a friend of mine is actually working on making a legit electric turbo out of a dump truck turbocharger from a big cat diesel and a 550watt electric motor
[04:02:10] <Caerdwyn> o.o
[04:02:21] <Caerdwyn> ..say byebye to your battery life...
[04:02:33] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> we're thinking about setting it up as PWM for speed/pressure control
[04:03:34] <Caerdwyn> oh cool
[04:03:42] <Caerdwyn> come do all that fancy stuff to my jeep and ill love you forever :P
[04:03:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[04:04:26] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'm trying to learn how to tune the ECU on my jeep, currently i've built a MAP voltage modifier to make an adjustable map sensor
[04:04:55] <Caerdwyn> ..I literally got a friend of mine from HS years ago to duct tape a 12v pc case fan to his intake and hook it to his car battery...swore up and down it made his car faster, when in reality, it was actually starving the carb because of air resistance xD
[04:05:08] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> nod
[04:06:07] <Caerdwyn> my eventual goal is to figure out how to deal with valves that dont have adjustable valve lashing, but are tapping like mad because of their age
[04:06:23] <Caerdwyn> ..stupid thing sounds like an old diesel motor when it warms up it clicks so much
[04:06:53] <Lapsus> lol Caerdwyn people are making a killing off of people like your friend selling "Electric Superchargers" on ebay

[04:07:52] <Caerdwyn> Lapsus: that was why I told him to do it...always bitched his car ran like shit, didnt have any HP, etc etc...I gave him a 120mm case fan, told him remove his air cleaner housing and tape the fan over it, then wire it to his battery
[04:08:04] <Lapsus> hahaha
[04:08:08] <Caerdwyn> he came in the next day all happy, swearing up and down it worked, his car ran better...omg xD

[04:28:21] <Caerdwyn> oh hell no
[04:28:27] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> nod
[04:28:33] <Caerdwyn> i'd sooner hack the phone and enable native tethering somehow
[04:28:36] <Caerdwyn> screw tethering fees
[04:28:47] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i was paying 40 a month for unlimited, now i'm paying 40 a month for 5 gigs 4G speeds
[04:28:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> but its unlimited internet, just high speed for 5 gigs
[04:29:01] <Caerdwyn> ..i'm kind of a hypocrite myself for that though, since im on AT&T, but they dont charge anything for tethering lol

[04:33:54] <ShivalWolf> no need to worry about bills
[04:33:56] <ShivalWolf> or usage
[04:33:59] <ShivalWolf> well i sorta have to worry
[04:34:04] <ShivalWolf> as long as i dont go over the 20gb a month limit
[04:34:07] <ShivalWolf> but then i just swap sim

[05:01:43] <tiwake> *assembly
[05:02:27] <Lapsus> the manual is nice and helpful, and also pretty much required reading for the game :p
[05:03:09] <tiwake> I was kinda hoping it was some sort of assembly already in use
[05:03:28] <tiwake> like MIPS or something
[05:03:41] <Lapsus> there's like 15 instructions or something
[05:03:49] <Lapsus> it's really not that hard to learn :p

[07:05:38] <aji> thanks
[07:05:40] <Moonlightning> Gladiolus: /and breaches the warp code in a contained manner/
[07:05:42] <Gladiolus> I went down to 7 to upgrade 10 using the RTM build in the hopes it would generate a valid key (using a valid 7 key), and it didn't. The thing is though, using 7 was fine, 7 is usable. 
[07:06:04] <Gladiolus> I also installed 8.1 on my macbook to get a valid upgrade tomorrow... and 8.1 is utterly unusable compared to 7 or 10 holy lol
[07:06:06] <aji> 7 was the "vista NEVER HAPPENED, OK?" distro
[07:06:20] <Gladiolus> just like, holy goddamn
[07:07:19] <Twilightlicious> I like Windows 8.1
[07:07:24] <Twilightlicious> I have zero problems with it
[07:08:07] <Gladiolus> I used 8.1 for a while and it was okay but going from 10 to it is like
[07:08:13] <Gladiolus> oh god, I can only one one metro app at a time!??!
[07:08:27] * Gladiolus D:
[07:08:29] <Twilightlicious> ^ Not True :P
[07:08:34] <tiwake> no problems other than the 20% extra time taken navigating the UI
[07:08:43] <Twilightlicious> You can use multiple metro apps at a time on Windows 8.1
[07:08:44] <Gladiolus> Two at a time, whatev.
[07:08:57] <Gladiolus> Either way I can't have the settings app in a window which blows.
[07:09:22] <Twilightlicious> Technically that's true, but Stardock has an app that allows for Windows 10 style apps, i think.
[07:09:37] <Gladiolus> why use a 3rd party work around when 10 allows that native
[07:09:47] <Twilightlicious> Thats why i said it was true
[07:09:47] <Gladiolus> also i tried to ask cortana the weather >.>
[07:09:57] <Twilightlicious> i don't approve of 3rd party system-level mods.
[07:10:07] <Twilightlicious> I has Cortana on my phone
[07:10:14] <Gladiolus> woah a winpho user
[07:10:18] <Twilightlicious> sometimes it amazes me, and then lets me down soon after.
[07:10:24] <Gladiolus> do you get, like, fruit baskets from MSFT?

[07:12:15] <aji> lmfao
[07:12:20] <aji> on irc, it WAS an epic battle
[07:12:48] <aji> for a while it was owned by atheme as 'tethys', where the atheme org decided the vision

[07:14:15] <Moonlightning> ONE! TRICK! VERSUS! AAAAAAJIIIIIIII! BEGIN!
[07:14:19] <Gladiolus> ey guys, can i asl you all about a bizzaro hardware problem?
[07:14:35] <Twilightlicious> Gladiolus, have you tried unplugging it?
[07:14:41] <Gladiolus> yes
[07:14:50] * Twilightlicious gets that question out of the way before even knowing the subject
[07:14:52] <Moonlightning> Unplugging things by itself tends to worsen hardware problems.
[07:15:08] <Gladiolus> I have this USB dongle that allows a PS/2 mouse and keyboard to be connected into a single USB port. It works great with my retina macbook as long as I power-on with it plugged in.
[07:15:15] <Gladiolus> With a 2005 powerbook, it doesn't work at all.
[07:15:17] <Gladiolus> whyyyy
[07:15:27] <Moonlightning> “This Ethernet link keeps cutting out!” “Try unplugging it?” “Now it doesn't work at /all./” :(
[07:15:30] <Gladiolus> It's like, such a dumb issue I don't even really care
[07:15:31] <Gladiolus> but /why/
[07:15:47] <Twilightlicious> Something to do with Legacy support
[07:15:53] * Twilightlicious knows not what she says
[07:15:57] <Gladiolus> but it works with the /newer/ computer so wtf
[07:16:14] <Moonlightning> I think Twilightlicious meant that they /introduced/ legacy support later? 6_9
[07:16:21] <Twilightlicious> ^
[07:16:43] <Moonlightning> I dunno. On a related note, when was the last time a Mac had a PS/2 port?
[07:16:44] <Twilightlicious> It's out of my jurisdiction, But that's what i would assume.
[07:16:49] <Moonlightning> I can't remember ever seeing one.
[07:16:51] <aji> One-Trick: lmao this is so cool but i'd be so confused if i wasn't a contributor
[07:17:18] <Moonlightning> Even those old iMacs or eMacs or whatever that came with the plastic shells in five colors used USB for the keyboard and mouse and had no PS/2 ports
[07:17:27] <Twilightlicious> Either the OS on the newer book has a driver the other does not, or the Bios uses some of that fancy emulation saucre

[07:18:49] <One-Trick> yea
[07:19:10] <One-Trick> ill stick to my tiny projects
[07:19:50] <aji> ikr
[07:20:24] <Gladiolus> they never did, Moonlightning.
[07:20:45] <Gladiolus> I bought this PS/2 to USB thing exactly for that, so I could KVM this powerbook with a pentium 3 and have Old Apple and Old PC on the same station.
[07:21:18] <Moonlightning> Gladiolus: really? What did the oldest ones use?
[07:21:21] <Moonlightning> That was before USB, right?
[07:21:24] * Moonlightning can't timelines.
[07:22:11] <Gladiolus> they used an apple specific connector
[07:22:18] <Gladiolus> mini-din or something
[07:22:38] <Gladiolus> It was slightly more advanced than  PS/2 since it allowed daisy chaining. The mouse connected to the keyboard, and that to the computer.
[07:22:57] <init3> "rmmod pcspkr" best linux command or bestest linux command?
[07:23:15] <init3> I fucking hate that annoying shit. 
[07:23:45] * Moonlightning is immediately reminded of Thunderbolt.
[07:24:03] <Moonlightning> Though of course Thunderbolt is fuckkin' overkill for a simple keyboard and mouse
[07:25:27] <Gladiolus> Apple does the same right now but with USB, the keyboard has two USB connectors where the old DIN connectors would be, and I do the same Mouse- Keyboard - PC thing.
[07:26:08] <One-Trick> i wrote a pcm driver for windows 3.1 that turned the pc speaker into a device that could play small 22khz mono wav files
[07:26:37] <Gladiolus> neat

[07:29:30] * Gladiolus pushes deguass on a CRT
[07:29:32] <init3> I had to make sure I forked the process otherwise it'd delay the system setting up routes and shit. 
[07:29:35] <Gladiolus> BYOOooonn-k
[07:29:45] <init3> Damn
[07:29:57] <init3> I'm so sad. I had to throw out my CRT. 
[07:30:15] <init3> I really should have just hid it in my trunk or some shit. 
[07:30:29] <init3> Well, I don't know if it would have fit. 
[07:30:42] <One-Trick> we had a filing cabinet that was full of holes from where we would arc the flyback transformer of dead crts to before tossing them out
[07:30:58] * Moonlightning giggles!
[07:31:22] <init3> Man, CRT capacitors scare the shit out of me. 
[07:31:26] <Gladiolus> same
[07:31:28] <Moonlightning> CRTs…I used to love pushing the deguass button as a kidd
[07:31:39] <init3> One of the best parts about them. 
[07:31:59] <Moonlightning> I remember doing it the first time…and doing it again and being disappointed at how it wasn't as dramatic as the first time.
[07:32:21] <init3> Good things come to those who wait. 
[07:32:30] <init3> My first lesson in that I think. 
[07:32:31] <Moonlightning> Actually, I still don't know what's up with that.

[07:32:45] <init3> Heh
[07:33:02] <init3> I believe it is because the coil needs to charge up Moonlightning 
[07:33:47] <Phase> the voltages you need to deflect an electron beam are rather crazy
[07:34:30] <One-Trick> there was a 30inch sony trinitron that, by the end of the day, you could stick paper clips to the sides of it. when you hit the degauss, they would slide off in a spiral
[07:34:56] <Moonlightning> Ooooooooh.
[07:35:11] * Moonlightning giggles.
[07:35:27] <init3> Ok. Now I want a degauss simulator for my LCD. 
[07:36:13] <init3> I'm looking, and I don't think anyone has made one. 
[07:38:04] <Moonlightning> …damn, the perspective in this thing
[07:38:21] <Moonlightning> > I want to stress again how expensive this project would be. At $20,000 per kilogram, it would cost $5.4 trillion just to get this stuff to orbit. For the same price, you could
[07:38:31] <Moonlightning> > get everyone in the world clean water for 238 years
[07:38:40] <Moonlightning> > pay off a third of the national debt
[07:39:59] <Gladiolus> lol at those last two
[07:40:03] <Gladiolus> water for the entire world
[07:40:07] <Gladiolus> or /one third/ of the USAs debt
[07:40:29] <Gladiolus> which means the US debt could furnish us with enough clean water to last most of a millenium
[07:42:10] <Moonlightning> Exactly my point.
[07:43:21] <Phase> Moonlightning, link?
[07:43:33] <Gladiolus> of course that amount of water doesnt' exist and when you get into such massive volumes of a resource it doesn't scale like that, but lol anyway

[15:50:01] <Googie> Not standard. It's fairly difficult and annoying for the "average dumb user" to keep up to date. Firefox has NoScript, I'm not sure what the Chrom(e|ium) alternative is.
[15:50:58] <Moonlightning> The Chrome alternative is chrome://settings/contentExceptions#javascript :V

[15:51:23] <Moonlightning> 'cos I don't see it in there, either.
[15:51:37] <Moonlightning> I should file a bug report.
[15:51:56] * Googie blinks.
[15:52:16] <Googie> NoScript is a Firefox extension.
[15:52:41] <Googie> It creates a whitelist of websites which are allowed to use Javascript.
[15:53:06] <Moonlightning> That shouldn't be an /extension./
[15:54:54] <Googie> Honestly, 99% of people aren't realistically going to be capable of maintaining a whitelist like that.

[15:56:46] <Moonlightning> …actually
[15:56:56] <Moonlightning> Is there even anything malicious JS could do?
[15:57:06] <Moonlightning> Besides just wasting resources?
[15:58:07] <Googie> It's an interesting question. There's a lot of protections, but the answer is yes.
[15:58:14] <Stik> well, there was a link yesterday about that

[21:26:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> o_o had to redo the distributor timing, it was pointing the rotor center at #1TDC with timing marks at 0 degrees on crank timing mark indicator

[21:27:26] <init3_library> I have no context for this. This on an engine?
[21:27:30] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> eeyup
[21:28:09] <init3_library> So I'm /alright/ with fixing cars and shit so I understand some technical language but I have no idea what "#1TDC" is. 
[21:28:35] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> cylinder #1, TDC being TopDeadCenter
[21:28:41] <init3_library> Ahh
[21:28:49] <init3_library> ok. that makes more sense. 
[21:28:51] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> meaning the piston is at the top of the travel in the cylinder and the crank is at the apex of its rotation for that cylinder
[21:29:29] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> the distributor is supposed to send fire AFTER top dead center thus the distributor is actually slightly behind crank rotation by a couple of degrees so it fires After top dead center while the piston is on the way down the cylinder
[21:29:29] <init3_library> Isn't that exactly when you want the distributor to hit the plug though?
[21:29:42] <init3_library> ooohhh
[21:29:46] <init3_library> I got ya
[21:29:52] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> you want about 1degree after TDC so the crank is on the down stroke with the piston
[21:29:57] <init3_library> Right
[21:30:03] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> >.< or you end up with lots of popping, backfireing, and general chaos
[21:30:19] <init3_library> If not that sounds liek a recipe for a blwn piston ring.

[21:30:35] <init3_library> Neato

[21:30:42] <init3_library> ouch
[21:30:55] <init3_library> No thanks
[21:31:07] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i've even seen spark plugs blown clean out of a head
[21:31:20] <init3_library> Fuck. I didn't know that could happen. 
[21:31:38] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> it was on a high compression racing engine that i've seen that
[21:31:56] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> most production engines even with aluminum heads dont have the cylinder pressures required to do that 
[21:32:18] <init3_library> So this is an older motor then eh? Newer ones having the timing controlled by the computer for the most part right? (I know crank/cam is mechanical always)
[21:32:37] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> 27 year old jeep cherokee
[21:32:41] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> Renix Fuel Injection
[21:32:46] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> timing IS controlled by ECU
[21:33:19] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> but that doesnt help if the distributor initial timing is off too far, the ecu can compensate if its off by a little, or if its close enough, but it has a hard time when the sync signal is out of sync with the CPS
[21:33:45] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> and on the renix system the distributors sync signal tells the ECU where #1 cylinder is so it can adjust timing of the injector pulses since it is SMPFI
[21:33:48] <init3_library> So it's not like a rotating distributor though right?
