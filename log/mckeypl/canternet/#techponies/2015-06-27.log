[01:43:30] <Webster> Dunno. Never worked right for me. I'd suggest asking the developers.

[03:40:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> welcome to systemD pain
[03:48:55] <Seoson> The updater decided to remove my suPHP module. Thank you -.-
[03:49:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats just to help you stop using php
[03:50:12] <Cydie|Insulted> What's suPHP
[03:50:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> its a module that allows PHP to run as differnt users
[03:51:42] <Cydie|Insulted> Oh
[03:51:50] <Cydie|Insulted> How come I never know that
[03:52:13] <Seoson> why does nobody fucking mention that.
[03:52:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> it possibly didnt realise it was in use
[03:52:48] <Cydie|Insulted> It's because I'm not that intelligent at programming etc
[03:52:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> but yeah compatability is a bitch
[03:54:16] <Seoson> Now I need to compile it myself.
[03:54:26] <Seoson> Oh bloody debian
[03:54:55] <Cydie|Insulted> Is it bad that I have little experience to programming
[03:55:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> Seoson: so according to forum post
[03:55:17] <ShivalPonyWolf> suphp is dead
[03:55:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats why its not in jessie
[03:56:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> its been dead for 2 years lol

[03:56:59] <PinkiePieBot> [ [suPHP] suPHP End of Life Notice ]
[03:57:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> so yeah not debians fault
[04:00:03] <Cydie|Insulted> Any free coding sites to learn more on programming
[04:00:22] <Seoson> yeah but there is no need to change anything. It works that's all that counts for me
[04:01:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> if it just works then you shouldn't have upgraded
[04:01:19] <Seoson> I need something that is stable in production. I don't want to change anything as long as it works well. I might look for a replacement but defenetly not now ;-)
[04:01:51] <Seoson> Wheezy had issues with up-to-date software - I needed to update
[04:02:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> suexec or mod_ruid2 are the alternatives
[04:02:18] <Seoson> I used very dirty tricks to make it work on Wheezy 
[04:02:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> suphp isnt comaptable with nwere php or apache apachrently
[04:02:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> probably has a massive security hole or something
[04:03:02] <Seoson> We'll see about that. I don't see any reason why it should not work
[04:03:39] <Seoson> It basically calls PHP per command line. I could probably write a similar module myself
[04:03:56] <ShivalPonyWolf> its probably due to the way apache loads modules
[04:04:01] <Seoson> (Well it does some thinsg to make life easy such as passing the apache vars and so on)
[04:04:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> that changed in 2.4 from memory
[04:04:35] <Cydie|Insulted> Is tutorials point recommended to learn?
[04:04:50] <Seoson> I will need to fix a few more things before apache is able to run. We'll see if it works or not.
[04:04:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> theres lots if you just google search for help on the langauge you are interested in
[04:05:20] <ShivalPonyWolf> namevirtualhost is gone now
[04:05:23] <Cydie|Insulted> I don't like using dumb courses
[04:05:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> that broke all my config files
[04:08:58] <Cydie|Insulted> Any site suggested?
[04:13:02] <Seoson> Just fixed namevirtualhost thing. Also they removed the SSlCertChainfile thing we means even more work for me

[04:38:05] <JustAberrant> :)
[04:39:03] <JustAberrant> Cydie: I don't know of any specifically.. I imagine the "good ones" change frequently
[04:39:16] <JustAberrant> stackoverflow is a really good place for general help
[04:39:38] <Cydie> They might close the issue JustAberrant
[04:39:47] <Cydie> Since it's not about coding
[04:40:09] <JustAberrant> was aimed at earlier question
[04:42:12] <Seoson> Cydie: Sadly no. My Apache doesn't output any error now and still doesn't want to start. Time to start digging
[04:43:07] <Cydie> Does overflow account bugs
[04:43:13] <Cydie> *accept
[04:44:32] <AppleDash> Random thing... Why is everyone obsessed with silent or quiet PCs?
[04:44:39] <Cydie> What's making hexchat won't work
[04:44:43] <AppleDash> I don't care how loud my PC is but everyone else seems to
[04:44:45] <Cydie> Be honest
[04:45:09] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: wouldn't say obsessed, but because noise can be distracting/annoying/over time damaging?
[04:45:20] * AppleDash shrugs
[04:45:26] <AppleDash> My PC's loudness doesn't annoy me
[04:45:32] <AppleDash> I get used to it after like 5 minutes
[04:45:37] * JustAberrant used to not care about sleeping in the same room with several machines (including a decent spec desktop and a large-ish file server)
[04:45:51] <JustAberrant> but after several years of that you wonder what it's doing to your hearing
[04:45:59] <AppleDash> I have 6 case fans running in this PC at full speed and I sleep in this room :P
[04:46:12] <Seoson> I like my PC super silent when idleing
[04:46:22] <Googie> I don't mind too much, but my fan has a rattle at the moment
[04:46:29] <Googie> I can hear it from across the house easily.
[04:46:31] <JustAberrant> hehe, enjoy the pleasant ringing and selective deafness when you hit your 40s I guess? ;p
[04:46:40] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: I will :P
[04:46:49] <JustAberrant> that's honestly what I started to worry about
[04:46:58] <JustAberrant> like.. it can't be good for you
[04:46:59] <Googie> That being said, AppleDash, get a 1U rackmount server and try sleeping next to it :P
[04:47:51] <AppleDash> I've listened to those
[04:47:59] <AppleDash> My PC isn't quite that loud
[04:48:06] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it's not that you don't get used to it, because you do
[04:48:13] <JustAberrant> it's that it's probably terrible for your hearing ;p
[04:48:22] <AppleDash> Maybe
[04:48:26] <JustAberrant> least for me
[04:48:36] <Googie> First time I remember walking into a data center. Afterwards... oh my ears.
[04:48:51] <Colgate> never been in a data center heh
[04:49:08] <JustAberrant> we have a small enclosed space with a bunch of very loud servers 
[04:49:15] <JustAberrant> during an ESSH review they measured the sound
[04:49:40] <Colgate> did they mandate hearing protection in the room? XD
[04:49:44] <JustAberrant> yup
[04:50:09] <Googie> In high school here, you have to do a week of work experience. I managed to get my week of experience at Sun (well, Oracle, but it was still a Sun office)
[04:50:25] <JustAberrant> haha, yup, sun are the loudest machines by far
[04:50:44] <Googie> Wasn't a proper data center, but they would have had a good 50 or so racks.
[04:51:02] <JustAberrant> (that's what's in this room mainly.. that and a huge cisco chassis and a SAN)
[04:51:08] <Googie> Probably more, I can't remember, but it was properly setup as a server room, HVAC and all that.
[04:55:23] <Starthunder> Cydie: language websites generally have tutorials
[04:56:03] <Googie> It's a shame though, I pass by the place occasionally still, they got absorbed into Oracle :(
[04:56:13] <JustAberrant> :(
[04:56:30] <Googie> Still has a bit of a mark on the building where the old Sun logo used to be
[04:56:55] <JustAberrant> it's still a kick in the balls to fire up VirtualBox and see Oracle's logo :(
[04:57:19] <Webster> Yeeeeah.
[04:57:32] <Webster> Thankfully they haven't ruined it *knocks on all the wood*
[04:58:22] <Googie> Don't worry! It's not like Oracle has a habit of ruining open source projects and causing a community fork...
[04:59:41] <Cydie> Can I just use tutorials point
[04:59:54] <Cydie> Python document seems too complicated
[05:00:14] <Cydie> Because you NEED a background of programming
[05:02:25] <Webster> Tutorials can be good, just realize some are bad and misleading. So if something seems stupid, try to find a second opinion.
[05:02:56] <Googie> The biggest thing is just practice practice practice, instead of blindly following a tutorial.
[05:03:16] <Cydie> Is it bad that I experiment
[05:03:21] <JustAberrant> nah
[05:03:26] <JustAberrant> pick something you actually want to make
[05:03:36] <JustAberrant> like, a project to work towards
[05:03:41] <JustAberrant> even if you just do little pieces of it
[05:03:58] <Cydie> I'm by means non-programmer
[05:03:59] <JustAberrant> way more interesting than trying to write a maze solver or whatever
[05:04:05] <Webster> Indeed.
[05:04:18] <Cydie> Are there people programming without experience
[05:04:22] <Webster> Cydie: So learn. Nothing special.
[05:04:36] <Webster> Yeah, all programmers start out not knowing how to program. You have to learn.
[05:04:42] <Googie> Nobody was born with programming experience.
[05:04:42] <JustAberrant> Cydie: at some point every programmer probably had no experience ;p
[05:05:04] <Googie> It took me /years/ when I was younger before I felt like I actually had any idea how to make what I wanted.
[05:05:20] <Cydie> Like you just read the tutorial for not learning concepts
[05:05:24] <Googie> But the whole path was just practice and experimentation.
[05:05:47] * JustAberrant just got _really_ drunk on sambuca with coffee beans in it and that weird mint irish cream stuff
[05:05:58] <JustAberrant> had a splitting headache for like 3 days
[05:05:58] <Cydie> What's with the term programming background
[05:06:04] <JustAberrant> and from that point on, I totally understood perl
[05:06:20] <Googie> Someone who already knows how to program in a different language is said to have a programming background.
[05:06:49] <Cydie> I know every language has the same parts
[05:07:05] <Webster> Sorta.
[05:07:07] <Seoson> So my Apache2.4 runs now fine with suPHP. Only one SSL cert appears to be corrupt and I will need to figure out why. Thats my work for today. I will go to sleep now, bye bye.
[05:07:14] <Cydie> Like python has the same functions
[05:07:19] <Cydie> With java
[05:07:23] <Googie> My recommendation is: https://www.openlearning.com/courses/unsw/computing1
[05:07:26] <PinkiePieBot> [ UNSW Computing 1 - The Art of Programming - UNSW Computing 1 - The Art of Programming - OpenLearning ]
[05:07:39] <Googie> Mainly because I know that lecturer, and he's amazing :V
[05:08:00] <Googie> But that's the whole of UNSW's first semester computing course.
[05:21:46] <Starthunder> Cydie: not all languages have the same featuresets
[05:22:22] <Starthunder> There are some basic things that nearly all languages higher than assembly have, like if-else|for|while
[05:23:06] <Starthunder> But beyond that, there are wide variations in what is supported and where (the language itself vs the standard library)
[05:23:18] <Starthunder> though whether something is in the lang or stdlib doesn't really make a difference, I suppose
[05:29:37] * Phase likes to distinguish between language and stdlib
[05:30:21] <Phase> it's good to know that printf() isn't some special thing, just a function that can be written in c
[05:32:30] <Cydie> I just use programming as a hobby
[05:33:43] <Phase> it's a good hobby
[05:34:28] <Cydie> I don't plan using it as for careers
[05:37:09] <Webster> Doesn't mean it's not worth learning it properly.

[20:46:43] <Seoson> Does somepony know how to add the ssl cert exception for weechat when using CanterNet?
[20:47:08] <Seoson> (First time on weechat for me ^^)
[20:51:32] <Colgate> /set irc.server.<networkname>.*

[21:02:30] <Seoson> Thank you. Used irc.server.CanterNet.ssl_verify as a workaround, but didn't like the idea ;-)

[22:21:53] <Seoson> WeeChat looks awesome (from a technical point of view). I will probably need to make some adjustments to the UI I'm using but I really like it so far.
