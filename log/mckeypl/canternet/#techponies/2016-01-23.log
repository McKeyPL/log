[03:57:16] *** Pony_33515 is now known as Dude
[03:57:46] *** Dude is now known as Pony_85139
[03:58:33] <Gigabit> I wrote the question wrong which confused me.
[03:59:36] <Gigabit> Trying to calculate the diameter of the moon by knowing the 1/2Â° subtend and the fact it's 384 X10^5 away
[03:59:41] <Gigabit> In km
[04:03:26] <Gigabit> But .93km doesn't sound right at all
[04:05:29] <Gigabit> No.. it's 3476km. Hmm, messed up somewhere.
[04:05:58] <HoneyDrops> Law of sines, iirc
[04:06:02] <Compu> well, google chrome is killing support for 32 bit linux
[04:06:28] <HoneyDrops> dist to moon/ sin(90-angle) = diam of moon/sin(angle), I think
[04:06:39] * HoneyDrops has a headache and is too lazy to look stuff up.
[04:07:32] <Gigabit> Nope small angle formula.
[04:07:58] <Gigabit> D=alpha X d divided by 206625
[04:08:04] <HoneyDrops> that works too, should simplify to that as theta -> 0
[04:08:19] <Gigabit> In this case alpha is .5 and d is 384,000
[04:08:41] <Gigabit> But when I divide that by 206625 I get a .93
[04:08:48] <Gigabit> Which is qrong
[04:08:52] <Gigabit> Wrong
[04:11:38] <HoneyDrops> radians
[04:11:57] <HoneyDrops> You need to work in radians for small angle approx.
[04:12:26] <Gigabit> Huh? The book doesn't talk about radians
[04:12:43] <Gigabit> Like we are on chapter one still lol
[04:16:21] * JustAberrant usually just remembers that a radian is approximately 63 gradians
[04:16:23] <HoneyDrops> Ah, I think that magic number (206625) is intended to handle the units conversion?  Blah.
[04:16:39] <JustAberrant> seems to serve me well enough
[04:17:22] * HoneyDrops just uses radians.  They are so much more natural to work with.
[04:17:58] <Gigabit> It doesn't work out though still
[04:18:20] * JustAberrant sucks at math, largely why I became a programmer :>
[04:18:49] <HoneyDrops> But programming is [applied] math :D
[04:19:38] * HoneyDrops thinks JustAberrant should write everything in Haskell :3
[04:19:46] <JustAberrant> pass ;p
[04:21:23] <HoneyDrops> LISP?
[04:24:38] <JustAberrant> god n ;p
[04:24:39] <JustAberrant> * no
[04:24:51] * JustAberrant likes writing actual software that does actual things ;p
[04:25:07] * HoneyDrops replaces all of JustAberrant's hardware with LISP machines >:3
[04:33:22] <wolfyshy> Compu: reading more about it, I thought you just meant 32-bit x86.. no.. it's all 32-bit machines
[04:33:38] <wolfyshy> that includes ARM.. like the raspi, the tegra, pretty much most of the lil ARM SoCs people buy
[04:33:50] <wolfyshy> google really does suck really bad now
[04:34:21] <wolfyshy> I can't really believe that they have to work /that/ hard to make sure their stuff work properly between 32-bit and 64-bit, and besides, they still support 32-bit windows..
[04:34:26] <wolfyshy> and 32-bit android devices..
[04:37:50] <Compu> well the reason is that 32 bit linux devices r a very small user base of google chrome
[04:37:56] <Compu> android isnt affected
[04:38:00] <Compu> nor is chromebook

[12:12:17] <Moonlightning> > When an enrollee attempts to gain access using a PIN, the registrar reports the validity of the first and second halves of the PIN separately.

[12:12:32] <Moonlightning> What kind of idiot came up with /that/ bullshit?
[12:13:00] <Moonlightning> > [I]n August 2014, researchers found that several devices used weak randomization in keys used to authenticate the WPS PIN.[13] An attack against these devices requires only a single guess instead of 11,000, but has to be followed by a series of offline calculations.
[12:13:18] <Moonlightning> > In some devices, disabling WPS in the user interface does not result in the feature actually being disabled, and the device remains vulnerable to this attack.[6]

[15:53:52] <Moonlightning> I mean, don't get me wrong, I like dark backgrounds!
[15:54:08] <Moonlightning> But I would rather have a light background and REASONABLE TEXT COLORS than a dark background and not being able to see shit! :V
[15:59:04] <johnsey> then change it?
[16:01:53] <Moonlightning> how :I
[16:02:06] <Moonlightning> there's nothing in about:preferences about this
[16:02:39] <johnsey> i'm not sure which colors you are talking about but there IS a colors setting in about:preferences
[16:02:49] <Moonlightning> browser.display.{back,fore}ground_colors are set to black on white
[16:03:14] <Moonlightning> and I tried toggling browser.display.use_system_colors and ui.use_native_colors--nothing
[16:03:55] <johnsey> are you talking about firefox UI colors or website colors, where the website doesn't have anything specified??
[16:03:58] <johnsey> -?
[16:04:56] *** Pony_70564 is now known as Dude
[16:05:10] <Moonlightning> The latter, I guess. I don't usually notice it on websites (because who /doesn't/ set colors?), but I'm trying to use file: and it's bugging the hell out of me

[16:05:52] <johnsey> hm that's white background with black and blue text for me
[16:06:45] <Moonlightning> Mine is...
[16:06:51] <Moonlightning> Well, it's not entirely consistent, either
[16:06:59] <Moonlightning> the about:config one is easier to describe.
[16:07:15] <Moonlightning> The top bit (search bar and column headers) is light
[16:07:22] <Moonlightning> And the rim around the window is light
[16:07:31] <Moonlightning> But the actual table, the scrolling view bit, is dark.

[23:09:40] <tiwake> hi Not-Renny
[23:09:54] <Not-Renny> Hey tiwake!
[23:09:58] *** Dude is now known as Pony_82882
[23:10:01] <Not-Renny> How goes?
[23:10:24] <tiwake> throat feels like its going to explode still
[23:10:28] <tiwake> but alright otherwise
[23:10:44] <Not-Renny> D:
[23:11:02] <Not-Renny> Did you try updating your firmware??
[23:11:17] <tiwake> firmware to what?
[23:11:39] <Gladiolus> http://s29.postimg.org/d4dxchy5j/REALPOWER.png
[23:11:42] <Gladiolus> lolololololol
[23:12:23] <Not-Renny> What is this?
[23:12:49] <tiwake> Gladiolus: oh lol... ATX 500w is the model number for a 250watt power supply
[23:12:52] <Gladiolus> a shit power supply
[23:12:56] <Not-Renny> Did you update your firmware to get the throat fix?
[23:13:10] <Not-Renny> >_____>
[23:13:34] <Not-Renny> You could probably run half a graphics card on that....
[23:13:53] <mniip> hey tiwake
[23:14:18] <tiwake> mniip \o/
[23:14:27] <mniip> I am freenode staff now >_>
[23:14:37] <tiwake> oh woah... lol nice
[23:14:50] <tiwake> can you Kline peoples?
[23:15:07] <mniip> I can neither confirm nor deny it
[23:15:11] <mniip> :)
[23:15:16] <tiwake> that means yes
[23:15:28] <mniip> well
[23:15:34] <mniip> all staff can do everything, in a way
[23:16:50] <tiwake> its good to know though, every once in a while some turd comes in to ##guns on freenode and spams it... kban him and somebody else comes in instantly afterwards
[23:16:56] <JockeTF> ... Even replace all topics in all channels with "Alpacas are awesome!"?
[23:19:39] <Not-Renny> This is best idea.
[23:20:08] <tiwake> Not-Renny: best idea is getting that R9 380 video card and protein folding with it for the brony@home team
[23:21:59] <tiwake> mniip: the #foldingismagic channel used to be on freenode, before I found my one true love, Colgate
[23:22:47] <Not-Renny> :P

[23:25:41] <tiwake> my window is cracked most of the time
[23:26:02] <tiwake> its nice to be able to control the temp like that actually :P
[23:26:15] <Not-Renny> Lol
[23:26:27] <Not-Renny> It is really warm in this room anyway, though D:

[23:35:32] <Not-Renny> Maybe I should invest in liquid cooling....?
[23:35:43] <tiwake> "his is a friendly reminder to notify you that your 300 EggPoints will expire in 3 days." what are egg points?
[23:36:34] <Not-Renny> I don't know D:
[23:36:57] <Not-Renny> What did you buy from NewEgg recently and do you want to get me a liquid cooling system?
[23:36:58] <mniip> reminds me of eggdro
