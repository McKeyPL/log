[00:02:53] <Divide|TechSupport> Hmm.  RTFM is one thing, but that's the first customer I've had who's ever mistook the WPS button for a power button.
[00:02:59] <Divide|TechSupport> mistaken*
[00:03:18] <Moonlightning> well, it's often unlabeled and the only button on the front of the thing
[00:03:22] <Moonlightning> what's anyone supposed to think
[00:03:55] <Moonlightning> If it has two curved arrows tip-to-tail on it, it looks like a restart button :B
[00:03:57] <Moonlightning> :V *
[00:04:30] <Divide|TechSupport> There is that, I suppose.
[00:04:43] <Moonlightning> another reason to use a *nix box as your netbox: no WPS.
[00:04:47] <Divide|TechSupport> And when you push it on our modems, it glows red like the eye of Sauron!
[00:04:49] <Moonlightning> You can properly have no WPS.
[00:04:59] <Moonlightning> Red? Bad color for that…
[00:06:49] <Divide|TechSupport> Just a little, yes.
[00:07:01] <Divide|TechSupport> You see a red light on your modem, you start to panic a little bit.
[00:27:22] *** zz_CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob
[00:27:44] <AppleDash> What's wrong with WPS?
[00:28:38] <Colgate> a lot
[00:29:07] <AppleDash> Not if you disable using PINs
[00:29:12] <Colgate> unless it was fixed in newer revisions of WPS, it can be cracked in seconds
[00:29:20] <AppleDash> More like hours
[00:29:26] <AppleDash> And nothing around here has that enabled
[00:29:32] <Moonlightning> All this bullshit has just put me off WPS in general.
[00:29:33] <Colgate> short period of time, how about that :P
[00:29:36] <AppleDash> they have WPS but no PIN stuff enabled
[00:29:45] <Moonlightning> I'll stick with WPA2-PSK[?], thanks
[00:30:05] <Moonlightning> If I want different authentication tokens for different users, I'll set up RADIUS
[00:30:13] <AppleDash> Err
[00:30:21] <AppleDash> You're still using WPA2-PSK if you're using WPS
[00:30:22] <AppleDash> lol
[00:31:22] <Moonlightning> Your PIN is 'Unadvisability Endostoma Abortiveness Distracter'. Have fun.
[00:32:04] <AppleDash> Yeah, no
[00:32:37] <Moonlightning> Well, if I gave you a PIN like 1363, it might be guessed by an attacker before you've used it. :V
[00:32:39] <Moonlightning> So no.
[00:33:36] * AppleDash shrugs
[00:33:48] <AppleDash> my WLAN password has always been and will always be pazzw0rd
[00:33:54] <AppleDash> nobody's cracked it yet
[00:34:03] <Moonlightning> How do you know that?
[00:34:13] <Moonlightning> That's probably way up there in the password lists.
[00:34:19] <AppleDash> Connected clients.
[00:34:23] <AppleDash> And logs of wlan connections
[00:34:28] <Moonlightning> y'know, next to Pa55w0rd and p@sswrd
[00:34:48] <Moonlightning> what, TCP connections via your network?
[00:34:55] <AppleDash> ...
[00:34:56] <AppleDash> no
[00:35:11] <AppleDash> Logs of when somebody clicks on "Wireless Networks", presses mine, enters the password, and clicks "Connect"
[00:35:39] <Moonlightning> …oh, /WLAN/, not /WAN/
[00:35:45] <Moonlightning> see, that's the problem with these acronyms -.-
[00:37:40] <Divide|TechSupport> Not only do I have a strong password on both network and router, I also have my internet access MAC-delimited.
[00:38:43] <Divide|TechSupport> I did, however, have a customer earlier whose network name was 'redwine' and whose password was 'redwine1'.  They were wondering why their network had such extensive upstream usage.  I WONDER WHY.
[00:40:13] <Moonlightning> …okay, what
[00:40:48] <Moonlightning> …
[00:40:49] <Moonlightning> …right.
[00:40:51] <Moonlightning> I'm a derp
[00:41:16] <AppleDash> People are using the #PorteOuverte hashtag right now to offer and find a safe place to stay in Paris
[00:41:27] <AppleDash> Sadly, 99% of the tweets are people tweeting exactly that statement ^
[00:56:39] <Moonlightning> No way to match the /middle/ of an address in iptables, huh
[00:57:07] <Moonlightning> 'd like to reject packets to the outside world from SLAAC addresses while I figure out why clients are still giving themselves SLAAC addresses
[00:57:20] <Moonlightning> so I can still IPv6 without fear of exposing MAC addresses
[01:00:48] <Colgate> "fear of exposing MAC addresses"
[01:01:06] <Colgate> what's wrong with that?
[01:05:05] <Moonlightning> It associates my specific devices with my online activities.
[01:06:06] <Moonlightning> Sure, you can go bother the ISP for records of which customer had which address at what time to see if it was me, but that's nontrivial.
[01:08:56] <Moonlightning> Anyway, are you any good with DHCPv6?
[01:13:18] <Colgate> /shrug, that's what tor is for
[01:13:19] <Compu> why am i banned from tpad?

[03:12:23] <Deathpony> but then I remembered that it was inside the wrapping
[03:12:28] <Deathpony> and since it was in the packaging it'll be fine
[03:13:16] <JustAberrant> I see :(
[03:13:25] <Deathpony> the plasticy thing it comes in
[03:14:13] <JustAberrant> there are limits to what polyethylene terephthalate can do :(

[03:15:22] <Deathpony> it was mild

[03:15:48] <JustAberrant> kidding aside, you have to try pretty hard to actually do damage via ESD these days
[03:15:49] <Deathpony> besides there's marks on the the plastic from the bottom of it
[03:16:27] <JustAberrant> unless you rub your feet on a carpet and specifically touch a contact, you're probably fine

[23:22:10] <Divide|TechSupport> HATE.
[23:22:35] <Divide|TechSupport> If you have a ChromeCast or an Apple TV or a laptop or a TOASTER attached to your TV, that does not make it a smart TV.  Stop telling me you have an LG Smart TV when it's NOT.
[23:23:44] <JustAberrant> heh
[23:26:16] <JustAberrant> that doesn't sound.. terribly unreasonable
