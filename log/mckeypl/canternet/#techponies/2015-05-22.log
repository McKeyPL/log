[22:13:41] <Colgate> looking for something to transmit video from a computer to hdmi wirelessly, preferably something that people can just plug their laptop into and have it just work
[22:13:45] <Colgate> any suggestions?
[22:17:55] *** Joins: sleumas2000 (sleumie@my.little.karaoke)
[22:18:27] <Lapsus> apparently the chromecast extension for chrome can broadcast the whole screen, but that might be too intense for the average user?
[22:18:54] <Colgate> doesn't that require like a google account and stuff?
[22:20:36] *** Joins: BlackCat (BlackCat@Anonlight.Starsarebeautiful)
[22:20:36] <Kinsley> Probably. Assuming it does, that would be a problem for your use case?

[22:23:25] <Colgate> yes, very, it can't use internet at all
[22:24:07] <Colgate> use case is, TV in a room, laptop in the back, can't run an hdmi through the wall
[22:24:15] <Colgate> may or may not have internet, can't rely on it
[22:28:02] <Colgate> chromecast also relies on there being wifi iirc, which is another uncertainty
