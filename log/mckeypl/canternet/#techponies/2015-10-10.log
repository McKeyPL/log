[01:25:00] <Sour_Sweet> ... if your provider allows you to use custom hardware and hands out login data
[01:25:09] <Compu> the modem is a modem with only 1 ethernet port

[01:25:51] <Sour_Sweet> WHAT?
[01:25:53] <Compu> yeah
[01:26:23] <Compu> they do it so they can say they allow custom hardware but they still basically make u rent their hardware cuz its cheaper
[01:26:23] <Sour_Sweet> Here they charge 5,-â‚¬ for /m for W-LAN (again only some cable companies)
[01:27:31] <Sour_Sweet> 5,-â‚¬/m*

[01:29:09] <Compu> oh we get our own IPv4 addresses

[01:29:29] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: yeah but it may never stop
[01:29:56] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: eventually they may just throw entire counties on one IPv4 address
[01:30:06] <Compu> but some companies will never drop v4
[01:30:15] <Sour_Sweet> Moonlightning: I'd be fine if they'd set that as default for everything, but leave you the option to get a dedicated address
[01:30:15] <Compu> since many dont want to bother with v6
[01:30:50] <Compu> only when google itself decides to stop support v4 will most companies get v6, and even then some stubborn ones wont
[01:31:30] <Sour_Sweet> I don't see the trouble with IPv6. All servers I run fully support IPv6 except for rare legacy applications

[01:40:02] <Moonlightning> Compu: Of course, Google can't very well drop v4 until most people have v6.
[01:40:20] <Moonlightning> Even then, providers could probably get around it somehow.
[01:41:08] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: see isps want to spend as little as possible and take as much as possible, they will avoid things that cost money even if its pennies and they will greedily hoard things the get them money

[01:42:13] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: thats why they oversell their infrastructure drastically, selling more speed than the infrastructure is capable of and getting around legal things by putting "up to" in the fine print
[01:42:31] <Compu> "up to" means that it has a possibility of getting that fast
[01:42:50] <Compu> which means they can give u whatever speed they want
[01:43:48] <Compu> and rather than upgrade the infrastructure to handle the speeds they give out now theyre trying to push for data caps so people dont use the speed they pay for and instead switch back to cable
[01:44:18] * JustAberrant ISP doesn't seem to have any ipv6 plans, but one thing I'll give them, I do get the speed they promise

[01:45:37] <Sour_Sweet> My ISP support IPv6 natively ;-)
[01:45:37] <Moonlightning> -.-
[01:45:41] <Sour_Sweet> s*
[01:45:45] <Moonlightning> IPv6 will never be /popular/
[01:46:02] <Moonlightning> middle-layer protocols aren't popular. People just don't /care./
[01:46:06] * JustAberrant mostly suspects that
[01:46:12] <JustAberrant> not for another 7 or so years
[01:46:19] <Moonlightning> The only protocols that can be /popular/ are like from layers one, six, and seven.
[01:46:30] <Moonlightning> People don't give a fuck about anything else.
[01:46:58] <Moonlightning> That covers Ethernet|Wi-Fi, TLS, and HTTP.
[01:46:59] <JustAberrant> carrier grade nat will continue to buy a lot of time
[01:47:06] <Moonlightning> And even TLS is stretching it.
[01:47:18] <Compu> Moonlightning: exactly, theyre point is unless theyre absolutely forced to they aint gonna do shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
[01:47:20] <JustAberrant> most consumers won't care if they are behind 20 layers of NAT
[01:47:37] <Compu> their*
[01:47:38] <Moonlightning> As Long As I Can Get My Facebookâ„¢
[01:47:43] <JustAberrant> you can charge a bit extra to anyone who wants an actual IP for gaming/whatever
[01:48:25] <JustAberrant> but yeah, between the huge number of cell phone users and huge number of people who mostly use their computer for web browsing there's plenty of room for CGN
[01:48:54] <Compu> JustAberrant: they dont do that, the fibre company has 2 speed plans, 100 mbps up and down for about $60 a month and then the business plan for 1 gbps up and down which costs $200 a month
[01:49:17] <JustAberrant> not yet
[01:49:23] <Compu> not yet?
[01:49:27] <Compu> they may never
[01:49:42] <JustAberrant> well, despite all the crying wold, we really are legitimately running low on ipv4 addresses
[01:49:52] <JustAberrant> it's either CGN or ipv6
[01:49:56] <Compu> they dont seem to be willing to change anything unless their absolutely forced to, and in fact the techs get rude when u suggest otherwise
[01:49:58] <JustAberrant> and I'm betting on CGN
[01:50:23] <JustAberrant> sure, but point is they're going to be forced to do one of those two things when they literally run out of IPs to lease customers
[01:50:31] <JustAberrant> it's just a matter of which
[01:50:52] <JustAberrant> and given then you'll _need_ an ipv4 address for awhile anyway
[01:50:52] <Compu> when i asked why they dont support IPv6 the tech got all snooty and uppity with me saying that they dont need IPv6 cuz IPv4 is fine and we're not running out of addresses as fast as everyone says
[01:50:59] * Moonlightning wolf cries.
[01:51:18] <JustAberrant> it makes sense for them to just do the cgn thing rather than the cgn thing _and_ ipv6
[01:51:23] <Moonlightning> Compu: I am reminded of those global warming denialists.
[01:51:30] <Sour_Sweet> First thing I'd do is put cellphones beind a NAT with an opt out option. Imagine how many addresses would be free again :P
[01:51:57] <Compu> JustAberrant: basically the techs r in denial about IPv4 running out and will probably throw NAT at the problem until they go out of business
[01:51:58] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: I think it was my old carrier that required client-side opting into IPv4.
[01:52:01] <JustAberrant> Sour_Sweet: pretty much that.. cell phones are a ridiculous waste of IP addresses and the case majority won't care
[01:52:10] <Moonlightning> I didn't notice it until I realized I couldn't connect to my VPN (server is v4-only)
[01:52:32] <Moonlightning> Either my previous or current carrier does.
[01:52:40] <JustAberrant> Compu: I feel like you didn't understand much of what I just said :(
[01:53:10] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: that wouldnt solve the tons of idiots who would find the switch and get everyone to turn it on
[01:53:34] <Sour_Sweet> ALSO that would (obscurity wise) increase security because of dumb jailbreak users.
[01:53:39] *** ButterBean is now known as ButterPup
[01:53:53] <Compu> JustAberrant: i understood, but a while is not forever and eventually not even NAT will be enough to fix the issue
[01:54:03] <Sour_Sweet> Running an SSH daemon with the root password alpine is a great idea :P
[01:54:12] <JustAberrant> sure, but by then someone will come up with something better than ipv6
[01:54:47] <Compu> JustAberrant: ah u mean something else for the company to never use because "its not necessary"
[01:54:52] <JustAberrant> or ipv6 will actually gain enough traction.. who knows, it's at least a possibility
[01:55:20] <JustAberrant> thing is I agree with your ISP.. it really isn't a necessity at the moment ;p
[01:55:25] <Compu> JustAberrant: im sure there will be a bunch of ignorant ISPs who will go out of business once IPv4 finally dies out
[01:55:32] <JustAberrant> which is exactly why I think it's gonna be CGN for a long damn time, because it'll work
[01:56:03] <Compu> JustAberrant: so they should wait until it causes problems before they bother looking at IPv6?
[01:56:23] <JustAberrant> should, probably not, but it's likely what's gonna happen, and I don't think it's gonna be that bad
[01:56:44] <Sour_Sweet> We need awesome IPv6 only services :P
[01:56:48] <Compu> JustAberrant: even NAT has its limits
[01:57:48] <JustAberrant> even a few layers of it adds a huge tonne of space.. and once you've got one layer, the difference between 1 and 10 layers isn't really much ;p
[01:57:53] <JustAberrant> at least logically
[01:58:01] <Sour_Sweet> How hilarious it would be if facebook decided to go one day IPv6 only. Carriers would certainly switch after that .
[01:58:09] <JustAberrant> you still don't have a dedicated IP.. whether your data gets shuffled once or 10 times.. 
[01:58:35] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: or they would be stubborn and go out of business
[01:59:32] * JustAberrant really doubts any ISP is gonna go out of business over ipv6
[01:59:44] <JustAberrant> they'll all implement it at the last possible moment and it'll be fine
[02:00:06] <Compu> JustAberrant: u have no idea how stubborn some ISPs can be
[02:00:13] <JustAberrant> most of them probably use it internally, it's the customer facing stuff they are adverse to
[02:00:23] <JustAberrant> and like I said, with good reason

[23:43:43] <Moonlightning> Should be 30 days, at MOST
[23:43:52] <Moonlightning> 30 days is PLENTY OF TIME to make the damn things stop rendering HTML from a CN
[23:44:13] <Moonlightning> In fact, I'd expect a //one-day// turnaround for something that fucking simple.
[23:44:22] <Moonlightning> A GOOD project would have it fixed the day after.
