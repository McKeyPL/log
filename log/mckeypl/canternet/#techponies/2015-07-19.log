[01:00:03] <Adelaide> I'm confused what can a class do
[01:00:47] <Moonlightning> Adelaide: /class/ has at least two common and conflicting definitions. What context are you in?
[01:02:27] <Adelaide> The thing in python
[01:02:34] <Adelaide> What is self etc
[01:03:30] <Moonlightning> The identifier `self` isn't special in Python. It's not a keyword. The only thing dictating that it be called `self` is convention (and PEP 0008)
[01:03:53] <Moonlightning> When a method is called on an object, Python passes the object as the first argument.
[01:04:40] <Adelaide> Oh if weirdClass(Lol) is called
[01:05:00] <Adelaide> Then self.wut = "hmmm"
[01:05:10] <Adelaide> To Lol.wut

[01:58:03] <Moonlightning> I take issue with this article.
[01:58:22] *** eyeburn is now known as Starburn
[01:58:24] <Moonlightning> > The first argument of every class method, including __init__, is always a reference to the current instance of the class.
[01:58:31] <Moonlightning> /instance/ method *, not /class/ method
[01:58:46] <Moonlightning> `@classmethod`s take a reference to the /class/ as their first argument :P

[01:59:44] <Moonlightning> > The above command [sic] is same as [sic]: `Restaurant().bankrupt`
[01:59:52] <One-Trick> well, self also deals with scopes
[02:00:19] <Moonlightning> …no, it's not. The latter will always make a new Restaurant instance (which will be discarded almost immediately, as it wasn't bound to anything)

[10:03:11] <One-Trick> its used to keep it from developing oxidase

[10:03:40] <Gigabit> but would it cause the board to fail?
[10:03:42] <One-Trick> err, not oxidase, thats an enzyme
[10:03:45] <One-Trick> no

[10:11:19] <Gigabit> no income, thats why I was hoping  for a "hack"
[10:11:26] <One-Trick> i got a cable that has a small controller built into the connector. just plug it into usb3 and into the drive and it works. only bad thing is the hdd is just exposed to everything
[10:12:30] <Seoson> Oh from those SSD conversion kits? Got one as well. Only have my doubts that it would work with a 3,5" HDD
[10:13:56] <Gigabit> just resoldered 2 connections that looked flimsy
[10:14:57] <One-Trick> got a meter? id check the caps and resistor packs

[10:24:03] <Gigabit> also, indicator led is not lit
[10:24:07] <One-Trick> 200 ohm resistence should show a short well enough
[10:26:45] <Gigabit> got 7.5 off one cap and 3.025 pff the other
[10:26:56] <One-Trick> theyre working then
[10:28:03] <Gigabit> I do know the usb port is really loose when I plug in a cord
[10:28:13] <Gigabit> the third cap is giving me 8.45
