[00:12:48] <Sour_Sweet> I like those hosts: "Unlimited traffic; Except for when you actually use it, which will lead us to suspend your account"
[00:13:49] <Sakura> Yeah cause then it leads to a lot of pissed off people flipping their computer desks & publicly denouncing the companies that do that.
[00:15:00] <Sour_Sweet> Also I don't get why so many hosts ban porn
[00:15:52] * Sour_Sweet pssst: "Porn is so evil that at least half of earth's population is watching it."
[00:15:57] <HoneyDrops> I assume to just avoid the additional hassle.
[00:16:10] <Quindo> There are a few reasons.
[00:16:18] <Quindo> The big one is Pedo.
[00:16:34] <Sour_Sweet> That's not the same as porn though O_o

[00:17:52] <Sakura> Then you're looking at being put in the partyvan.
[00:17:57] <Quindo> It is much easier to just say "Porn is not allowed"

[02:33:43] <Sakura> 2 days with Twitter & not a single Twitter follower. Non of my IRL friends are that active even. :(
[02:33:59] <Quindo> Sakura Whats your twitter handle?
[02:34:27] <Sakura> Not giving it out, sorry.
[02:34:33] <Quindo> XD
[02:34:41] <Sakura> You're going to have to find it on your own.
[02:34:47] * Quindo thinks that is why you have no twitter followers
[02:35:26] <Sakura> I don't have Twitter followers because the local news media didn't follow me back like they did on Instagram.
[02:35:42] <AppleDash> Social media is dumb
[02:35:51] <HoneyDrops> ^
[02:35:56] <Sakura> ^^
[02:39:35] <RainbowBlitz> Nuuuu facebook is life 
[02:39:40] <RainbowBlitz> XD
[02:41:59] <Sakura> Facebook is the what I regularly do most but I don't post as often as I need to.
[02:42:25] * HoneyDrops has not touched FB in... 5 years?  Maybe longer?
[02:43:20] * JustAberrant doesn't use it, but I get the popularity 
[02:44:35] <JustAberrant> people want what social media brings, I don't really think that's wrong, I'd prefer if it was a bit more distributed/private, but as that's not a priority for most (which again, I don't necessarily think is wrong) it's not gonna happen
[02:45:28] * JustAberrant shruggles
[02:45:30] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-lu48ce.lnk.telstra.net)
[02:45:44] * HoneyDrops shrugs, she doesn't get it.
[02:46:01] <JustAberrant> well yes, but you don't actually exist in the same world as everyone else
[02:46:26] * HoneyDrops lives in a quiet, happier world :D
[02:46:46] <Phase> HoneyDrops, something you can do with the systemd journal: journalctl -b /usr/sbin/pppd
[02:47:12] <JustAberrant> most people like to share stuff/socialize/etc, and facebook (and similar) provides a more efficient way of doing that than individually contacting people through other means
[02:47:30] <JustAberrant> I get the efficiency of being able to just post something and have anyone who cares be able to see it
[02:47:32] <Phase> sharing stuff on facebook seems so impersonal though
[02:47:36] <HoneyDrops> ^
[02:48:10] <HoneyDrops> I mean if I just want to dump stuff, I'd host it myself.  If I want to share, I'll use e-mail, call, or even send a card.
[02:48:54] <JustAberrant> all of which are less efficient, and while justified for big stuff, for little stuff not so much
[02:49:03] <JustAberrant> the big thing facebook and others bring is centralization
[02:49:12] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn|2 (Alcoholicor@Pony-bfp.0d7.20.67.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:49:25] <JustAberrant> someone posts something, everyone who cares (and many who probably don't) are notified
[02:49:41] <JustAberrant> it's kinda like rss, except people actually use it
[02:50:02] <HoneyDrops> The little things don't need to be shared.  I mean seriously, no one needs to know what my random thoughts are though my day.  Or what tea I had this morning.
[02:50:21] <JustAberrant> again, some (most) people enjoy both sharing and reading that stuff
[02:50:53] *** Joins: corkfuse (corkfuse@corkfuse)
[02:50:59] <JustAberrant> and from a practical standpoint, I can see the pro's of someone posting something like.. "hey, anyone wanna go see the new star wars movie" and waiting for responses
[02:51:10] <JustAberrant> rather than emailing a bunch of people you think might be interested
[02:51:22] * HoneyDrops would just go XD
[02:51:36] <JustAberrant> meh, going to a movie alone feels so depressing
[02:51:41] <HoneyDrops> that is, if I were inclined to go to the movies...
[02:51:50] <HoneyDrops> Sticky floors and *shivers* those seats.
[02:51:53] <JustAberrant> yes yes, you're social isolation is quite impressive..
[02:51:57] <JustAberrant> * your
[02:52:20] <JustAberrant> most of the world likes to actually spend time with other people though
[02:52:21] * HoneyDrops always has her special somepony to drag places.
[02:53:48] <JustAberrant> either way, I'm not on facebook either, but I don't think the concept is necessarily bad, I just don't like the popular implementation
[02:54:06] <HoneyDrops> I can agree with that, the implementation is the bad part.
[02:54:41] <JustAberrant> I can also see major appeal in keeping in contact with people .. people you wouldn't regularly talk to but still kinda want to keep in touch with
[02:54:54] <JustAberrant> i.e. old co-workers and such
[02:55:23] * HoneyDrops never socialized with co-workers >_>
[02:55:39] <Phase> i actually use facebook for that, but not the timeline thing
[02:55:48] * Phase is happy they have an xmpp gateway
[02:55:59] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: yeah see, again, that's not really normal ;p
[02:56:06] *** Quits: corkfuse (corkfuse@corkfuse) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:56:14] <Phase> normal is for plebs
[02:56:29] * HoneyDrops would rather socialize with *points around* interesting ponies/people.
[02:56:38] <JustAberrant> meh.. you spend a huge chunk of time at work, imo best to make it as pleasant as possible
[02:56:44] <JustAberrant> not saying you have to be best friends with co-workers
[02:57:12] <JustAberrant> but I do think a middle ground makes time go by way better, and I think it does have genuine positive influence on work
[02:57:13] <Phase> or it could be like me where socializing irl is hard and or scary
[02:57:46] <JustAberrant> well, there is that, but at the same time work is kinda a forced environment with an already established common interest ;p
[02:58:03] <Phase> i still don't view posting stuff to facebook as socializing
[02:58:04] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn|2 (Alcoholicor@Pony-bfp.0d7.20.67.IP)
[02:59:33] <HoneyDrops> I tended to focus on work, basically all interaction was in immediate furtherance of that.
[02:59:46] <JustAberrant> IBM? ;p
[02:59:50] * HoneyDrops also tended to skip lunch >_<
[03:00:04] <HoneyDrops> Nah, local computer repair shop.
[03:00:16] <JustAberrant> "thank you fellow employee, maybe I will see you at our next scheduled work break!"
[03:00:24] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: ah
[03:00:32] <JustAberrant> but yeah, bleh ;p
[03:01:05] <JustAberrant> I get some people like that, but like I said, you bury such a chunk of your life at work.. unless it's really damn satisfying on it's own I'm gonna want to be able to joke around with people occasionally
[03:02:27] <HoneyDrops> I hated it XD  mostly I just filtered out everything and let me mind checkout for ~8-10 hours
[03:02:34] <HoneyDrops> my*
[03:03:50] <JustAberrant> alright, but would your opinion change if you were planning on working that job for say, the next 35 or so years?
[03:04:01] <JustAberrant> I mean.. I think you'd be pretty miserable
[03:04:25] <HoneyDrops> honestly I really would hate to do anything for that long
[03:04:31] <Phase> ^
[03:04:49] <JustAberrant> well maybe not that specific job, but jobs that are probably similar
[03:05:25] <JustAberrant> which is really what pretty much most people outside of academics and the independently wealthy do.. 
[03:05:53] <Phase> depends on the person
[03:06:15] <Phase> people are meaningfully different, some are fine with one job for 35 years, some desire it, some can't stand it
[03:06:22] * Phase wouldn't be able to stand it
[03:06:34] * JustAberrant likes variety but I don't need as much as others ;p
[03:07:02] <JustAberrant> I could probably do the job I'm doing for a long damn time (and well, I'm approach 10 years..) because there's enough variety and my role changes enough over time 
[03:07:54] <HoneyDrops> I don't like jobs really, the idea I have to be at some specific place for some specific time doing some specific thing is just unpleasant, to the point it really saps any possible joy out of whatever that task potentially held.
[03:07:56] <JustAberrant> I can probably be a software guy in _some_ form until I retire at least
[03:08:49] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: hah, well most people don't _like_  jobs, but it's not an option for most.. and socializing with co-workers is one way to make it not as shitty
[03:09:02] <HoneyDrops> I'd much rather some setup where I get paid for doing something, after it's done and I can drop something if I don't feel like finishing it.
[03:09:05] <JustAberrant> as is finding something interesting, finding something that pays reasonably well so you can really enjoy your free time, etc..
[03:09:41] <Phase> HoneyDrops, i douno about the second half, if someone's paying you for something they're expecting what you promised them
[03:09:51] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn|2 (Alcoholicor@Pony-bfp.0d7.20.67.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[03:10:15] <JustAberrant> you could do your own thing, like write mobile apps and hope they take off.. but then if you "drop something" you're not getting any money for whatever time you've already invested
[03:10:23] <JustAberrant> which if you do frequently enough, means you'll go broke
[03:10:41] <HoneyDrops> Phase: I mean, I get paid after it's done
[03:10:49] <HoneyDrops> No prior obligation
[03:11:06] <JustAberrant> and yeah, what Phase said, if someone contracts you to do something, even if they don't pay you any money because you didn't do it, it still probably fucks them over due to timelines/etc
[03:11:24] <Phase> you could do contract or freelance work, there's some sites which do code bountys for open source projects
[03:11:28] <HoneyDrops> Like I show up and do X until I get bored, and I get paid for whatever output I make.
[03:11:44] <Phase> i dont know if you could sustain yourself off of those
[03:11:46] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: hehe, yeah, I don't really see that happening ;p
[03:11:56] <HoneyDrops> Sadly :(
[03:12:15] <Phase> ultimately you're given money in exchange for something, you do have to do the something
[03:12:31] <Phase> i mean you can just not do it, then you don't get the money
[03:12:36] <Phase> seems pretty reasonable imo
[03:13:25] <HoneyDrops> I'm fine with that basic idea, I mean I show up to do X, with no prior agreement/arrangement/obligation, try it, and leave when I feel like it.  if I finish something, I get paid whatever that task/item was worth to them else I get nothing.
[03:14:31] <Phase> the great thing about capitalism is if you can make it work financially, then you're free to do whatever. the crappy thing is you have to make it work financially
[03:14:56] <JustAberrant> Phase: sure, but this is why most of that type of work has a contract
[03:15:09] <JustAberrant> because if I hire someone to do something, chances are I need it done at a certain time
[03:15:37] <JustAberrant> if they just say "fuck it" and not deliver, even if I'm not out any money, it still may have derailed a larger project
[03:16:24] <JustAberrant> one of our subcontractors at work is currently paying huge fines because they didn't get a feature working in time, for exactly that reason.. it's literally costing a shit-tonne of money due to hard to reschedule things having to be rescheduled
[03:17:33] <JustAberrant> TLDR: there's more to the cost of something than the thing itself
[03:19:53] <Phase> risk management~
[03:20:08] <Phase> which is what a contract is really
[03:20:16] <JustAberrant> right, which is why there are late penalties ;p
[03:20:17] <Phase> we agree to mutal gain, with provisions for when shit goes wrong
[03:20:21] <HoneyDrops> Anyway, but socializing never made the process any more enjoyable to me, so I mostly stopped bothering :/  Just focusing on the task to finish it so I could go think about other things seemed better.  When I did tech support, I was very quick to respond, but most of the time it was just waiting, which was nice.  I could just sit and think.
[03:21:04] <HoneyDrops> Or draw, or read… I really should read more.
[03:21:28] <JustAberrant> well sure, but jobs where you mostly sit around and do nothing also tend to be dead ends that don't pay well
[03:21:38] <JustAberrant> and to be honest, I'm the opposite
[03:21:56] <JustAberrant> I worked in the public sector for about a year, cushy job that paid well but was boring as fuck, and I hated it
[03:21:56] * HoneyDrops shrugs 18$/hr was not bad for starting out, still in undergrad.
[03:22:16] <JustAberrant> time _crawls_ for me when I'm not actually doing anything
[03:22:31] * HoneyDrops doesn't get bored.  I can get bored with something, but it's impossible for me to be "bored" in some general sense.
[03:22:34] <JustAberrant> I figure if I dragged my ass in there, I want to be doing something worth while
[03:23:12] <JustAberrant> rather be swamped then looking for something to do
[03:23:16] <HoneyDrops> I'll read a book, doodle, think about things (ok, daydream).  Or just nap.
[03:23:20] * HoneyDrops loves naps.
[03:24:05] <JustAberrant> well, realistically I could maybe have gotten away with daydreaming .. but meh, I could have been doing that at home

[19:42:27] <HoneyDrops> While I support the general idea of putting some programming into secondary schools, or even primary.  Programming is not CS, and really proper computer science would be better than programming would be.

[19:46:02] <mniip> HoneyDrops, what do you mean by programming?
[19:46:13] <mniip> writing hello world?
[19:46:25] <HoneyDrops> Computational theory, algorithms, data structs, O(n), logic, proofs.
[19:46:36] <mniip> pretty sure that's compsci
[19:46:48] <mniip> well logic and proofs are math
[19:47:00] <HoneyDrops> I was answering wolfyshy.
[19:47:12] <mniip> oh
[19:47:16] <mniip> :<
[19:47:18] <HoneyDrops> CS is a subdiscipline of math.
[19:47:40] <mniip> everything is :P
[19:48:05] <wolfyshy> I did cover three of those already and feel that hands-on experience is going to be much better than the terribly-written textbooks and snore-inducing professors that focus so hard on theory that you don't even get the point of learning it
[19:48:10] <HoneyDrops> Well yes, but CS is to programming as physics is to engineering.
[19:48:18] <wolfyshy> then when you finally realise you need it, it's about 5 years after you graduated and slept through the class
[19:48:29] <wolfyshy> no I'm not jaded by the AWFUL educational system in the US

[19:52:00] <HoneyDrops> Mostly that the purpose of general education is not about job skills: the point is to foster a populace with the basic cognitive skills to be competent citizens.  They need to be able to follow, and pick apart arguments (in the formal sense), develop and execute empirical tests, identify problems and break them down into smaller units with simple solutions, be able to articulate and
[19:52:03] <HoneyDrops> communicate their ideas, etc.

[20:41:49] <HoneyDrops> Programming is core part of basic computer use, you need to learn it, but between learning some specific system (a given language) and learning the general concept behind it (formal proofs, theory of computation, algorithm design and evaluation), the general is more pressing.
[20:42:18] <HoneyDrops> Unrelated: It's snowing here :3
[20:42:32] * HoneyDrops watches the snow, so paying less attention than normal.
[20:44:28] <Quindo> Why is it whenever I watch a discussion room with Feminists and MRA/not feminists in the same room the Feminists are always talking over the other party when it is their turn to talk?  >.>
[20:46:45] <HoneyDrops> Because they are not using the speaking stick correctly?  Or they feel the concept of a speaking stick is inherently representative of latent phallic subjugation?
[20:47:33] <Quindo> Do not mic everyone live!  Have one person on the mic at a time and give them X time to make a point.  Then let people que in resonses.
[20:48:19] <Quindo> If you are an opposing party and you are shouting "Turn off the camera", "Don't give this person airtime!" it immediatly makes me invalidate everything you say.
[20:48:43] <Quindo> I want to stay moderate, but it is so hard to when everyone talking about the issue are extremists.
[20:48:56] <HoneyDrops> Well it makes you a fail debater, really the merits of the ideas are independent of the speaker.
[20:49:41] <Quindo> What makes you a fail debater?  talking over the other party?
[20:50:08] <HoneyDrops> Good ideas can be expressed horribly and ineffectively, and horrible ideas can be expressed eloquently and beautifully. 
[20:51:27] <HoneyDrops> I was just countering the "it immediatly makes me invalidate everything you say"  It just mean you know they suck it expressing their ideas, it doesn't inherently say anything about the merits of their ideas.  But yes, more often then not, it at least gives a hint.
[20:51:28] <Quindo> yeah, I do not want to really discuss the topic here, I was just mad that BBC was unable to get a hold on the discussion.

[23:57:03] <Kinsley> But...
[23:57:25] <HoneyDrops> I think that as a concept is dumb.
[23:57:43] <Kinsley> It's a difficult and ever-moving balancing act to strike the right balance between giving all players a compelling experience and making a profit.
[23:57:44] <HoneyDrops> You play a game because it's fun.  If you don't want to play the game, then don't play the game.
[23:58:04] <JustAberrant> well, trading money for things that influence actual game play, yeah, I agree that's shit
[23:58:34] <HoneyDrops> If profitability is considered in game design, there is something wrong.
[23:58:57] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: profitability is pretty much the biggest thing driving most game design..
[23:59:02] <Kinsley> HoneyDrops: to an extent, yes.
[23:59:17] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: and that is what is wrong with the industry.
[23:59:21] <Kinsley> I get that games should be about the gameplay and being a compelling experience.
