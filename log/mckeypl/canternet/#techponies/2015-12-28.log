[01:38:21] <PinkiePieBot> [ China passes law requiring tech firms to hand over encryption keys ]
[01:42:28] <JustAberrant> they're just trying to stay ahead of the `mericans and the UK ;p
[01:43:32] <ShivalWolf> thats going to lock chinese companies out of alot of vendor agreements
[01:46:15] * Phase wonders what they're going to do about open source products
[01:46:26] <Phase> i mean you can't go to torvalds and demand luks keys
[01:46:29] <ShivalWolf> counteries thinking they can make laws that affect outside themselves really shits me off
[01:46:42] <Phase> well, you can, but it won't do much more than piss off torvalds
[01:46:57] <ShivalWolf> the US does it all the time but everywhere seems to be jumping on the boat
[01:48:45] * Phase isn't sure what their goal is
[01:49:02] <Phase> it's not anti-terror
[01:49:04] <ShivalWolf> fucking people over as ususal
[01:49:12] <ShivalWolf> creating an even tighter police state
[01:49:18] <Phase> to what end though
[01:49:22] <ShivalWolf> keeping the current corrupt goverment in power
[01:49:26] <Phase> control for the sake of control?
[01:49:46] <ShivalWolf> thats enough for most powerhungry people
[01:51:43] <Phase> it's just such a foreign idea to me
[01:52:46] <Colgate> nice
[01:53:44] <ShivalWolf> peopel with low self worth who get a small amount of power do whatever it takes to keep that power and build on it. then when you have peopel who get large amounts of power they will do whatever it takes not to give it up

[02:02:12] <Colgate> yeah
[02:02:33] <Colgate> oh man
[02:02:35] <ShivalWolf> good luck them doign full packet inspection and running snort properly on a 1ghz processor

[02:03:14] <Colgate> depends on traffic, but yeah :P
[02:03:22] <ShivalWolf> does the processor have the AES instruction
[02:03:26] <ShivalWolf> thats probably what they are talking about
[02:03:31] <Colgate> well, right below it
[02:03:39] <Colgate> it says "Cryptographic Hardware Acceleration"
[02:03:43] <HoneyDrops> In many ways the internet represents a very direct threat to the entire concept of countries.  I mean, how many of us are from different countries?  To us, here, where the others are physically located, what side of some arbitrary lines all of you happen to be is almost entirely irrelevant here.
[02:03:45] <Colgate> so I'm assuming this is a different thing?
[02:04:43] <ShivalWolf> from the doco of the processor
[02:04:44] <ShivalWolf> Integrated coprocessors for application acceleration
[02:04:44] <ShivalWolf> • Packet I/O processing, QoS, TCP, Acceleration
[02:04:44] <ShivalWolf> • Support for IPsec, SSL, SRTP, WLAN security (includes
[02:04:44] <ShivalWolf>  DES, 3DES, AES (up to 256-bit), SH-A1, SHA-2 up to

[02:04:49] <ShivalWolf> • Regular expression, compression/de-compression
[02:05:03] <Phase> >Regular expression compression
[02:05:53] <ShivalWolf> so yeah they picked a processor with crypto functions built in
[02:06:01] <ShivalWolf> theyprobably dont even use them right
[02:06:07] <Phase> like any router soc doesn't
[02:06:07] <Colgate> they just mentioned it twice :P

[06:25:20] <Moonlightning> Yes, the demo world. :P
[06:25:28] <JustAberrant> what is this "demo world" ;p
[06:25:44] * JustAberrant seriously hasn't played vanilla minecraft in a long damn time
[06:25:47] <Moonlightning> It's the only one you can play in if you haven't bought the thing. <.<
[06:25:59] <Moonlightning> It's always the same, as far as I've seen

[06:27:03] <JustAberrant> what is the <X> ? ;p
[06:29:02] <JustAberrant> so wait, you've just been playing the same world that forces you to reset after an hour and a half?

[12:23:11] * Phase found two of those in elemental
[12:23:34] <Phase> REALLY annoying since leak checks don't pick it up
[12:24:47] <mniip> well
[12:24:50] <mniip> it's a minor leak
[12:25:14] <Phase> user-triggerable and with no easy patch
[12:25:25] <mniip> oh?
[12:25:39] <Phase> i assume anywany, never looked inside sno_whois

[12:26:04] <Phase> mniip, what i mean is ircd's stay up for a long time, minor leaks accumulate more than you think
[12:26:30] <Phase> Oh, it's modunload
[12:26:31] <mniip> a find_snomask_slot leak doesn't accumulate
[12:26:33] <Phase> my bad
[12:26:46] <Phase> that is minor
[12:26:50] <mniip> it iterates over the snomasks table looking for an unused bit
[12:27:15] <mniip> so writing that to the snomasks table "frees" up the resource

[19:48:23] <HoneyDrops> (paraphrased) "DRM is the abstinence based model of crypto" XD
[20:20:46] <JustAberrant> didn't watch the talk, but I find Cory Doctorow tends to be like RMS, in that he gets up there and whines about the situation but doesn't really bring a pragmatic solution
[20:21:28] <JustAberrant> and preaching to the already converted doesn't change much
[20:25:10] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[20:32:57] <HoneyDrops> In the talk he does bring up what to do.
[20:33:15] <JustAberrant> does it equate to "don't use any of it"
[20:33:17] <JustAberrant> cause that won't work
[20:33:59] <JustAberrant> isolating yourself from change doesn't stop change, and eventually you'll either get dragged along or the quality of your life relative to others will suffer
[20:34:42] <HoneyDrops> The EFF has a plan for organizing with security researchers, product designers, and acedemics to find cases where the DMCA/DRM hurts society in clear ways and focus on how to get those cases where the DMCA is used to hush people up in front of judges.
[20:35:11] <HoneyDrops> So that judicial review can chip away/strike it down.
[20:35:47] <JustAberrant> well, that's something, but I doubt it'll work either
[20:36:02] <JustAberrant> the people pushing DRM are very good at avoiding cases where they might lose
[20:36:33] <JustAberrant> they want hippy church of RMS types in courts that don't understand tech, and they are good at getting it
[20:36:56] <HoneyDrops> well yes, which is the problem, and he makes that point: those that favor the DMCA really don't want cases to go to trial
[20:37:26] <JustAberrant> well, they want cases to go to trial, just ones that they can win
[20:38:05] <JustAberrant> look at the whole 2600 case, that was the dream case for them
[20:38:07] <HoneyDrops> but things are to a point it's going to happen sooner or later and the trick is have defendents lined up so that the DMCA is forced into losing fights
[20:38:43] <HoneyDrops> once the dmca falls, drm is dead
[20:39:12] <JustAberrant> uh huh, and world peace will be declared and nothing bad will ever happen again, etc ;p
[20:39:17] <HoneyDrops> it's only even semi-viable now because it is a crime to break it, or to even talk about how to break it
[20:39:53] <JustAberrant> if current indications are anything, it's not going anywhere, but it's good to at least see _an approach_ being pushed rather than just talking about how evil DRM is
[20:39:53] <HoneyDrops> w/o that it's basically wishful thinking that math will change to do what you want
[20:40:24] <JustAberrant> I might watch the talk later *shrugs*
[20:40:39] *** Quits: Phase (Phase4@Pony-johrv1.internode.on.net) (Connection closed)
[20:41:03] <HoneyDrops> same as crypto backdoors will end badly, math doesn't care and no matter how hard you legislate it will not budge.
[20:41:38] <JustAberrant> sure, but technical merit has nothing to do with the law
[20:42:07] <HoneyDrops> I know, but when they don't align, bad things will happen until we fix it.
[20:42:10] <JustAberrant> math may not care, but people don't like being fined or thrown in jail
[20:42:48] <HoneyDrops> oh I meant that mandaded access will be utilized by those who were not intended access.
[20:43:03] <JustAberrant> sure, but the response is "so what"
[20:43:17] <HoneyDrops> then again I might not mind global banking nerworks being demolished XD
[20:43:36] <JustAberrant> things already get broken into all the time, the system has evolved to cope with that
[20:44:11] <JustAberrant> someone getting access to something via it's crypto back door will be little different then them getting access via an unpatched server to most
[20:44:17] <JustAberrant> it'll just become something that happens
[20:46:16] <HoneyDrops> A fixed, built in backdoor is a lot different than a simple exploit.  It is one thing to pwn a few unpatched servers, it's another to be able to reliably access entire networks on demand via systems that are mandated to be there by law.
[20:46:55] <Colgate> eh, could just be like china
[20:47:08] <Colgate> encryption is secure, until they ask for your keys
[20:47:11] <Colgate> and you have to comply
[20:47:52] <JustAberrant> mm, that makes it hard to monitor someone unknowingly though
[20:48:05] <JustAberrant> but yeah, that might happen too at some point
[20:48:54] <HoneyDrops> the solution thwere is systems where it isn't possible to give them the keys... sure you might go to jail, but at some point they run out of people to jail
[20:49:36] <JustAberrant> yeah see, most people arn't going to want to go to jail
[20:50:27] <JustAberrant> it's only a small segment of the population that cares about this stuff to begin with (which is why it's happening mostly unimpeded)
[20:50:29] <HoneyDrops> I think once we're to the point keys can be demanded, the difference between the two sides of the wall is rather moot.
[20:50:50] <HoneyDrops> We're all prisoners then.
[20:51:08] <JustAberrant> again, most people won't see it that way, hell I don't see it that way
[20:51:12] <HoneyDrops> it's just how visible the cage is
[20:51:23] <JustAberrant> it's not an ideal situation, but to the average person it doesn't really have a serious impact
[20:51:45] <JustAberrant> not on a day to day basis anyway
[20:53:09] <JustAberrant> you can still go to work, have money, do fun things, have sex with the girlfriend, etc.. most people (and probably accurately) never picture themselves in the kind of situation where they are forced to hand over a crypto key
[20:53:30] <JustAberrant> it only really matters to a small segment of the population
[20:53:54] <JustAberrant> and even then it's largely on principle to protect against things like the government becoming a dictatorship
[20:55:29] <JustAberrant> the response to such a law would mostly be shrugs, not "whelp, I gues life is over"
[21:06:00] <HoneyDrops> yes, but what happens when people start getting fired for whom they sleep with?
[21:06:20] <HoneyDrops> what happens when owning devices raises your insurance premiums?
[21:07:37] <JustAberrant> people accept it as the new way and live within it
[21:08:02] <HoneyDrops> Yes, the focus tends to be on govt abuses.  However, at least on paper they are limited.  Corportations have no such limits, they are almost entirely free to collect and use whatever information they like to get whatever they want.  May it be obedient employees who won't quit under abuse because their porn habits might get leaked, etc.
[21:10:30] <HoneyDrops> Generally companies only want one thing: money, which isn't inherently that bad.  However, they are willing to shit on any/everything/one else to get it.
[21:10:50] <HoneyDrops> and that collateral will add up.

[21:22:37] <HoneyDrops> Really the loss in where you buy your coffee is, on pretty much any rational scale, a minor concern, but the elimination of the idea that others can control how your things interact with other things you own is almost ineffably harmful.
[21:23:15] <HoneyDrops> err... flips that around, the "the elimination of the idea that you can control your things, rather than others can control how..."

[21:50:03] <HoneyDrops> johnsey: it already is pretty much over in software, it is well beyond most people's comprehension that there is no real reason, aside from arbitrary rules, that they couldn't change the software they use however they like.
[21:52:22] <HoneyDrops> The technical barrier to me altering the behavior of any software I use is fairly minimal, even if I lacked the skill set, it would not be hard to hire people on the open market to alter software to my whims.  However, we've created artifical limits that only legally allow the original vendor that ability.  That is the norm, and the idea that limit doesn't even exist (or that it even is a
[21:52:24] <HoneyDrops> limit) just goes over their heads.

I've got this WinXP virtual machine that I plan on letting other users on the internet use. This machine will be network capable, receiving commands from the Twitch IRC Chat from my channel, which will be streaming the visual output of the virtual machine. Twitch's TOS forbids the broadcasting of adult material, so I need a way of filteri
[21:59:47] <RazorSharpFang> Oh shoot, that was way too long.
[22:00:33] <RazorSharpFang> Did that cut off?
[22:01:58] <Unixkitty> "adult material, so I need a way of filteri"
[22:02:23] <RazorSharpFang> so I need a way of filtering the network requests this machine makes.
[22:02:47] <RazorSharpFang> I'm a first-year CS student, so network management is unknown to me.
[22:04:11] <Colgate> firewall it so it can only contact twitch's servers
[22:04:21] <Colgate> and the irc servers
[22:04:33] <RazorSharpFang> That sounds like a wonderful idea, but I haven't the foggiest of how to implement it.
[22:04:45] <Colgate> iptables
[22:05:00] <RazorSharpFang> These sound like great keywords for googling.
[22:05:07] <Colgate> assuming linux
[22:05:31] <Colgate> if on windows, I'm sure it has something similar, maybe, hopefully
[22:05:39] <Colgate> maybe windows firewall has something useful :P
[22:05:52] <RazorSharpFang> Should I make a gateway for the VM, or... Hmm, But I don't know if WinXP has firewalling.
[22:06:10] <Colgate> the host machine is doing the firewall
[22:06:17] <Colgate> you can't trust the guest to keep its own firewall config
[22:06:41] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, the host is a Win7. I'll look into firewalling.

[22:12:51] <RazorSharpFang> I don't think text counts

[22:54:03] * RazorSharpFang still uses password-auth for his webserver
[22:54:18] <johnsey> it is used to secretly share a session key before switching to symmetric ciphera
[22:54:25] <johnsey> ciphers
[22:54:47] <johnsey> it has nothing at all to do with the authentication method
[22:55:08] <RazorSharpFang> Shows how little I know about web security
[22:55:24] <RazorSharpFang> I'm taking a unit in that this semester though, so hopefully I'll learn a bit more.

[22:56:29] <RazorSharpFang> Logjam?
[22:56:43] <HoneyDrops> because exploits now need a cute name
[22:57:22] <johnsey> not really a new phenomenon, but yeah
[22:57:33] <Phase> a DH exchange generates a shared secret that can't be derived from a mitm
[22:58:20] <johnsey> (unless you use a too small p)
[22:58:37] <Phase> is computationally difficult to derive'
[22:58:49] <johnsey> (unless you use a too small p)
[22:58:58] <Phase> true
[22:59:05] <RazorSharpFang> what would be considered too small?
[22:59:15] <Phase> 2048 bit and lower
[22:59:17] <Phase> apparently
[22:59:28] <johnsey> <2048
[22:59:32] * Phase hasn't paid much attention to DH security
[22:59:38] <johnsey> 2048 ought to be fine for now
[23:00:00] <Phase> is there any reason not to use 4096?
[23:00:16] <RazorSharpFang> Overhead?
[23:00:17] <johnsey> no, except for computation times
[23:00:38] <johnsey> to generate
[23:00:43] <RazorSharpFang> Perhaps for the same reason we don't use gigabyte-keys
[23:01:23] <RazorSharpFang> My pentium 4 is having trouble virtualizing Ubuntu server
[23:01:49] <johnsey> alright, time to hear about the current state of iridium hacking
[23:01:57] <HoneyDrops> ooo
[23:02:06] * HoneyDrops hides in johnsey's pockey to listen.
[23:02:42] <johnsey> you can watch the stream
[23:03:24] <HoneyDrops> :)
[23:08:52] <RazorSharpFang> Hmm, thought VBox locked up, but it was just lagging.

[23:21:11] <RazorSharpFang> Can a process listen to a network interface on port X and then connect to that interface on port X?
[23:21:31] <Colgate> yes
[23:21:52] <RazorSharpFang> Networking is weird.
[23:23:47] <Colgate> not weird at all

[23:25:01] <Colgate> when you connect to a port, you open a local port as well, so the it would be like 127.0.0.1:55555 connecting to 127.0.0.1:80
[23:25:03] <Colgate> or whatever

[23:29:04] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah.
[23:29:41] <RazorSharpFang> But I feel all the really interesting and very useful stuff is programming with networks in mind.
[23:44:12] <Stik> the networky bit is pretty done and dusted though
[23:44:38] <Stik> unless you're involved in some low level things, it's just "make an ajax call to this web api, call this when done" these days
[23:45:39] <Stik> all the low level stuff has been wrapped up in such good libraries that you'd never find yourself doing the nitty gritty unless you were just curious to do it for its own sake

[23:52:23] <Quindo> CRU Many to One database interfaces are annoying to code...

[23:54:33] <HoneyDrops> Stik: I could still see rolling your own UDP based protocols for special cases.
[23:55:31] <RazorSharpFang> Well, one of my current projects has me using java sockets, which have been very pleasant to use.
[23:55:44] <RazorSharpFang> I just love the java libraries and APIs.
[23:56:12] <HoneyDrops> AJAX is a nightmare in so many ways.
[23:57:45] <RazorSharpFang> What's wrong with AJAX?
[23:59:03] <HoneyDrops> At it's core it breaks a basic model of the web, where a URI should universally resolve to the same thing.  You can't bookmark the complex state in any meaningful way to recall it on demand.
[23:59:47] <HoneyDrops> breaks most crawlers or otherwise makes scraping sites far more difficult.
