[12:36:21] <Moonlightning> Googie: so…Perl, huh
[12:36:26] <Moonlightning> Got any good guides for getting into it?
[12:37:21] <Googie> Nothing that I know off the top of my head. Just lying in bed at the moment :P
[12:37:50] <Googie> I was forced to learn it as part of a class, but learned to like it
[12:38:34] <Moonlightning> Mmm.
[12:38:46] <Moonlightning> I think I'll be giving it a try.
[12:40:01] <Googie> I can give you some some of my old lab exercises tomorrow, nothing hard, but it should be enough to hit the ground running for basic shell scripting
[12:40:28] * Moonlightning nodnods. ^^
[12:41:03] *** Joins: LegionRed (LegionRed@The.DragonHorse.DraconisEquus)
[12:48:16] <johnsey> some general hints (some may make more sense once you have more background): be wary of whether you use something in list or scalar context, don't use the default OOP (if you really want OOP, use something like moose), @{} and %{} are your friends, map is awesome

[12:51:25] <Moonlightning> Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww!
[12:51:45] <Moonlightning> Using third-party software for basic language functionality?
[12:52:11] <johnsey> well, you can use the regular perl OOP but you'll find that it's a pain
[12:52:18] <johnsey> it works though

[12:57:42] <johnsey> perl oop itself is fairly minimal but still a lot is achievable, if you apply the right amount of hackery. that's why there are higher level systems like moose you save you the headache of this hackery
[12:58:27] <johnsey> even perldoc recommends using one of those frameworks
[12:58:38] <johnsey> see http://perldoc.perl.org/perlootut.html#PERL-OO-SYSTEMS for the details
[12:58:39] <PinkiePieBot> [ perlootut - perldoc.perl.org ]
[12:58:48] <Moonlightning> gods…
[12:58:57] <Moonlightning> why don't they incorporate it into the language proper, then?
[12:59:05] <johnsey> that's what perl6 does
[12:59:44] <johnsey> which is a totally different beast
[13:00:19] <johnsey> i'd personally recommend staying away from OOP when learning perl5 and only going there once you got a good feeling for the language
[13:01:35] <Moonlightning> Ahh.
[13:01:54] <Moonlightning> So, learn Perl 5 first, stay away from OOP, then maybe go on to Perl 6?
[13:02:33] <Moonlightning> on a completely unrelated note
[13:02:35] <johnsey> i think it's a reasonable approach
[13:02:36] <Moonlightning> YAY I HAVE EMAIL NOW~
[13:02:41] <johnsey> yay!
[13:02:56] <Moonlightning> geez that took absolute /ages/
[13:02:57] <Googie> For portability and just general scripting, ignore Perl 6
[13:03:14] <Moonlightning> I still haven't sorted out how I'm going to archive anything
[13:03:20] <Moonlightning> but at least I'll actually /get/ new things
[13:03:39] <johnsey> how do you store mails? maildir, mailbox...?
[13:03:42] <Googie> Perl 6 has had an... interesting history
[13:03:55] <johnsey> AND an interesting future haha
[13:04:03] <Moonlightning> maildir <-offlineimap-> IMAP servers
[13:04:07] <Googie> 15 years in development...
[13:04:11] <Moonlightning> I'd /like/ to get it to do a download-and-delete thing
[13:04:20] <Moonlightning> doesn't seem possible with offlineimap at the moment
[13:04:26] <Googie> Still not 1.0
[13:04:42] <johnsey> download-and-delete? that's not quite the idea of imap, no
[13:04:48] <johnsey> then you should use pop
[13:05:02] <Moonlightning> POP is ew.
[13:05:34] <johnsey> why, if it fits your requirements?
[13:06:22] <Moonlightning> a thing can be ew while otherwise fitting requirements
[13:07:03] <johnsey> well, you can easily simulate the behavior by moving mail from your inbox to a local folder
[13:07:11] <johnsey> (when using imap)
[13:07:23] <Moonlightning> But offlineimap synchronizes all the folders, both ways.
[13:07:43] <Googie> I'm not sure why it's ew. All the improvements of IMAP basically only relate to having mail stored serverside
[13:08:06] <Moonlightning> Really.
[13:08:28] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[13:08:51] <Googie> IIRC yeah
[13:09:02] <johnsey> i'm fairly sure you can specify which folders to sync with offlineimap
[13:09:50] <Moonlightning> But then I'd just have it sync only the inbox, and then it would still sync the inbox, meaning stuff would stay on teh server until I archived it.
[13:10:26] <johnsey> create a client side filter rule that moves mail from the inbox to the archive and you're set
[13:14:38] <johnsey> when it comes to email, you can be reasonably sure that somebody else on the internet has done it before: http://baptiste-wicht.com/posts/2014/07/a-mutt-journey-filter-mails-with-imapfilter.html

[13:35:06] <Sour_Sweet> I love IMAP. Why would one want to use anything else? Being able to read you mails everywhere without worrying about them getting lost when a device breaks is amazing.
[13:35:28] <Sour_Sweet> your*
[13:37:10] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: well, quotas. :P
[13:37:24] <johnsey> i thought you're running your own mailserver
[13:37:26] <Moonlightning> also, privacy
[13:37:30] <johnsey> you can set arbitrary quotas!
[13:37:32] <Moonlightning> I /should!/
[13:37:44] <johnsey> or remove them entirely
[13:38:58] <johnsey> on a related note, i've been contemplating a sieve script to encrypt mails with my public key server side
[13:39:15] * Sour_Sweet runs his own mail server and therefore doesn't care about any of those things.
[13:40:08] <Sour_Sweet> <johnsey> nice
[13:41:13] <Sour_Sweet> I still use the silly browser add-on mailvelope (or something like that)
[13:42:40] <Moonlightning> …uhhhh…
[13:43:00] <Moonlightning> My system is generating `Message-ID`s ending in "@$hostname"
[13:43:03] <Moonlightning> that ain't good
[13:43:16] <Moonlightning> Isn't that something that's done by the SMTP server?
[13:43:33] <Moonlightning> …hang on…
[13:43:51] <Moonlightning> Is that happening because of an `EHLO $hostname`? >.>
[13:44:03] <Sour_Sweet> no
[13:44:37] <Sour_Sweet> This is quite normal to avoid collisions
[13:45:07] <Moonlightning> $hostname as in the name of the client machine.
[13:46:11] <Moonlightning> Which currently isn't fully-qualified, but sometimes ends in vpn.blackl.net.…
[13:46:17] <Moonlightning> which…would not be good.
[13:46:23] <Moonlightning> do not want
[13:46:30] <Sour_Sweet> The message id is either generated by your client or your smtp
[13:46:46] <Moonlightning> well, that tells me exactly nothing more
[13:47:04] <Moonlightning> Does it just vary, or what?
[13:47:18] <Sour_Sweet> I don't think it's strictly defined
[13:47:53] <Sour_Sweet> Both can do so, I don't know what's more common
[13:48:17] <Sour_Sweet> I'd guess smtp
[13:50:25] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah it probably is the SMTP. Threads have different headers (Reference)
