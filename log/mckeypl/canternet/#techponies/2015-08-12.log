[06:52:58] <locodashie11> heh
[06:53:46] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> basicly they suggested pulling the boot back and cramming the wire down deep into the coil, then using a small flat blade screw driver push the wire down untill it "clicks" into place then carefully push the boot back to the coil and LEAVE IT ALONE

[18:43:01] <PinkiePieBot> [ Lenovo quietly installed software on laptops, even if you wiped it ]
[18:46:32] <Colgate> wouldn't that be illegal?
[18:46:52] <Colgate> especially if you never agreed to lenovo's terms and conditions or whatever
[18:47:47] <Compu> Colgate: buying/using the device = agreeing
[18:49:30] <Compu> anyone know a good way to clone a hard drive without a secondary computer with which to do it?
[18:49:48] <Colgate> what if you didn't buy it?
[18:50:03] <Colgate> it was a gift, and the first thing you did was boot into a windows 7 CD and installed win7
[18:50:11] <Colgate> you never agreed to anything but the windows EULA
[18:50:50] <Colgate> maybe you're being illegal now because you're using this software without agreeing to their terms, lol...
[18:51:41] <Colgate> Compu: put in another hard drive, then `dd if=/dev/sdx of=/dev/sdy/
[18:51:56] <Colgate> s/\/$/`/
[18:51:58] <Compu> Colgate: cant, not enough sata ports
[18:52:07] <Compu> also my desktop runs windows
[18:52:20] <Colgate> linux livecd
[18:52:27] <locodash11[server]> use something like macrium reflect
[18:52:28] <Compu> also im not sure if that will keep things bootable
[18:52:32] <locodash11[server]> hmm
[18:52:49] <Colgate> dd works on blocks, it will be an exact clone
[18:52:51] <Compu> im just saying because my hard drive in my desktop has a pending sector count
[18:53:14] <Colgate> so you could in theory, take the drive out, replace it with that one, and nothing would be the wiser
[18:53:37] <Colgate> course it matters a little bit, since different hdd models and what not, but the data would be identical
[18:53:47] <Compu> Colgate: if i got a bigger hard drive how would i expand the new partition to fill the new drive without killing windows bootability
[18:54:06] <Compu> cuz windows does partitions differently than linux and doesnt like it if linux edits them
[18:54:19] <Colgate> windows does not do partitions differently
[18:54:28] <Colgate> they both use MBR/GPT
[18:55:14] <Colgate> they use different filesystems, windows uses ntfs and linux uses a wide variety of filesystems, but that's not partitioning
[18:55:57] <Compu> i know
[18:56:13] <Compu> but i heard if u edit partitions from linux then windows will refuse to boot from them
[18:56:38] <Colgate> I've done it before
[18:56:58] <Colgate> you just expand the partition, expand the ntfs file system, then have windows do a file system check on the partition you expanded, then you're good
[18:56:58] <Compu> Colgate: pending sector count of 117 is bad right?
[18:57:05] <Colgate> I don't know

[18:58:22] <Compu> Colgate: theres literally nothing wrong with the hard drive besides the pending sector count
[18:58:25] <Colgate> highly doubtful
[18:58:35] <Compu> well yeah
[18:58:44] <Compu> i would have it backed up on the old hard drive
[18:58:56] <Compu> if something goes wrong then just clone it again and try again
[19:00:33] <Colgate> very few filesystems can do live filesystem expansions, I know ext4 can, but I don't know about any others

[19:08:18] <Colgate> ok?
[19:09:13] <Compu> can u suggest a good replacement?
[19:11:28] <HoneyDrops|Half> Compu: do you have two computers?  http://clonezilla.org/ can do disk image transfers over a network.
[19:12:54] <Compu> HoneyDrops|Half: no but i just called a guy i know who says he can clone the drives
[19:13:00] <Compu> he says he'll use dd

[19:13:19] <Compu> HoneyDrops|Half: any suggestions for a cheap and reliable 1 TB hdd
[19:14:13] <HoneyDrops|Half> I generally go with WD, as I've had best luck with them.
[19:14:55] <Compu> HoneyDrops|Half: any specific model suggestions? i dont need something very fast as this is never ever gonna be able to even dream of being a gaming computer
[19:17:38] <HoneyDrops|Half> Black is nice of you don't mind the premium, but Green/Blue are fine too.  HDs brand/lines seems to be very anecdotal for some reason.  I'm willing to swear by WB and Hitachi, but I have friends who seem cursed with WD.  Ironically they have great luck with seagate, where they die on me :x
[19:19:07] <Compu> HoneyDrops|Half: i need something reliable that will last for 10+ years preferably, speed is not a concern
[19:19:11] <Compu> price is
[19:19:45] <Googie> 10+ years with a HDD cannot ever be guaranteed. Even 5 is pushing it, though you maybe get a warranty that long if you are lucky.
[19:20:14] <Compu> Googie: well whats the most reliable hdd u know of?
[19:20:14] <Googie> If speed isn't a concern, just go with whatever is cheap, at the size you want, with a decent warranty.
[19:20:33] <Googie> A $500 enterprise SAS drive.
[19:21:11] <Googie> HDD drive reliability is basically an unknown. All manufacturers have bad batches.
[19:21:53] <Compu> well we're kinda poor
[19:22:09] <Compu> so when we get something we need it to last because we cant constantly get new somethings
[19:22:15] <Googie> <Googie> If speed isn't a concern, just go with whatever is cheap, at the size you want, with a decent warranty.
[19:22:24] <Googie> You can't get that with a HDD. It's a lucky draw

[22:09:12] <Vega> bah skype errors out
[22:10:46] * johnsey would recommend looking for a alternative anyway
[22:11:37] <Finwe> ps -e sounds like Solaris.
[22:13:09] <Finwe> Our IT administrator once changed the hostname of a Solaris server to "-f" because of some minor differences between command parameters in Solaris and almost any other *NIX.
[22:18:02] * HoneyDrops|Half agrees with johnsey.  I personally favor mumble.
[22:18:26] <johnsey> mumble is awesome and if you need video, you could give WebRTC a shot

[23:19:14] <init3> So I had some speakers with like zero bass response. Was getting really annoyed trying to compensate with my EQ. 
[23:19:30] <init3> Then I saw their face. http://imgur.com/2ciuDfI

[23:19:37] <init3> Now I'm a belieever. 
[23:20:20] <init3> Quick question though. What I'm using to drive them is way underpowered for those beasts. 
[23:21:06] <init3> But the impedance is right. It's just going to mean they aren't going to be as loud as they could be right? Nothing that's gonna fry my amp or damage the speakers right?

[23:24:18] <init3> I think these speakers are older than I am but they are so crisp. They even have a switch on the back for the high end "Reduce, normal, and full" And since I'm all about that bass I reduced the highs and my god. 
[23:29:25] <init3> But it's only 60W on speakers that can probably handle double that.
