[00:36:21] <Starthunder> The `flags` help says +r allows use of `unban`, which removes all bans matching you, and +e allows unbanning yourself

[04:40:34] <Starthunder> What lead up to it?
[04:40:52] <Starthunder> also, what's with the /emergency/ bit? You need the machine working on short notice, or what?
[04:41:45] <Twinreds> Yeah
[04:41:50] <Twinreds> its my school laptop
[04:41:55] <Twinreds> so i have a bunch of files on it

[04:43:24] <Starthunder> Okay.
[04:43:44] <Starthunder> Describe the screen a bit more?
[04:43:58] <Starthunder> Is it properly white, or light gray? Solid color all the way through, or anything at all on it?

[04:54:52] <One-Trick> i cheated, regardless
[04:55:20] <Starthunder> Shut it down (force if you have to). Hold down option and hit the power button, see if you get anything.
[04:55:50] <Lapsus> Twinreds: I hope you have a trustworthy computer store near you, because if you try to go to an apple store they're going to take all of your money. :p

[04:58:20] <Colgate> if you just need the files and a working computer, I would just get a linux livecd and run with that until you can fix it
[04:58:33] <Colgate> assuming the hdd isn't borked ofc
[04:58:44] <Twinreds> Like 20 seconds
[04:58:50] <Twinreds> its just white
[04:59:06] <Lapsus> Twinreds: Hey, any weird noises coming from the harddrive? stick your ear against the laptop, if the harddrive is just going clunk clunk clunk, you should have had backups.
[04:59:27] <Starthunder> Twinreds: that's assuming a spinning HDD. Is it an HDD or an SSD?
[04:59:52] <Lapsus> I guess. it is an older macbook though
[05:00:12] <Twinreds> Idk
[05:00:16] <Twinreds> i think hdd
[05:00:21] <Starthunder> My 2009 MacBook has an SSD :p
[05:00:53] <Twinreds> I jear fans
[05:02:25] <Starthunder> That's expected. They can kick in way before the OS does.
[05:02:30] <Starthunder> No clicking from the HDD?
[05:03:44] <Twinreds>  Idk if its an hdd i think it is
[05:04:00] <Twinreds> i dont hear clicks
[05:04:35] <Starthunder> Still blank screen?

[05:51:08] <Twinreds> Not atm
[05:52:02] <Starthunder> Okay…'cause I'm out of ideas for what to do with just your laptop. My next step would be to make a disk you can boot it from, and see what's up with the internal disk.
[05:52:19] <Starthunder> If you need the laptop before tomorrow, you'd better see if you can get those things from a friend or something.
[05:52:46] <Twinreds> Ill jist managa
[05:52:49] <Starthunder> Though at this point I haven't much hope for the disk, so maybe also start thinking about what you would do if the data turned out to be unrecoverable (or at least not recoverable on short notice)
[05:52:59] <Twinreds> i just hope i dknt get assignments that require mac
[05:53:05] <Twinreds> but theres macs at school

[05:56:33] <Starthunder> Oh, wait…
[05:56:44] <Twinreds> Mmm
[05:56:48] <Starthunder> Do you need the stuff that's already on this laptop?
[05:56:51] <Starthunder> I thought you did.
[05:57:07] <Twinreds> Ehy
[05:57:10] <Twinreds> why
[05:57:16] <Starthunder> Because it may not be recoverable :P
[05:57:28] <Starthunder> But we might be able to rig you up an OS X system that you can use.
[05:57:38] <Twinreds> we? 
[05:58:06] <Starthunder> #techponies ? I'm speaking in the collective, because even though I'm the only one talking to you right now, this thread is open for anypony here who has ideas or any other helpful stuff.
[05:58:33] <Twinreds> Oj ok
[05:59:10] <Lapsus> Twinreds seems like he's slowly deteriorating :v
[05:59:14] * JustAberrant has no such  things
[05:59:44] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: probably gonna regret this, but what's a Twinreds?
[06:00:11] <Lapsus> Twinreds: Find someone you know that knows what they're doing, or find a local computer place that will deal with laptops, not like, bestbuy or something, but a small computer place that knows their shit, and bring it to them for help.
[06:00:17] <Starthunder> Here's what I'm thinking. If you can get a biggish flash drive that you can erase, and a friend's Mac (or maybe even one of the Macs at the school), you can make the flash drive into an OS X recovery disk. Then, if you can get an external disk, you can boot your laptop from the recovery disk and install OS X onto the external disk.
[06:00:37] <Starthunder> It'll be less convenient than the laptop being self-contained, but it'll give you a normal OS X system you can use.
[06:00:58] <Lapsus> Twinreds: Assume that your data is all gone and make plans for that. Worst case, you're already working on it, best case, you get all your files back.
[06:01:16] <Twinreds> Ok

[14:54:15] <Starthunder> (Seoson): what's the authoritative CVE site?
[14:54:26] <Starthunder> I googled and found a Reddit thing and not much else
[14:55:02] <Starthunder> > PIN and pattern locks unaffected
[14:55:05] <Starthunder> great.
[14:55:07] <wolfyshy> it's only passwords
[14:55:12] <wolfyshy> you can overflow it
[14:55:21] <Starthunder> Well, I use a password. :/
[14:55:23] <wolfyshy> if you type more than I think it's 128 chars in the password field
[14:55:27] <wolfyshy> it will overflow and just unlock
[14:55:29] <wolfyshy> well stop
[14:55:34] * wolfyshy uses a 9-digit PIN
[14:55:36] <Starthunder> …
[14:55:45] <Starthunder> Just any 128 characters?
[14:55:48] <wolfyshy> yes
[14:55:49] <wolfyshy> any
[14:55:51] <wolfyshy> it overflows
[14:56:08] <wolfyshy> the trick the guy did was type numbers into the emergency dialer, then copy and paste
[14:56:13] <wolfyshy> bam, instant in
[14:56:18] <Starthunder> how was that not discovered before now??
[14:56:44] <wolfyshy> the hole was only added in 5.0
[14:57:22] <wolfyshy> because google rewrites everything for every OS version... except stagefright
[14:59:03] <Starthunder> Doesn't work for me
[14:59:45] <Seoson> Sorry I was away ^^ As wolfyshy said you need Android 5.0 or above without the lastest monthly security patch
[15:00:07] <Seoson> I was able to reproduce it on my device.
[15:00:12] <Starthunder> oh wait
[15:01:28] <Starthunder> yeah, it doesn't work here :I
[15:02:12] <Seoson> (Because as a sane person I use a password to unlock my device, not some weird finger swipe)
[15:03:05] <Starthunder> Yeah, it was over 128 chars
[15:03:06] <Seoson> Luckily this does of cause not affect my device's boot up procedure due to device encryption.
[15:03:19] <Starthunder> apparently the pasteboard carried over
[15:03:48] <Starthunder> So I just pasted into vim to check. 195 chars.
[15:03:56] <Starthunder> And it said /wrong password/
[15:04:29] <Seoson> You'd think that if the lock app crashes you'd be put to a blackscreen until it starts again, but nope straight to the launcher :P
[15:08:22] <firestream_laptop> well i got teamspeak working with a plugin that lets you use your webcam :D
[15:10:29] <Seoson> TS is a two sided thing for me. I love it and use it everyday, but the software underneath is horrible

[15:18:39] <firestream_laptop> let me pm you one of them
[15:18:52] <Seoson> Waiting :P
[15:25:19] <Starthunder> Yeah I can't reproduce it
[15:25:54] <Starthunder> I started with an ~8000 char string and duplicated it in the emergency dialer several times, but I still got the copy and paste options
[15:26:35] <Starthunder> Trying to paste what I have into Keep gives a toast saying /Note too large/
[15:28:14] <Starthunder> vim crashes instantly if I try to put it
[15:31:08] <Starthunder> So…lock screen, camera, quick toggles, bettings button…
[15:31:25] <Starthunder> That gives me a password prompt (which I can't get a keyboard for, try as I might)
[15:31:36] <Starthunder> pasting the massive string into there three or four times does…nothing.
[15:31:43] <Starthunder> Bit of lag, sure, but otherwise nothing
[15:32:26] <Starthunder> oh o.o
[15:34:24] <Starthunder> Wow, glitchy
[15:36:32] <Starthunder> After four pastes, it glitches out
[15:36:50] <Starthunder> The bar at the bottom with the three buttons disappears, reappears, and disappears again
[15:37:07] <Starthunder> Then it fades to wallpaper, and back
[15:37:18] <Starthunder> Aaaand now I'mlooking at all my photos :|
[15:37:23] <Starthunder> No status bar
[15:37:47] <Starthunder> Tried to swipe from the top, got the lockscreen again, and it seems fine this time

[16:29:32] <Starthunder> …hmmmm
[16:29:52] <Starthunder> What about all the phone-y things though
[16:36:12] <Starthunder> Unrelated: given a timestamp, how do I tell if it's from one of those DST overlappy periods?
[16:38:04] <Seoson> Timestamps should have no conflicts if I recall correctly
[16:39:54] <Seoson> They are by definition "only" a counter since 01.01.1970 in seconds. No number is issued twice or skipped.
[16:41:33] <Starthunder> Well, these are formatted, and in local time
[16:41:50] <Starthunder> also, leap seconds are skipped, aren't they? >.>
[16:43:45] <Seoson> I'd have to look into the standard, but I don't think so. When I say timestamp I always mean the integer number - no format at all
[16:44:52] <Starthunder> Okay, okay
[16:45:04] <Starthunder> given a date and time, how do I tell if it's from one of those DST overlappy periods?
[16:45:58] <Seoson> Just for the record: Unix timestamps just keep counting for leap seconds - I looked it up
[16:46:51] <Seoson> I'd imagine that depends on your environment
[16:48:03] <Seoson> They definition of DST is not very machine friendly.
[16:49:16] <Seoson> It begins on the last Sunday in March at 2:00 jumping to 3:00

[16:50:06] *** GigaZzz is now known as Soarin
[16:50:10] <Starthunder> So…I guess I can just compile a list of Last Sundays In March going back a decade or so and check dates against those?
[16:50:42] <Seoson> It ends on the last Sunday of October  jumping from 3:00 to 2:00 again
[16:50:57] <Soarin> DST is stupid
[16:51:09] <Seoson> Yeah, but I'd use a system library if possible
[16:51:29] <Starthunder> There are libraries that have is_dst_overlap()s?
[16:51:30] <Seoson> If things change in the future you can mess up very easily.
[16:51:36] <Starthunder> This is a oneshot thing.
[16:52:32] <Seoson> I personally avoid all of those things by simply using UNIX timestamps :D
[16:53:31] <Starthunder> …y'know…maybe I should've had the transcript timestamp format be '%s %F %T'

[18:12:46] <Seoson> Nope
[18:12:59] <Seoson> Everything routed through DTAG went out
[18:13:08] <Seoson> My home connection was useless
[18:13:12] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ouch
[18:13:21] <Seoson> Hetzner was still reachable through other German ISPs
[18:14:00] <Seoson> Just most of their transit traffic is routed through DTAG, since they are a Tier 1 provider

[18:15:34] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> for a second there i thought i got disconnected because my mifi hotspot was saying no connected users

[20:06:51] <Seoson> DTAG backbones have again a massive overload. YT streaming almost impossible on my end atm. Only a matter of time until it fails again.
[20:10:07] * Student-QRS eats Seoson fibre
[20:10:17] <Seoson> Let's see if I can find an inner German VPN to get my transit traffic routed over Level 3 or something.
[20:11:49] <Seoson> It's frustrating to have a 50 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up connection (uncapped, actually arrives not just what I pay for) if you cannot use it correctly
[20:15:21] <Vegafk> Seoson, I agree and not trying to say its worse off pissing contest, but it does suck a bit more with up to 5 down and up to 3.5 up
[20:15:30] <Vegafk> :P
[20:16:32] <Seoson> Can you watch a YT video in 140p? Well I can't atm. Do the math what that actually means
[20:16:58] <Vegafk> I cannot either right now. constantly buffers. 
[20:17:02] <Seoson> My transit downstream is well beyond 1 Mbps atm
[20:17:25] <Vegafk> albeit, some days it works great. Others it is better off to have someone mail me the video
[20:17:28] * Student-QRS gives Vegafk and Seoson massagies
[20:17:42] * Vegafk could go for one right nowe
[20:17:44] <Seoson> *g* Vegafk
[20:18:02] <Vegafk> g?
[20:18:36] <Seoson> short fot frustrating
[20:18:38] <Seoson> for*
[20:18:47] <Vegafk> ooh, I did not know that.
[20:18:48] <Seoson> NO wrong again
[20:19:13] <Seoson> giggling = *g* my shortcut played a bad game with me
[20:19:52] <Seoson> But yeah also frustrating :P
[20:20:45] <wolfyshy> I read that as "short, fat, frustrating"
[20:20:51] <wolfyshy> which accurately describes most telecos
[20:22:28] <Vegafk> I must say.. I love the weather app in win10
[20:22:50] <Seoson> Yeah they are old, some of them have a monopoly and basically they can go fuck themselves.
[20:25:35] <Seoson> The only other sane option I have here would be to use a (tv) cable company. Sadly all them think Dual-Stack Lite is a good idea.
[20:25:54] <Seoson> all of*
[20:26:29] <Compu> Seoson: im using one
[20:26:52] <Compu> 20 Mbps down and like 2 Mbps up
[20:26:56] <Compu> $40 a month
[20:27:59] <Seoson> I'd get 200 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up no problem, but DS-Lite is a no go for me.
[20:28:27] <Seoson> Hell they are even preparing 500 Mbps down in some regions atm.
[20:30:40] <Seoson> From a price point of view that's about the same what I'm paying currently Compu (inc. phone flatrate, no TV)

[20:31:39] <Compu> Seoson: whats DS-lite
[20:31:56] <Compu> Seoson: and that price is for internet only for me, no other services
[20:32:31] <Seoson> You have a dedicated IPv6 subnet, but not dedicated IPv4 address. Your IPv4 address is shared with many other people.
[20:32:59] <Seoson> All IPv4 traffic is routed through a gateaway at your provider.
[20:33:21] <Compu> ah
[20:33:28] <Compu> we dont have that
[20:33:47] <Seoson> You are in the U.S.?
[20:33:58] <Compu> we have 1 IPv4 address for the entire network and then IPv6 addresses for each device
[20:34:00] <JustAberrant> :)
[20:34:03] <Compu> Seoson: yes
[20:35:02] <Seoson> Yeah that's called Dual-Stack and exactly what I have now.
[20:35:27] <Seoson> ... some say native dual-stack ....
[20:36:09] <Compu> i run my website over it
[20:36:16] <Compu> http://www.compu.ml/
[20:36:18] <PinkiePieBot> [ Compu's Website ]
[20:37:04] <Seoson> Yeah sadly I have no static IPv4 address. My website (and a few other things such as WeeChat) or hosted in a data center
[20:37:40] <Seoson> I can't even load your website properly -.-
[20:38:33] <Seoson> Now it works
[20:38:45] <Compu> mmm
[20:39:09] <Compu> i also run a mumble server, an ftp server, and my irc bot
[20:40:07] <Seoson> or = are* Good lord I'm sleepy :D
[20:42:22] <Seoson> why .ml as your TLD? Is it one of those free domains?
[20:43:51] <Colgate> yes it is
[20:44:25] <JustAberrant> .ml is the new .tk ?
[20:44:30] <JustAberrant> actually is .tk still a thing'
[20:45:27] <Seoson> If .TK didn't come with silly terms I'd actually welcome the idea.
[20:45:42] <Compu> Seoson: silly terms?
[20:46:01] <JustAberrant> meh, considering how cheap you can get a real domain.. like.. $6 a year-ish if you hunt around
[20:46:39] <Compu> JustAberrant: we often cant afford things
[20:46:42] <Seoson> At least it used to be the case that if you didn't login with their site each X days the domains is suspended.
[20:46:45] * JustAberrant remembers .tk domains that were web redirects to geocities pages :>
[20:46:53] <Colgate> yeah, .ml is like .tk
[20:47:29] <Colgate> *.ml will probably be on blacklists soon :P
[20:47:32] <Colgate> if not already
[20:47:50] <JustAberrant> hehe
[20:47:56] <JustAberrant> yeah
[20:48:01] <Compu> why?
[20:48:11] <JustAberrant> pretty sure any email from a .tk domain is immediately assumed spam at this point
[20:48:14] <JustAberrant> .ml will soon follow
[20:48:24] <Colgate> because free domains == haven for spammers
[20:48:35] <Seoson> Cheapest domain I can get my hands on used to be .de domains for about 0.15 €/m
[20:48:36] <Compu> so basically fuck people who cant afford shit
[20:48:40] <Compu> i see
[20:48:45] <JustAberrant> Compu: well, it's pretty much guarenteed spammers will use the domains
[20:48:47] <Colgate> 10$/year is.... nothing
[20:48:57] <Seoson> maybe .20 but they are VERY very cheap
[20:48:59] <Compu> Colgate: to u maybe
[20:49:06] <Colgate> to anybody who is running a server
[20:49:15] <JustAberrant> it's not nothing, but if you've got a place to host a website it shouldn't be that infeasible
[20:49:21] <Colgate> hell, a single ipv4 address costs more than that
[20:49:49] <Compu> Colgate: to anybody? im running a server and $10 is not nothing to me
[20:49:57] <Seoson> Consider my server is a cheap model for 49,-€/m domains are in comparison still nothing
[20:49:57] <Compu> we're on a very tight budget here
[20:50:36] <Colgate> like, the cheapest servers you can get that still have ipv4 connectivity not-nated is like, 15$/year
[20:50:49] <JustAberrant> fair enough, but it's almost universal that free is rarely good
[20:50:53] <Compu> Colgate: my server is in my room
[20:51:03] <Colgate> electricity costs then
[20:51:27] <Compu> not much
[20:51:27] <Colgate> also rent
[20:51:27] <Compu> we're already paying rent so that doesnt really count
[20:51:27] <Seoson> Yeah I'd imagine you get higher than 15$ this way.
[20:51:35] <Compu> we would still be paying rent without the server
[20:51:48] <Colgate> internet service
[20:52:02] <Colgate> which is probably on a dynamic IP range anyways
[20:52:11] <Colgate> which means terrible for hosting
[20:52:18] <Seoson> And bandwidth is a problem
[20:52:33] <Seoson> Not even getting into mails from a dialup range
[20:52:39] <Seoson> Oh and rDNS
[20:52:47] <Colgate> hosting a mail server on a dynamic range isn't going to work at all
[20:52:58] <Colgate> all of those are blacklisted so hard
[20:53:02] <Compu> Colgate: sticky dynamic
[20:53:02] <JustAberrant> even if you get a real domain, IP ranges from consumer ISPs tend to be blacklisted
[20:53:09] <Seoson> Maybe if your ISP offers a smartrelay
[20:53:10] <Colgate> sticky dynamic? uhhhhhhhh
[20:53:13] <Compu> my ip rarely ever changes
[20:53:18] <Colgate> still a dynamic range
[20:53:21] <Compu> like maybe once a year it changes
[20:53:25] <Colgate> still a dynamic range
[20:53:31] <JustAberrant> because few consumers run their own outgoing mail, so almost all mail coming from a consumer ISP range is going to be people with infected machines spamming
[20:53:40] <Compu> not as much hassle and its either that or no server
[20:53:43] <Colgate> my isp blocks outgoing port 25 anyways
[20:53:51] <JustAberrant> static/dynamic doesn't matter, it's what it's allocated for
[20:53:52] <Colgate> so I couldn't run a mailserver if I wanted to
[20:54:12] <Compu> my isp doesnt block any ports as far as i know
[20:54:16] <JustAberrant> hehe, mine actually doesn't, but if I send a mail to my gmail from my IP it goes to spam
[20:54:25] <Seoson> Luckily mine does not :P I'd give them a hard time for such things. I want my traffic to be unaltered
[20:54:44] <Compu> Seoson: and what would giving them a hard time do?
[20:54:58] <Compu> they have to give a fuck in the first place for it to do anything
[20:55:29] <Seoson> I did get discounts on several cases. when my internet once again fails I call them and get a discount :D
[20:55:44] <Compu> i could switch to fiber internet but it would cost $20 more and the local fiber service has pretty much a hate campaign against IPv6
[20:55:48] <Seoson> Even if it's only for an hour or so
[20:55:58] <johnsey> Season doesn't live in the US I think, where the choice of ISP is a bit more limited and it's harder to threaten with changing providers
[20:55:58] <Colgate> the biggest problem with free domains is the lack of accountability
[20:56:06] <Colgate> you can just dump in whatever details you want for whois
[20:56:10] <Compu> Seoson: bwahahahaha discounts
[20:56:17] <Colgate> and without even payment info, no way of verifying
[20:56:34] <Seoson> johnsey: Yeah. However there is not much choice here either. Most ISP are reselling
[20:56:56] <Compu> Seoson: for most ISPs in the US ur bill could easily go up when an outage happens because they dont give a fuck because most of them have virtual monopolies for their areas
[20:57:12] <johnsey> Seoson: it's still much better than in the US
[20:57:12] <Compu> ur bill can go up for just existing
[20:57:36] <johnsey> of course, it's not perfect either
[20:58:28] <Seoson> At least we have our Bundesnetzagentur that is closely watching the ex monopolists
[20:58:37] <Compu> hell sometimes ur bill will go up just because the ISP says so
[20:58:37] <Seoson> So they can't do what they want
[20:59:06] <Compu> Seoson: oh we're supposed to have that but the companies like to pay off the government so that never happens

[21:01:02] <JustAberrant> C 2001-2002
[21:01:05] <JustAberrant> yeahhh
[21:01:19] * Starthunder still needs a domain. Wants a .net one.
[21:01:45] * JustAberrant has several domains :(
[21:01:50] <JustAberrant> no .net though
[21:02:04] <init3> Maybe I should just offer to drop it off at that address they list. It is only like 15 minutes away. 
[21:02:11] <Starthunder> You can't possibly get a .net domain for $10/year, can you.
[21:02:20] * Starthunder would do that in a heartbeat.
[21:02:21] <init3> Oh yeah
[21:02:23] <Seoson> My ISP (which is a DTAG reseller - 1und1 or 1&1)  has changed it's strategy in the last couple of years to a customer is king approach. Sadly they very often can't do much (and have the wrong people on the phone anyway), but while doing nothing they will at least make sure you feel good about it
[21:02:50] <JustAberrant> hehe
[21:02:52] <Colgate> Starthunder: probably can
[21:02:57] <JustAberrant> there's a local one here like that.. teksavvy
[21:03:05] <JustAberrant> great people, but they don't own the lines
[21:03:23] <JustAberrant> and bell basically does the legally required minimum because, well, they are basically the competition
[21:03:27] <Starthunder> Colgate: really? o3o
[21:03:31] <Colgate> 12.50$/year
[21:03:34] <Colgate> pretty close
[21:03:37] <Starthunder> What's the catch >.>
[21:03:40] <JustAberrant> yeah, I don't think .net is one of the stupidly expensive ones
[21:03:51] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: what catch, that's what most domains cost
[21:03:51] <Colgate> none? I'm just looking at namecheap
[21:04:04] <Seoson> My most expensive one is a .CC domain ^^
[21:04:04] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: except for some weird ones and country specific ones
[21:04:24] <Starthunder> Namecheap's the good one, yeah?
[21:04:29] <JustAberrant> .ca is like $20 to $30 for some reason :(
[21:04:55] <Starthunder> > We're just verifying you are a real human and not a bot. After a couple of seconds, our site will automatically load and the rest of your visit will be nice and fast. We apologize for the inconvenience.
[21:05:03] <Starthunder> I think they want me to accept a cookie.
[21:05:14] <Colgate> think my most expensive is .horse :P
[21:05:29] <Colgate> 25$/year
[21:05:44] <init3> Of course .horse is expensive lol
[21:05:52] <Colgate> "expensive"
[21:06:02] <johnsey> it's a good tld though
[21:06:08] <Colgate> 25$/year isn't that much unless you have a lot of domains
[21:06:08] <JustAberrant> oh my.. I didn't know that was a thing
[21:06:10] * JustAberrant looks
[21:06:21] <Colgate> brushie.horse! which is uh, still unused
[21:06:30] <Colgate> I think
[21:06:38] <JustAberrant> aww :)
[21:06:43] <Starthunder> xD
[21:06:57] <Seoson> Wait what? .horse is a thing?
[21:07:02] <Starthunder> Eeyup.
[21:07:04] <johnsey> i was gonna get likea.horse but it was already taken
[21:07:22] * Starthunder idly wonders if w.horse is taken.
[21:07:27] <Colgate> .horse has a bunch of premium domains, so watch out for that
[21:07:49] <Colgate> 25$/year is their normal rate, but certain premium domains they charge a lot more for
[21:07:56] * Seoson will now register brushie.horse and tell all people he is Colgate.
[21:07:59] <Seoson> NOT
[21:08:07] <Colgate> I already registered it
[21:08:10] <Seoson> Ohhh
[21:08:12] <Colgate> like, a year ago, or more
[21:08:30] <Colgate> Creation Date: 2014-10-01T02:54:32Z
[21:08:34] <Starthunder> wat
[21:08:35] <Colgate> almost a  year ago
[21:08:40] <Starthunder> CloudFlare 503d at me on behalf of Namecheap
[21:08:44] <Seoson> Didn't you just say it's still available
[21:08:47] <Seoson> ?
[21:08:49] <Colgate> no
[21:08:56] <JustAberrant> yeah, namecheap is really slow for some reason
[21:09:04] <Colgate> I just said I haven't done anything with it
[21:09:05] <Seoson> Oh wait I see "unused" :D
[21:09:35] <Seoson> I just remembered it was your vHost ^^

[21:24:34] <johnsey> you might get some rejects when trying to register with a .horse email address
[21:25:10] <Seoson> I can get why it confuses people. I welcome the new competition but in some contexts even doing web design for several years I don't know all new TLDs and therefor don't recognize them as domains

[21:25:56] <Seoson> since .blog and things
[21:27:15] <Seoson> I just looked at PHPs regex for e-mail addresses today. You should really not implement those things yourself.
[21:27:38] <init3> Always use a library when you can. 
[21:27:48] <johnsey> an RFC-conforming email address can look pretty strange
[21:27:59] <JustAberrant> lol, amazon has book.horse

[21:44:03] <HoneyDrops> Sounds like they need a good system for anonymous hosting and DNS.
[21:44:25] <Seoson> Which doesn't mean people won't ignore the law anyway and (sometimes) get sued.
[21:45:02] <Seoson> Rent a server in another country and use a whois guard and you're fine for the most part

[21:47:25] <HoneyDrops> Aside from the issue of payment (which just means we need a proper anonymous payment system), ideally the hoster shouldn't have any info on the client to give.  (use keypairs to verify ownership)
[21:48:01] * HoneyDrops sighs.  Just so much needs fixing :(
[21:48:06] <Starthunder> I have to give Namecheap my real name, huh :<

[21:49:13] <Starthunder> so may as well be no country enforcing it
[21:49:21] <Starthunder> If you “really fuck up”, just kill your domain

[23:16:10] <Seoson> Sad truth is that even Tor hidden services don't always protect you.
[23:16:31] <Seoson> In case of Silkroad they did use a flaw in their software I believe.
[23:16:35] <Colgate> depends on a lot of factors, but it goes a long way
[23:16:49] <Seoson> Sure
[23:16:49] <Colgate> makes it substantially harder at the very least
[23:17:31] <Colgate> silk road was compromised, then they embedded js into the pages that people using tor incorrectly got sniped on

[23:18:09] <Seoson> Yeah but what about their server? It got compromised as well
[23:18:27] <Colgate> sure, their server got compromised, it happens
[23:19:16] <Colgate> though, if I was running an illegal service, the entire VM would be inside a tor wrapper, so they would have to break out of the VM first to get much useful data from it
[23:19:34] <Seoson> I think they didn't set it up correctly. I'd use Root in russia -> VM with no connection to the internet at all apart from tor -> actual site

[23:23:27] <Colgate> I don't remember the exact details, but they made a lot of mistakes
[23:23:43] <Seoson> Everyone using the exact same software is a horrible idea
[23:23:55] <Colgate> it has +s and -s
[23:24:13] <Colgate> using exact same software means that everyone is identical, more anonymous
[23:24:29] <Colgate> it also means find a bug, and you hit a lot of targets
[23:24:55] <Seoson> I prefer the VM I've setup.
[23:25:12] <Colgate> it isn't the best sollution, but it is simple enough that your mid-60s people that you mentioned earlier can figure it out
[23:25:17] <Seoson> But yeah browser fingerprinting is a thing
[23:25:25] <Colgate> and be reasonably secure unless they go out of their way to make it not so
[23:27:35] <Seoson> Won't prevent people from being dumb and saving evidence on their hd indeed o.O
[23:27:52] <Colgate> sure, but that's outside the scope of the browser bundle

[23:28:19] <Colgate> and boot from a livecd

[23:32:23] <Seoson> And blocking proxys was a way to get rid of spam - nothing more or less.
