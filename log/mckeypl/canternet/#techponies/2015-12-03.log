[01:12:32] <Compu> JustAberrant: yeah but it isnt a super expensive tv, its just a cheap emerson 32" LED 720p tv
[01:12:33] <MisterSkids> im not sure
[01:12:45] <MisterSkids> i just want to get into a job that allows me the freedom of doing my arts
[01:12:47] <JustAberrant> I wouldn't say so, especially with the recent trend of outsourcing
[01:13:06] <JustAberrant> there are still jobs for sure, but I wouldn't say it's a high demand industry at this point
[01:13:16] <JustAberrant> and certainly not within certain geographic regions
[01:13:32] <MisterSkids> aww :(
[01:13:43] <JustAberrant> it's not overly well paying either, again, it pays a livable salary, but there's much more lucrative careers
[01:13:48] <MisterSkids> what about video editing
[01:13:54] <MisterSkids> probably not a very good idea huh/
[01:14:08] * JustAberrant shrugs, I dunno anything about that industry
[01:14:33] <JustAberrant> just be sure to research whatever it is you want to do before spending too much time and money on it
[01:15:04] <JustAberrant> also I think as a general rule, if you are doing it because it pays and not because you love it, chances are you're gonna suck at it
[01:15:31] <JustAberrant> a lot of shitty programmers came out of the 2000's when computers was the thing to get into 
[01:16:42] <Googie> Hahaha, the latest Windows Server 2016 beta automatically downloads news updates, and has the Xbox One app included by default
[01:16:59] <Googie> (Just in case you feel like gaming on the Domain Controller!)
[01:17:30] <JustAberrant> man, I know I harp on about windows, but I don't know how the fuck windows admins keep their sanity
[01:17:40] <JustAberrant> it just seems like the most ill-suited OS for a server, and it seems to be getting worse
[01:18:34] <JustAberrant> windows managed to creep it's way into where I work (customer keeps their requirements on a windows system and now we are trying to do this weird devops/sync/newfangled bs
[01:18:55] <JustAberrant> it's win server 2012, and it just feels so clunky 
[01:18:57] <Googie> They've made some nice improvements. PowerShell is supposedly getting really good these days, and Server Core is finally producing a version that is CLI only
[01:19:03] <JustAberrant> might be the setup, but there's a lot of really stupid things

[03:51:58] <Googie> Moonlightning: RDP :/
[03:52:11] <Moonlightning> But…that wastes resources!
[03:52:13] <Googie> Plus there's a proprietary protocol for PowerShell I think.
[03:52:19] <Moonlightning> Ew.
[03:53:02] <Sour_Sweet> RDP is pretty much the standard
[03:53:03] <Colgate> powersheel remoting, yeah
[03:53:15] <Sour_Sweet> Or at least used to be until recently
[03:53:16] <Colgate> also you can use remote admin tools to manage them remotely as well
[03:53:24] <Sour_Sweet> Powershell is getting more common
[03:53:25] <Colgate> but I think they use powershell underneath
[03:53:38] <Colgate> RSAT*
[03:53:49] <Googie> Oh yeah, the SMB stuff.
[03:54:57] <Gigabit> Okay so, how is it cheaper to cut the cable cord? I just looked, Netflix is 7.99, CBS online is 5.99, hulu is like 9.99 as well. And I am sure other ones as well. At that price I may as well keep cable.
[03:55:45] <Colgate> you just stop watching TV
[03:55:49] <Googie> It's a lot cheaper if you don't subscribe to all of them. Plus torrenting tends to fill any gaps.
[03:55:55] <Sour_Sweet> Back when I had admin access on a Windows Server 2000 there was no such thing as PowerShell and I haven't touched a Windows Server since really
[03:56:10] <Colgate> I think powershell was added in 2003/XP?
[03:56:16] * Moonlightning frowns.
[03:56:16] <PinkiePieBot> Cheer up, Moonlightning, all of your friends are here!
[03:56:26] <Moonlightning> Don't cable packages tend to be //way more// than $10 a month?
[03:56:26] <Googie> Probably, but I don't think anyone really used it.
[03:56:37] <Colgate> it didn't get noticed until w7/2008 though
[03:56:51] <Colgate> First appeared November 14, 2006; 9 years ago
[03:57:20] <Colgate> XP SP2 and server 2003
[03:57:27] <Sour_Sweet> I've canceled my cable subscription. I paid about 20,-€/m and most channels were not even HD
[03:57:44] <Googie> That's amazingly cheap TBH :V
[03:58:00] <Sour_Sweet> I don't watch much TV anyway and I can just watch it online if I really want to
[03:58:18] <Gigabit> True to torrenting and stuff but but.. That sucks
[03:58:25] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah, but Nerflix is 8.99€/m
[03:58:35] <Sour_Sweet> Netflix*
[03:58:40] <Googie> I don't think that Powershell was really that capable in those days either.
[03:58:43] <Gigabit> They don't have TBBT or a bunch of other shows I like
[03:58:54] <Googie> Not much in the way of integrate to the vast majority of Window Server's components.
[03:58:59] <Googie> *integration
[03:59:22] <Colgate> it is a good scripting language for windows, but I wouldn't want to use it as a shell
[04:00:18] <Sour_Sweet> The channels I do watch are the ones provided by the government (WAY better news than any private channel in Germany) and I can watch them online for free in HD ;-)
[04:00:44] <Sour_Sweet> Also they store most of their content for a limited time in a free archive
[04:01:42] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: get a tv and a chromecast
[04:01:56] <Sour_Sweet> The only thing I need to pay for them is what used to be called GEZ, but it's a tax now essentially and you cannot avoid it
[04:02:16] <Sour_Sweet> Even if you don't have any TV
[04:02:22] <Compu> Gigabit: dont forget amazon prime video
[04:02:34] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: GEZ?
[04:02:46] <Sour_Sweet> The alternative would be to get a dish and watch free
[04:02:48] <Gigabit> Also, would getting a TV as a monitor be a bad idea? 
[04:03:01] <Gigabit> I don't use prime video
[04:03:02] <Sour_Sweet> Depends on your usecase
[04:03:08] <Compu> Gigabit: depends on what u want to do with iut
[04:03:12] <Sour_Sweet> A friend of mine does so and is very happy
[04:03:22] <Sour_Sweet> I wouldn't be happy with a TV
[04:03:36] <Compu> Gigabit: i dont use prime video anyways but thats cuz i cant afford the $99 a year
[04:03:49] <Gigabit> Well I leave my PC on all the time. And currently I have a 21.5" Acer and it was 186 a few yews ago
[04:04:11] <Gigabit>  Ooh shit.. I forgot prime video is part of prime.. And I have prime x.x
[04:04:21] <Gigabit> Student prime but prime
[04:04:21] <Compu> ah
[04:04:24] <Compu> well u have prime
[04:04:27] <Sour_Sweet> Latency is useally a bit higher than with a normal monitor, but that depends heavily on the model and there is a chance you won't notice it
[04:04:38] <Compu> theres a PS3 prime video app
[04:04:47] <Compu> Gigabit: theres also prime music
[04:04:48] <Sour_Sweet> Also TVs consume more energy useally
[04:05:00] <Sour_Sweet> Not that I'd imagine this is a problem in the U.S.
[04:05:08] <Gigabit> So better off getting a monitor and TV if I want one
[04:05:18] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: i dont notice latency unless its like more than half a second or some shit
[04:05:41] <Compu> i have motor skills issues that give me bad reaction times anyways
[04:05:55] <Sour_Sweet> Than you've never played FPSs on a high refresh rate monitor ;-)
[04:06:18] <Compu> pfft
[04:06:25] <Gigabit> Maybe I should just get a 32" monitor instead
[04:06:31] <AppleDash> TVs as monitors usually have bad latency, bad color reproduction for computing, and bad viewinG ANGLES
[04:06:31] <Compu> i never played an FPS
[04:06:45] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: like i will ever afford a gaming computer of any kind
[04:06:46] <AppleDash> A 32" monitor seems pretty useless unless it's 4L
[04:06:49] <AppleDash> 4K*
[04:07:10] <Gigabit> I want the big screen. It don't need 4k
[04:07:11] <Compu> AppleDash: i have a 24" dell 1080p monitor
[04:07:21] <Compu> 20 msec latency
[04:07:28] <AppleDash> That is an asston
[04:07:35] <Compu> works great with my ps3
[04:07:42] <Gigabit> Maybe dual 24" would be bettwr
[04:07:45] <Sour_Sweet> I even notice the difference between a 144Hz and a 60Hz display. Having played on the first for quite some time now the seconds makes me uncomfortable in FPSs
[04:07:47] <AppleDash> I'm stopping now
[04:08:02] <Compu> especially since the dvi-d port supports HDCP
[04:08:02] <AppleDash> Gigabit: How much do you have to spend?
[04:08:04] <Googie> The funny thing about monitor latency, and latency in general, it can be hard to tell until you experience what it's like when it's a lot lower.
[04:08:13] <Googie> Then all of a sudden, woah :P
[04:08:19] <Compu> so i can use an hdmi to dvi-d cord to hook my ps3 up to it
[04:08:26] <Gigabit> Nothing yet but when I get my refund check, would limit to around 1k cot a new build
[04:08:31] <Gigabit> Fot#
[04:08:39] <Gigabit> For*
[04:08:39] <AppleDash> Oh
[04:08:49] <AppleDash> I was gonna recommend a monitor that would cost like half that
[04:08:50] <Sour_Sweet> I currently have a 27" monitor (primary), and old 20" (secondary, portrait mode) and a 40" TV
[04:09:01] <Compu> Googie: mmk, when i somehow become incredibly rich i'll try it, otherwise i cant afford it
[04:09:39] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: we only have a 32" tv cuz my grandpa got it for us last christmas, it was on sale at walmart for $100
[04:09:49] <AppleDash> I'm using 2 27" 1440p displays and I hope to have a 28" 4K display soonish
[04:09:58] <AppleDash> Fit all of the things
[04:10:13] <Sour_Sweet> My 27" is only 1080p, but I don't need more
[04:10:15] <Compu> AppleDash: highest resolution display i have is on my galaxy note 4
[04:10:25] <Sour_Sweet> Thanks to my low vision I won't notice pixels anyway
[04:10:41] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: i love the HDCP support on my dell monitor
[04:11:04] <AppleDash> I just like having lots of screen space
[04:11:29] <Sour_Sweet> Next thing I'll buy is a proper multi-monitor arm to hold my displays
[04:11:53] <AppleDash> I would look into that, but one of my displays is in portrait mode
[04:12:03] <AppleDash> It would kill my pseudo-OCD to have a setup like that on a monitor arm

[04:19:23] <AppleDash> I don't trust TV wall mounts

[04:20:26] <Sour_Sweet> I used to shop from the U.S. as well due to the old exchange rates of 1€ = 1.40$ and Steam's silly 1€ = 1$ policy
[04:20:41] <Sour_Sweet> But currently it's not worth the effort
[04:22:24] <Compu> AppleDash: if u mount the wall side to wood and not just drywall its fine
[04:22:41] <AppleDash> Issue: There is no wood in my walls
[04:22:54] <Kinsley> That seems highly suspect.
[04:23:03] <AppleDash> My studs are made oe metal and I'm not sure of proper mounting practices for metal
[04:23:12] <Kinsley> Fair enough.
[04:23:16] <AppleDash> :P
[04:23:40] <Gigabit> Can consoles detect monitors as the display?
[04:23:47] <Sour_Sweet> Yes
[04:23:59] <Sour_Sweet> I use an old PS3 on my 20" Dell
[04:24:15] <Gigabit> Alright so I AK thinking of snagging a 27" monitor that has dvi and HDMI, and using that with my 21"
[04:24:22] <Gigabit> #Am
[04:24:41] <Sour_Sweet> It needs to support HDCP though, so keep that in mind
[04:24:49] <Sour_Sweet> Most monitors do however
[04:24:50] <Compu> Gigabit: i use a dell 24" monitor, u just need a monitor that supports HDCP and u need an HDMI to DVI-D cord
[04:25:00] <Kinsley> I think you'd be hard pressed to find one that doesn't, though.
[04:25:08] <Compu> i use the dell E2414H
[04:25:20] <Kinsley> HDCP is pretty bullshit, though.
[04:25:29] <Kinsley> Everything is bullshit, for that matter.
[04:25:39] <Gigabit> AOC e2752She has 2 hdcp
[04:25:42] <Compu> Kinsley: humans r bullshit
[04:25:51] <Sour_Sweet> The RaspberryPi displays often support HDMI, but no HDCP
[04:25:56] <Compu> Gigabit: 2 HDCP? wat?
[04:26:15] <Gigabit> That's what the description says lol
[04:26:27] <Sour_Sweet> There are some HDCP stripper that work quite well
[04:26:41] <Gigabit> I am assuming it is meaning the HDMI ports support hdcp
[04:26:41] <Sour_Sweet> Also HDCP has multiple versions
[04:26:45] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: and theyre all illegal :D
[04:26:56] <Compu> the HDCP strippers that is
[04:27:00] <Sour_Sweet> Who cares again?
[04:27:03] <Gigabit> Er hdcp*
[04:27:43] <Compu> Gigabit: what r u correcting?
[04:28:01] <Gigabit> Obviously nothing because I thought I made a mistake and I didn't.
[04:28:42] <Compu> k
[04:28:44] <Compu> anyways
[04:28:59] <Compu> my birthday is coming up so u should all get presents for me :D
[04:29:06] <Sour_Sweet> The new 4K content requires a newer HDCP standard often not supported by TVs
[04:29:20] <Sour_Sweet> Even if they're 4K capeable on paper
[04:29:47] <Sour_Sweet> BluRay players have a softfail iirc though
[04:29:58] <Sour_Sweet> But you won't get 4K than
[04:30:19] <Sour_Sweet> then*
[04:30:29] <Compu> now if only game consoles supported 4K
[04:30:39] <Compu> especially the ones that play blu rays
[04:30:39] <Sour_Sweet> Zhh. Wait 2 more generations
[04:31:15] <Sour_Sweet> They don't even run on FullHD 90% of the time
[04:31:38] <Sour_Sweet> And don't get me started on cinematic 24 FPS
[04:32:01] <AppleDash> Yeah
[04:32:18] <AppleDash> Maybe 2 more generations and we'll have 1080p
[04:32:18] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: im on PS3, at least gran turismo 6 runs at 1080p
[04:32:22] <AppleDash> don't get too ahead of yourself
[04:32:37] <Compu> hey we have 1080p on PS3 with gt6
[04:32:41] <Sour_Sweet> AppleDash: I doubt it
[04:32:48] <Sour_Sweet> Argh lines.
[04:32:50] <Gigabit> Okay so why would a monitor have VGA and HDMI but no dvi?
[04:32:54] <Sour_Sweet> I meant Compu
[04:33:05] <Compu> Gigabit: cuz few people use dvi anymore?
[04:33:13] <AppleDash> I use DVI
[04:33:19] <Compu> if they want digital most people use displayport or hdmi
[04:33:22] * JustAberrant uses DVI :(
[04:33:28] <Gigabit> I was under the impression dvi was still really common
[04:33:33] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: You have like 10 monitors though
[04:33:33] <Sour_Sweet> VGA is legacy and business stuff
[04:33:37] <AppleDash> You kinda have no choice
[04:33:42] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:33:46] <Sour_Sweet> HDMI is just the most common consumer port
[04:33:50] <Compu> Gigabit: it is but that doesnt stop manufacturers from trying to kill it off
[04:33:57] <Gigabit> Ya but game consoles don't have DP I don't think
[04:33:57] <JustAberrant> actually a lot of the newer cards that do like 6 outputs are hdmi only
[04:34:15] <AppleDash> My GPU does like 6 outputs
[04:34:15] <Compu> Gigabit: nope thats what hdmi is for
[04:34:21] <Sour_Sweet> JustAberrant: Ahh since, when?
[04:34:24] <AppleDash> Has one DVI and a bunch of mini displayports
[04:34:26] <Sour_Sweet> They use display port
[04:34:31] <Sour_Sweet> (and HDMI)
[04:34:34] <Compu> the only time u need dvi for a console is if the display doesnt have hdmi
[04:34:39] <AppleDash> I use the DVI
[04:34:43] <JustAberrant> er yeah, hdmi or displayport, whatever ;p
[04:35:01] <JustAberrant> but my computer is (relatively) old, so all my video cards are DVI :D
[04:35:06] <Compu> AppleDash: my laptop has VGA and s-video :D
[04:35:18] <AppleDash> I imagine that JustAberrant has like 5 low-end video cards in every slot
[04:35:23] <JustAberrant> either way, afaik it's easy to convert hdmi to dvi
[04:35:31] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah
[04:35:32] <JustAberrant> they are basically same in a different connector
[04:35:35] <Compu> JustAberrant: use a DVI-D to hdmi cord
[04:35:37] <Sour_Sweet> I do so for the PS3
[04:35:44] <Sour_Sweet> Sound was more of an issue
[04:35:50] <AppleDash> Rather interesting thing I discovered
[04:35:51] <Compu> u wont get sound over hdmi but it will still work for video
[04:36:00] <AppleDash> DVI to HDMI cables don't work for 1440p 60hz
[04:36:07] <AppleDash> But plain DVI works fine
[04:36:10] <Sour_Sweet> Since consoles don't bother to support game sound via USB headset
[04:36:10] <Compu> AppleDash: then suffer :D
[04:36:23] <AppleDash> I bought a DVI cable
[04:36:24] <Sour_Sweet> (Voicechat is fine though)
[04:36:46] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: cuz theyre consoles, ya nut, most people use them with actual tvs
[04:37:05] <Compu> i just use the AV out on the ps3 to connect it to my speakers
[04:37:19] <Sour_Sweet> BUT IF YOU HAVE THE FREAKING DRIVER ANYWAY SUPPORT FREAKING AUDIO REDIRECT
[04:37:35] <Sour_Sweet> It's not hard to just change the output port
[04:37:47] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: no they dont, consoles dont usually use drivers, they use direct hardware access
[04:37:52] <Sour_Sweet> I have at least 3 sound devices connected to my PC all the time
[04:38:11] <Sour_Sweet> Compu: They use drivers just like any other computer
[04:38:18] <Compu> no they dont
[04:38:22] <JustAberrant> Compu: at some point there is gonna be a driver ;p
[04:38:25] <Compu> look at the PS3 OS
[04:38:32] <Sour_Sweet> The PS3 is what, FreeBSD after all?
[04:38:38] <Compu> nope
[04:38:43] <Compu> PS3 is custom OS
[04:38:46] <Sour_Sweet> It's some weird *nix
[04:38:56] <Compu> with custom processor arctitecture
[04:39:03] <JustAberrant> Compu: doesn't matter, it'll still have a driver ;p
[04:39:06] <Compu> nope
[04:39:09] <Kinsley> Point is, all modern OSes use drivers.
[04:39:09] <Compu> look it up
[04:39:19] <Compu> the OS on the PS3 accesses the hardware directly
[04:39:22] <Compu> no driver
[04:39:24] <Sour_Sweet> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_system_software
[04:39:25] <PinkiePieBot> [ PlayStation 3 system software - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[04:39:26] <Kinsley> Whether they're called drivers is not importent.
[04:39:33] <Kinsley> important*
[04:39:37] <Sour_Sweet> OS family Unix-like[1]
[04:39:38] <JustAberrant> Compu: the code to do that is a driver..
[04:39:42] <Compu> Kinsley: ur gonna call the OS a driver?
[04:39:44] *** Quits: LordShadowWing (LordShadowW@Pony-meil2p.machlink.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:39:54] <Kinsley> Define OS
[04:39:55] <Sour_Sweet> The driver is part of the OS 6_9
[04:40:00] <Kinsley> Because ^
[04:40:11] <Compu> :P
[04:40:19] <JustAberrant> the driver may be a component of the OS, but if it's a piece of software that interfaces between other software and hardware, it's a driver
[04:40:25] <Compu> driver implies a translation between the OS and the hardware
[04:40:30] <Kinsley> ....
[04:40:35] <Sour_Sweet> You always have an abstraction, which is the driver
[04:41:09] <Sour_Sweet> Even consoles do that. Otherwise you couldn't connect different variants of (usb) headsets for example
[04:41:15] <Kinsley> Hell, you can argue that kernels have "drivers" for various CPUs.
[04:42:18] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: it has just standard drivers for hardware not made by sony, everything else is set up for the OS to access it directly
[04:42:38] <JustAberrant> Compu: ... still a driver.. doesn't matter if it's built into the OS ..
[04:42:42] <Kinsley> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel#/media/File:OS-structure.svg
[04:42:43] <PinkiePieBot> [ Microkernel - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[04:42:59] <Compu> mmk
[04:43:43] <Kinsley> What it's called and where it runs doesn't change the nature of what's going on. A piece of software is written and used to interface between or within an OS and its hardware.
[04:44:44] <Sour_Sweet> Also I highly doubt that they even write every driver themselves. That'd be way too much work.
[04:44:59] <JustAberrant> Compu: a driver is literally anything that controls (or "drives" a piece of hardware), doesn't matter if it's written in a high level language and installed as a piece of software or scribed by hand onto an EEPROM with a pin..
[04:45:52] <JustAberrant> anyway, it's too late for semantic arguments, I'm to bed
[04:46:45] <Sour_Sweet> Consoles are just computers nowadays. As you go further back in generations the differences will increase
[04:47:21] <Sour_Sweet> The PS2 used weird cell processors for example
[04:47:25] <Kinsley> Consoles have always been computers, let's be clear. It's just that modern consoles are starting to adapt features more common to PCs.
[04:48:03] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah I meant common personal computers
[04:48:23] <Kinsley> To the point that the Xbox One is effectively a cut down version of Windows 10 running on an AMD A4 chip.
[04:48:26] <Sour_Sweet> The architecture was quite different in the past
[04:49:50] <Gigabit> I think the monitor I qant

[04:51:35] <Compu> yeah, ew glossy
[04:52:01] <Gigabit> Some of us don't care about that :p
[04:52:02] <Sour_Sweet> (I'm very pickly when it comes to such things)
[04:52:31] <Compu> Gigabit: mmk but some of us like being able to seen the screen without having to clean it every 5 seconds

[04:52:56] <Gigabit> IPS led to be exact
[04:53:10] <Compu> AMOLED is best

[04:54:22] <Sour_Sweet> Apart from being glossy I don't like the ports coming out on the back panel. The rest looks fine
[04:54:53] <Compu> Kinsley: hey it has the same resolution as my phone :D
[04:55:36] <Kinsley> Phone screens shouldn't be higher res than 1080p.
[04:55:44] <Googie> Sour_Sweet: The PS3 was Cell.
[04:55:58] <Sour_Sweet> I wish nVidia would choose to support FreeSync
[04:55:59] <Kinsley> And I say that knowing full well the phone I have is 2560x1440.
[04:56:01] <Compu> Gigabit: is*
[04:56:05] <Kinsley> Sour_Sweet: you and me both.
[04:56:14] <Googie> The PS2 had a bunch of fun stuff though looking at it. The I/O chip was actually just the original PS1 CPU underclocked.
[04:56:30] <Gigabit> Why did you correct me?
[04:56:56] <Sour_Sweet> I have a G-SYNC display, which works great, but I had to pay a premium for that. Also only one display port
[04:56:57] <Compu> Kinsley: i have the galaxy note 4 and u need a microscope to see individual pixels, also the screen looks absolutely incredible
[04:57:11] <Compu> Gigabit: meant Googie
[04:57:12] <Kinsley> I have the same phone.
[04:57:20] <Kinsley> I still think it's excessive.
[04:57:24] <Sour_Sweet> I prefer better battery life ;-)
[04:57:29] <Kinsley> ^
[04:57:46] <Kinsley> Also better CPU/GPU performance since it doesn't need to drive as many pixels.
[04:58:00] <Sour_Sweet> YAY MORE PIXELS!111ONE!!
[04:58:01] <Kinsley> (And fucking root so I can nuke the bloatware)
[04:58:14] <Compu> Kinsley: i need a new battery for mine cuz the one in it has a defect but the warranty requires me to take it to a verizon corporate  store and the closest is 30 miles away
[04:58:23] <Sour_Sweet> Because we all know how well that worked for digital cameras
[04:58:31] <Googie> Some advice with correcting what other people say: People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
[04:58:42] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: AMOLED gives my all the battery life i need
[04:59:01] <Kinsley> AMOLED is super power hungry, actually.
[04:59:01] <Sour_Sweet> Which is what? One day of heavy use?
[04:59:20] <Sour_Sweet> If it even makes they day.
[04:59:20] <Compu> Kinsley: not when ur looking at black backgrounds and light text
[04:59:40] <Compu> which i usually am when im out and about
[04:59:40] <Googie> But yeah, going older and older, consoles actually had really cool specialized hardware.
[04:59:45] <Compu> reading fics and such
[04:59:48] <Compu> and wikipedia
[04:59:51] <Kinsley> Using the screen at all tanks your battery faster than anything.
[05:00:03] <Compu> Kinsley: i have no complaints
[05:00:22] <Kinsley> I do. I should be able to screen-on for 8 hours at least.
[05:00:31] <Compu> i can walk around video chatting on skype for like 5 hours on battery
[05:00:32] <Googie> The Atari 2600 for example didn't have enough ram for a frame buffer :V
[05:00:57] <Colgate> I should really get a new phone, mine can't go 8 hours with the screen off on wifi >.>
[05:00:58] <Compu> Kinsley: then get a battery pack
[05:01:10] <Compu> Colgate: pfft
[05:01:15] <Colgate> could replace the battery, but eh, could just get a new phone
[05:01:26] <Sour_Sweet> the* I used my phone all day browsing the internet (3-4 hours maybe?), had a 20 minutes call, constantly connected to WiFi, cell and bluetooth, WeeChat running all day, watched a few YT videos and still have 20% left.
[05:01:33] <Compu> Colgate: then pick one ya butt
[05:01:43] <Colgate> but this one still works!
[05:02:02] <Sour_Sweet> That's how a battery should work ;-) Thank you CM12.1

[05:02:25] <Colgate> it would probably be a N6p or whatever the latest N6 is that isn't the big one :P
[05:02:42] <Compu> and with that i can last all day easy, longer than my mom's s6 at least

[05:03:54] <Compu> samsung doesnt have as much bloatware with touchwiz on android 5.0 and above
[05:04:13] <Compu> in fact they got a lot closer to stock android

[05:05:04] <Sour_Sweet> I don't :P
[05:05:18] <Compu> only app i dont really use is google maps cuz i prefer waze
[05:05:20] <Colgate> google play is holding android back imo
[05:05:27] <Colgate> preventing android from having a real package manager
[05:05:44] <Compu> Colgate: google play is the app store, drop that and android will die with consumers
[05:06:01] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah also I uninstalled Firefox Mobile because it's a broken piece of crap and use Chrome now
[05:06:14] <Colgate> I use firefox mobile all the time just fine?
[05:06:29] <Compu> if u dont have an app store with tons of apps on ur smartphone os then ur smartphone os will never be mainstream, and if u want the money it needs to be mainstream

[05:06:48] <Sour_Sweet> Because that's what is broken
[05:06:49] <Colgate> it zoomes?
[05:07:01] <Colgate> you just do the 2 finder spread thing
[05:07:06] <Compu> ^
[05:07:09] <Sour_Sweet> You can enable force zoom on all websites
[05:07:11] <Colgate> the generic zoom thing for everything
[05:07:14] <Sour_Sweet> Which is the 2 finger thing
[05:07:31] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: if a website has disabled zoom then dont use that website
[05:07:32] <Sour_Sweet> BUT that will corrupt the webites layout in recent versions

[05:10:32] <Colgate> it makes no sense
[05:10:46] <Sour_Sweet> It doesn't, but websites do it anyway

[05:11:42] <Sour_Sweet> Which again works way better in Chrome than in FF
[05:11:53] <Colgate> debatable
[05:12:03] <Sour_Sweet> And I used to be a FF fan
[05:12:39] <Googie> I'll be honest, I agree with Sour_Sweet in that I've found Chrome on mobile to work better in general, though Firefox is still my main browser.
[05:13:17] <Sour_Sweet> Amazon mobile blocks zoom
[05:13:30] <Sour_Sweet> You can override this with an option in FF

[05:16:22] <Colgate> since android comes with a default browser "browser" which is chromium
[05:16:44] <Colgate> make them do a browser ticket thing like MS had to do in EU :P
[05:26:51] <Sour_Sweet> Sadly I don't have the upsidedown text bug screenshot from FF mobile anymore
[05:27:28] <Sour_Sweet> I cannot reproduce it atm, but on higher zoom levels the text would just flip
[05:27:37] <Sour_Sweet> Making it impossible to use
[05:30:52] <Colgate> I've never seen that one :O

[06:39:29] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> then the power outage we just had while it was running startup repair i'm pretty sure wrecked my mft
[06:39:35] <Gladiolus> How did a graphics error do that? You've got some deep s
[06:39:36] <Gladiolus> oh
[06:39:39] <Gladiolus> Yeah okay that'll do it
[06:40:19] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> basicly i got the problem with windows aero and the new AMD driver where it loads, suddenly for no reason, it starts looping in a cycle of black screen, recover "AMD kernel video driver has stopped responding and has recovered"
[06:40:53] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> and it would do this once every 30 minutes or so, or it would continue to do this non stop in ever worstening cycles for an hour or untill the system finally throws BSOD because the driver failed to recover
[06:41:04] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> THAT fragged my registry according to startup repair
[06:41:05] <Gladiolus> wow that sucks

[06:41:45] <Gladiolus> You will?

[20:36:48] <Shutter> Long story short, not a lot of money leads to a lot of different brands, and it is a hell to do anything with in the start z.z
[20:37:13] <Colgate> yep!
[20:37:14] <Shutter> This is a Black Box 24 port SFP switch. Guess I better consult the documentation.
[20:37:37] <Colgate> we have 4 different brands of switches in our company I think, since we bought whatever was the cheapest at the time
[20:37:40] <DataByte> 'black box switch' - yup, seen a few, lol
[20:37:49] <Colgate> might be 3...
[20:37:51] <DataByte> one was actually black, amusingly enough

[20:40:05] <DataByte> oh, and adtran switches, make that 6
[20:40:35] <Shutter> I wish I had the money to standardize on Cisco Catalysts all over. The two I have of those (for edge, though) are delightful to work with.

[20:41:30] <Shutter> mniip: No, it's just different

[20:43:10] <DataByte> that's awesome xD
[20:43:21] <Shutter> Hmm, I guess this technically makes more sense than shut no shut, but still, would be nice to not relearn everything.

[20:43:22] <Shutter>   enable                Enable port state operation
[20:44:07] <DataByte> that's similar to the hp (and various other vendors.. so far, cisco is the only ones i've seen "shutdown" on)
[20:44:27] <Shutter> Works on D-Link DGS if I recall correctly, as well
[20:44:55] <Shutter> They are believe it or not alright, just a shame the documentation isn't always correct with reality

[22:13:14] <cyzon> sup
[22:13:46] <Xefir> Hello :)
[22:15:09] <Sour_Sweet> There are probably a lot people around knowing a thing or two about JS. I personally have done a couple of small things with node

[22:16:11] <cyzon> I know node
[22:17:22] <Sour_Sweet> Unrelated: German ISP removes traffic limits for "file sharing traffic" of 10 GiB per day completely after having it lowered from 60GiB to 10GiB previously which lead to a shitstorm
[22:18:24] <Xefir> Okay, I facing a problem with streams. I know I can pipe any stream to another, but I want to merge two PCM audio streams. I found this https://github.com/alfreddatakillen/audio-mixer but it awfully slow, because it make a loop around the _read and burn all the CPU =/ And I don't know how to get out this. Have you any ideas ? ^^"

[22:19:10] * Moonlightning noses under Gigaway. :3
[22:21:23] <Sour_Sweet> To be very honest: That's sounds like a task I wouldn't handle in JS
[22:22:06] <Sour_Sweet> Realtime media processing demands for highly optimized code
[22:25:20] <Xefir> In fact, I have done nearly all my work in node.js, like convert mp3 icecast stream to PCM, grab audio PCM data from mumble and pipe a stream or the another to icecast again without performance problem. Maybe I was a little to optimistic when we have to manipulate and modify real time stream at the same time =/

[22:31:01] <Colgate> Sour_Sweet: isn't most traffic "file sharing traffic"?
[22:31:12] <Colgate> I mean, you go to a website, you are downloading files...
[22:32:47] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah their definition is a b!tch. By file sharing traffic they mean p2p (primarily BitTorrent) and One-Click-Hosting companies.
[22:33:06] <Colgate> p2p... define peer?
[22:33:14] <Colgate> >.>
[22:33:16] <Sour_Sweet> They've been using a combination of white and blacklists
[22:33:29] <Sour_Sweet> Rapidshare is bad, Dropbox is not
[22:33:42] <Sour_Sweet> It doesn't make any sense.
[22:34:37] <Colgate> indeed
[22:34:37] <Sour_Sweet> I guess they just check the IPs via DNSBL/rDNS for dial up matches
[22:34:58] <Sour_Sweet> + Blacklists for One-Click-Hosting providers
[22:35:57] <Sour_Sweet> After you hit the limit they reduced your bandwidth to 100 kbps.

[22:36:58] <Sour_Sweet> So if your legitimate p2p application isn't big enough too bad for you
[22:39:26] <Sour_Sweet> Xefir: You probably also want to use heavy multi threading to merge the streams. I've taken a small look into the lib and it doesn't use any.
[22:39:52] <Sour_Sweet> Also monkey patching is not exaclty the best idea ;-)
[22:40:29] <Xefir> Sour_Sweet: Oh. I don't think at it. Will see. Also : monkey patching ?
[22:41:11] <Sour_Sweet> Monkey patching means overwriting existing functions in runtime with your own.
[22:41:38] <Colgate> cause torrents are always illegal
[22:41:43] <Colgate> :D
[22:41:51] <Colgate> and all p2p is inherently evil
[22:41:55] <Sour_Sweet> It's a deprecated practice. Doesn't mean it's not useful though

[23:03:10] <AppleDash> probably*
[23:05:05] <Sour_Sweet> I'd imagine RapidSSL or something like that is cheaper. Also there is WoSign and StartCom
[23:05:38] <AppleDash> Not everyone knows about them

[23:27:51] <Colgate> Sour_Sweet: tmobile also does very evil things in the US, especially with net neutrality
[23:28:03] <Colgate> the latest being "binge on!"
[23:28:17] <Colgate> where certain video streaming services don't count against your data plan
[23:28:38] <Sour_Sweet> Zero rating, I see
[23:29:50] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah they do that for Spotify here. Also they try to sell priority traffic to content providers and refuse to do free peering with a reasonable bandwidth
[23:30:07] <Colgate> they dod that with spotify and other music streaming services here too
[23:30:09] <Colgate> and I hate it
[23:31:31] <Sour_Sweet> T-Mobile / DTAG thinks that Google should pay them to get traffic to their customers, even though DTAG customers already pay a huge premium
[23:33:26] <Sour_Sweet> Because of that - no matter how high your bandwidth is - from 18 to 22 o'clock YT can become inaccessible and does on a regular basis
[23:33:59] <Sour_Sweet> Netflix pays the price iirc
