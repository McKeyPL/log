[06:59:22] <Moonlightning> > The only thing about account tags which annoys me is that the account name is not temporally unique.
[06:59:54] <Phase> it is just the nickserv account name
[07:00:22] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[07:22:03] <CompuDesktop> Kinsley: is there a way to allow passwords to be used from local network machines but only keys for things from the internet on SSH?
[07:22:06] <CompuDesktop> oops
[07:22:11] <CompuDesktop> forgot to remove the ping
[07:22:15] <CompuDesktop> sorry Kinsley
[07:24:45] <Moonlightning> Hmmmm.
[07:24:50] <Moonlightning> That is a good question.
[07:25:46] <Moonlightning> …I think you can, actually, with just the config file!
[07:26:08] <Moonlightning> combine `Match` with `PasswordAuthentication` and `PubkeyAuthentication`
[07:27:00] <Moonlightning> See also `AuthenticationMethods` for more fine-grained control over that (TIL)

[07:50:17] <Colgate> sure, that looks fine
[07:50:39] <Moonlightning> CompuDesktop: check the permissions. That file and all its parents may only be writable by the owner.
[07:51:15] <Moonlightning> If any of them are writable by the group or other, then sshd will ignore the authorized_keys file
[07:51:31] <CompuDesktop> Moonlightning: permissions r.....0666?
[07:51:42] <Moonlightning> Yeahno, that won't do.
[07:52:08] <Moonlightning> Generally you want ~/.ssh and everything in it to be accessible only to yourself, anyway :P
[07:52:30] <Colgate> 600
[07:52:32] <CompuDesktop> ok so command should i use and what octal should i set it to
[07:52:36] <Colgate> or 700 for ~/.ssh
[07:53:02] *** Quits: MistVeil (AndChat3408@Pony-prm9c8.static.axtel.net) (Quit: Bye)
[07:53:08] <CompuDesktop> what command is that? i havent changed file permissions in forever
[07:53:16] <Colgate> chmod
[07:53:24] <CompuDesktop> ok and what user/group?
[07:53:33] <Colgate> ...yourself?
[07:53:36] <CompuDesktop> ok
[07:53:38] <Moonlightning> chmod doesn't take user or group names.
[07:53:49] <Moonlightning> You're probably confusing it with chown (which is not what we're doing right now)
[07:54:04] <Colgate> you also need to own it, but if you created it, you probably own it already
[07:56:26] <Moonlightning> (chmod, besides taking absolute modes in numeric form, also takes what're known as /symbolic modes/)

[07:56:50] <Colgate> I always use the octal stuff in chmod, /shrug
[07:57:00] <CompuDesktop> ok
[07:57:09] <Colgate> ok, that's a lie, sometimes I use chmod +x, but that's it
[07:57:11] <CompuDesktop> so chmod 700 ~/.ssh
[07:57:13] <CompuDesktop> right?
[07:57:19] <Colgate> yes
[07:57:23] <CompuDesktop> done
[07:57:33] <CompuDesktop> now what about the authorized keys file?
[07:57:36] <Colgate> 600
[07:58:00] <Colgate> 600 gives the owner of the file read/write privs, and to everybody else no privs
[07:58:16] <Colgate> 700 gives the owner read/write/execute privs, and to everybody else no privs
[07:58:26] <CompuDesktop> done
[07:58:29] <Colgate> you need execute privs to open a folder
[07:58:36] <CompuDesktop> now it should work?
[07:58:40] <Moonlightning> Probably.
[07:58:50] <Colgate> maybe, assuming the keys were right and stuff
[07:58:52] <Colgate> :P
[07:59:02] <CompuDesktop> hmm
[07:59:03] <CompuDesktop> wait
[07:59:22] <Moonlightning> You need execute privileges on a directory to access any of its contents; you need read privileges to list its contents.
[07:59:28] <CompuDesktop> do i need to change the pubkeygenerator@mobiledevice at the end of the first key there?
[07:59:45] <Moonlightning> That's acutally a comment field. It is completely ignored. You can use it for your own purposes, or leave it out.

[08:02:05] <CompuDesktop> ?
[08:02:06] <Moonlightning> `chmod go-w ~` will remove the write permission for group and other on your homedir, while leaving the other permission flags as the yare.
[08:02:18] <CompuDesktop> but
[08:02:27] <CompuDesktop> i need to be able to write to my home dir
[08:02:42] <Moonlightning> Yeah. You own it, right?
[08:02:45] <CompuDesktop> yes
[08:02:49] <Phase> go == 'group' and 'other'
[08:02:52] <Phase> u == owner
[08:02:56] <CompuDesktop> oh
[08:02:59] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[08:03:15] <Moonlightning> (also, `a` means /all/, as in /all three of them/)
[08:03:28] <CompuDesktop> done
[08:03:51] <CompuDesktop> woo!
[08:03:54] <CompuDesktop> it worked
[08:04:07] <Moonlightning> Yay
[08:04:36] <Moonlightning> btw, I keep the relevant user@host of the key in the comment field
[08:04:57] <Moonlightning> So the key with the private half on my mane laptop gets marked blackl@rainbow-dash
[08:05:11] <Moonlightning> I have a bunch of machines, so that makes keeping the keys straight easy
[08:05:13] <Moonlightning> instead of impossible
[08:05:57] <CompuDesktop> ok
[08:05:58] <CompuDesktop> so
[08:06:16] <CompuDesktop> Moonlightning: now how do i make it so ssh accepts passwords from the local network but not from the internet?
[08:06:19] <Moonlightning> Optional. Probably doesn't even matter now, but I would highly recommend doing it as soon as you start having more than one thing from you SSH from
[08:06:49] <Moonlightning> Define /local network/.
[08:07:02] <Moonlightning> (I'll take /Internet/ to mean /the address space that isn't the local network/)
[08:07:02] <CompuDesktop> 192.168.*
[08:07:25] <Moonlightning> So 192.168.0.0/16 (CIDR notation is a good thing to know.)

[08:08:53] <CompuDesktop> where is sshd_config
[08:09:04] *** Joins: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net)
[08:09:19] <Moonlightning> Probably either at /etc/sshd_config or /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[08:09:55] <CompuDesktop> its the second one
[08:10:08] <Moonlightning> Anyway, `Match` introduces a conditional block. From there until the next `Match` or the end of the file, keywords will only apply to matching clients.
[08:10:59] <CompuDesktop> well
[08:11:07] <CompuDesktop> i have no idea where in the file to put any of this
[08:11:38] <Moonlightning> Given what I just said, you'll want to do it at the end. :P
[08:11:51] <CompuDesktop> ok so what exactly do i put at the end
[08:11:53] <Moonlightning> Otherwise, the settings currently there would only apply to clients from the local network.
[08:12:13] <Moonlightning> Match Address 192.168.0.0/16
[08:12:40] <Moonlightning>     PasswordAuthentication no  # indentation is ignored by sshd, but I recommend putting it in for readability
[08:13:04] <Moonlightning> Er, sorry, `yes` instead of `no`
[08:13:24] <CompuDesktop> ok any more?
[08:13:27] <Moonlightning> You want `PasswordAuthentication no` /outside/ this `Match`—i.e. earlier in the file
[08:13:43] <CompuDesktop> how do i end the match?
[08:14:01] <Moonlightning> `Match`es run until the next `Match` or until the end of the file.
[08:14:13] <CompuDesktop> ok
[08:14:19] <Moonlightning> If you really want this in the middle of the file, you can effectively “end” a `Match` with `Match *`
[08:15:09] <CompuDesktop> how do i transfer as root in winscp?
[08:15:37] <Kinsley> As far as I know, you need to be logged in as root...
[08:15:51] <Moonlightning> Well, you would have to make sshd allow root authentication, which is generally frowned upon.
[08:16:03] <CompuDesktop> oh ok
[08:16:25] <Moonlightning> Consider instead transferring as yourself, and using `sudo` to chown and move into place once the files are on the destination machine.
[08:16:41] <Moonlightning> s/Consider //; you really should do it that way :P
[08:17:12] <CompuDesktop> if i put the file elsewhere and then sudo cp it into where i want it would that work?
[08:17:22] <Kinsley> Yes
[08:17:22] <Moonlightning> You probably wanna `sudo mv` instead
[08:17:26] <CompuDesktop> ok
[08:17:41] <Kinsley> (backing up the original just in case)
[08:18:13] <Moonlightning> Well, the original is (temporarily) backed up by virtue of the fact that it's still on the source machine, because you `scp`ed it and haven't deleted it from src yet. :P
[08:18:47] <CompuDesktop> i backed it up
[08:20:15] <CompuDesktop> ok Moonlightning now restart?
[08:20:22] <CompuDesktop> how do i restart sshd?
[08:21:36] <Moonlightning> Yeah, you will need to reload for changes to sshd_config to take effect
[08:21:51] <CompuDesktop> ok restarted
[08:22:09] <CompuDesktop> apparently an active ssh connection isnt lost when restarting sshd?
[08:22:11] <Moonlightning> reload != restart, but restarting almost always involves reloading, so whatevs
[08:22:35] <Moonlightning> I only recently realized that. That's what those other processes are for. :P
[08:22:48] <CompuDesktop> gonna test via phone 4g
[08:23:14] <CompuDesktop> oops
[08:23:18] <Moonlightning> sshd spawns child processes to handle clients; those stay alive when the mane daemon dies
[08:23:21] <CompuDesktop> forgot to forward
[08:23:29] <Moonlightning> Forward?
[08:23:43] <CompuDesktop> forward the ports
[08:23:51] <Moonlightning> Why would you need to forward ports. :I
[08:24:24] <CompuDesktop> for internet to access the ssh?
[08:24:46] <Moonlightning> Your server has a public IP, yeah?
[08:24:48] <CompuDesktop> the entire point of this was so that only local network can use passwords and internet access requires keys
[08:25:11] <CompuDesktop> i gotta forward port 22 in my router config to enable internet access
[08:25:12] <Googie> Hahaha, reading this forum thread. Audiophiles thinking that SSDs have better audio quality than HDDs.
[08:25:24] <CompuDesktop> Googie: that makes no sense

[19:50:11] <RazorSharpFang> johnsey: Is... the MLP episodes from johnsey[fserve] missing its audio? I can't seem to find the audio, only video codecs in the file.

[20:12:42] <RazorSharpFang> So far, S05E11 720p and S05E12 720p
[20:16:31] <johnsey> oh, seems only the 1080p ones have audio. i'll fix that
[20:17:16] <RazorSharpFang> That would be great, I've come to rely on johnsey[fserve] for my MLP fix.

[21:27:13] <cyborg_ar> it was used a lot in the looney tunes

[23:43:41] <cyborg_ar> ever happened to you to have some ideas that sound great on your head but have no idea on how to commit to code
[23:46:29] <Webster> Yeah.
[23:48:40] <cyborg_ar> :( it's very frustrating
[23:48:50] <Moonlightning> Got a specific one?
[23:50:30] <cyborg_ar> i want to make an application where you draw a measurement system with nodes and lines and it figures out the uncertainty propagation out of the diagram
[23:50:42] <cyborg_ar> but i don't even know how to draw nodes in Qt :(
[23:52:25] <cyborg_ar> nor i'm sure i'm thinking of the right metaphors anyway
