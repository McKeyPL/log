[01:53:15] <Moonlightning> :/
[01:53:45] <cyborg_ar> actually, authorization to do something i should be able to do anyway
[01:54:03] <Moonlightning> Why does DNS explicitly ban multiple CNAMEs? :(
[01:54:13] <Moonlightning> That would've been an awesome feature. :(
[01:58:54] <cyborg_ar> sounds confusing
[01:59:49] <cyborg_ar> i thought cname was "this is the canonical name", to be used once in each alias dns entry
[01:59:55] <cyborg_ar> no "here's a list of aliases"
[02:00:57] <Moonlightning> …okay, so maybe another kind of entry.
[02:01:44] <Moonlightning> …oh! I'm looking for SRV records.
[02:02:00] <Moonlightning> …so, wait…is SRV not widely-supported? o.o
[02:03:54] <cyborg_ar> hmm
[02:04:04] <cyborg_ar> i wonder if there's a cname chain ddos attack
[02:04:20] <Phase> Moonlightning, i think it has to be explicitly supported by applications
[02:04:44] <Moonlightning> ahhh
[02:04:45] <cyborg_ar> make a really long chain of cnames that hit several servers to DOS a recursive server
[02:04:56] <Phase> cyborg_ar, there'll be a limit
[02:05:09] <cyborg_ar> hehe
[02:05:29] <Phase> but feel free to set it up and dig +trace, would be interesting to see
[02:05:33] <Moonlightning> Okay…so we need an SRV that doesn't require explicit app support. :<
[02:06:21] <cyborg_ar> the number of CNAMEs to follow in a chain shall be three, two is too little, four is too much; five is right out! three are the CNAMEs to follow in a chain.

[02:19:54] <Colgate> spidershy?
[02:20:07] <Moonlightning> I dunno. Does your webserver have a name?
[02:21:05] <Moonlightning> It's sort of an anycast thing.
[02:21:15] <Moonlightning> You can use any of these names.
[02:21:48] <Moonlightning> Like SRV, but without specifying more information than that, and without requiring explicit app support.
[02:21:49] <Colgate> Server:"Rainbow Dash - Serving at the speed of rainbooms"
[02:21:50] <Colgate> ha
[02:22:56] <Moonlightning> The implication is that the a server with an ANY record pointing to it provides that service.
[02:23:06] <Moonlightning> It's cleaner than having all those IPs in multiple places.
[02:23:12] <Moonlightning> AND
[02:23:30] <Colgate> yeah, lets make another standard for dns!
[02:23:48] <Moonlightning> It also lets you point the root of the zone at something, for e.g. Web purposes, so people can forgo the leading `www.` when typing into their address bar 9.9
[02:24:21] <Moonlightning> Rather than having to `www CNAME @` and then have A and AAAA records for @, which is incredibly dirty
[02:24:23] <Colgate> um, but you don't need a www.?
[02:24:51] <Moonlightning> If www doesn't resolve, it doesn't resolve. :p
[02:24:55] <Moonlightning> er
[02:25:01] <Colgate> www. is just historical, it isn't needed
[02:25:17] <Moonlightning> What, all major web browsers try www if @ doesn't resolve?
[02:25:32] <Colgate> and? programs can do whatever they want
[02:25:56] <Moonlightning> I'm asking you if they do. Because I'd been assuming they don't.

[02:31:21] <Moonlightning> Why should @ be the same as www for some intents and purposes?
[02:31:45] <Moonlightning> But not the same as irc?
[02:31:48] <Moonlightning> Why is HTTP special?
[02:32:07] <Colgate> because people are stupid and don't know about the thousands of other protocols besides http
[02:32:22] <Moonlightning> /Because people are stupid/ is not a good reason for something like this.
[02:32:34] <Moonlightning> It's unclean. :p
[02:32:36] <Colgate> SRV already exists
[02:32:46] <Moonlightning> But it requires explicit application support.
[02:33:03] <Colgate> your solution does too?
[02:33:07] <Moonlightning> No it doesn't?
[02:33:18] <Colgate> how doesn't it
[02:33:33] <Moonlightning> Same way CNAME doesn't?
[02:33:52] <Colgate> that just returns another address to look up
[02:34:05] <Moonlightning> ANY does, too.
[02:34:08] <Moonlightning> Only /multiple/ addresses.
[02:34:29] <Colgate> how is this better than multiple A/AAAA records?
[02:35:19] <Moonlightning> It's cleaner. You don't have to specify IPs multiple times, and you have more of a structure.
[02:35:42] <Colgate> not good enough of a reason, will never get adopted
[02:35:47] <Moonlightning> Service names (like irc and www) have ANY records for machine names (like cadance and chrysalis) that support those services, and those names have address records
[02:36:32] <Colgate> you do realize that a lot of this stuff is just automated

[06:24:46] <SilverEagle> so Seagate has a sale going on, 3x3TB barracauda 7200rpm drives for $240...compared to a single WD Red 4TB at $220
[06:24:56] <SilverEagle> considering I don't give *that* much of a damn about my data
[06:25:00] <SilverEagle> lol
[06:25:21] <JustAberrant> I got burned way too much by seagate when they had that bad batch
[06:25:59] <SilverEagle> well I mean
[06:26:07] <SilverEagle> a majority of what goes onto my NAS environment is replaceable
[06:26:17] <SilverEagle> the irreplaceable stuff is backed up super-redundantly
[06:27:02] <SilverEagle> convention footage isn't replaceable, but it's also not all that useful beyond like a month afterward
[06:28:01] <SilverEagle> but that's a huge price differential
[06:28:38] <SilverEagle> and isn't the whole thing with WD Reds that they spin *slower* to preserve lifespan
[06:30:35] <SilverEagle> I guess they're specifically built for NAS...ses in several ways
[06:30:37] <Googie> Should already have traditional backup anyway, so I'd say that's probably a decent deal. RAID5 gives you 6TB with medicre redundancy.
[06:31:02] <JustAberrant> meh.. I've got a raid6 and a complete mirror server.. but replacing disks is still a huge pain in the ass
[06:31:53] * Googie has been looking into increasing his home storage. 4TB isn't enough these days.
[06:32:05] <JustAberrant> hehe
[06:32:19] <Googie> Still wondering if I can justify setting up one of these: http://www.norcotek.com/product_images/rpc-4224b.jpg
[06:32:25] <JustAberrant> I wanna upgrade all my stuff.. but yeah.. probably won't do that till next year
[06:32:32] <SilverEagle> yeah I have about 9TB internal (1TB SSD + 2x4TB Seagates)
[06:32:36] <Googie> Probably about a $1200 build or so.
[06:32:37] <SilverEagle> but it's not raided
[06:32:44] <SilverEagle> and I want a NAS anyhow
[06:33:03] <SilverEagle> see this is the problem I have though...if I go buy a NAS, and I wanna put these two drives straight in it
[06:33:15] <SilverEagle> where do you store the 8TB of crap on it if it decides it *has* to reformat them
[06:33:31] <SilverEagle> you gotta go get disks anyway
[06:33:50] <JustAberrant> Googie: I'm more or less considering the 16 bay version of that
[06:34:01] <SilverEagle> terrible idea: rentable hard drives
[06:34:02] <JustAberrant> (probably only use 12 bays)
[06:34:07] <Googie> The 16 bay doesn't exist here in Aus
[06:34:47] <Googie> And yeah, no way I'd use 24 bays

[06:37:06] <Googie> They're pretty low power consumption. I can't recall exactly, but IIRC my UPS was telling me about 30w or so ?
[06:37:12] <SilverEagle> orly?
[06:37:18] <SilverEagle> that's nuffin

[06:38:33] <SilverEagle> not bad

[07:59:34] <SilverEagle> I may end up wanting the faster (yet much more $$) RN314
[08:00:05] <Phase> the higher end models are much faster, and have x86 chips

[08:01:01] <Phase> thought i had updated that
[08:01:53] <SilverEagle> ah yep the 314 has an Atom on it
[08:01:57] <SilverEagle> 2.1ghz dual core
[08:02:06] <SilverEagle> and can do on-the-fly transcoding
[08:02:08] <SilverEagle> which cheapie can't
[08:02:22] <SilverEagle> but cheapie can still do plex, just untranscoded
[08:07:56] <Colgate> oh, 20TB storage, not 20TB memory XD
[08:08:03] <SilverEagle> hahah
[08:08:04] <Colgate> 20TB memory would be crazy >.>
[08:11:57] <SilverEagle> ok so current cheapin' out plan is

[08:25:00] <SilverEagle> but Netgear is already preconfiged
[08:25:02] <Googie> It's about the size and shape of a 4 bay NAS
[08:25:27] <Googie> I suppose it depends, I'd view preconfigured as a negative :P
[08:26:42] <Phase> Microserves aren't bad but it doesn't come with a nice interface
[08:26:53] <Phase> plus it has glacial boot speed
[08:27:17] <SilverEagle> yea I kinda want the NAS
[08:27:27] <SilverEagle> since it also has a lot of really nice x-raid features
[08:27:30] <Googie> I guess I've never noticed that, I never reboot it + SSH is fine for me on something like that
[08:27:41] <SilverEagle> it can re-raid without needing to teardown/recreate the raid
[08:28:31] <Phase> it runs btrfs ontop of that
[08:28:45] <Phase> so you avoid the sharp edges of btrfs arrays and get cheap snapshots
