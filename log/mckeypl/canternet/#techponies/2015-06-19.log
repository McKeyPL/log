[03:54:32] <GigabitPony> um, how do i update flash player with a tar.bz2 file?
[03:54:54] <GigabitPony> er firefox i mean
[03:56:39] <Webster> Depends on the OS you're using and whether it's a binary install or source install.
[03:56:49] <GigabitPony> source I think
[03:56:57] <GigabitPony> it directed me to the firefox download page
[03:57:57] <Webster> Then you'd remove the program files from the previous version, build from the source according to the directions, e.g. ./configure && make, then install e.g. sudo make install.
[03:58:09] <Webster> If you can just get a premade package for your OS it'd probably be a lot cleaner, though.
[03:58:41] <Webster> If it's Debian/Ubuntu/etc usually just 'sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade' will update Firefox if there's a new version.

[06:08:09] <JustAberrant> Mono|Depressed: much of c++ is platform dependent, there are obviously compilers for c++ for windows (and just about every other platform in existence), but software not specically written for windows tends to be a pain to compile on windows

[06:13:58] <Mono|Depressed> thats the cons of c++
[06:16:12] <JustAberrant> that's why the great fire cactus gave us build systems
[06:18:15] <Phase> Mono|Depressed, hence why make exists :P
[06:18:50] <Phase> *.c: *.o: g++ -c $@ -o $^ ?
[06:18:56] <Phase> i forget the magic variables in make

[06:19:36] <JustAberrant> ;p
[06:19:52] <Phase> make is fine
[06:19:56] * JustAberrant will spare you all his usual make rant ;p
[06:20:31] <Phase> only problem i've ever had is remembering which of $^, $@, $! and so on actually does something

[06:21:12] <Phase> ones the input filename, ones the output filename

[06:21:56] *** Flowheart is now known as Starburn
[06:22:20] <Phase> JustAberrant, having used grunt, ant, and a few other 'new-age' build systems, i really wish more people just used make
[06:22:46] <JustAberrant> :(
[06:23:05] <Phase> mostly grunt and ant, they're awful scripting languages more than an actual build system
[06:23:13] <Phase> grunt being litterally javascript
[06:23:20] <JustAberrant> hehe
[06:23:27] <JustAberrant> you really want my make rant? ;p
[06:23:40] <Phase> i'm curious
[06:24:40] <JustAberrant> my big complaint is that it makes things that should be really simple very complicated
[06:24:50] <JustAberrant> especially if you arn't interested in manually listing out source files
[06:25:40] <Phase> complicated how?
[06:26:04] <JustAberrant> well ok, lets do a really simple (and common) use case
[06:26:18] <JustAberrant> you've got a directory structure along the lines of...
[06:26:47] <JustAberrant> src/pony_configuration/some_class.cpp
[06:26:52] <JustAberrant> src/pony_configuration/some_other_class.cpp
[06:27:05] <JustAberrant> src/pony_presentation/some_third_class.cpp
[06:27:25] <JustAberrant> you want to generate a similar structure of object files..
[06:27:35] <JustAberrant> i.e. obj/pony_configuration/some_class.o
[06:27:45] <JustAberrant> and then link it all together into some binary
[06:27:48] <JustAberrant> right?
[06:27:50] <Phase> obj/*.o: *.c doesn't work?
[06:27:50] <JustAberrant> dead simple use case
[06:28:01] <JustAberrant> Phase: not with the directories involved
[06:28:11] <JustAberrant> at least not easily
[06:28:31] <Phase> i'm sure it can do that
[06:28:49] <JustAberrant> without having to list either all the source files or all the directories?
[06:29:26] <JustAberrant> or end up with some silly recursive series of make files in each directory?
[06:29:26] *** GamerArtemis is now known as Gigabit
[06:29:26] <Phase> with a single makefile you'd need to call out to find or something
[06:30:12] <Phase> JustAberrant, that's fair i guess
[06:31:35] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (Bluepon@Pony-scppg6.s0tm.sdub.0151.2601.IP) (Quit: Ping timeout: -1 second)
[06:31:50] <JustAberrant> Phase: that's my point
[06:31:56] <JustAberrant> like, literally, the simplest usecase
[06:32:00] <JustAberrant> and it already can't just do it
[06:32:14] <JustAberrant> not to mention it comes to a dead stop if you have spaces in file names
[06:32:17] <Phase> well simpliest wouldn't place it in a separate directory
[06:32:24] <JustAberrant> well ok
[06:32:29] <JustAberrant> but still pretty damn simple
[06:32:34] <Phase> Yeah, that's always been trouble with unix tools
[06:32:39] <Phase> no one deals with spaces
[06:32:51] <Phase> but tbh i'd say don't use spaces
[06:33:07] <JustAberrant> well yes, ideally ;p
[06:33:25] <JustAberrant> and then we get into the fact that the syntax around wildcards is just plain confusing
[06:33:58] <Phase> JustAberrant, http://gittup.org/tup/ex_a_first_tupfile.html there is this
[06:33:58] <PinkiePieBot> [ tup | A First Tupfile ]
[06:34:24] <Phase> and it might support extended globs
[06:34:32] <Phase> where ** recurses directories
[06:35:12] <JustAberrant> well yes, there are better build systems that deal with this
[06:35:15] <JustAberrant> my point is that make sucks
[06:35:34] <Phase> i would actually like something better than make
[06:38:48] <JustAberrant> :)
[06:39:05] <Phase> JustAberrant, by which i mean, what are these better systems you speak of?
[06:39:10] * Phase is sick of language-specific crap
[06:39:22] <JustAberrant> most c++ build systems suck imo :(
[06:39:33] <JustAberrant> I've actually yet to find one I like
[06:39:51] <JustAberrant> I tend to use cmake
[06:39:55] <JustAberrant> but it's quite terrible
[06:40:11] * Phase <rage>cmake</rage>
[06:40:27] <JustAberrant> hehe
[06:40:32] <JustAberrant> well, there's scons ;p
[06:40:36] <Phase> stupid c/c++ specific box of magic
[06:40:47] <Phase> isn't scons just python scripts?
[06:40:49] <JustAberrant> if, you know, you want to make your c++ even more fun by adding python into the mix ;p
[06:40:53] <JustAberrant> yeah
[06:41:26] <Phase> ok, scons is like cmake but written in python
[06:42:02] <JustAberrant> and there's autotools, which is like making sweet sweet love to a cheesegrater 
[06:42:21] <Phase> autotools isn't even a build system, its a config generator
[06:42:40] <JustAberrant> sure, but it also ultimately gives you the makefile you use
[06:42:47] <JustAberrant> so it's kinda build system-ish
[06:43:14] <Phase> from templates you write
[06:44:00] <JustAberrant> fair `nuff
[06:44:17] <JustAberrant> theoretically you can use ant ;p
[06:44:22] <Phase> i've used ant
[06:44:23] <Phase> once
[06:44:28] <JustAberrant> but I can only imagine how well that works with c++
[06:44:41] <JustAberrant> hey now, ant was amazing when it first came out
[06:44:55] <Phase> you'd have to write out your own tasks for c/c++ compilers, end result would be like cmake but written in xml
[06:44:56] <JustAberrant> ant+ivy is still pretty big
[06:45:01] <JustAberrant> personally I prefer maven
[06:45:04] <JustAberrant> (this is all for java)
[06:45:11] <JustAberrant> I haven't jumped on the gradle bandwagon
[06:45:18] <Phase> and ant is *still* a script, it has no concept of dependencies
[06:45:19] <JustAberrant> c++ really needs a maven equivilent :(
[06:45:49] <JustAberrant> Phase: well, that's not entirely true.. it has targets that depend on other targets
[06:46:02] <JustAberrant> ivy adds proper dependency management though
[06:46:11] <JustAberrant> as in "oh, you need junit.. let me just grab that for you.."
[06:46:33] <Phase> not library dependencies
[06:47:01] <JustAberrant> maven basically does what everyone ultimately ends up doing in an ant+ivy setup with like 1000 lines of xml and just does it by default
[06:47:02] <Phase> fundamentally what i want to write is source files x though command y makes z
[06:47:05] <JustAberrant> which is.. pretty awesome
[06:47:29] <Phase> and z plus b makes a
[06:47:36] <Phase> and so on
[06:47:54] <JustAberrant> I dunno, sounds great on paper, but as make demonstrates, it makes common use cases way more difficult then they need to be :(
[06:47:57] <Phase> i did like ants concept of a file selector
[06:48:17] <JustAberrant> maven basically says..
[06:48:27] <JustAberrant> oh, you've got an src/ folder with a bunch of java files in it
[06:48:32] <JustAberrant> you probably want me to compile those..
[06:48:34] <Phase> JustAberrant, the trivial problem you presented is one of implementation, not method
[06:48:37] <JustAberrant> and maybe turn them into a jar file
[06:48:45] <Phase> yeah, i don't like that
[06:48:54] <JustAberrant> it's like, stupidly brilliant
[06:48:55] <Phase> because the moment you want something slightly weird
[06:49:15] <JustAberrant> well that's the thing, it's easy enough to override that
[06:49:23] <Phase> JustAberrant, https://github.com/ariscop/paintchat/blob/master/build.xml the one time i used ant
[06:49:24] <PinkiePieBot> [ paintchat/build.xml at master · ariscop/paintchat · GitHub ]
[06:49:39] <JustAberrant> you typically have your configuration already to pull in dependencies
[06:49:50] <JustAberrant> maven just takes a lot of common use cases and makes them really easy to implement
[06:50:08] <JustAberrant> rather than trying to be built around some declarative/other approach
[06:50:14] <Phase> needed to generate two jars from the same sources, and zip some resources
[06:50:47] <Phase> i don't even know how the netbeans generated stuff works
[06:50:48] <JustAberrant> mm
[06:50:53] <JustAberrant> hehe
[06:51:19] <Phase> JustAberrant, i don't want "magic box that builds my code", that's ant, maven, cmake, scons, visual studio, so on
[06:51:25] <Phase> i want 'tool that makes files into other files'
[06:51:38] <JustAberrant> we have that, it's called a compiler ;p
[06:51:45] <Phase> there's more than one kind of file
[06:51:47] <JustAberrant> (I do get what you mean)
[06:52:03] <JustAberrant> the problem is at some point you need to arrange those files 
[06:52:23] <JustAberrant> and that's where tools that provide that "turn x into y" generic ruleset fall apart
[06:52:38] <JustAberrant> and yes, you could implement make style declarative configuration with a sane way of dealing with a practical source tree
[06:52:42] <JustAberrant> but.. I don't think anyone has
[06:53:09] <Phase> no, everyones doing https://github.com/ariscop/iris/blob/elemental-client/Gruntfile.js instead
[06:53:10] <PinkiePieBot> [ iris/Gruntfile.js at elemental-client · ariscop/iris · GitHub ]
[06:53:27] <JustAberrant> hehe
[06:53:28] <Phase> though in some cases (like ^) file order matters
[06:53:41] <Phase> and you'll notice that there's a makefile and gruntfile
[06:53:45] <JustAberrant> I get the same icky feeling with gradle
[06:53:57] <Phase> there's actionscript in that repo, grunt doesn't have any way to handle actionscript
[06:54:10] <Phase> where as it's two lines of make
[06:54:21] <Phase> ah, it's $^ and ^@
[06:54:36] <JustAberrant> http://svn.justaberrant.com/viewvc.cgi/DerpyDCM/branches/01__initial/server/pom.xml?revision=29  .. since we're sharing ;p 
[06:54:36] <PinkiePieBot> [ [DerpyDCM] Contents of /branches/01__initial/server/pom.xml ]
[06:54:43] <Phase> though i don't remember if $^ is the one i want... one only lists changed files
[06:55:19] <Phase> JustAberrant, i... can't even see what thats ment to do
[06:55:39] <JustAberrant> yeah, I'll admit.. it's.. not the most intuitive
[06:55:53] <JustAberrant> but once you accept it into your spleen.. it's wuvily
[06:56:24] *** Quits: cyborg_ar (cyborgar@Pony-6ha.u4o.25.181.IP) (Client exited)
[06:56:30] <Phase> why does your build system need 5 plugins just to get its job done
[06:56:56] <JustAberrant> maven is very plugin based
[06:56:57] <Phase> *.class: *.java, out.jar: $(sources)
[06:57:18] <Phase> i mean yeah you have the problem of listing sources but is this much infrastructure really an acceptable alternative?
[06:58:03] <JustAberrant> but basically, that will pull in junit, log4j, and derpydcm-lib (part of that projects), and spit out a jar 
[06:58:17] <JustAberrant> the shade plugin produces a jar that contains all the dependencies built in
[06:58:31] <Phase> the fetching part i get (though imo npm does it better)
[06:58:39] <JustAberrant> it will also bundle in any files in a resources/ directory
[06:58:42] <JustAberrant> generate javadocs
[06:58:47] <JustAberrant> and do a bunch of other little tricks
[06:59:52] <JustAberrant> oh yes, and will do unit testing/generate reports/etc
[07:01:21] <JustAberrant> but yeah
[07:01:29] <JustAberrant> it is basically a big box o` magic that you have to know how to use
[07:01:35] <JustAberrant> I will admit that
[07:01:51] <JustAberrant> I've done enough stuff with it that I basically have a huge sample set to pull bits and pieces I need
[07:02:00] <Phase> yeah, again, its the big 'ol box of magic bit i hate
[07:02:08] <JustAberrant> gradle is worse imo
[07:02:11] <Phase> we need *less* magic in build systems, not *more*
[07:02:25] <JustAberrant> thing is, maven works really damn well ;p
[07:02:28] <Phase> i'm sure the enterprise market loves their black boxes but no, please no
[07:03:41] <JustAberrant> the dependency management (as in libraries) feature though is imo what c++ really could use
[07:03:43] <Phase> JustAberrant, the particular problem i had with cmake was trying to generate preprocessed files to throw at clang-scan
[07:03:57] <JustAberrant> not just for dealing with external ones, but internal ones
[07:04:11] <JustAberrant> it makes it so nice to be able to have a project that's multiple components
[07:04:26] <Phase> JustAberrant, genrally i've seen git submodules or similar for that
[07:04:35] <JustAberrant> so you have your  ponies-lib project, that you compile and "publish" an artefact to your local repository
[07:04:45] <JustAberrant> and then you have a ponies-client project that depends on it
[07:04:50] <Phase> or git-subtree
[07:05:13] <JustAberrant> and then you can also publish your ponies-lib artifact to a remote repository and other people building  ponies-client can pull it in
[07:05:14] <JustAberrant> etc
[07:05:40] <JustAberrant> it's a very flexible feature

[15:36:54] <JustAberrant> I.. sure hope not :>
[15:37:20] <JustAberrant> someone, somewhere probably wrote a plugin for irssi
[15:37:27] <Mono|Depressed> I mean HexChat is a bitch nowadays
[15:37:31] <JustAberrant> it wouldn't be hard to do.. mIRC scripting was pretty simple
[15:37:33] <JustAberrant> but still
[15:37:58] <Mono|Depressed> i wish irrsi can have their own language
[15:38:06] <Mono|Depressed> *irssi
[15:38:10] <JustAberrant> why?
[15:38:23] <Mono|Depressed> because perl is hard
[15:38:35] <JustAberrant> there's already plenty of good scripting languages, each tool introducing yet another one is silly
[15:38:37] <Mono|Depressed> and client that owns a language is easy
[15:38:54] <Mono|Depressed> are some easy?
[15:39:13] <Mono|Depressed> i don't really read the python documentation
[15:39:13] <JustAberrant> yeah but perl is far more powerful than a custom language, and gives you access to the billions of libraries already out there
[15:40:24] <JustAberrant> :(
[15:40:53] <Mono|Depressed> perl is a pain because you don't have modules
[15:40:59] <JustAberrant> .. yes you do
[15:41:17] <JustAberrant> perl is built around the idea of packages/modules
[15:42:13] <JustAberrant> http://www.cpan.org/modules/
[15:42:13] <PinkiePieBot> [ Perl Modules - www.cpan.org ]
[15:42:23] <Mono|Depressed> yes but some of them are malware
[15:42:51] <Mono|Depressed> look at python, they have modules
[15:43:01] <JustAberrant> uhm, what?
[15:43:41] <JustAberrant> modules are just a language feature, yes you could put malware in a module, same as you could in any languages module/package system..
[15:44:16] <Mono|Depressed> CPAN should remove all the malware
[15:44:41] <JustAberrant> what's this malware you speak of?
[15:45:03] <JustAberrant> I imagine they probably would remove something if it was reported
[15:45:44] <Mono|Depressed> http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=977218
[15:45:48] <PinkiePieBot> [ Malware on CPAN ]
[15:46:48] <JustAberrant> uhm.. the comments to that would seem to confirm my initial reaction..
[15:47:12] <JustAberrant> "I haven't heard of any malicious code upload to CPAN."    " I know of 3 in the last 12 years which were quasi-fishy uploads with potential "   "...and I've never experienced any, at least with the 'name brand' ones that are often recommended here on PerlMonks."    .. etc
[15:47:59] <JustAberrant> any system where people upload things for public consumption can be abused, it seems like cpan does as good a job as you can expect of policing it..
[15:48:19] <johnsey> perl is only hard to read, not to write ;) 
[15:48:34] <JustAberrant> hehe, can't it be both :>
[15:48:51] * JustAberrant likes perl.. but even I admit after like a few months of not using it I have to google for stuff that should be basic
[15:49:05] <JustAberrant> it's a language of a wide variety of incantations and some non-intuitive language mechanics
[15:49:06] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: I didn't. It just doesn't have a driver that supports AP mode.
[15:49:15] <johnsey> that's the same thing with any language though, every language has some weird specifics
[15:49:16] <JustAberrant> the language mechanics you learn, the incantations you forget ;p
[15:49:21] <johnsey> else there'd be only 1 language
[15:49:27] <JustAberrant> yeah, but perl seems to be built on them ;p
[15:49:46] <JustAberrant> and has such a huge variety
[15:49:49] <johnsey> i think you're just getting confused by the ability to do things more than 1 way
[15:49:59] <johnsey> which is the concept of perl :)
[15:50:03] <JustAberrant> I'd say they are one and the same
[15:50:18] <JustAberrant> ability to do things more than 1 way == lots of weird incantations
[15:50:19] <johnsey> "There's more than one way to do it" Larry Wall
[15:50:34] <JustAberrant> doesn't make it simpler ;p
[15:50:47] <johnsey> but much more fun!
[15:50:49] <johnsey> :D
[15:50:54] <JustAberrant> I already said I liked perl ;p
[15:51:04] <johnsey> like it or hate it
[15:51:33] <JustAberrant> I just admit that it's not a straight forward language to use
[15:52:00] <JustAberrant> when you start getting into nested collections, the various combinations of referencing/dereferencing get quite whimsical
[15:52:32] <JustAberrant> @{HASH{^%$some->->{}%->{%{....
[15:52:57] <johnsey> i dunno, to me it just seems like syntax details you either learn or put up as a ref sheet somewhere, or just look up quickly
[15:53:05] <johnsey> doesn't make it harder imho
[15:53:27] <johnsey> i have to look up how to do $things in python, too, whenever i manage to force myself to use it
[15:53:54] <JustAberrant> sure, but contrast it to c++ or java, which have a very simple set of language mechanics and put all the functionality within it
[15:54:12] <JustAberrant> you can usually intuitively figure out what you need to do, especially with auto-completion
[15:54:17] <johnsey> c++ is the last thing i'd consider as "simple language"
[15:54:25] <JustAberrant> well, the language is simple ;p
[15:54:29] <JustAberrant> ok, well, it was simple
[15:54:32] <johnsey> WAS
[15:54:34] <JustAberrant> it's.. gotten more complicated
[15:54:37] <johnsey> then there was stuff tacked on
[15:54:43] <JustAberrant> yes ;p
[15:55:00] <Mono|Depressed> Python is simply mindfucked
[15:55:04] <Mono|Depressed> because
[15:55:05] <Mono|Depressed> a, b = 3, 4
[15:55:14] <johnsey> just go through all the things added in the latest standards, it's madness. sure, i can see the convenience of these features, but they raise the entry bar
[15:55:27] <JustAberrant> c++ is flailing imo
[15:55:39] <JustAberrant> they tried to add all the nifty stuff everyone likes from more modern languages
[15:55:42] <JustAberrant> but it just doesn't fit
[15:55:46] <JustAberrant> and yeah, it's messy as hell
