[00:02:00] <Quindo> well, I did not want to just dump 500 predefined records into the database which would not have been hard.

[00:41:02] <Lapsus> the camera on the vive seems like you could do some really interesting stuff with it, mainly that it's tracked as accurately as the rest of the headset
[00:41:06] <Kinsley> I do want to see VR and AR go very mainstream.
[00:41:44] <Kinsley> But the necessity of high-res screens at very high refresh rates means we need huge leaps in GPU power quickly and cheaply.

[00:42:19] *** WuBzY is now known as WuBzYIsSoTired
[00:42:37] <Lapsus> apparently the recommended config for the rift cv1 is a 970 and a reasonable quadcore processor
[00:42:50] <Googie> Kinsley: The other option is pulling back on scene complexity
[00:43:05] <Googie> Yeah.
[00:43:31] <Lapsus> eye tracking and foveated rendering would also reduce gpu load
[00:43:35] <Googie> As odd as it might sound, you don't need photorealism in VR

[00:44:11] <Phase> non-photorealism would be preferable imo
[00:44:29] <Phase> both for lower gpu load and the fact that i'm not sticking a screen on my face to see what i could see by going outside

[01:24:13] <Quindo> But figuring out how to do it is the fun part.
[01:27:51] <Quindo> I think I just need to change to a self calling function that is actually able to yeild when it hits a child cap.

[01:29:20] <RazorSharpFang> I've never used a foreach construct.

[02:56:47] <Sour_Sweet> I sadly need CardDAV and CalDAV though as well as a proper sharing API.

[03:04:05] <RazorSharpFang> One day, I'll learn to roll my own software.
[03:04:12] <RazorSharpFang> In the meantime, I'm using Java
[03:05:14] <RazorSharpFang> I'm always irked at how long and wordy java code is.
[03:05:23] <RazorSharpFang> BufferedWriter output = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream()));
[03:05:27] <RazorSharpFang> I mean, just look at that.
[03:05:54] <Sour_Sweet> RazorSharpFang: Solution: Screw Java
[03:06:06] <RazorSharpFang> Java's the only language I know well enough right now.
[03:06:31] <Sour_Sweet> God I hate Java. It's like nothing in written in Java is actually done properly :D
[03:06:34] <mniip> now to make this ANSI-compliant
[03:06:52] <RazorSharpFang> I'm learning C++ this semester, so hopefully I'm learn to do stuff the C++ way.
[03:07:23] <Moonlightning> Colgate: nah
[03:07:30] <Moonlightning> I'm just suspicious of owncloud.
[03:07:36] <Moonlightning> Isn't it like closedsource or something?
[03:07:48] <RazorSharpFang> Sour_Sweet: A lot of my problems stem from not knowing how to use the libraries of C/C++ or the libraries of the OS natively, like WinSocket.
[03:07:59] <RazorSharpFang> But I've been taught java, so I know how to use that.
[03:08:09] * HoneyDrops just uses ssh and sshfs.  For the rare case I have to serve a file otherwise, I'll fire up nginx.
[03:08:09] <Sour_Sweet> Strange thing is I like Mono/.NET which is somewhat similar to Java.
[03:08:31] <RazorSharpFang> Similar? It's almost one-to-one. :^)
[03:08:47] <RazorSharpFang> Maybe you just dislike java on principal.
[03:08:55] * Moonlightning keeps nginx running. Has quite a bit of stuff that's served to the general public.
[03:08:58] <Sour_Sweet> HoneyDrops: Firewalls are a thing. Doing it over clean SSH is not always possible
[03:09:39] <Sour_Sweet> Nor do I want to SSH into/onto my server from an unsafe machine
[03:09:41] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: tunnel SSH over TLS, bind to port 443
[03:09:54] <Moonlightning> Oh, that, definitely
[03:09:59] <RazorSharpFang> Sour_Sweet: Anything interesting would probably require either a wrapper library, or using an OS's libraries which would lock me into that operating system.

[03:16:30] <Sour_Sweet> I useally only use TLS when talking about the protocol or StartTLS
[03:17:36] <Moonlightning> starttls is stupid
[03:17:40] <Colgate> I use the terms interchangeably
[03:17:48] <Colgate> what's stupid about it?
[03:17:54] <HoneyDrops> I don't generally refer to either.
[03:17:55] <Sour_Sweet> It's actually great
[03:18:15] <Moonlightning> Just listen for TLS or $application_protocol on the same port
[03:18:22] <Moonlightning> They're not likely to me ambiguous :V
[03:18:26] <Colgate> starttls is great because then you don't need different ports for TLS/non-TLS
[03:18:29] <Moonlightning> s/ or / and /
[03:18:51] <Sour_Sweet> Well starttls just does that
[03:19:00] <Sour_Sweet> Except for it waits for the command
[03:19:02] <Moonlightning> Noooo…starttls requires that you indicate it.
[03:19:15] <Moonlightning> Rather than just either initiating a TLS handshake, or…not doing so.
[03:19:25] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah which will avoid confusion
[03:19:44] <Sour_Sweet> And also makes implementation easier

[03:25:28] <HoneyDrops> Well, depends on who's firewall.  ISPs should block nothing, ever.

[03:27:49] <RazorSharpFang> Sour_Sweet: My ISP doesn't support IPv6 at all.

[03:28:22] <Moonlightning> I've found a network on which my VPN doesn't work :/
[03:28:31] <Colgate> an upstream firewall intercepts all of my AAAA lookups and returns NXDOMAIN
[03:28:45] <Colgate> which obviously causes issues
[03:28:45] <Moonlightning> Colgate: dnssec!
[03:29:02] <Colgate> dnssec isn't supported enough for that to be a viable solution

[03:29:22] <RazorSharpFang> If it's not viable, is it also infeasible?

[03:29:37] <Moonlightning> speaking of…are you supposed to redo nsec3 chains less frequently than once an hour? <.<
[03:29:43] <Colgate> the box in question doesn't even have ipv6

[03:30:37] <Moonlightning> On another unrelated note, can you de-ess with like ffmpeg or something?
[03:30:40] <Moonlightning> this is pretty horrible
[03:30:44] <RazorSharpFang> I didn't realize NSLookups could be done through TCP
[03:30:47] <Colgate> there isn't any good way that I've found to block outgoing(or incoming) AAAA lookups :(
[03:31:24] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: clients are supposed to try with UDP, and then try with TCP if that fails somehow or if it gets truncated (maybe only if they need more than what they got?)
[03:31:34] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: do you read the standards?
[03:31:39] <Colgate> I found that bind9 has an option for not resolving AAAA on incoming ipv4, but that requires a recompile
[03:32:07] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: I can't possibly, I've got too much to read anyway. Financial documents seem to be just as hard as computer techncal documents

[03:45:27] <HoneyDrops>  Akitakomachi is good too, bit more of a "nutty" flavor.
[03:45:30] <RazorSharpFang> I haven't heard of that in Perth.
[03:46:24] <HoneyDrops> Go to a proper Asian grocery store (Japanese or Korean over Chinese or SE-asian), check the rice section.
[03:46:43] <RazorSharpFang> I've never seen an asian grocery store.
[03:47:58] <HoneyDrops> Also don't overcook it, you need to wash it, let it drain, then soak for ~30-60 min in a 1:1.1 rice to water ratio, then bring to a boil over med-high heat, turn down to med-low and simmer for ~7-8 minutes.
[03:48:22] <HoneyDrops> The let sit, also lidded for 15-20 minutes before fluffing.

[03:49:41] <HoneyDrops> Should be a very, very light fluff.  Otherwise it will break up the grains and make it mushy :(
[03:50:17] * HoneyDrops wants to make some rice now…
[03:51:15] <RazorSharpFang> Hmm, seems like a lot of effort. Will this rice taste different to store-brand white rice?
[03:52:27] <HoneyDrops> I dunno what your "white rice" is, but if it's like here in the US, and the parboiled stuff… yeah it will have a flavor.
[03:52:45] * Moonlightning was brought up on rice.
[03:52:49] <HoneyDrops> Is it called "converted" rice?
[03:53:37] <RazorSharpFang> It's just called "white long grain rice"
[03:55:09] <HoneyDrops> Ok, look for medium grain ones.
[03:55:46] <RazorSharpFang> I'll take a look when I get the chance. I'm off to sleep now, so cyas.

[04:18:28] <HoneyDrops> I would rather get random ads than targeted ones, if for no other reason that I object to the entire systems of monitoring the populace to better target manipulations.
[04:21:39] <Sour_Sweet> I don't like the idea of tracking either, but I can see the value of targeted ads for the user. Sad thing is that the ad serving industry won't realize this until it's too late. Good old times when ads actually contained some information
[04:22:44] <HoneyDrops> As far as I'm concerned, the entire ad industry could burst into flames tomorrow and nothing of value would be lost.

[07:53:40] <JustAberrant> I believe in capitalism kept in check with strong regulation and a moderate amount of socialism ;p
[07:53:43] <HoneyDrops> I honestly don't care who has material wealth, and I'm not all that concerned with the distribution of it.  Though I do favor a more equitable sharing.  My main concern is that material wealth can be and is used to allow individuals in exert a greater degree of influence over society.
[07:55:17] <HoneyDrops> So, if they cannot be decoupled, it follows that the only way to equalize the capacity to influence society between all persons is to equalize the material wealth.  It's not a goal unto itself, just what seems to be the least indirect manner.

[07:59:31] <JustAberrant> most of those discovers are driven by wealth
[07:59:41] <JustAberrant> looking at the history of china is actually very interesting in that regard
[07:59:55] <JustAberrant> a _lot_ of stuff showed up in china early on but was never put to serious use
[08:00:14] <JustAberrant> largely because up until recently china was totally about pigeonholing
[08:00:33] <HoneyDrops> van Goth would be a good counter example, commercial failure, but amazing art.
[08:00:35] <JustAberrant> if your parents were farmers you were a farmer and your kid would be a farmer, didn't matter what you did
[08:00:58] <JustAberrant> so there was no incentive to really innovate
[08:01:30] <JustAberrant> in our society if you discover something novel, you try to make a fortune with it
[08:01:46] <JustAberrant> in early chinese society there was no reason to 
[08:01:57] <HoneyDrops> I would argue there is a larger cultural problem, there is an innate joy of discovery and creation - we just manage to beat it out of our children far too often.
[08:02:37] <JustAberrant> sure, but things take more than just discovering them, a lot of time there's hard and unpleasant work
[08:02:39] <Compu> HoneyDrops: i would happily transfer to a robot body if the body was a pony
[08:03:09] <JustAberrant> also there's no incentive to share or to try to find other uses not of a direct interest to you
[08:03:14] <JustAberrant> best example: gun powder
[08:03:22] <HoneyDrops> Work, sure?  But it doesn't have to be unpleasant.
[08:03:25] <JustAberrant> the Chinese discovered it and did nothing with it

[23:59:30] <Quindo> hehe, reminds me of the person who was playing with a zqsd layout in counter strike...
[23:59:31] <Phase> i'd make it a menu key but that's something i need on windows more than linux
[23:59:49] <Phase> Quindo, that's... a very specific layout
[23:59:57] <mniip> Quindo, the controls have got to be configurable
