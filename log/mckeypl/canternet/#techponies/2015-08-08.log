[04:47:09] <Gladiolus> "When first released in 2001, Itanium's performance, compared to better-established RISC and CISC processors, was disappointing.[2][3] Emulation to run existing x86 applications and operating systems was particularly poor, with one benchmark in 2001, reporting that it was equivalent at best to a 100 MHz Pentium in this mode (1.1 GHz Pentiums were on the market at that time)."

[04:54:37] <init3> Timing out. One sec
[04:54:38] <Webster> init3: Might be a router causing issues.
[04:55:15] <init3> I am pretty sure once on my neighbor's wifi I connected to canternet via v6
[04:55:31] <Webster> Make sure you have a public IPv6 address and not just a link-local address.
[04:55:37] <init3> Hmm
[04:56:03] <init3> fe80::20c:6eff:fed2:ae2c supposedly is my address. That look right?
[04:56:12] <Moonlightning> That's link-local.
[04:56:13] <wolfyshy> nope, that's link-local
[04:56:18] <init3> Balls
[04:56:28] <init3> But that makes more sense 
[04:56:35] <Moonlightning> fe80::/10 is like 169.254/16, only actually used
[04:56:47] <init3> Right
[04:56:57] *** Quits: endoriazel (coprah@endoriazel) (Quit: ZNC - http://znc.sourceforge.net)
[04:57:07] <Moonlightning> or, wait…isn't the scope of 169.254/16 site-local, not link-local?
[04:57:19] <Moonlightning> …whatever. The point is, fe80::/10 isn't /global/
[04:57:22] <Moonlightning> which is what you need
[04:57:32] <init3> So I just gotta figure out how to tell debian to pull both. 
[04:57:40] <init3> Because I can get it to pull just v6
[04:57:51] <init3> But obviously I need both. 
[04:58:14] <init3> doing eth0:1 isn't the solution is it?
[04:58:16] <Moonlightning> The only time it's okay to use non-global addresses is when you need or //really really want// that bit of security, and in VPNs
[04:58:22] <init3> (eth0 being wan of course)
[04:58:47] <Moonlightning> If you have multiple fe80::/10 addresses, you need to specify the interface at the end, after a `%`
[04:59:13] <Moonlightning> like fe80::f00:ba2%eth0
[04:59:28] <init3> I don't want a local address though. 
[04:59:40] <Moonlightning> Oh. Uh
[04:59:40] <init3> And my ISP has DHCP V6
[04:59:41] <Moonlightning> I dunno
[04:59:59] <init3> I just got to get it to pull V4 and V6 from DHCP
[05:00:25] <wolfyshy> does debian have a auto v6 option?
[05:00:35] <init3> yes
[05:00:41] <Webster> dhclient6?
[05:00:46] *** Joins: endoriazel (coprah@Pony-81pjdu.de)
[05:00:53] <init3> Maybe I need to install that to manually do it
[05:01:20] <init3> It is somehow pulling on on its own if I have just ipv6 auto in the interfaces file
[05:02:14] <Moonlightning> @.@ …
[05:02:23] <Moonlightning> Can somepony give me a crashcourse in Gentoo useflags?
[05:02:29] <Moonlightning> The documentation seems so…dense, and I can't get into it. :(
[05:03:08] <init3> derp
[05:03:17] <init3> if only I RTFM'd
[05:03:20] <init3> dhclient -6 eth0
[05:03:58] <init3> now I can ping6 out.
[05:05:35] <HoneyDrops|Half> Moonlightning: what do you mean?  Basically if you want support for THING you add it to you useflags, if you explicitly don't, add -THING.  You put global ones in /etc/portage/make.conf and you can put per-package in /etc/portage/package.use  they will override global useflags.
[05:06:00] <Moonlightning> Uhh
[05:06:14] <Moonlightning> I think that's all I need! Thanks! XD
[05:06:32] <HoneyDrops|Half> emerge will rebuild packages with changed useflags with the N flag
[05:06:59] <init3> can someone tell me if 2001:558:6007:b:3019:d49c:c8c8:5b9c is pingable?
[05:07:00] <HoneyDrops|Half> emerge -uDNv world will do a Deep Update and rebuild packaged with New useflags.
[05:07:12] <HoneyDrops|Half> (v is just verbose, like normal)
[05:07:16] <Moonlightning> Rebuild all packages whose useflags've changed?
[05:07:17] <init3> shouldn't be
[05:07:57] <HoneyDrops|Half> Moonlightning yeah, depending on what you change... that can end up being a lot.
[05:08:05] <Moonlightning> Oh, is there not a way to change useflags from the commandline? I guess I wanted them to go in my shell history
[05:08:27] <Moonlightning> Eh, that's fine, doesn't seem like the kinda thing that'd happen a lot
[05:08:39] <Moonlightning> Just when I first install a package, and maybe later if I realized I needed a feature
[05:08:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> Umm, you can do a onetime override by setting the USE var, but it will want to rebuild later if you use N

[05:21:34] <Webster> So buy one from Newegg?
[05:21:43] <Moonlightning> Yeah, but what do I /buy/
[05:21:53] <Webster> Depends on what you need.
[05:22:04] <Moonlightning> I have a way-too-long list of criteria. :P
[05:22:19] <Moonlightning> The most important thing is that it needs to be able to do AP mode on Linux.
[05:22:36] <Webster> You could get a separate WAP instead. Lets you position it better.
[05:22:36] <Moonlightning> Because if not, it's 100% useless to me (I have no other boxes with expansion slots)
[05:22:48] <Moonlightning> Mmmmm…
[05:23:10] <Moonlightning> I dunno. I think I'd rather do a card. I've only got two ethernet ports.
[05:23:27] <Moonlightning> …/hmmmmmmmmmmmm./ How expensive are dedicated switches?
[05:23:33] <Webster> Not very.

[05:28:39] <Googie> init3: The best part ? /64 isn't a recommended allocation to home users. /56 is
[05:28:57] <init3> What? lol
[05:29:10] <init3> Why the in the fuck?
[05:29:58] <Googie> Unfortunately IPv6 has some parts of it that require a minimum subnet size of /64 to work (Namely Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)
[05:30:30] <AppleDash> I assign all my IPv6 addresses static
[05:30:33] <AppleDash> Am I not meant to do that?
[05:31:06] <AppleDash> Also, Googie, I've ran gigabit ethernet over 100 meters of Z crossconnect wire before
[05:31:12] <AppleDash> It wasn't the best but it did the job

[05:36:38] <Moonlightning> preferably one that'd do ac /and/ n at the same time, but, y'know, I'm wondering if I should just forget about ac
[05:37:36] <Webster> One I linked does ac and n, not sure about at the same time. As for AP mode, gotta just make a list of ones you're considering and then search one by one to see if they support AP mode.

[06:08:30] <Webster> Probably a Cintiq, but that's pricey.
[06:08:49] <Webster> Moonlightning: Other possibility is getting an AC router and just putting it in bridge mode, then you have a switch built in.
[06:09:04] <Librarian> yeah, kinda expensive
[06:09:18] <Librarian> a litlle less pro then?

[06:09:58] <Webster> Moonlightning: You can with the right firmware, yeah. Makes it an AP.
[06:10:27] <Moonlightning> Webster: My first thought was that it'd defeat the purpose of having a fully-fledged computer as a netbox, but…
[06:10:36] <Webster> Librarian: Probably an Intuos or Bamboo. I didn't think the Intuos I tried once was anything special. I'm doing okay with my $40 tablet, personally. >_>

[06:13:48] <Webster> It'd probably work fine. You get to have the fun of dealing with Wacom drivers though.
[06:14:43] <Librarian> bad drivers or a pain to use?
[06:15:05] <Webster> Seem to have lots of problems requiring reinstalling and fiddling with stuff.
[06:15:32] <HoneyDrops|Half> It's a little fiddly in Linux, but works well after the initial fuss.

[06:32:15] <Moonlightning> > Standards: IEEE 802.11ac, IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n
[06:32:24] <Moonlightning> This sounds like it does ac, /or/ a+b+g+n
[06:32:43] <Moonlightning> i.e. if all the clients are ac, it'll do ac, but if an n client joins, it'll drop all of them to n
[06:33:59] <Moonlightning> which, for me, would rather defeat the purpose of having an ac card
[06:34:11] <HoneyDrops|Half> How about two cards?

[06:59:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> I'd settle for them to just publish specs openly so the community can write drivers.  My experience is hw vendors shouldn't go anywhere near a compiler >_>

[07:02:07] <Moonlightning> I feel like I should still get an ac card, though, so I don't have to buy a new one later!
[07:02:12] <Googie> Very little supports it, and the ecosystem seems immature, especially on the foss side.

[19:00:18] <init3> ipv6 is haaaaard. 
[19:00:22] * init3 pouts
[19:00:27] <Moonlightning> No it's not.
[19:00:35] <init3> Then halp
[19:00:43] <init3> I can't get ra working :(
[19:00:44] <Moonlightning> If it's hard, complain to your product or service provider.
[19:01:02] <init3> I'm pretty sure I'm doing it wrong. 
[19:01:13] <init3> My gateway can do it super easy. 
[19:01:24] <init3> I just need to figure out how to advertise my /64 internally. 
[19:05:16] <init3> I suppose if my ISP was nice enough to give me a static prefix it'd be easy. 
[19:05:50] <Moonlightning> Hardcoding netids in configfiles seems like the Wrong Way™ to me, anyway
[19:05:56] <Moonlightning> and I always want to do things the Right Way™
[19:06:04] <init3> Right
[19:06:33] <Moonlightning> This sounds like the kinda thing I'd ask for help here with, but…two heads are better than one, I guess, so
[19:06:39] <Moonlightning> What's your setup; what've you done so far?
[19:08:31] <init3> Ok so eth0 is my wan, eth1 is lan. 
[19:08:47] <init3> I can dhclient -6 eth0 and grab a /64
[19:09:24] <init3> I've assigned eth1 an address from the block manually for now. 
[19:09:35] <init3> and installed radvd. 
[19:09:57] <init3> enabled ipv6 forwarding with sysctl, same with accept_ra
[19:09:58] <Moonlightning> So a single client is to be connected on eth1?
[19:10:12] <init3> No, that goes to a switch. 
[19:10:51] <Moonlightning> Ahh, okay
[19:10:56] <Moonlightning> Yeah, I dunno how that'd work
[19:11:52] <init3> Well one thing i've just discovered is that a "boolean" value needs to be set to 2. 
[19:12:01] <init3> fuck sakes
[19:12:25] <Moonlightning> Oh? Which one?
[19:13:08] <init3> accept_ra
[19:14:15] <init3> I'm reminded of in Futurama, Bender is describing a dream. Something about all the ones and zeros flying by, everywhere and... "I think I saw a 2" and Fry says "Shh, it's okay 2 doesn't exist"
[19:14:26] <Moonlightning> xD
[19:16:34] <init3> Part of the thing is a lot of this documentation is kind of outdated and a lot of guides are for people with ISPs that do not provide native v6
[19:16:59] <johnsey> according to ze docs, accept_ra is an integer, not a boolean
[19:17:24] <Moonlightning> Where are these fabled docs?
[19:17:32] <init3> Depends on who you ask apparently
[19:17:49] <Moonlightning> The ponypages on sysctl and sysctl.conf don't list the options
[19:18:06] <johnsey> the linux kernel documentation
[19:18:15] <johnsey> Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
[19:18:17] <init3> but 2 allows ra 'passthrough'. If you have forwarding enabled it'll disable ras. 
[19:19:27] <init3> Whatever docs I was looking at were probably outdated. 
[19:19:47] <johnsey> the point is that you often don't want routers to auto-configure
[19:19:54] <init3> Whatever docs I was looking at were probably outdated. What I don't get is how my v4 network keeps breaking when I try to get v6 working but all in due time. 
[19:20:10] <johnsey> and forwarding enabled usually indicates that
[19:20:41] <init3> Ahh
[19:20:49] <init3> But in the case of a gateway, you do. 
[19:21:11] <Moonlightning> Is it online? :/
[19:21:20] <Moonlightning> or do I have to pull a kernel tarball and… :|
[19:21:25] <johnsey> well, if it's not static...
[19:21:37] <johnsey> gateways tends to have static prefixes
[19:21:41] <init3> I'm looking at http://www.mattb.net.nz/blog/2011/05/12/linux-ignores-ipv6-router-advertisements-when-forwarding-is-enabled/
[19:21:41] <PinkiePieBot> [ Matt’s Musings » Linux ignores IPv6 router advertisements when forwarding is enabled ]
[19:21:54] <init3> Hehe... I have Comcast. 
[19:22:03] <johnsey> unless they're behind a residental connection which gets random prefixes ;)
[19:22:09] <init3> I am
[19:22:26] <johnsey> I guess that's what the 3rd option is for then 
[19:22:28] <Moonlightning> Never mind, got it
[19:22:36] <init3> aye
[19:22:38] <Moonlightning> Yay Gentoo. I have kernel docs just sitting around.
[19:23:00] <Moonlightning> accept_ra: integer
[19:23:11] <johnsey> Moonlightning: it's also online, e.g. lxr.free-electrons.com
[19:23:14] <init3> I was probably looking at something old. 
[19:23:22] <init3> fuck me.
[19:23:40] <Moonlightning> 0: do not accept RA; 1: accept RA only if forwarding is disabled; 2: overrule forwarding behaviour and accept RA even if forwarding is enabled
[19:23:44] <init3> Anyway so either of you use wide-dhcpd?
[19:23:48] <Moonlightning> johnsey: sounds legit :P
[19:24:00] <init3> Well
[19:24:05] <Moonlightning> My gateway is currently an Apple Time Capsule :I
[19:24:23] <Moonlightning> I just ordered a Wi-Fi card. Might be finally starting this project back up.
[19:25:17] <init3> THe thing is, if I use dhcpd -6 i get an address /64. That dhcp client should be able to pass everything on to radvd but it gives my external interface an address /128. Is that fucked or does it make sense?
[19:26:36] <Moonlightning> eth1 shouldn't be getting a /128
[19:26:50] <init3> Hmm
[19:26:56] <Moonlightning> It sounds like it's /the/ switch, immediately inside of your gateway
[19:27:03] <Moonlightning> in which case…it should be getting the whole /64
[19:27:19] <Moonlightning> that said…I think whether it's a layer-two or layer-three switch may be relevant here
[19:27:30] <init3> It's a L2 unmanaged
[19:27:38] <Moonlightning> I forget what /managed/ means.
[19:27:50] <init3> That it has an ip
[19:27:52] <Moonlightning> Okay, layer-two…so it's not going to deal with IP at all.
[19:27:57] <init3> yes
[19:28:24] <Moonlightning> So your box should be able to talk to any of the clients to the switch, just using Ethernet, I guess?
[19:28:33] <Moonlightning> And it would assign IPs to them
[19:29:19] <init3> aye
[19:29:35] <init3> Well the box itself shouldn't. 
[19:29:48] <Moonlightning> …but that means that the device on eth1 from your box' perspective wouldn't have a single address.
[19:29:50] <init3> Clients should be pulling ras from my ISP
[19:30:03] <Moonlightning> Oh!
[19:30:06] <Moonlightning> Right.
[19:30:20] <Moonlightning> (…my setup is gonna be a bit more complex than that. Hmm…)
[19:30:22] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> its 102 with a heat index of 120 here now
[19:30:34] <Moonlightning> (Because I want to do IP assignments myself.)
[19:30:38] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> o_o i'm going to just go home, and friggin' sleep after i get off work
[19:31:23] <Moonlightning> init3: your box is still a hop, though
[19:31:26] <Moonlightning> It's the gateway
[19:31:29] <Moonlightning> right?
[19:32:07] <init3> Err, yeah. I guess I mean they should use my ISP's DHCP
[19:32:28] <init3> But yes, it'll be a route. 
[19:35:43] <Moonlightning> The switch just forwards Ethernet packets. So a client sending a packet to, I dunno, Google, would address the layer-two portion to…the box?
[19:36:43] <Moonlightning> johnsey, halp. I dunno how this works. :(
[19:37:15] <Moonlightning> (You can think of accept_ra like this, though)
[19:37:24] <Moonlightning> (0: don't; 1: do; 2: /really/ do)
[19:37:55] <johnsey> ipv6 autoconfiguration with dynamic prefixes sucks in general as this apparently wasn't intended
[19:38:22] <Moonlightning> But then you have to change the configuration files when you move and change prefixes
[19:38:29] <Moonlightning> which stinks >:(
[19:38:38] <johnsey> no, a router with a dynamic prefix wasn't intended
[19:38:41] <johnsey> that's what i meant to say
[19:39:17] <johnsey> you can still do it AFAIK but I'd have to ask ze interwebs, too, how to configure it
[19:39:34] <Moonlightning> It's a router by virtue of the fact that it sits between the upstream gateway and the clients on the LAN, right?
[19:39:42] <Moonlightning> I mean…init3 couldn't just plug the switch into the wall…?
[19:40:23] <init3> I still want to be able to firewall though of course. 
[19:40:31] <Moonlightning> Ahhh.
[19:40:48] <init3> But I may be getting somewhere. At least for the time being.
[19:40:58] <init3> I unno.
[19:41:14] <Moonlightning> Does nopony know how to do it? :(
[19:42:18] <Moonlightning> I mean, I want to do this, too(, sort of)
[19:44:45] <init3> I'll let you know if I figure it out. But johnsey said, this was intended to have static v6 blocks assigned. 
[19:44:57] <Moonlightning> ;-;
[19:45:35] <frackster> …–…
[19:45:43] <init3> I probably will eventually. I'll just have to be bothered enough by it. 
[19:46:14] <init3> Because on "borrowing" a neighbors connection it did work. I connected to canternet via v6 and I wanna do that again. 
[19:46:37] <init3> That's in the comcast all in one gateways. 
[19:46:48] <init3> I want to know how to do it myself obviously. 
[19:47:30] <Moonlightning> yeah
[19:49:19] <Moonlightning> I wanna know how to get clients to do those temporary addresses, while also having permanent addresses assigned by my netbox, so they're all in one place
[19:50:38] <init3> What do you mean? 
[19:50:48] <init3> You want two sets of addresses?
[19:52:06] <Moonlightning> Yeah, I guess.
[19:52:16] <Moonlightning> I mean, I already /have/ temp and permanent

[20:01:55] <tiwake> oh gosh... I just typed up a huge email to a couple of close friends about turning off the data collecting "features" of windows 10
[20:01:56] <init3> ipv6 is on my mad science agenda today. 
[20:02:16] <tiwake> I was just going to give them a couple links on how to turn it off, with a bit of text to describe the two links
[20:02:30] <tiwake> 6 links and ~500 words later I sent the email
[20:02:31] <tiwake> heh
[20:02:58] <Moonlightning> :p
[20:03:19] <Moonlightning> init3: so these are the three IPv6 addresses my laptop has, currently
[20:03:46] <tiwake> I should set up an IPv6 network sometime
[20:04:00] <Moonlightning> The permanent one is the /64 prefix, followed by its MAC address with fffe added right in the middle
[20:04:31] <Moonlightning> There are two temporary addresses, too. As I understand it, the host portion of those are entirely random.
[20:05:57] <Moonlightning> The temporary address is changed on a frequent basis, and the old one is released. There's just an old one hanging around here because there's an open connection using it.
[20:06:02] <Moonlightning> Right?
[20:06:41] <init3> uuuhhhh
[20:07:25] <init3> I seriously just started mucking about with v6 last night at like 2am.

[20:07:46] <Moonlightning> Somepony confirm|deny that
[20:07:59] <Moonlightning> I like it, though. And I want to keep it when I switch netboxes.
[20:11:38] <Moonlightning> I just want the permanent addresses to be based on a table stored on the netbox, not clients' MAC addresses.

[20:41:57] <init3> okay. So ip autoconfig is working. Routing is now...
[20:42:04] <init3> *not
[20:43:27] <Moonlightning> :?
[20:43:35] <Moonlightning> How's that? Routing tables on your netbox bad?
[20:47:25] <Moonlightning> …I should connect my new netbox again so I can mess with it more
[20:48:48] <init3> Trying to figure it out. It kinda seems like the kernel isn't happy about the idea of packet forwarding. 
[20:49:04] <init3> But I think I have everything enabled to allow it. Perhaps not. 
[20:49:40] <Moonlightning> What is the packet-forwarding option set to for the two interfaces, and the `all` one?
[20:51:33] <init3> all are 1 currently
[20:51:43] <init3> probably should be 0 on the WAN though right?
[20:51:58] <Moonlightning> Well, you want packets to be forwarded in both directions, yes? :p
[20:52:10] <Moonlightning> wait a sec, I haven't read the doc
[20:53:27] <Moonlightning> > forward packets between interfaces
[20:53:29] <Moonlightning> that's a little vague
[20:54:10] <Moonlightning> If it's off for one interface, does it mean that packets /received/ on that interface won't be forwarded elsewhere? Or that packets will never be forwarded /via/ that interface? Or both?
[20:54:34] <Moonlightning> > this variable is special, its change resets all configuration parameters to their default states
[20:54:36] <Moonlightning> :|
[20:56:22] <init3> huh
[20:56:48] <init3> net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding is the most important I think
[20:57:05] <init3> Still seems to be not doing it. 
[20:58:43] <Moonlightning> set {eth0,eth1,all}.forwarding on, and check your routing tables and firewall?
[21:00:41] <init3> ip6tables is all open and flushed. 
[21:01:01] <init3> The gateway can ping6 google for example
[21:01:13] <init3> SO it has okay routing tables i'd assume. 
[21:01:19] <Moonlightning> And clients can ping the gateway, but not Google?
[21:01:23] <init3> I just dunno
[21:02:43] <Moonlightning> …check?
[21:03:58] <init3> There was some lag there
[21:04:07] <init3> And yes, the clients can ping the gw
[21:05:04] <Moonlightning> hm
[21:05:21] <init3> I can ping my WAN interface internally too...
[21:05:29] <Moonlightning> double-check a client's routing tables?
[21:05:37] <Moonlightning> And see if the gateway's logs have anything relevant
[21:05:59] <Moonlightning> Wait. The gateway only has one IP, right?
[21:06:03] <init3> well I can do a travepath6 from the client and I can see it hitting the gw. 
[21:06:24] <Moonlightning> …don't traceroutes fail completely if you can't ping the remote host?
[21:06:29] <init3> No
[21:06:34] <init3> not always
