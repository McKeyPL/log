[03:29:04] <Gigabit> Hmm.. is it possible to make a multi boot flash drive for installing different distros?
[03:29:18] <Gigabit> Like say, Kubuntu and Arch from the ame flash drive
[03:29:38] <JustAberrant> sure
[03:30:07] <JustAberrant> I mean, probably with varying degrees of effort depending on how those distros set up their install cd
[03:31:00] <JustAberrant> the real question is, why would you want to?
[03:32:26] <Gigabit> Well, to save on flash drives. I have a 16gb with Kali linux on it, would be nice to fit Arch or Kubuntu on it to
[03:32:49] <HoneyDrops|Half> I think he's asking why you'd want to boot into multiple different distos?
[03:32:57] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[03:33:08] <JustAberrant> I was assuming you were talking about installers
[03:33:19] <Midnight_Tinker> Kali isn't really a production distro, I could see booting into it and something else
[03:33:50] <JustAberrant> (in which case by the time you go to install one of those distros, it'll probably be out of date anyway and you may as well grab a fresh copy)
[03:34:10] <JustAberrant> yeah, a dual book live cd/flash drive I can _kinda_ see
[03:34:29] <Midnight_Tinker> I wish someone would make an Arch installer that whenever its used it pulls the latest update and updates itself when its used
[03:35:06] <Midnight_Tinker> too many "when its used" but you get the idea
[03:35:30] <Midnight_Tinker> I guess in practice it doesnt matter since Arch just runs a pull from the repo when you install it
[03:35:40] *** Joins: Fantasma (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[03:35:49] <JustAberrant> dunno about arch, but gentoo is _kinda_ like that just in the sense that it doesn't really have a proper "installer" so much as a set of instructions and a snapshot of portage/other bits that you usually download when installing
[03:36:18] <JustAberrant> you can install gentoo from any distro you want if it has your basic tools
[03:36:33] <Midnight_Tinker> Arch is the same, its just basic fs tools and pacman
[03:36:35] <HoneyDrops|Half> Gentoo's install is really simple, once you've done it a few times.
[03:36:49] * JustAberrant nods
[03:37:20] <Midnight_Tinker> I would, but I'm just too in love with pacman to switch off Arch
[03:37:23] <HoneyDrops|Half> Also helps to have a second system so you can ssh in.
[03:37:35] <JustAberrant> it's gotten a lot simpler too, portage is way more polished than it was back in like 2003-ish .. hell it's noticably more polished than a few years ago
[03:37:46] <JustAberrant> and the profiles are actually sane now and not a joke
[03:37:49] <HoneyDrops|Half> Unless you particularly revel in a standard tty.
[03:37:54] <Gigabit> Oh well I am meaning installers JustAberrant 
[03:37:57] <JustAberrant> plus upstream packages have abandoned the whole billion --with-whatever options
[03:38:11] <JustAberrant> which makes the use flags way simpler too
[03:38:31] <JustAberrant> and also genkernel isn't a complete joke anymore either
[03:39:07] <JustAberrant> you can pretty much go with the default make.conf, use genkernel, choose a desktop profile, and install without really tweaking anything .. and actually have a usable system
[03:39:09] <HoneyDrops|Half> I still build my own kernel, but use genkernel for making initramfs.
[03:39:19] <JustAberrant> which.. definitely wasn't the case awhile ago :>
[03:39:23] <JustAberrant> and yeah, same
[03:39:50] <JustAberrant> I do lvm+dmcrypt/luks .. used to roll my own initrd back in the bad days
[03:39:59] <JustAberrant> now I just use genkernel for that
[03:40:17] * JustAberrant getting lazy...
[03:40:34] <JustAberrant> completely random: extlinux is kinda awesome
[03:41:04] <JustAberrant> I've hated grub for years.. and grub 2 is terrible.. I didn't even realize syslinux still lived on in a usable form.. but it does.. and it's glorious
[03:41:23] <JustAberrant> no convoluted web of shell scripts and init files and configuration files that generate more configuration files and some stupid auto detection thing
[03:41:28] * Moonlightning kicks JustAberrant. “Ya, boot!”
[03:41:34] <JustAberrant> just _one_ damn really simple config file
[03:41:40] <JustAberrant> like.. 10 lines to do what I want
[03:41:49] * Moonlightning piles boots on JustAberrant.
[03:41:52] <JustAberrant> and that _includes_ having a lyra background :>
[03:43:08] <HoneyDrops|Half> I use grub2, but it set it up on this laptop and haven't touched it since.  I don't really want to mess around with UEFI again, if I can help it.
[03:43:18] <HoneyDrops|Half> s/it set/I set/
[03:49:04] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:49:18] <JustAberrant> haven't had to deal with that yet, all my machines are old enough to predate that garbage
[03:49:26] <JustAberrant> when I upgrade though I'm in for a treat :(
[03:50:58] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/misc/bootup.mp4  <-- dunno why, but this makes me way happier than it should :>
[03:52:52] <HoneyDrops|Half> I did absolutely no visual customization to my boot, whole boot takes about 15 seconds, including POST (~6 seconds) to get to a login prompt (5 second timeout on GRUB).
[03:53:01] <Moonlightning> hmm, I should do that
[03:53:07] <Moonlightning> big Caramel right across the screen
[03:53:24] <Moonlightning> Priorities, though.
[03:53:43] <HoneyDrops|Half> I also reboot maybe every few months.
[03:53:45] <JustAberrant> mine boots up pretty fast too.. dunno exact time, but yeah, definitely under 30 seconds
[03:54:03] <JustAberrant> and yeah, that :>
[03:54:05] <Moonlightning> Anypony know any MSAs or MRAs that support proper TLS and STARTTLS and can be configured to do server cert validation and refuse TLS versions before 1.1 (in /both/ cases)?
[03:54:34] <JustAberrant> but yeah, with extlinux is was dead simple to do.. literally one line to define an image for the background.. and 2 lines to define the menu placement
[03:54:37] <JustAberrant> so what the hell :>
[03:55:50] * JustAberrant never subscribed to the whole graphical login manager thing either, which is good because it means if X crashes you end up in a logged in terminal :>
[03:56:13] <JustAberrant> I do disable VT switching though and alt+backspace.. so it's not _that_ easy.. but still
[03:56:41] <HoneyDrops|Half> If I were to drop grub, I was going to just do EFI Stub
[03:57:04] <JustAberrant> I really should use xdm.. just seems like all the options out there really suck.. lightdm is about the only graphical login that doesn't completely annoy me.. but still..
[03:57:26] <HoneyDrops|Half> I just log into the tty and startx
[03:57:39] <JustAberrant> myup, that's what I do :>
[03:57:48] <JustAberrant> but yeah.. definitely insecure :(
[03:58:08] <HoneyDrops|Half> ?
[03:58:27] <JustAberrant> as said above, all someone has to do is get x to crash and they've got a logged in terminal
[03:58:46] <JustAberrant> and that's assuming you disable VT switching, which if you havn't they can just switch to that TTY and ctrl+c it
[03:58:48] <HoneyDrops|Half> er... as opposed to just opening a terminal in the running X session?
[03:58:51] <Colgate> couldn't they just open a terminal emulator?
[03:59:05] <JustAberrant> assuming locked screen
[03:59:18] <Colgate> oh, lock screens only stop the non-determined anyways
[03:59:21] <HoneyDrops|Half> ^
[03:59:44] <JustAberrant> I dunno about that.. you have to be pretty damn determined 
[03:59:51] <HoneyDrops|Half> Always assume unsupervised physical access == pwned system
[03:59:56] <JustAberrant> full disk encryption means rebooting is useless
[04:00:14] <JustAberrant> which means you are into fun times pulling bits off the ram bus and all that
[04:00:37] <JustAberrant> unless you can get xscreensaver to crash (which is probably pretty dan hard, it's a seriously stable bit of software)
[04:00:57] <JustAberrant> if you are using xdm (which I'm not..) getting x to crash doesn't get you anywhere
[04:01:18] <JustAberrant> _vs_ just opening a TTY and doing start x.. where you don't need to kill sxreensaver, just get x itself to crash
[04:01:26] <JustAberrant> * startx
[04:01:32] <JustAberrant> which is probably _way_ easier to do
[04:01:52] <HoneyDrops|Half> You could probably do something like startx || logout to foil that :p
[04:02:11] <JustAberrant> hehe, I guess that's an option :>
[04:03:10] * JustAberrant doesn't care anyway, if someone breaks into my house to tinker with my computer, they're probably not too many steps away from hooking my testicals up to a car battery.. so moot point :>
[04:05:27] <JustAberrant> but just in principle I think xdm is _probably_ more secure
[04:06:51] * JustAberrant also runs a non-kerberos/encrypted nfs .. which means someone could just plug a machine into my switch, do a little listening, and easily get access to most of my files anyway :>
[04:07:22] <JustAberrant> *listening and spooking I guess
[04:07:47] <JustAberrant> random rant: why are the two options for nfs: blatantly insecure and easy, fairly secure but a huge pain in the ass
[04:07:52] <JustAberrant> there needs to be a middle ground :(
[04:09:45] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: 3spoofy5me :(
[04:09:52] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> like debian installs where its an option to encrypt the home folder
[04:10:00] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ?
[04:10:24] <JustAberrant> nah, full disk encryption is straight forward
[04:10:49] <JustAberrant> encrypt the disk, have it prompt for a key on boot, unlock and mount it, carry on.. 
[04:11:08] <JustAberrant> nfs though, to make that secure, requires setting up single sign on/kerberos and a bunch of other stuff
[04:11:16] <JustAberrant> which is fine if you actually want that stuff
[04:11:38] <JustAberrant> but annoying if you just want some form of authentication better than "hey, I'm this user!" and maybe a little encryption

[04:13:24] <JustAberrant> you can kinda do shitty hacks like run nfs over an ssh tunnel
[04:13:27] <JustAberrant> but it's unreliable and slow
[04:13:57] <Moonlightning> Just require a client cert, or all requests to be signed
[04:14:03] <JustAberrant> indeed
[04:14:07] <JustAberrant> that would be perfect

[04:14:14] <JustAberrant> like.. the middle ground _everyone_ wants
[04:14:18] <PinkieShy> does logging the chat fragment the hdd?
[04:14:33] <JustAberrant> but as far as I know it doesn't exist
[04:15:18] <Moonlightning> PinkieShy: firstly, at this point in time, not everypony needs to be concerned about file fragmentation.
[04:15:31] <JustAberrant> the only way (I know of) besides ssh tunneling and such, is to set up kerberos with a key distribution center.. which is a huge pain in the ass imo
[04:15:57] <Moonlightning> In particular, if you have an SSD, fragmentation doesn't affect performance at all. [peer review needed]
[04:16:03] <PinkieShy> Moonlightning so fragmention isn't a big issue like it use to be??
[04:16:10] <Moonlightning> PinkieShy: It depends.
[04:16:24] <JustAberrant> depends on your file system, but for IRC logs probably not
[04:16:24] <PinkieShy> I have no sdd.. I just have the regular kind that came with the laptop
[04:16:44] <PinkieShy> JustAberrant I'm on windows 8.1 so file system i think is NTFS?
[04:16:50] <Moonlightning> My understanding is that fragmentation causes performance degradation because spinning disks are good at sequential reads.
[04:17:35] <Moonlightning> But if the file is in fragments all over the disk, it has to seek a lot to get at all of them, thus slowing down reads from the point of view of apps (and the user)
[04:17:53] <Moonlightning> SSDs aren't worse at random reads than sequential reads, so it doesn't affect them.
[04:18:02] <PinkieShy> ok :)

[04:18:09] <Moonlightning> Another factor is (as J_stAberrant said) your filesystem.
[04:18:31] <JustAberrant> NTFS fragments last I heard, but it's probably such a minor impact with text files..

[05:45:00] <JustAberrant> honestly though, 3 is probably the ideal
[05:45:03] <HoneyDrops|Half> I don't really see the point past 3, and I spend most of my time on a laptop.
[05:45:12] <JustAberrant> anything more than that is just extra

[05:45:30] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops|Half: ehe, I can't stand laptops for lack of screen real estate
[05:45:35] <JustAberrant> I need _at least_ two
[05:45:37] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i went from single to dual, huge difference when you do a bunch of stuff at once
[05:45:43] <HoneyDrops|Half> tags/workspaces/virtual desktops let me swap context and I don't need to change where I am looking.
[05:46:02] <Gigabit> So.. would arch and a kde DE be even less of a system impact then linux mint, on a low end laptop with a slow ass hdd?
[05:46:17] <HoneyDrops|Half> I have 12 tags with my wm, if I wanted to I could have up to 32.
[05:46:46] * JustAberrant has 6, but I still do a lot of stuff where it's convenient to have stuff side by side
[05:46:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> If you're running KDE... it's going to be the main performance issue.
[05:47:01] <JustAberrant> also I almost always have a video going.. so that's one right there
[05:47:14] <Gigabit> damn, I really like kde, right now my laptop is sraight mint
[05:47:17] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: arch won't make much difference.. 
[05:47:25] <JustAberrant> certainly not compared to your DE/WM
[05:47:51] <HoneyDrops|Half> You can always disable services you don't use, but that isn't going to make KDE not a slow POS.
[05:47:53] <JustAberrant> the difference using a lightweight wm on old hardware is staggering though
[05:47:56] <Gigabit> yeah its running Cinnamon currently
[05:48:09] <JustAberrant> Cinnamon, kde, gnome, etc are all fairly heavy
[05:48:20] <JustAberrant> compared to openbox/xfce/etc
[05:48:35] <HoneyDrops|Half> openbox, i3 or dwm (depending on your preferred WM style) and call it a day.
[05:48:48] <JustAberrant> personally I run openbox with the xfce panel

[05:49:51] <Moonlightning> thirteen-inch, too
[05:49:59] * HoneyDrops|Half hugs Moonlightning and approves.
[05:50:01] <JustAberrant> hehe, I'd go insane
[05:50:04] * Moonlightning hugs back.
[05:50:17] <Moonlightning> Agreed with HoneyDrops—virtual desktops are /the/ way to go
[05:50:32] <Gigabit> So which distros have xfce or openbox as the default?
[05:50:35] <Moonlightning> I have six. They're ordered by how much I care if other people see.
[05:50:41] <JustAberrant> bleh, switching back and forth is annoying on a regular basis
[05:50:51] <Moonlightning> Desktop one is work stuff, ordering Wi-Fi cards from Amazon, etc
[05:50:52] * HoneyDrops|Half uses a X230 primarily.  Hell, I'm sitting at my desk and there are two 1600x1200 LCDs and still on my laptops's 12" screen XD
[05:50:57] <Moonlightning> Desktop six is porn :p
[05:51:09] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: hehe
[05:51:25] * JustAberrant mostly uses one desktop, and has stuff I need less frequently on the others
[05:51:33] <Moonlightning> and then fullscreen apps go after the desktop they'd be placed in
[05:51:41] <JustAberrant> more so at work than home, at home I mostly use the one
[05:51:54] <Moonlightning> Oh, I keep a blank terminal to the left of desktop one, too
[05:52:00] <Moonlightning> it runs `cat >/dev/null`, no shell
[05:52:13] <JustAberrant> I see ;p
[05:52:15] <HoneyDrops|Half> I like virtual desktops as I can keep a workspace for a projest set up for weeks.
[05:52:35] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[05:52:46] <HoneyDrops|Half> So I can just Mod4+F# over to that tag and pick up where I left off.
[05:52:57] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i've introduced a coworker of mine to virtual desktops
[05:53:08] <JustAberrant> yeah, that's also something I'll do at work.. like if I've got something ongoing and suddenly need to do something else, I'll switch to an empty desktop and start on the new thing
[05:53:29] <HoneyDrops|Half> Flip to another tag for another project (or irc, tag #10 >_>) and work on that.
[05:53:36] <JustAberrant> not so much at home.. I never have that much stuff going on ;p
[05:54:21] <HoneyDrops|Half> I tend to get distracted, but there is no compelling reason to close out that set of terminals, so I leave them be until I come back to it.
[05:55:12] <JustAberrant> anyway, good example of where multi-monitors are essential imo: looking through a data capture while reading through the interface design spec.. yes you could have the spec one one desktop and wireshark/whatever in another, but so much nicer to just glance back and forth
[05:55:49] <Moonlightning> command-tab ftw
[05:56:31] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] agrees
[05:56:46] <HoneyDrops|Half> mod4+tab to flip between two most recent tags.  But dwm makes it easy enough to display two things side by side anyway.
[05:56:48] <JustAberrant> I also tend to do it when reviewing code.. we use reviewboard, which is great and all, but I like to have the code open separately so I can browse around/poke at stuff
[05:56:53] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> or when doing data carving, having an article with magic numbers up on one screen, and a hex dump on another
[05:56:59] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops|Half: I find the switching very distracting
[05:57:51] <JustAberrant> another good use case is when I'm running something live and watching for an event
[05:58:06] <Moonlightning> I never resize windows
[05:58:07] <Moonlightning> ever
[05:58:20] <JustAberrant> so I'll have the thing going on one screen where I'm doing stuff, then have the logs/data capture/etc running on the other screen
[05:58:27] <Moonlightning> I'm verrrry careful about keeping them the default size
[05:58:48] <Moonlightning> and the default planement too
[05:58:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> I let dwm handle sizing/placement.
[05:59:12] <HoneyDrops|Half> Makes sense to me that a window manager should... well manage windows.
[05:59:31] <JustAberrant> also when I'm running through test procedures.. again.. yes I could swtich between the procedure and the application, but so much nicer to just have both of them there
[06:00:12] <HoneyDrops|Half> So most anything I open on a formerly empty tag is "full screen" open a second thing it's always on the left, and gets about 60% of the screen.
[06:00:59] <HoneyDrops|Half> the first windows gets the right 40% (I can adjust the proportion, should I want to, by default the right window should get 80col with my terminal settings)
[06:01:17] <JustAberrant> hehe, that would drive me crazy too
[06:01:29] * JustAberrant tried the tiling window manager thing.. just couldn't get used to it
[06:01:45] <HoneyDrops|Half> Open a third, and the first two are vertically split that 40% to the right and the new windows gets the 60% on the left.

[06:01:50] <JustAberrant> it makes logical sense, but just didn't click with me
[06:02:47] <HoneyDrops|Half> I can swap different layouts too, giving the "main" window the left/right/top/bottom instead, grid layouts, a "tabbed" maximize, and so forth.
[06:03:01] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: also I think there's some ubuntu one that does.. but really it's usually trivial to install a different one

[06:03:24] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: it probably won't feel as polished though, most distros are set up with one in mind..

[06:04:44] <JustAberrant> nah, with regards to default wm menus/etc
[06:04:53] <JustAberrant> I use gentoo, which is pretty "plain" out of the box
[06:06:17] <HoneyDrops|Half> I wrote my own "menu" wrapper around dmenu
[06:07:57] * JustAberrant tends to launch most stuff through a terminal, I only really put the "main" stuff in the menu
[06:08:55] <HoneyDrops|Half> It defaults to a similar behavior as the stock wrapper script, but I can feed it my own predefined list and it checks anything I run with it against a table that tells it if it should run in a terminal (and if it should hold after exit), use sudo, etc.
[06:10:42] <JustAberrant> also I should bed :(
[06:11:09] <JustAberrant> it's like 1am :(
[06:11:32] <HoneyDrops|Half> This mean I can do [Menu]dmesg and it will open urxvtc, run dmesg, and hold the terminal open so I can scroll though it.  Though I generally just open a terminal and run dmesg from bash.
