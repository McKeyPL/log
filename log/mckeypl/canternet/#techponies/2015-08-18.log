[00:35:35] <HoneyDrops|Half> Aww
[00:36:53] <HoneyDrops|Half> We need better routing tech, encryption is good, but its far to easy to monitor who is taking to who, encryption only protects what is being said, not preventing 3rd parties from knowing A and B are communicating.
[00:38:11] <Seoson> Onion routing for everyone :O
[00:47:19] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> xP
[00:49:19] <Moonlightning> We also need to get ponies with non-usage-capped uplinks to start exchanging completely meaningless data over TLS. Tons and tons of it.

[00:53:17] <Colgate> encrypting everything helps with that

[00:55:33] <wolfyshy> I have uncapped internet but I don't see how that helps
[00:56:51] <Moonlightning> Well, obviously, if you have usage caps, sending and receiving useless garbage would be a waste of your precious quota :p
[00:57:06] <wolfyshy> I mean, what garbage am I supposed to send, and to whom?
[00:57:18] <Moonlightning> Anything! Anyone!
[00:57:32] <wolfyshy> also, since this channel isn't +Z (or whatever inspircd uses for ssl-only chan I think it's +Z), the confidentiality of this plan is ruined.
[00:57:46] <Moonlightning> Pipe from /dev/zero or /dev/urandom or /dev/national-anthem or whatever you like.
[00:58:06] <Moonlightning> Not over IRC—over something else.
[00:59:04] <Moonlightning> The layer-seven protocol is very, very simple. Any data at all is valid, and is ignored. Both sides send arbitrary data to each other continuously, as allowed by other things.
[00:59:14] <Moonlightning> If you're gaming or something, you'll wanna throttle it.

[00:59:41] <Moonlightning> It's intended to run on top of something that provides good security, like TLS or SSH.
[00:59:51] <Moonlightning> The idea is to just generate more encrypted traffic.
[00:59:54] <wolfyshy> most of my games are LAN with family or guests so :P
[00:59:58] <wolfyshy> I don't really need to throttle
[01:00:20] <Moonlightning> In the hopes that the NSA, GHCQ, etc will have trouble keeping up with all the extra useless shit.
[01:00:22] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: in that case, why not just ssh to people's computers and cat /usr/share/dict/wordlist on repeat or something

[01:00:39] <Moonlightning> wolfyshy: Bam, there you go. Implementation.
[01:01:36] <Colgate> wolfyshy: it is +z for ssl only channels on inspircd
[01:01:55] <wolfyshy> aha
[01:01:59] <wolfyshy> I was close
[01:02:12] <Moonlightning> You're probably thikning of umode Z, for indicating that a user is connected over TLS.
[01:02:32] <wolfyshy> isn't that ratbox-derivatives only?  I'm not +Z and I'm using TLS...
[01:03:10] <wolfyshy> indeed, I'm +Z on freenode and another network that's running charybdis, but I'm not +Z on here, my testnet running insp22, or chatspike
[01:03:16] <HoneyDrops|Half> Well really the smart thing would be to keep continual data streams and inject actual data a la steganography when you do want to actually communicate.
[01:03:39] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops|Half: use ANSI bold control codes for the words in the dictionary that you want to use? :P
[01:04:00] <Colgate> inspircd doesn't have a umode for TLS
[01:04:08] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops|Half: indeed, it would need refining after a while in case they've caught on.
[01:04:24] <Seoson> I thought about writing an app for me that would just google randome terms to mess up their analysis of me
[01:04:26] <Colgate> also, there are a whole 3 channels that are +z here, and 1 of those is an ircop only channel :P

[02:06:15] <Moonlightning> So…is part of the IPv6 allocations that one entity gives to another normally used for the downstream router to communicate with the upstream one?
[02:07:05] <Moonlightning> Say an ISP assigns a customer 2001:db8:d189:d00::/56
[02:07:33] <Moonlightning> Does the customer's router normally assign a /64 to its upstream-facing interface from that same /56?
[02:11:31] *** locodash11[lagout] is now known as locodash11[server]
[02:17:56] <Webster> I can't imagine it assigning a subnet to its WAN side at all, just a single IP for itself.
[02:18:45] <Webster> Though with IPv6, since your LAN is all publicly addressed, the router probably doesn't even need a public IP.
[02:18:58] <Moonlightning> You need an IP on that interface, though, don't you?
[02:19:36] <Webster> Ethernet MAC, yes. Not necessarily an IP though, unless it is itself accessing the Internet.
[02:19:39] <Moonlightning> I mean, /I/ thought you didn't, but…
[02:19:57] <Webster> So if your router is doing DNS caching or being a time server, then yeah, it needs an IP.
[02:20:27] <Webster> Or if for some reason the router is doing NATv6.
[02:20:33] <Moonlightning> I thought it could just have an address from its subnet on its LAN side, and no address on its WAN side—it would route packets upstream properly, of course, and the provider would route all packets bound for its subnet (including packets for it) to it.
[02:20:54] <Moonlightning> Freenode/##networking insisted that the WAN side did in fact need its own address (and subnet by extension)
[02:21:06] <Moonlightning> And that it should be different from that of the LAN side.
[02:21:50] <Webster> Don't see why it's required. At most it'd need an IP address from the assignment. No idea why you'd assign an entire subnet to it.
[02:22:42] <Moonlightning> Huh.
[02:22:49] <Moonlightning> Well, what typically happens?
[02:23:21] * Moonlightning doesn't know what's typical, because the previous router hid the details from them, and the current router is a Linux box with a lot of manual config stuffs.
[02:23:55] <Webster> For IPv4, it just gets the one public IP address from the modem that's on the subnet the ISP chose for the block of customers you're part of, then the router would do NAT.
[02:24:13] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[02:27:50] <Webster> With IPv6, you don't have to do NAT, so unless your router is itself making outgoing connections, it can just forward stuff to the LAN without needing an IP for an outgoing connection.
[02:28:31] * HoneyDrops|Half will probably keep using NAT even with IPv6.
[02:28:34] <Moonlightning> Mine will need a global address.
[02:28:57] <Moonlightning> But…am I right? Can it just use its address from the LAN, without having any address on the WAN side?
[02:30:37] <Webster> If you get a /56 you can just assign the router another IP from it. Due to routing, you probably want to assign the IP on the WAN interface in addition to the LAN interface.
[02:30:59] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> Moonlightning are you using the router as your gateway, or are you doing brp?

[02:43:13] <Moonlightning> Webster: What?
[02:43:19] <Moonlightning> DJ-C0L7[EIT]: Yeah, it's the gateway. (What's BRP?)
[02:44:18] <Webster> Moonlightning: So you have some subnet assigned by your ISP. The same subnet is on both sides of the router. Router only assigns addresses on LAN side, and reserves one for itself for use on the WAN side if it needs one.
[02:45:18] <Moonlightning> Webster: thought you weren't supposed to assign the same subnet to multiple interfaces, or subnets bigger than /64 to anything.
[02:45:51] <Webster> It depends entirely on your routing.
[02:45:58] <Webster> I've not heard the /64 thing.
[02:46:30] <Moonlightning> Lots of things will refuse to play with non-/64s, too. :|
[02:46:55] <Moonlightning> In particular, isc-dhcp-server refuses to `subnet6 temporary` for anything bigger than a /64
[02:46:58] <Webster> What I learned was you get a /48 or smaller subnet from your ISP and you can divvy it up how you want. The standard was a /48, though ISPs generally give out /64s these days.
[02:47:13] <Moonlightning> Ewwwww! No, give them more than a /64!
[02:47:14] <Webster> AFAIK a /64 is required for auto-address generation.
[02:47:25] <Moonlightning> /56es are reasonable.
[02:47:40] <Moonlightning> A /60 is the /minimum/ for a customer assignment, I'd say.
[02:48:22] <Webster> So it might be that if you're using auto-addressing or privacy addresses you need a /64.
[02:48:38] <Webster> Although I don't know why that'd be a /requirement/.
[02:48:55] <Moonlightning> For privacy addresses, the larger the subnet, the better!
[02:49:36] <Moonlightning> I wanted to divide my /48 into two /49s; the lower for permanent addresses that I assign, the upper for privacy addresses
[02:49:47] <Moonlightning> A whole nother 15 bits for clients to set randomly!
[02:49:54] <Moonlightning> But isc-dhcp-server said no.

[02:51:13] <Webster> Moonlightning: I mean, if you can only assign a /64, might as well just use that for the LAN and give the router an IP from that on the LAN side and a different IP from another /64 or whatever on the WAN side.
[02:51:16] <Moonlightning> Ideally, I could have reserved the lowest /112 for permanent addresses, and used the entire rest of the /48 for random addresses
[02:51:50] <Moonlightning> But two /49s would be preferable to two /64s, and having no idea what to do with the whole other /50 :|

[02:56:31] <Webster> Middle bits as in between the prefix and the /64? Zeroes usually.

[06:38:52] <Moonlightning> I don't suppose CSS has a thing sort of like shells' {foo,bar,baz} thing?
[06:39:19] <aji> Moonlightning: CSS works best if you can modify the document to work with it
[06:39:22] <aji> otherwise, no, i don't think it does.
[06:39:39] <Moonlightning> Yeah, but this is better than adding class="" to /every/ /single/ /table/ /cell/, geez
[06:39:40] <aji> the way i'd handle that case is with a single class and then adding that class to foo bar baz individually
[06:39:48] <aji> ah
[06:39:52] <Moonlightning> that would get VERY annoying
[06:39:54] <aji> if you're doing like
[06:40:06] <aji> .bla .other > thing > .complicated {foo,bar,baz}
[06:40:08] <aji> you can do
[06:40:10] <Moonlightning> I'm looking for like a `table > * > tr > {td, th}`
[06:40:16] <aji> .bla .other > thing > .complicated foo,
[06:40:18] <aji> .bla .other > thing > .complicated bar

[06:40:21] <aji> .bla .other > thing > .complicated baz { ...
[06:40:31] <aji> which is only slightly worse imo
[06:40:53] <Moonlightning> Okay, well…is there a way to specify multiple nth-child()s then?
[06:41:05] <Moonlightning> Because right now I have a `td:nth-child(2), td:nth-child(3), td:nth-child(4), td:nth-child(5)` >.>
[06:41:09] <aji> don't think so :(
[06:41:13] <Moonlightning> And that doesn't cover `th`es
[06:41:15] <Moonlightning> dear Luna :(
[06:41:24] <aji> i really think you should just suck it up and use class="" :(
[06:41:52] <Moonlightning> Nonono
[06:42:02] <Moonlightning> Doing this would be better than writing class="" every time I make a new cell
[06:42:24] <Moonlightning> Thanks though

[06:51:53] <Googie> I can't remember the exact codepage.

[06:52:35] <Finwe> Some keyboards actually have the Compose key.
[06:52:41] <Moonlightning> option-semicolon -> ellipses
[06:52:42] <Finwe> Sun keyboard at least.
[06:53:01] <AppleDash> I feel like it was something that catered to people like Shutter, Googie, because IRC was developed by a lot of them :(
[06:53:18] <aji> compose .  .  .

[06:54:11] * Googie hugs HoneyDrops|Half back
[06:54:43] * HoneyDrops|Half uses right-alt as compose.  I don't really need a second alt key (well 3rd, I already have Escape :p)
[06:54:50] <AppleDash> That's not a charset, that's a... rules for determining what is lowercase and upper :P
[06:54:51] <Moonlightning> You mean, `compose-(dot, dot, dot)`
[06:55:21] <Moonlightning> disambiguation :3
[06:55:47] <AppleDash> Googie, I was going for things like ÅåÆæØø
[06:56:09] <Googie> Honestly that's one of the problems with IRC that still hasn't (really) been solved.
[06:56:22] <Googie> There's no standard codepage or character encoding for IRC.
[06:56:27] <Moonlightning> compose-(shift-a, o)
[06:56:36] <AppleDash> yes
[06:56:39] <Moonlightning> compose-shift(a, e)
[06:56:49] <Moonlightning> compose(shift-o, slash)
[06:56:52] <AppleDash> So I take avantage of that and get mad at people who don't use ASKII
[06:57:03] <Moonlightning> s/\(/-(/
[06:57:34] <AppleDash> slash-k-l-i-n-e-m-o-o-n-l-i-g-h-t-n-i-n-g
[06:59:01] <Moonlightning> how do you have enough fingers to press that? 6_9
[06:59:21] <Moonlightning> Unless you meant `'/kline moonlightning'`
[06:59:25] <Moonlightning> which expands to a completely different thing
[07:00:03] <Moonlightning> slash, k, l, i, n, e, space, m, o, o, n, l, i, g, h, t, n, i, n, g
[07:00:19] <Moonlightning> And then the text would just sit there because you forgot the trailing `return`

[07:02:11] * Phase thinks utf8 should just be made standard for irc
[07:02:26] <Phase> i mean what other encoding would you use?
[07:02:39] <AppleDash> ASCII
[07:03:06] <Phase> utf8 is a superset, plus there's more languages than english
[07:03:08] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: Who says I'm just using my fingers!
[07:03:23] <AppleDash> I have definitely involved my tongue in complex key combos before that I just haven't been able to reach
[07:04:25] <aji> Googie: Phase: "we'll just leave it to the clients, problem solved!" -punting in action
[07:04:29] <Phase> quite fortunate ascii was 7 bit
[07:04:32] <aji> tho tbf utf-8 didn't really exist when irc was standardized
[07:04:32] <Phase> aji, XD
[07:04:35] <Moonlightning> there, I'm happy enough with this now
[07:04:58] <aji> (more like "punting inaction" HUR!)
[07:05:14] <Phase> ASCII is de-facto standard far as i can tell, but because utf8 is a superset that's what clients tend to use, and it 'just works'
[07:05:27] <Phase> to irc servers it's just more bytes to throw around
[07:05:35] <aji> ight
[07:05:37] <AppleDash> yeah

[07:40:20] <One-Trick> how would you kick a user using all unicode chars?
[07:40:57] <Googie> Exactly. Stuff like that makes it a pain. Especially if they're using non-printable characters.
[07:41:12] <Moonlightning> No, no. You can't have unprintables in nicks.
[07:41:17] <wolfyshy> so disallow non-printable characters
[07:41:27] <Googie> It gets a bit more tricky than that
[07:41:49] <One-Trick> thats how i kept a lot of people messaging me in WoW back in the day. my character name started with a É
[07:41:53] <Phase> don't the unicode guys provide that data?
[07:41:54] <Googie> What's the difference between unprintable and ancient hieroglyphics ?
[07:42:22] <Googie> (Hence why I'm just doing a whitelist of allowed unicode characters defined in the configs)
[07:43:19] <Googie> uSpoof is interesting though. That might be very useful.
[07:44:15] <Phase> i'm fairly sure this stuff is already stored somewhere
[07:44:34] <Googie> Yeah, libICU comes with a database that has all that sort of data.
[07:44:37] <Phase> whether a character is printable or not is at least
[07:44:57] <Phase> as in the unicode consortium provides it
[07:44:58] <Googie> The thing is though, if a character is printable is different from "is a character printable in any sane font" :V
[07:45:06] <Googie> That too, but then you have to parse a lot of it.
[07:45:10] <Phase> i know it doesn't *solve* the problem, it does the bulk of it
[07:45:15] <Phase> but it does'

[09:52:15] <Moonlightning> Okay, I need sleep, but a question for you pones to answer while I'm gone
[09:52:38] <Moonlightning> Every time there's a section thing in an HTML document, and you jump to a section, and it has a header
[09:52:54] <Moonlightning> It looks…squished. There's way not enough whitespace at the top.
[09:53:08] <Moonlightning> Especially in proportion to the side margins, and what the top and bottom margins /normally/ are.
[09:53:53] <Moonlightning> So…is there a way to make it so that when a user jumps to a section in a document, the top margin is completely on-screen?

[20:43:05] <Moonlightning> Odd behaviour is odd.
[20:43:08] <Moonlightning> behavior *
[20:43:33] <Moonlightning> So I got a `body > section > blockquote > p > i` here
[20:43:55] <Moonlightning> And I have the inspector open, fiddling with the spacing
[20:44:25] <Moonlightning> Now…<p>s have a vertical margin of 16px.
[20:44:54] <Moonlightning> And I was fiddling with the padding of the <blockquote>, trying to make it space right internally with the <p>
[20:45:11] <Moonlightning> The vertical padding there wsa originally 10px.
[20:45:24] <Moonlightning> And I turned it down…down…down…
[20:45:48] <Moonlightning> Even at 1px, there was too much space
[20:46:14] <Moonlightning> But then I turned it down to 0px, and suddenly there was no space at all between the <p> border and the <blockquote> border.
[20:47:04] <Moonlightning> When the <blockquote> padding was nonzero, the <p> would always be laid out so that its margin wouldn't intersect with the <blockquote>s padding
[20:47:54] <Moonlightning> But as soon as I changed the <blockquote>s padding to zero, that constraint disappeared.

[22:42:01] <Gigabit> can't even shutdown my pc to restart it, without a hard shutdown, unless I can do it via terminal
[22:43:35] <Moonlightning> Resorts.
[22:43:44] <Moonlightning> The absolute last resort is the hardware reset.
[22:43:52] <Gigabit> Nevermind got iiiit
[22:43:54] <Moonlightning> Before that, try doing a firmware-level reset
[22:44:01] <Moonlightning> Before that, in Linux, try the magic sysreq thing
[22:44:04] <HoneyDrops|Half> ctrl+alt+f2 to switch to a tty?
[22:44:06] <Gigabit> forgot that cntrl alt del, brings up a menu
[22:44:13] <Moonlightning> Ah, good.
[22:44:25] <Moonlightning> That's one of the first things to try.
[22:44:33] <Moonlightning> Also try SSHing to get a terminal.
[22:44:55] <Seoson> Also Shift+Alt+T at least in GNOME if I recall correctly
[22:46:27] <Seoson> Or mabe Ctrl + Alt + T .... Oh dear I should use Linux desktops more often ^^
[22:46:39] <Moonlightning> meta-control-t sounds right.
[22:47:49] <Gigabit> HoneyDrops|Half,  XD
[22:48:01] <Gigabit> I pressed that and got to the screen and could not get back
[22:56:25] <HoneyDrops|Half> ctrl+alt+f7 (normally) to get back to X
