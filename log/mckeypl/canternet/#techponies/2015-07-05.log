[00:20:19] <Twilightlicious> You guys remember when i called this, right? http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/4/8892825/minecraft-windows-10-edition-beta-features
[00:20:20] <PinkiePieBot> [ Minecraft for Windows 10 beta arrives on July 29th launch day | The Verge ]
[00:21:35] <Twilightlicious> Though i thought they would use the version made by 4J Studios
[00:21:45] <Twilightlicious> but it seems they're going with the terrible Pocket Edition instead

[01:59:49] <cyborg_ar> hmm i wonder if there's a proof that all terminating fractional numbers expressed in one base can be expressed in another if and only if the other base has all the prime factors of the former
[02:00:16] <cyborg_ar> say, base 10 can represent all base 2 numbers exactly, but not the opposite
[02:03:09] <Cydie> You talking about exponents cyborg_ar?
[02:03:24] <cyborg_ar> about fractional numbers like 0.1
[02:03:58] <cyborg_ar> 0.1d can't be represented in binary with a finite number of digits
[02:04:42] <Cydie> Eh I can't learn binary
[02:05:02] <cyborg_ar> it's something like 0.0(0011)b
[02:05:15] <cyborg_ar> with the 0011 bit repeating tru infinity
[02:05:19] <Cydie> Lol who likes learning binary? Not me
[02:06:15] <cyborg_ar> so converting decimal to binary and back necessarily has a quantifiable rounding error
[02:08:53] <Phase> fractions work, 1/1010

[09:45:30] <Twilightlicious> Nerds, Assemble!
[09:48:55] <Mike_Coltfield> Is it a GeForce 5-series or older? The answer is 2.
[09:49:01] <Mike_Coltfield> Well, 5xx
[09:49:38] <Twilightlicious> I know my 560 could only do 2
[09:49:43] <Twilightlicious> but my new GPU is a 960
[09:50:14] <Mike_Coltfield> 6, I think, then
[09:50:32] <Twilightlicious> I think that's actually how many ports it has
[09:50:40] <Twilightlicious> 4 DisplayPorts, 1 HDMI, 1 DVI
[09:51:00] <Googie> Apparently four
[09:51:06] <Googie> http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-960/specifications
[09:51:06] <PinkiePieBot> [ GeForce GTX 960 | Specifications | GeForce ]
[09:51:11] <Googie> But that's for the reference design.
[09:51:56] <Mike_Coltfield> Nope 4 displays
[09:51:59] <Twilightlicious> That's fine, i only have 3 anyways lol
[09:52:02] <Mike_Coltfield> Ah, Googie beat me
[09:52:35] * Mike_Coltfield drags Googie off for retribution in the form of banana-chocolate-Nutella crêpes.
[09:52:43] <Minuette> did nvidia finally add in 4+ monitor support again?
[09:53:02] <Minuette> I remember a few years ago they removed that from the linux driver for "feature parity"
[09:53:15] <Minuette> people were not happy
[09:53:34] <Mike_Coltfield> Understandably. I think my next card's going to end up being an AMD.
[09:54:01] <Mike_Coltfield> They have better driver support these days and they stopped overheating, so there goes my only real complaints against them.
[09:54:02] * Googie is really considering getting an AMD GPU as well, even if a new Nvidia one would be slightly better in terms of $/performance.
[09:54:21] <Googie> AMD's approach for Linux drivers recently has been quite interesting.

[10:01:06] <Twilightlicious> like 10 years ago
[10:01:23] <Twilightlicious> Because AMD Seemed to only update their cards for like a year
