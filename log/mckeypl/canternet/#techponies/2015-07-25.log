[04:20:46] <Moonlightning> Well, the report didn't list a parent process. If a shell running under tmux crashes, it apparently lists tmux as the parent
[04:21:00] <Moonlightning> So I think I can assume it's nothing important.

[14:54:45] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it took 12 hours, (including waiting for the parts to arrive) but i finally got the timing chain replaced on my 4x4
[14:55:11] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> after alligning the timing chain (which it wasnt before) now i'm getting an odd surging but no hesitation at acceleration, i'm thinking vacuum leak
[14:56:39] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> hilariously enough though, from a standing start, i can smoke the rear tires which i was unable to do before (the timing chain i replaced had 14 degrees of play between the roation of the crank beginning to the distributor starting to move
