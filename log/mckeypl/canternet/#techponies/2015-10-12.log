[04:59:21] <Compu> well i called verizon tech coach about my phone not recieving texts properly and they hung up on me after i told them that a reset usually refers to a factory data reset and not to a reboot
[04:59:32] <Compu> i wasnt even being rude about it
[04:59:39] <Compu> i was calmly informing them
[05:00:13] <JustAberrant> :(
[05:02:02] <Compu> yeah i dont know whats going on
[05:02:07] <Compu> they had me reboot my phone
[05:02:26] <Compu> and then while i was doing so they hung up
[05:02:58] <Compu> before that they had me shut it off so they could "remove it from the tower and put it back on" or something
[05:03:09] <Compu> then they had me turn it back on and make a test call
[05:03:21] <Compu> and then they had me reset my messages app
[05:03:36] <Compu> and thats when they said to "reset the phone"

[20:39:14] <init3> Hey, there's no way (other than adding server addresses to the routing table) to specify a certain application use a particular interface is there? I'd like my IRC client to always use my wireless card so when I get lazy and take it to my bed I don't have to reconnect. My current method is just to unplug the ethernet while it connects. 
[20:39:48] <init3> Since I use ipv6 seamless failover wouldn't really help. 
[20:41:30] <init3> (I don't think, unless the IRC server would be okay with my connection switching addresses)
[20:43:13] <Webster> init3: An app can choose a specific interface, but it requires support that.
[20:47:17] <init3> Right, but in this case I'd need to do it besides the app. It does not seem to support it. I'm wondering if some sort of iptables magic or something else like that could work. 
[21:07:11] <Webster> Possibly.
[21:07:19] <Webster> Enable NAT and use the pre-routing table maybe.
