[00:09:30] <JustAberrant> not quite, no ;p
[00:10:43] <HoneyDrops> I don't know how it's done in MS Windows, but X it's not hard.
[00:11:53] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: it's a whole stack..  monitor < vid card < drivers < xorg < toolkits (sometimes) < window manager < toolkits < applications
[00:12:53] <Stik> oh i had no intention of doing antyhign c++ Shutter , don't fear :P
[00:13:36] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Well, I don't know of any APIs for doing that.
[00:14:01] <HoneyDrops> Xlib~
[00:14:20] <RazorSharpFang> What if it's windows?
[00:14:46] <JustAberrant> you can probably make most toolkits (Qt, gtk) do it, but you might need to go down into the lower level libraries (i.e. xlib)
[00:14:57] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: then it's a completely different implementation
[00:16:04] <JustAberrant> either way, you're basically skipping/ignoring the window manager and talking directly to xorg
[00:16:29] <RazorSharpFang> So, you could just say "draw this X image here"
[00:16:31] <JustAberrant> you could also probably use xcompositing/etc .. I don't know anything about that though :>

[00:38:35] <RazorSharpFang> In windows there's an ALWAYS_ON_TOP flag.
[00:39:23] <RazorSharpFang> Multiple things can have that flag true, so just because you're 'on top' does not mean you may be the top_most thing.

As a result, the program `pax` (Latin for "peace" in the tar wars) was created and standardized. `pax` however did not gain popularity as its syntax is less risky but also less intuitive than the tar syntax. Another problem may be that `gpax` is more or less unmaintained.

[04:23:50] <init3> Even though I rather like KDE but that's just me.

[04:25:09] <init3> I hate getting asked questions like this because to me it is like, "What flavor of ice cream should I get?"
[04:25:13] <HoneyDrops> I started with Gentoo, and have always had at least one Gentoo system (generally primary).  But I also run Debian (still pre-systemd), and Slack.  I've used/supported most common ones.

[04:26:11] <Starthunder> I need to switch my servers over x.x
[04:26:16] <init3> Mandrake was babby init's first linux. 
[04:26:21] <Starthunder> should probably do that soon, before I stop being able to update
[04:26:27] * JustAberrant hasn't used slackware in a long damn time (since it came on lettered floppies)... but yeah, gentoo became my go to.. I've got other machines with other distros, and have tried both debian and arch on the desktop (and didn't like either).. but gentoo is definitely my staple
[04:26:37] * JustAberrant now kinda curious what slackware is even like now
[04:27:22] <Starthunder> the i3 screenshot on Wikipedia makes it look like just a CLI thing xD
[04:28:10] <init3> At risk of starting this tired argument again, I understand what people don't like about systemd, but I feel that at some point the lengths required to avoid it are way more annoying than the lengths required to get used to it.  
[04:28:37] <init3> I might try XFCE Starthunder as a starting point. Can always uninstall it.
[04:29:11] <init3> THat's a full desktop environment so it'll pretty much be usable as a full workstation once you install it. 
[04:29:31] <JustAberrant> init3: that in itself is why people hate systemd, but yeah, I accept that at _some point_ it's going to happen, I'm gonna say fuck it and use it.. but I'll be pissed off as hell about it

[04:29:54] <Starthunder> What, you mean it isn't a full usable workstation now?!
[04:29:57] <init3> Otherwise you are going to need to install each individual thing one by one as you need it. Which I get there are reasons for that
[04:30:09] <JustAberrant> (an init system shouldn't come with an overwhelming sense of inevitability that it will be the only choice you have if you want a functional system)

[04:30:20] <Starthunder> I should probably mention I intend to run Steam on top of it, and games on top of that
[04:30:47] <init3> I mean, twm is a perfectly usable GUI
[04:30:54] <init3> Not saying it isn't
[04:31:09] * Starthunder will try xfce.
[04:31:13] <HoneyDrops> If I have to, I will just roll my own distro, but I am confident Gentoo will continue to offer a choice.
[04:31:21] <init3> BUt you'll need to install each and every tool by hand you don't want to just use xterm for. 
[04:31:27] <Gigabit> Starthunder,  I have xfce and like it. If that helps :P

[04:40:31] <HoneyDrops> A DE consists of a collection of applications, a WM, generally a bar/menu system (which ofter has a system tray) and has a backend to integrate it all.
[04:40:39] <Starthunder> Ooooh.
[04:40:44] <Starthunder> hmm.
[04:40:58] <HoneyDrops> A WM literally just manages (and possibly decorates) windows.

[04:41:14] <Starthunder> I guess I want a full DE then?

[04:42:22] <init3> o3o

[04:43:44] <init3> Example: http://lxlinux.com/lxdeobmenu.png
[04:43:49] <HoneyDrops> Generally a DE comes with a file manager, a text editor, a web browser, some system-settings programs, often a preferred media player, email client, etc

[04:51:21] <init3> Which I suppose is another one to look at Starthunder, though I'm not a huge fan.

[04:56:12] <init3> But admittedly it probably doesn't operate like it as far as the top menu looks though. But you can make the dock look almost exactly like an OSX dock. 
[04:56:30] <init3> I mean, like the top menu becoming the menu for the app in use
[04:56:37] <RazorSharpFang> I found ElementaryOS to be similiar to MacOSX

[05:04:45] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, we've got D3D8 and D3D9 working, but D3D7 has issues.
[05:10:22] <RazorSharpFang> What would be the best way for me to change the Apache2 webserver root directory?
[05:12:53] <Starthunder> So waitâ€¦where does Xorg come into all of this?
[05:16:52] <HoneyDrops> Xorg is the X server
[05:19:44] <HoneyDrops> Xorg is the display server, all clients (which the WM is one) interface with it to display.  The server also sends events to the clients (though the WM, kinda).

[05:21:53] <HoneyDrops> You can even run X w/o a window manager, though you run into issues if you have multiple windows as you cannot easily resize, move, or re-stack X clients w/o one.

[05:36:10] <Starthunder> Okay.
[05:36:13] <Starthunder> Unrelatedâ€¦wtf?
[05:36:25] <Starthunder> Okay, so I had net-fs/cifs-utils installed
[05:36:29] <RazorSharpFang> That's weird... my symbollic link isn't showing up in Apache's directory listing.
[05:36:34] <Starthunder> Then I depcleaned it 'cos I didn't want it anymore
[05:36:52] <Starthunder> As far as I knew, it was removed then
[05:36:54] <Googie> The default configuration of Apache likely doesn't allow symlinks outside of the web directory for security reasons
[05:37:05] <Starthunder> But I did a depclean with no arguments just now, and a /ton/ of packages showed up slated for removal
[05:37:10] <Googie> You need to change your Apache configs if you want to change the web root.
[05:37:11] <Starthunder> includingâ€¦net-fs/cifs-utils
[05:37:21] <Phase> Googie, i think the default config disallows symlinks regardless
[05:37:22] <Googie> (Though I'd recommend Nginx instead. Much nicer configs :V)
[05:37:43] <RazorSharpFang> Googie: Apache is all I've ever used. : /
[05:38:00] <RazorSharpFang> Yet, I don't know how to change the server root...
[05:38:28] <RazorSharpFang> Could I just mount a directory into the current server root?
[05:38:35] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: those are all deemed unneeded by portage.
[05:38:49] <Starthunder> HoneyDrops: but why didn't the earlier depclean get rid of them?
[05:38:51] <RazorSharpFang> like /media/razor/HardDisk/ into /var/www/html/

[05:40:19] <HoneyDrops> I never use depclean in any context aside from `emerge --depclean`

[05:41:06] <Googie> RazorSharpFang: RTFM
[05:41:08] <HoneyDrops> If I am removing something manually, I always use emerge -C

[05:41:53] <RazorSharpFang> I don't understand why it's 000-default.conf
[05:41:59] <RazorSharpFang> 000 ? Why 000?
[05:43:08] <Starthunder> As opposed to 001 or 100?
[05:43:26] <Starthunder> No real reason, I guess, just proper zero-indexing.
[05:43:49] <Starthunder> You /could/ add 100 to everything (provided that doesn't make anything go over 999); whatever's reason the config doesn't care
[05:44:00] <Starthunder> â€¦probably. It's conceivable that 000 is special, but I don't think it likely.

[06:44:12] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not getting this.
[06:44:25] <ShivalWolf> is razor a mountpoint?
[06:44:42] <RazorSharpFang> I'm unfamiliar with mountpoints.
[06:44:52] <ShivalWolf> is it like a usb device or external drive
[06:45:10] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah
[06:45:41] <ShivalWolf> type mount
[06:45:46] <ShivalWolf> grab the line relevent
[06:47:22] <Starthunder> Ohhh, yeah. What filesystem?
[06:47:33] <Starthunder> Some filesystems do weird things with permissions
[06:47:41] <Starthunder> like ignore changes, returning success but changing nothing
[06:47:48] <RazorSharpFang> fuseblk
[06:47:54] <Starthunder> often because the filesystem doesn't support POSIX permissions
[06:48:04] <Starthunder> and so permissions for every item in the filesystem are specified in the mount options
[06:48:14] <Starthunder> speaking ofâ€”show us those mount options
[06:48:20] <Starthunder> preferably just the entire line from `mount`
[06:48:32] <RazorSharpFang>  /dev/sdb2 on /media/razor/HardDisk type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)
[06:49:53] <ShivalWolf> its a fuseblk guessing NTFS formatted drive. ntfs does not support linux file permisions so thats why you cant chmod it
[06:50:17] <RazorSharpFang> Dang.
[06:50:31] <RazorSharpFang> Can I just have Apache running under root?
[06:50:57] <RazorSharpFang> Bad Habitsâ„¢
[06:51:19] <ShivalWolf> you probably want to manually mount the drive into another location and alter the permisions setting so it mounts as global read/write/execute
[06:51:35] <RazorSharpFang> That sounds like a better solution.
[06:52:23] <Starthunder> Even better solution, make it so that you don't need to serve from an NTFS volume
[06:52:28] <Starthunder> What are you doing that for, anyway?
[06:52:49] <ShivalWolf> you probably need to look at putting it in your fstab and look at the ntfs-3g mount options for permisions
[06:53:06] <ShivalWolf> or copy everything off
[06:53:13] <ShivalWolf> blow NTFS away and format it to native linux FS
[06:53:20] <ShivalWolf> but then you dont get windows access to the drive anymore
[06:53:22] <Starthunder> I second the latter option.
[06:53:32] <Starthunder> Do explain your current setup, though
[06:54:37] <RazorSharpFang> System is designed to be a lightweight mediaserver, allowing network users to access files on the ExHD through their browser.
[06:55:29] <RazorSharpFang> The machine itself is VERY old, and has few uses itself. (70GB HDD, Pentium 4 CPU, NVidia GeForce 8500 GT, 1.5GB DDR1 RAM)
[06:55:32] <Starthunder> Will this external disk need to be regularly disconnected from the server and connected to a Windows machine?
[06:56:04] <RazorSharpFang> Starthunder: It will not be. But it's contents exceed ALL current storage that I have excluding the ExHD.
[06:56:18] <RazorSharpFang> I can't put it anywhere temporarily.
[06:56:21] <Starthunder> Mmmmm.
[06:56:52] <Starthunder> What's its capacity and current usage?
[06:57:13] <RazorSharpFang> 1 TB, 75% usage
[06:58:45] <HoneyDrops> I would pull the graphics card, that P4 is going to suck enough watts on its own.
[06:58:46] <Starthunder> Can you give us a ballpark breakdown of what all that stuff is?
[06:59:01] * Starthunder is now known as Watt.
[07:00:20] <RazorSharpFang> Starthunder: About 50% Video, 40% executables (games, software) and 10% archives
[07:00:59] <Starthunder> Archives as in the compressed kind?
[07:01:14] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah
[07:01:23] <Starthunder> Mmmmm.
[07:01:51] <RazorSharpFang> It used to b e 95% capacity, but i'm converting a bunch of DivX to H.264.
[07:02:00] <RazorSharpFang> Using the pentium 4.
[07:02:06] <Starthunder> Okay, I'd say find a way to borrow|rent a one-tera disk in the near future so you can switch filesystems
[07:02:07] <RazorSharpFang> This is a slow process.
[07:02:15] <Starthunder> 6_9
[07:02:25] <Starthunder> In the meantimeâ€¦yeah, go with setting the permissions to be more open
[07:02:31] <Starthunder> â€¦althoughâ€¦grrrrrâ€¦
[07:02:36] <RazorSharpFang> ?
[07:03:08] <Starthunder> Linux has ACLs, and there's supposed to be a richacls thing coming soon|now
[07:03:17] <Starthunder> richacls map pretty well to NTFS ACLs
[07:03:47] <Starthunder> â€¦nah, even if everything else supported richacls right now, there's no way fuse+ntfs-3g would add support that quickly
[07:03:49] <Starthunder> damn.
[07:04:21] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: do clients to this web thing need to be able to modify any of the files on this disk?

[07:07:39] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: can I explaiiiin :(
[07:07:52] * Soarin dodges cause ain't nopony got time for that ;p
[07:07:55] <RazorSharpFang> What the + means? Yes.
[07:08:02] * Starthunder blinks.
[07:08:46] <Starthunder> Well, okay. The + flag means that there is an ACL on this item. Mind you, it's almost certainly a Linux-style ACL, not an NTFS-style one (those aren't supported anyway).
[07:09:27] <Starthunder> ACLs are basically just an extension of the same three read|write|execute permissions to more users and groups than just the owning user and owning group.
[07:09:43] <Starthunder> I was asking if I could explain POSIX permissions to you, though. I really think it's important you understand :<
[07:09:44] <RazorSharpFang> Now it says "permission denied" when I try to cd into razor.
[07:09:57] <Starthunder> Though you don't have to listen to me. :p You could find an article to explain
[07:10:02] <RazorSharpFang> drwxrw-r--+
[07:10:10] * Starthunder sighs. :p
[07:10:16] <Starthunder> Okay, POSIX permissions 101.
[07:10:34] <RazorSharpFang> So, given that /I/ can read/write/exec, and given that anyone in my GROUP can read/write, and ANYONE can READ, Why can /I/ not?!
[07:10:43] <Starthunder> I'll get to that in a minute.
[07:11:19] <Starthunder> You have three permissions. Read, write, execute. And you have threeâ€¦uhâ€¦things. Owning user, owning group, and others.
[07:11:33] <Starthunder> The permissions are pretty straightforward when applied to files.
[07:12:13] <RazorSharpFang> But it's my directory. I own it.
[07:12:17] <Starthunder> The trick is that, for /directories/, execute permission means traverse permissionâ€”i.e. you need execute permission in order to do anything with the directory's /contents/
[07:12:38] <Starthunder> Regardless of the permissions on the contents.
[07:13:20] <Starthunder> Read permission means list permissionâ€”you need it to `ls` the directory, in short
[07:13:43] <Starthunder> Those two aren't entangledâ€”you can have one without the other, and it'll work as you'd probably expect.
[07:14:07] <Starthunder> Write permission means permission to change the contents (sort of)
[07:14:13] <Starthunder> and here it really helps to think of a directory as a file.
[07:14:19] <Starthunder> (which is pretty much is.)
[07:14:35] <RazorSharpFang> So, if /I/ am the owner of the directory, and that the directory has read/write/execute permissions for the owner, why can't I access it?
[07:15:09] <Starthunder> â€¦you should be able to. O.o
[07:15:21] <Starthunder> Check the ACL on it, maybe?
[07:15:33] <Soarin> Um. Silly question here but are you logged in as your account who has ownership of said file?
[07:15:34] <Starthunder> getfacl $directory
[07:15:48] <Starthunder> (A directory is nothing more than a list mapping filenames to inodes.)
[07:16:07] <RazorSharpFang> Soarin: Yes.
[07:16:09] <Starthunder> (If you have write permission on a directory, you can change that list. You can add a mapping, delete a mapping, and change the name on a mapping.)
[07:16:28] <Soarin> I should have asked.. Are you accessing the file as an account or member of s group that you gave access to it?
[07:16:41] <Soarin> Okay, never mind me. Was hoping to maybe help
[07:16:46] <Starthunder> (In practice, this means that you need write permission on a directory to create, delete, move and rename items inside of it.)
[07:16:49] <RazorSharpFang> I'm accessing it as razor@Server.
[07:16:57] <RazorSharpFang> file owner is razor

[07:19:29] <RazorSharpFang> That's it.
[07:19:35] <Starthunder> There's your problem.
[07:19:49] <Starthunder> With ACLs, the standard group-permission field is reappropriatedâ€¦
[07:20:12] <Soarin> Group isn't it? Damn you Starthunder I was trying to ask that first :<
[07:20:15] <Starthunder> It's used as a /mask/ field. Only permissions set in the mask field can be granted by an ACE.
[07:20:34] <Starthunder> Soarin: If I answer your question before you ask it, that means I'm doing it right. :3
[07:20:51] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not really getting it. : /
[07:21:37] <Starthunder> ACL entries override the standard permissions (I think).
[07:22:09] <Starthunder> So even though you own it, and the owning user has rwx, your specific ACL entry only has rw-
[07:22:40] <Starthunder> Therefore, you only have rw-.
[07:23:06] <RazorSharpFang> So, how would I rectify this?
[07:23:36] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|Sleepies
[07:23:40] <Starthunder> Do you need ACLs? It may be simpler to go without them.
[07:24:13] <RazorSharpFang> No. I just want to use the HDD as a media server.
[07:24:29] <RazorSharpFang> This was much simpler on windows. ;-;
[07:25:30] * Starthunder takes an ext4 filesystem, attaches it to a Windows machine, and tries for several hours to get the permissions to play nice without knowledge of the Windows permissions system without converting it to a filesystem Windows does natively.
[07:25:37] <Starthunder> This was much simpler on Gentoo. >:(
[07:26:14] <RazorSharpFang> That wasn't the emote I used.
[07:26:16] <HoneyDrops> Standard posix permissions are easy, what distro is using ACL by default?
[07:26:29] <RazorSharpFang> I'm on Ubuntu 14.004
[07:26:34] <RazorSharpFang> **14.04
[07:26:54] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: â€¦wait a sec. How do you have an ACL? I thought this was on an NTFS filesystem O.o
[07:27:12] <RazorSharpFang> It is.
[07:27:24] <HoneyDrops> what command are you using to mount it?
[07:27:40] <Starthunder> â€¦waitâ€¦I thought the filesystem was discarding all your permissions changes
[07:27:41] <RazorSharpFang> It automounted.
[07:27:50] <RazorSharpFang> It still is.
[07:28:11] <HoneyDrops> First, disable automount.
[07:28:14] <HoneyDrops> Never automount.
[07:28:17] <Starthunder> /dev/sdb2 on /media/razor/HardDisk type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)
[07:29:04] <Starthunder> (HoneyDrops: automounting as in the DE doing it, or `mount -a`?)
[07:29:25] <HoneyDrops> ( Starthunder: DE/daemon, mount -a is fine )
[07:31:09] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, so how'd I mount it properly? I assume I'd have to unmount it first.
[07:31:16] <HoneyDrops> yes
[07:31:44] * Starthunder (likes not automounting. It means that they can plug stuff in, maybe do some checks on the device, then unplug without waiting.)
[07:33:23] <Starthunder> Turn off automounting first.
[07:33:31] <HoneyDrops> then `mkdir /mnt/<whatever you want to mount to>` (you can make a directory wherever, but /mnt is the standard place) then, `fusermount -o <options, we'll cover those shortly> /dev/sdb2 /mnt/<the mountpoint you made>`
[07:35:04] <Starthunder> They're not running as root, HoneyDrops
[07:35:45] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, this needs to be a directory that apache can access.
[07:36:03] <Starthunder> Not because of that, but because you don't have write for /mnt (probably)
[07:36:19] <Starthunder> (Relatedlyâ€¦shouldn't /mnt be a=rwxt, so you don't have to be root to make a mountpoint and mount something there with e.g. fuse?)
[07:37:15] <Starthunder> Also, can we work on turning off automount first? Don't want Unity autoremounting it suddenly
[07:39:46] <RazorSharpFang> So, how do you turn off automount?
[07:40:00] <HoneyDrops> You can make the mountpoint wherever, and you can just sudo mkdir to create the mountpoint.

[07:42:05] <RazorSharpFang> I can't seem to get that to work. >.> 
[07:42:19] <Starthunder> Nameserver lookup failedâ€¦
[07:42:33] <Starthunder> â€¦never mind. I'll just paste the relevant bit.
[07:42:36] * RazorSharpFang notes self: Check router
[07:42:41] <HoneyDrops> Anyway, once we get the mount command working, what we'll do is set it up in fstab, so it will mount on boot (I assume this drive is effectively a permanent fixture?)
[07:43:22] <RazorSharpFang> Sorta. The machine itself fails to boot if it's plugged in.
[07:43:38] <Starthunder> Actually, HoneyDrops, can you walk them through this? I need to go make me some tea already
[07:43:38] <RazorSharpFang> I've got "unplug ExHD before booting" written on the machine.
[07:43:53] <Starthunder> Mmm. Should fix that.
[07:44:10] <HoneyDrops> ( I need to sleeps soon, but I can try. )
[07:44:11] <RazorSharpFang> It doesn't get past the bios.
[07:44:31] <HoneyDrops> Can you not install the drive internally?
[07:44:51] <RazorSharpFang> No, it's a USB ExHD.
[07:45:04] <HoneyDrops> It's still a regular drive inside the housing ;)
[07:45:25] <RazorSharpFang> I'd rather not, the machine isn't expected to live for more than ~3 years.
[07:45:54] <HoneyDrops> The only catch is IDE/PATA or SATA and if the motherboard supports it.
[07:45:58] <RazorSharpFang> After which, it will probably fail catastrophically.
[07:46:26] <HoneyDrops> Unless it catches fire, the drive should be fine. >_>
[07:46:39] <RazorSharpFang> My previous one did.
[07:47:02] <RazorSharpFang> Thank goodness for fire extinguishers.
[07:48:14] <HoneyDrops> My last system that died caught fire too.  Only the PSU was toast, though for a while the CPU was going, hard locking, so I gave up on it.
[07:48:42] <HoneyDrops> Anyway, we can just set up a shell script then to mount it.
[07:49:07] <HoneyDrops> or still put it in fstab, and you can just do mount <whwatever mountpoint>
[07:49:38] <RazorSharpFang> Can this be /any/ directory?
[07:51:41] <HoneyDrops> Yes, though for obvious reasons you will not want to use one that is important for other things (mounting random things on /usr will not end well)
[07:55:09] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, that's odd.
[07:55:27] <RazorSharpFang> I've mounted it to ~/http and now it's green.

[07:59:24] <HoneyDrops> (for mounting)
[07:59:30] <RazorSharpFang> Yes.
[07:59:51] <HoneyDrops> Ok, if you don't need write permissions, I would mount it as ro
[07:59:58] <HoneyDrops> but you don't have to.
[08:00:17] <RazorSharpFang> Well, in order to write into it, they'd have to be in my home directory.

[08:07:23] <Starthunder> They'd just need +x on your homedir, and then write permission on whatever item on the disk they wanted to change
[08:07:42] <HoneyDrops> Soarin: yes, they now charge.
[08:07:42] <RazorSharpFang> But somehow they'd have to be in my machine.

[08:45:25] <RazorSharpFang> Is *.tgz a new compression format?
[08:45:47] <Starthunder> Nah
[08:45:51] <Starthunder> It's just .tar.gz
[08:46:47] <Starthunder> â€¦I used to think (mistakenly) that passing -z to tar was somehow fundamentally different than piping tar to gzip
[08:47:08] <Starthunder> and I would use .tgz extensions when doing the former, and .tar.gz when doing the latter
[08:47:19] <Starthunder> (And I would always do the former :p )
[08:47:37] * HoneyDrops always does .tar.<compression extension>
[08:47:42] <Starthunder> I think I'll start always using .tar.gz now
[08:47:43] <Starthunder> Yeah
[08:48:00] <RazorSharpFang> I just use *.zip or *.7z, so...
[08:51:02] <Starthunder> 7zip, ew. Proprietery.
[08:51:04] <HoneyDrops> I have the tools for decompressing rar, zip, 7z, but I never use them (ok, I do use zip to repackage jar files)

[08:52:54] <Starthunder> Oh, 7zip is open?! o.o
[08:52:57] <Starthunder> what am I thinking of?
[08:53:00] <HoneyDrops> rar
[08:53:15] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, rar
[08:53:17] <RazorSharpFang> I hate rars
[08:53:19] <Starthunder> â€¦ahhh.
[08:53:39] <RazorSharpFang> Creating rars is patented, or something.
[08:53:50] <HoneyDrops> "No (decompression source code is available, but it's not free software due to the restriction that it must not be used to reverse engineer the RAR compression algorithm)"
[08:54:03] <HoneyDrops> The format is closed/undocumented.
[08:54:27] <RazorSharpFang> Free as in Freedom.
[08:54:32] <RazorSharpFang> To militarize.
[08:55:18] <Starthunder> rar hasn't caught on, has it.
[08:55:43] <HoneyDrops> it was popular for a while, but seems to have fallen into disuse.
[08:55:44] <Starthunder> (Goodâ€¦now I don't have to reconcile xz haveing 7z headers)
[08:55:52] <Starthunder> good :V
[08:56:27] <HoneyDrops> I mostly recall seeing a whole lot of them on Kazaa
[08:56:46] <HoneyDrops> If you go looking for old console ROMs, you'll also bump into rars
[08:56:50] <Starthunder> wonder if they were getting paid to use rar
[08:57:24] <HoneyDrops> No, it was better compression (as compared to zip) and dialup was still the norm.
[08:57:57] <Starthunder> how's rar compare to the xz|lzma|bz2|gz lineup?
[08:58:36] <RazorSharpFang> I've found that rar performs worse than ultra lzma, but less so on binary executable-like files.
[08:58:59] <RazorSharpFang> A trend that reverses for complexity of binary file.
[08:59:07] <HoneyDrops> xz is lzma
[08:59:17] <Starthunder> I thought xz was lzma2 or something
[08:59:20] <HoneyDrops> but I xz is better compression ratios, iirc.
[08:59:27] <Starthunder> â€¦binaries? don't you generallyâ€¦not try to compress binaries?
[08:59:35] <Starthunder> y'know, like media stuff. It's already compressed.
[09:00:03] <Starthunder> â€¦wellâ€¦maybe. But if you want a smaller binary, you should recompiled with -Os or something, yeah?
[09:00:26] <HoneyDrops> There is no reason to create new rar's, just keep some tool to decompress the odd legacy one you encounter.
[09:00:42] <Starthunder> yeahno
[09:00:44] <HoneyDrops> It's like the floppy drives and ZIP disk drives.
[09:01:21] <RazorSharpFang> Starthunder: I'm referring to binaries instead of source-code.
[09:01:22] <HoneyDrops> I think there are FOSS rar decompressors.
[09:01:25] <RazorSharpFang> Machine instructions.
[09:01:43] <RazorSharpFang> For some reason, rar compresses machine instructions better than any other kind of information.
[09:02:34] <RazorSharpFang> One time, this friend of mine had a paid copy of winrar, so I used it to compare the compression of different file-types and compression schemes.
[09:02:41] <Starthunder> Hmmmmmâ€¦
[09:02:48] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: I know that
[09:02:51] <RazorSharpFang> But I found that the benefit of rar wasn't worth the TIME IT TOOK TO COMPRESS!!
[09:02:54] <Starthunder> that's normally what you mean by /binary/
[09:02:57] <Starthunder> How /do/ you compress binaries?
[09:03:06] <RazorSharpFang> Using the algorithm.
[09:03:06] <Starthunder> â€¦I guess you could o.o
[09:03:15] <Starthunder> I've been assuming they'd have embedded resources
[09:03:18] <RazorSharpFang> A lot of instructions are going to be similiar.
[09:03:21] <Starthunder> butâ€¦beyond text, no; that's silly
[09:04:13] <RazorSharpFang> A lot of software is looping.
[09:04:44] <Starthunder> And there's loop unrolling. That'd compress fairly well, I would think
[09:05:09] <RazorSharpFang> Using algorithms to compress algorithms. 
[09:05:39] <Starthunder> BWOMMMMMMMMM
[09:07:37] <Googie> Starthunder: UPX
[09:07:43] <Starthunder> Googie: hmm?
[09:08:15] <Googie> Compressing executable binaries is quite doable
[09:08:34] <Starthunder> They actually do compress fairly well, don't they?
[09:08:45] <Googie> Yeah
[09:08:46] <Starthunder> Not as well as text, of course, but they're not already compressed.
[09:09:06] <Starthunder> And they generally don't have already-compressed things embedded
[09:12:32] <RazorSharpFang> Machine instructions aren't compressed.
[09:13:04] <RazorSharpFang> They correspond to the instruction on the hardware.
[09:13:12] <RazorSharpFang> (or system call, but whatevs)
[09:16:12] <HoneyDrops> Unstripped binaries are full of a ton of stuff too that compresses well.
[09:16:53] <RazorSharpFang> Isn't the start of every windows executable like WIN32 something something?
[09:16:56] <HoneyDrops> Anyway, it's worth keeping some way to decompress rars around, but there is no reason to every chose it.
[09:17:09] <HoneyDrops> s/every/ever/
[09:17:14] <HoneyDrops> choose*
[09:17:16] * HoneyDrops yawns.
[09:17:37] <RazorSharpFang> I've found that 7zip decompresses rars fine, and it's free software. (Free as in freedom, but also free as in free beer)
[09:18:21] <RazorSharpFang> Also, the windows version integrates beautifully with Explorer.
[09:18:42] <Starthunder> Ugh. I hated that.
[09:18:53] <Starthunder> It always felt soâ€¦ugly. Out of place.
[09:18:59] <Starthunder> Not consisten with the rest of the Explorer UI.
[09:19:08] <HoneyDrops> I just want a simple CLI tool.
[09:19:14] <RazorSharpFang> Right click -> 7-zip -> extract here ?
[09:19:53] <RazorSharpFang> HoneyDrops: You'd like tar, then, right?
[09:19:55] <HoneyDrops> Archivers don't need a GUI, you're just doing file manipulation.
[09:20:39] <RazorSharpFang> but what if you want to selectively extract files?
[09:20:41] <HoneyDrops> I use tar.{b,g,x}z depending on the case.
[09:21:02] <HoneyDrops> You can extract specific files
[09:21:19] <HoneyDrops> It's not as efficient as with zip, but it can be done.
[09:22:06] <Starthunder> So what's the difference between 7z and xz?
[09:22:21] <RazorSharpFang> 7z is a container format. It can contain poo.
[09:22:39] <RazorSharpFang> Isn't xz LZMA2-specific?
[09:23:46] <RazorSharpFang> My internet appears to be struggling a lot.
[09:23:54] <Starthunder> Your uplink *
[09:24:10] <Starthunder> unless you own an entire Internet, in which case /holy shit can I get in on that?/
[09:24:12] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, 7z can contain several different things.
[09:24:14] <RazorSharpFang> Oh, a negative signal to noise ratio.
[09:24:19] <RazorSharpFang> That's not awful.
[09:24:22] <Starthunder> wut
[09:24:26] <Starthunder> how are you even communicating with us?
[09:24:31] <Starthunder> â€¦what does that even /mean?/
[09:24:49] <RazorSharpFang> That's an average, not current.
[09:25:12] <HoneyDrops> a .7z can use lzma, lzma2, bzip, or DEFLATE, iirc
[09:25:13] <Starthunder> Still, it means that you must have had a lot of negative s:r in the last averaging period
[09:26:13] <RazorSharpFang> Oh yeah
[09:26:19] <RazorSharpFang> It goes awful in the rain.
[09:26:46] <Starthunder> wouldn't the lower bound be 0 signal/lots of noise?
[09:26:57] <Starthunder> I meanâ€¦how do you have /negative/ signal?
[09:26:59] <RazorSharpFang> No, because noise can be higher than signal.
[09:27:12] <Starthunder> 0/large_number is still 0
[09:27:17] <RazorSharpFang> Logs

[09:39:31] <Googie> There's an exception for reverse engineering for interoperability

[09:40:41] <HoneyDrops> I don't see why not.

[09:48:53] <Starthunder> I'm writing a thing to spawn subprocesses and redirect their stdio streams arbitrarily
[09:50:03] <Starthunder> Oh, what do I call it, by the way?
[09:50:09] <Starthunder> I'm using `pipemaster` as a working title
[09:51:21] <HoneyDrops> The TPP can jump into a volcano.
[09:51:35] <Starthunder> bit long, don't you think, HoneyDrops?
[09:52:15] <HoneyDrops> `pm`
[09:52:21] <Starthunder> also, I really don't think it can. It /is/ only an agreement, an abstract thingâ€¦
[09:52:25] <RazorSharpFang> I also hate the TPP
[09:52:28] <Starthunder> ^
[09:52:50] <HoneyDrops> No one likes the TPP, except those writing it.
[09:52:54] <Starthunder> `pm` is surely taken, isn't it?

[09:55:57] * HoneyDrops hisses at such fluff.
[09:56:34] <HoneyDrops> does it at least keep the 127 exit code?
[09:56:52] <Phase> yeah
[09:57:19] <Phase> only problem is it actually says command not found twice, one from zsh and the other from the script itself
[09:57:32] <Phase> also zsh is love
[09:57:44] <Phase> righthand prompt ftw
[09:58:30] <Starthunder> Orâ€¦ooh, what about `piper`?
[09:58:42] <HoneyDrops> bash for interactive, and sh for scripting

[10:04:44] <Starthunder> This is much better than that hack with a fifo and two `tee /dev/tty`s ^
[10:05:35] <roflin> is that a minimalist irc chat client?
[10:05:50] <Starthunder> roflin: no; it's an arbitrary redirecting thing
[10:06:05] <roflin> ah, my shell foo isn't that good.
[10:06:06] <Starthunder> Can y'all figure out what that does?
[10:06:18] <Starthunder> roflin: it's a syntax I mostly made up, so it might not be intuitive :p
[10:06:19] <HoneyDrops> minimalist irc is call netcat ;)
[10:06:27] <Starthunder> This one plays pingpong for you though :D
[10:06:34] <Starthunder> So slightly more than minimal.
[10:06:45] <aji> i consider an irc client to be anything that handles PING automatically
[10:06:50] <Starthunder> Does the syntax make sense?
[10:06:58] <aji> if it handles PING automatically, that's all it needs to do as far as i care
[10:07:03] <aji> to be considered an irc client
[10:07:04] <Starthunder> Andâ€¦just everything in general? Does it make sense?
[10:07:07] <Starthunder> Or should I cahnge it?
[10:07:10] <aji> in short, netcat doesn't count!!!!!!!!!!!

[10:08:22] <Phase> HoneyDrops, having the exit code show if != 0 is on its own reason enough to use zsh imo
[10:08:51] <HoneyDrops> I have that in bash

[12:04:57] <Starthunder> RazorSharpFang: yes, but if it was taking longer than you expected, it may have /actually/ been writing 1TiB of useless data over 24000+ files(!)

[12:05:35] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> otherwise NTFS was stopping dead in its tracks at 2.5tb
[12:05:38] <Selina> Compu: it can't handle a 4tb drive with regular formatting.
[12:05:56] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> its NTFS-GPT or something like that
