[04:32:30] <Moonlightning> JackG: wrong scheme, mate
[04:37:16] <JackG> Moonlightning: it's intentional. I link everything with HTTP unless there's some obvious need for security (e.g., e-commerce) (c)
[04:38:02] <Moonlightning> :|
[04:38:42] * Moonlightning hacks JackG's boxes and installs overzealous HSTS lists. :|
[04:39:01] * JackG has crappy shared hosting with no SSL
[04:39:06] <Googie> There's always a need for security and privacy :)
[04:39:17] <JackG> *obvious*
[04:40:07] <JackG> reasons are 1) I have this idea that some people still live in the dark ages w/o SSL/TLS support and 2) if you care that much, you should install HTTPS Everywhere
[04:41:28] <JackG> or 3) I'm lazy
[04:41:45] <Moonlightning> I call bullshit on #3.
[04:41:47] <Googie> The interesting thing with privacy is that it's most effective if everyone uses it, even if they don't care. Otherwise it makes the people that do care stand out.
[04:41:52] <Moonlightning> You just got done saying that it's /intentional./
[04:41:57] <Moonlightning> ^2
[04:42:20] <JackG> I know, #3 was a joke
[04:42:24] <Moonlightning> -.-
[04:42:25] <Midnight_Tinker> Googie: privacy yes, security no
[04:42:29] <Moonlightning> Not a very good joke, then, is it.
[04:42:50] <JackG> and if sites care about security and/or privacy, they can redirect to HTTPS (which a lot do)
[04:43:27] <JackG> 3.1) consistency
[04:43:28] <Googie> There is always a need for security, yes. MITM attacks are annoyingly easy, especially with tools like SSLStrip which are only just starting to be mitigated.
[04:43:42] <Googie> Sites can't reliably redirect to HTTPS.
[04:43:48] <Moonlightning> JackG: Again, bullshit. See your #1. :P
[04:43:54] <Moonlightning> Wanna talk about consistency
[04:43:56] <Midnight_Tinker> oh, I meant security is more effective when the people around you don't use it
[04:44:09] <Moonlightning> What? No it's not.
[04:44:15] <Moonlightning> Not against government attackers, anyway.
[04:44:25] <JackG> Moonlightning: I don't see how those are inconsistent
[04:44:31] <Moonlightning> If only one user out of a million uses security, then they can focus resources on the one user.
[04:44:39] <Midnight_Tinker> you're assuming the one user is a target
[04:44:51] <Moonlightning> Midnight_Tinker: I'm assuming the government's goal is to have everything in cleartext.
[04:44:52] <Midnight_Tinker> in which case no matter what someone with more resources than you is going to have what you don't want them to have
[04:45:03] <Moonlightning> JackG: First you said you had this idea that some people have no TLS support.
[04:45:12] <Moonlightning> JackG: Then you said sites can just redirect to https:.
[04:45:21] <Moonlightning> Pick one. :P
[04:46:18] <JackG> Moonlightning: I can pick both. If sites want to alienate the virtually nonexistent HTTP-only audience, they can. But for those who don't, http: URLs work.
[04:46:26] <JackG> s/those/those sites/
[04:46:29] <Midnight_Tinker> effective security is defined by it being harder to break the security than to not have your thing
[04:46:46] <JackG> also s/who/that/
[04:47:18] <Moonlightning> It's defined by it being impossible to break the security with current resources for a very long time.
[04:49:07] <Moonlightning> Midnight_Tinker: there are government agencies with public stances that people should not encrypt because it makes law enforcement harder.
[04:49:26] <Moonlightning> I don't think jumping from there to /the government is actively trying to crack encryption/ is that big a jump.
[04:51:05] <Midnight_Tinker> no security is impossible to break
[04:51:44] <Googie> It definitely helps if you don't make yourself a target though. See: privacy
[04:54:49] <Moonlightning> Nothing is impossible to break.
[04:59:10] <Midnight_Tinker> thus, an acceptable measure of "impossibility" is to make it not worth the effort

[18:31:13] <Rylee> don't use anything else
[18:31:19] <Rylee> and be happy finally
[18:34:53] <johnsey> http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/10/06/1217248/eu-court-of-justice-declares-us-eu-data-transfer-pact-invalid
[18:37:17] <AppleDash> Rylee: That doesn't tell me when I should change the version
[18:37:39] <Rylee> yes it does
[18:37:51] <AppleDash> Sure
[18:37:53] <AppleDash> But if I do 2
[18:37:53] <Rylee> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
[18:37:54] <Rylee>     MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
[18:37:55] <Rylee>     MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
[18:37:56] <Rylee>     PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
[18:37:57] <Rylee> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
[18:38:04] <AppleDash> I'll be at 0.100.1 very quickly
[18:38:09] <Rylee> err
[18:38:21] <AppleDash> because pretty much every commit adds functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
[18:38:21] <Rylee> major 0 is free reign to not do that
[18:38:21] <Compu> which reminds me
[18:38:25] <AppleDash> And whbat if I don't have an API?
[18:38:29] <Rylee> which is also spelled out
[18:38:40] <Compu> i should make a patch version of compubot with the most recent updoots
[18:38:44] <Rylee> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.
[18:40:00] <Rylee> well, if you don't have an API, then what is it doing?
[18:40:42] <Compu> https://github.com/ask-compu/CompuBot/releases/tag/v1.0.1 im doing androidish release naming ^_^
[18:40:43] <PinkiePieBot> [ Release Applejack Â· ask-compu/CompuBot Â· GitHub ]
[18:41:20] <Compu> should i be changing the release name for bugfix releases? cuz if i do im gonna run out of alphabet letters very quickly
[18:42:18] <AppleDash> Rylee: It's running
[18:42:21] <AppleDash> It's being an IRC bot
[18:42:27] <AppleDash> (I am also writing an IRC bot)
[18:42:41] <Compu> AppleDash: my bot is in active use in my channel
[18:42:56] <Compu> which ur in my channel so u have seen her
[18:43:15] <AppleDash> Inded
[18:43:18] <AppleDash> Indeed
[18:43:23] <AppleDash> I tend to write things and then use them
[18:43:32] <Compu> shes based on the PinkiePieBot in here but it seems Kinsley hasnt been doing a whole lot with PinkiePieBot lately so i branched a while ago and did my own thing
[18:43:40] <Compu> same
[18:45:26] <Compu> i have my bot set up to run without any additional things installed in python but certain features while automatically be disabled if dateutils is not installed in python, features like the release date being shown in spotify url responses
[18:46:12] <Compu> i recently switched to a new api for mlp episodes that provides the airdates in unix time so that while work whether dateutils is installed or not
[18:47:08] <Compu> i also recently completely rewrote the seen module from scratch to use sqlite instead of storing seen info in RAM
[18:47:58] <Compu> i have it set up to where theres a single entry in the database per nick and when a nick posts a new message in any channel the bot is in the old seen entry is replaced with a new one containing said message
[18:48:29] <Compu> i tried to have it do quit/join/part too but apparently phenny didnt like that and kept bugging out
[18:52:16] <AppleDash> Oh, it's that bot framework
[18:52:24] <AppleDash> the one that's basically the one I hate but worse
[18:52:42] <Compu> yeah its what PinkiePieBot is based on
[18:53:03] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: bundle multiple commits into one release :p
[18:53:22] * AppleDash bundles Moonlightning into a release.
[18:53:48] <Rylee> AppleDash: well, IRC bots have some overarching behavior
[18:54:02] <AppleDash> go on
[18:54:14] <Compu> AppleDash: i left all the framework and stuff for entries into the seen database that arent PRIVMSG but for now all the code that would store those entries is commented out
[18:54:33] <Rylee> (I know it's not an article but) my recommendation would be to increment the minor version for each feature if you're going w/ semver
[18:54:35] <Rylee> ALTERNATIVELY
[18:54:42] <Rylee> some projects have time-based release cycles
[18:55:55] <Compu> Rylee: thats what i plan to do, increment the monor version with new features and the patch version with bugfixes and other small bits
[18:56:45] <Compu> i'll also probably only increment the alphabet letter of the release name for minor and major versions
[18:56:55] <Compu> Rylee: whats a good pony B name?
[18:57:15] <Lapsus> Braeburn
[18:57:20] <Moonlightning> ^
[18:57:25] <Compu> sounds good
[18:57:29] <AppleDash> Butts
[18:57:37] <Compu> ill name the next minor release Braeburn
[18:57:57] <Compu> probably Carrot Top after that, then Derpy
[18:58:02] <Compu> hmmmmm
[18:58:10] <Compu> cant think of a good E name tho
[18:58:25] <johnsey> just do feature development on a feature branch, with the commit id appended to the version number and bump the actual version number when a feature is merged into master and considered stable
[18:59:42] <AppleDash> johnsey: That seems sane
