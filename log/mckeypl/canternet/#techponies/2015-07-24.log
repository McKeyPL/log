[12:02:32] <AppleDash> I have no idea what I'm doing
[12:04:08] <Googie> What level are you up to ?
[12:04:33] <AppleDash> Sequence generator
[12:04:41] <AppleDash> Some of my outputs are randomly getting swapped and I have no clue why
[12:04:54] <johnsey> hah an assembly game
[12:05:38] <AppleDash> I can show you the code if you want :P
[12:06:05] <Googie> johnsey: With really really restrictive resource limits per node, woo!
[12:06:15] <Googie> 12 instructions, two registers is all you need!
[12:06:18] <Googie> (Oh, and blocking IO)
[12:06:23] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[12:06:37] <AppleDash> It seems to happen when the B number is lesser, hmm
[12:06:52] <Googie> (And when I say 12 instructions, I actually mean "A stored program capacity of 12 instructions")
[12:06:57] * AppleDash fixed it
[12:07:28] <AppleDash> I feel like this is a bad solution xD
[12:07:34] <AppleDash> Or at least unconventional

[12:11:41] <johnsey> Googie: can you write self-modifying code?
[12:11:50] <Googie> Sadly no :(
[12:11:52] <johnsey> aw
[12:13:42] <johnsey> no bitshift operations? :(
[12:14:04] <Googie> Nope.
[12:14:55] <johnsey> that's a shame. i think i'll still try it out later
[12:15:16] *** Awaykitty is now known as Unixkitty
[12:16:00] <Googie> Most of the difficulty is in figuring out how deal with the limited architecture, and having to use multiple nodes for just about everything.
[12:17:38] <AppleDash> I find myself using adjacent nodes with something like mov right, right in them to give myself more registers
[12:18:10] <Googie> Yeah.
[12:20:25] *** Gigabit is now known as GigaZzz
[12:25:17] <AppleDash> Now I want to see a game like this but with an obscure instruction set nothing like anything sane
[12:25:46] <AppleDash> Where the real challenge is figuring out how to use the "multiply by pi" instruction to perform a left bit shift
[12:25:47] <Stik> like what?
[12:25:50] <Stik> heh
[12:25:55] <AppleDash> :P
[12:26:27] <AppleDash> Well, I guess in this case we wouldn't be working with floating point, but you get the point (no pun intended :P)

[13:22:54] <Googie> Oh PHP. Great bug in their "Random number generator"

[13:23:41] <PinkiePieBot> [ Run your PHP code in our online shell (150+ versions) ]
[13:28:08] <Googie> The RNG only supports 32 bit numbers, so the sane thing to do is just to scale them up if needed...
[13:28:40] <Googie> Incidentally, yes, those numbers are all even
