[00:35:54] <Webster> Sounds like maintenance. :P
[00:36:01] <Moonlightning> In the middle of the afternoon?
[00:36:25] <Webster> You said asleep, so I assumed late.
[00:36:28] <Moonlightning> ISPs don't do periodic disruptive maintenance, do they?
[00:36:38] <Webster> They do if it's something major.
[00:36:40] * Moonlightning napped recently. See the disconnect on the scrollback?
[00:36:45] <Moonlightning> Something major, every few weeks?
[00:36:48] <Webster> Nope, I joined too late.
[00:36:58] <Webster> Or they just might be killing long running connections.
[00:37:26] <Moonlightning> You think?
[00:37:44] <Moonlightning> actually, I called them and mentioned I had long-running connections, and they didn't mention anything about that
[00:37:51] <Moonlightning> And they have good support :B
[00:38:07] <Moonlightning> And, actually…my SSH connections tend to survive.
[00:38:16] <Moonlightning> It's just IRC, but it's /all/ IRC, all five networks

[00:38:48] <Moonlightning> Well, I meant the latter, but the former applies too, to a significantly higher degree than you'd expect from an ISP :3
[00:39:59] <Webster> Not enough keep-alives on it?
[00:40:04] <Sour_Sweet> Oh my ISP support agents are very friendly, but they or only "trained" and know the standard cases. Asking them anything more technical is going to result in very funny answers

[00:41:21] <Moonlightning> So it's not that.
[00:41:38] <Sour_Sweet> A bouncer is no option?
[00:42:08] <Moonlightning> I'd really rather not.
[00:44:22] <Moonlightning> So uh
[00:44:29] <Moonlightning> How do I troubleshoot this? @.@
[00:44:40] <Webster> Wireshark, I guess.
[00:44:46] <Moonlightning> :?
[00:45:04] <HoneyDrops> If one goes to the trouble of a bouncer, it makes just as much sense to just put the client on the server and skip the bouncer.
[00:45:34] <Moonlightning> 'cept you can't really do that for most networks
[00:45:46] <Sour_Sweet> HoneyDrops: I'd still call it a bouncer than :O Using a WeeChat relay myself
[00:46:33] <JustAberrant> meh, bouncers have their advantages
[00:46:46] <JustAberrant> namely using irssi from a phone kinda sucks imo ;p

[00:48:25] <Moonlightning> Oh, cool, wireshark actually has a CLI v—ohp, nope, wait. This is an X thing.
[00:48:28] <HoneyDrops> well I should probably set up mosh, but generally I am using wifi anyway.
[00:49:19] <JustAberrant> also the phone screen is a different size
[00:49:42] <JustAberrant> which means you're either detaching other sessions to get it to resize all the time.. which in the case of irssi is annoying
[00:49:44] <HoneyDrops> I have weechat set to clean up the UI based on terminal size
[00:50:00] <Colgate> Sour_Sweet: why do you consider it a security risk?

[00:50:37] <Sour_Sweet> Leave my notebook unlocked, Somebody exits weechat and has a terminal on my server :P
[00:51:00] <Moonlightning> You leave your laptop unlocked and unattended?!
[00:51:02] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: fine if you don't mind always having to re-attach I guess... my issue with doing that would be I have 3 machines I usually have irssi running on
[00:51:03] <HoneyDrops> :p don't leave a device unattended
[00:51:19] <Sour_Sweet> At work: Sometimes
[00:52:06] <JustAberrant> I use znc mainly as a multiplexer ;p
[00:52:06] <Colgate> if you remove the exec and script plugins, you can use a weechat-relay client of some sort
[00:52:13] <Sour_Sweet> Because of the BS software my employer used it's a pain to login again (delay, re-enter a couple of passwords)
[00:52:31] <HoneyDrops> tmux has a locking system, iirc.
[00:52:33] <Moonlightning> You let your employer install crap on your laptop?!

[00:52:51] <Sour_Sweet> Moonlightning: It's my employers notebook
[00:52:51] <Colgate> make sure you remove them from the filesystem as well
[00:53:03] <Colgate> otherwise someone could /plugin load them
[00:53:04] <Moonlightning> You do personal stuff on your employer's machines?!
[00:53:15] <Sour_Sweet> Yes
[00:53:22] <Moonlightning> Dude. :(
[00:53:23] <Sour_Sweet> Because: why not?
[00:53:33] <Moonlightning> Because shit like this.
[00:53:38] <Moonlightning> I would never trust anything issued by any employer.
[00:53:45] <HoneyDrops> ^
[00:53:45] <JustAberrant> gotta admit, that's kinda silly.. computers are cheap enough that there's no need for that any more ;p
[00:53:47] <Moonlightning> It might have spyware on it, and maybe even legally!
[00:53:49] <Colgate> I ssh into home from my work too :P
[00:54:29] * Moonlightning goes a bit farther…only ever enters any password to a personal thing on machines he owns and trusts
[00:54:51] <Sour_Sweet> I'm on of the few people having full admin right on my machine I'd probably know if something is trying fuck me over. Apart from that I only handle non sensitive private things on this machine
[00:55:04] * JustAberrant secretly hopes Moonlightning gets pwned some day just for the irony ;p
[00:55:11] <Moonlightning> IRC is very sensitive to me :P
[00:55:15] <Sour_Sweet> one* rights*
[00:55:38] <Moonlightning> Seriously, though. Just go buy yourself a cheap laptop that you can just call your own. You can get a pretty decent (I guess?) one for like $250
[00:55:53] <Moonlightning> it's not gonna run all your fancy games and shit, but it'll be fine for IRC and basic browsing
[00:56:02] <Sour_Sweet> I do have 2 laptops around I could use
[00:56:12] <Moonlightning> well then pffffff why are we having this conversation?
[00:56:22] <HoneyDrops> Used netbook is enough for an ssh terminal/basic browsing.  Battery life will suck, but unless you can't find an outlet... that isn't an issue.
[00:56:30] <Sour_Sweet> One of them even having a quite recent dedicated graphics card
[00:56:52] <Sour_Sweet> But there is no reason to bring it to work except for when I really need it
[00:58:01] <Sour_Sweet> I have a full gigbit connection at work, my boss doesn't care and it doesn't show other people THAT obviously when I do private things
[00:59:41] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[01:00:51] <Moonlightning> Sigh. Okay. Whatever.
[01:00:55] <Sour_Sweet> Apart from that my employed did profit from it quite a lot. I did 3d renders at home using a remote access, I use database management things on my server server for company data quite often because it saves a lot of time
[01:00:57] <Moonlightning> Connection drops. How do I troubleshoot them. :(
[01:01:59] <Sour_Sweet> What confuses me is that it doesn't disconnect your SSH sessions. Those are the first that timeout for me
[01:02:29] <Moonlightning> I've found that SSH is more resilient to connection drops.
[01:02:43] <Moonlightning> It tends to be able to continue through them and just pick up afterwards.
[01:03:01] <Sour_Sweet> On very silly solution for your problem (if you cannot find the cause) would be to run your IRC sessions over an SSH tunnel.
[01:03:05] <Moonlightning> Which makes a lot of sense; seems to me any TCP-streaming thing, like IRC(!) should be able to do that
[01:03:27] <Moonlightning> But IRC just won't. The network disconnects after two minutes. Ping timeout.
[01:03:58] <Moonlightning> SSH tunnel wouldn't help…it'd still be my client that would have to respond, which it can't, 'cos the uplink dropped for more than 2 minutes
[01:04:28] <Sour_Sweet> Have you noticed any specific times? Maybe you ISP timeouts the connection for silly anti bot stuff.
[01:04:43] <Moonlightning> No; it feels random.
[01:05:59] <Sour_Sweet> I'd setup some kind of monitoring first to see if the whole connection is gone or if it's just IRC. However 2 minutes without uplink is a more than reasonable time for timeouts :P
[01:06:58] <Moonlightning> Then my ISP shouldn't be killing the uplink (if it is intentional; maintenance or something) for over two minutes without a /very/ good reason.
[01:07:39] *** Joins: LegionRed (LegionRed@The.DragonHorse.DraconisEquus)
[01:07:50] <Moonlightning> Okay, monitoring. Like, what, `ping`?
[01:07:50] <Sour_Sweet> Also you can check your router's logs to see if the problem is between it and the node, in your network or in the ISP's network
[01:07:53] <Moonlightning> But with timestamps?
[01:07:57] <Moonlightning> Oh, really? o.o
[01:08:16] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah or HTTP requests - they work quite good as well
[01:08:23] <Moonlightning> All I see here is downstream DHCP stuff. XD
[01:08:37] <Sour_Sweet> I useally use google because almost zero downtime :P
[01:09:37] <Sour_Sweet> If you write a script and decide to use HTTP make sure to only request the header ^^
[01:10:48] <Moonlightning> So, what, syslog, or something else?
[01:11:01] <Moonlightning> 'cos syslog just has normal-looking DHCP stuff (downstream /and/ upstream, actually)
[01:12:35] <Sour_Sweet> My router has dedicated logs for that. I haven't checked any standard unix/linux logs. I'd watch out for PPoE timeouts (they must be logged somewhere)
[01:13:06] <Moonlightning> Pretty sure this doesn't use PPPoE
[01:13:47] <Sour_Sweet> Mine does :P
[01:14:02] <Moonlightning> Anyway, nothing out of the ordinary in the few minutes leading up to weechat disconnecting

[01:14:55] <Sour_Sweet> Nope just checked: PPPoE

[01:19:10] <wolfyshy> ^
[01:19:27] <Sour_Sweet> DRM will always fail if it doesn't provide the user any advantage. The industry will eventually get it
[01:19:42] <Sour_Sweet> Steam works with me for example ;-)
[01:19:53] <Moonlightning> Well, it won't if it doesn't ever /hinder/ the user.
[01:19:57] <Moonlightning> Like…yeah, Steam :P
[01:20:05] <Moonlightning> I haven't even /noticed/ Steam does DRM
[01:20:10] <Moonlightning> that's how good it is.

[18:35:14] <Rylee> of course you don't use these products for a windows server. you'd use RDP, which is pretty industry standard.
[18:35:20] <Rylee> or you'd use powershell.
[18:35:28] <RazorSharpFang> Yay powershell?
[18:35:39] <Sour_Sweet> Also TeamViewer does NAT traversal for you
[18:35:39] <Moonlightning> Not server server, server as in the thing that runs a server that you're connecting to :P
[18:35:49] <Rylee> .... yes.
[18:36:37] <Sour_Sweet> I've used the windows power shell exactly 2 times in my entire life :P
[18:38:41] <RazorSharpFang> I've mainly used it on Win7 machines that have CMD disabled.
[18:38:57] <Sour_Sweet> WHAT and they leave the power shell on?
[18:39:07] <Sour_Sweet> *facehoof*

[18:46:01] <Moonlightning> We're talking about right-to-be-forgotten and stuffs
[18:47:19] <Sour_Sweet> ^Like it ever was a problem for average users. I had numeros websites delete post about or from me in the past with no problems at all.
[18:47:56] <Moonlightning> That covers literally everything, though, doesn't it?
[18:47:59] <Moonlightning> Archives and shit, too
[18:48:27] <Moonlightning> If you start getting into archives, then you're basically retconning
[18:48:36] <Moonlightning> Which is a redflag
[18:48:56] <RazorSharpFang> I didn't murder those people. *retconned*
[18:48:57] <Sour_Sweet> There is an exception for press, but it's insufficient, so they can even hit the press
[18:49:13] <Moonlightning> what, seriously?
[18:49:20] <Moonlightning> How long ago does the thing have to have happened? o.e
[18:49:25] <Moonlightning> you could potentially use that as a realtime censor
[18:49:39] <Moonlightning> “no, you can't print that I wANT IT TO BE FORGOTTEN”
[18:51:23] <Sour_Sweet> It gets even worse: Know those nice people collecting credit card numbers from hacked websites or database dumps and sending them to the banks? Nope illegal. Hosting content from TheHackingTeam about exploits they've actively used? Nope illegal
[18:53:42] <Moonlightning> People /do/ that?
[18:53:55] <Moonlightning> I wouldn't do that. Ungrateful idiot illiterate banks would probably go after me for hacking -.-
[18:55:34] <RazorSharpFang> Law makers so out of sync, they may as well be using DOS.
[18:59:26] <Sour_Sweet> The law is btw. bundled with the "Vorratsdatenspeicherung" means the long term archival of telecommunication metadata for law enforcement
[18:59:58] <Sour_Sweet> (which is in itself a failure)
[19:00:03] *** Pony_41062 is now known as Fusl
[19:00:39] <RazorSharpFang> I don't understand why they don't ask people working in the tech industry what laws are required.
[19:00:59] <RazorSharpFang> And not just the people at the top.
[19:01:16] <Moonlightning> It's called a technocracy, RazorSharpFang
[19:01:28] <Moonlightning> Teachers determine how the education system works, etc
[19:01:30] <Sour_Sweet> I can only hope that if it passes out high court is voiding it again.
[19:01:48] <Sour_Sweet> our*
[19:05:44] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: I haven't heard anything of the sort. Care to expand on that?
[19:07:55] <Moonlightning> > The technocracy movement is a social movement which arose in the early 20th century. Technocracy was popular in the United States and Canada for a brief period in the early 1930s, before it was overshadowed by other proposals for dealing with the crisis of the Great Depression.[1][2]
[19:07:57] <Moonlightning> > The technocrats proposed replacing politicians and businesspeople with scientists and engineers who had the technical expertise to manage the economy.[1]
[19:08:53] <RazorSharpFang> And that's not the current system, then?
[19:09:16] <Moonlightning> The current system is democracy.
[19:09:23] <Moonlightning> i.e. rule by charismatic politicians.
[19:09:35] <Moonlightning> Read the second bit again/
[19:09:38] <Moonlightning> s:/:.:
[19:10:31] <RazorSharpFang> (replace '/' with '.' ) ?
[19:10:51] <Moonlightning> (Yeah.)
[19:11:09] <RazorSharpFang> I've seen that one used here, where else is it found?
[19:12:54] <Moonlightning> What, the s/// syntax?
[19:12:59] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah
[19:13:15] <Moonlightning> It's found in `sed` and `vi`. Probably other editors, too.
[19:13:47] <Sour_Sweet> Is it non geeky to use nano? :P
[19:14:10] <Moonlightning> vim has soured me to nano
[19:14:18] <Moonlightning> I can't /navigate/
[19:14:41] <Moonlightning> I'm always trying to navigate, and ending up with junk being added to the file instead
[19:15:05] <Moonlightning> I'm so used to `vim`s movements that I hate using `nano`.
[19:15:19] <Sour_Sweet> I cannot handle vim ... I just can't
[19:15:20] <AppleDash> I don't know what's different about navigating
[19:16:13] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: between vim and nano, really?
[19:16:21] <AppleDash> Really
[19:16:47] <Moonlightning> `nano`s movement commands consist of basically arrow keys, home, end, pageup, pagedown, as far as I can tell
[19:16:55] <Moonlightning> There's things like control-w or something to search
[19:17:11] <Moonlightning> That's…about it.
[19:17:12] <AppleDash> I don't call that navigation
[19:17:21] <Moonlightning> It's what I meant by navigation.
[19:17:24] <AppleDash> I use cursor keys, home, end pageup, and pagedown in vim too
[19:17:32] <Moonlightning> I use normal mode in `vim`.
[19:17:38] <AppleDash> no idea what that is
[19:17:49] <Moonlightning> It's when you press escape and you do things that aren't inserting text.
[19:18:13] <Moonlightning> I use ^$|HML extensively
[19:18:31] <Moonlightning> besides things like delete|yank|put, which as far as I can tell, you just can't do in nano
[19:18:56] <Moonlightning> I'm always jumping around in so many ways in `vim`, and, as far as I can tell, you /just can't do/ most of that stuff in `nano`.
[19:19:08] <Moonlightning> It feels so much more slow and limiting.
[19:20:50] * RazorSharpFang just uses pageup and pagedown
[19:21:11] <Moonlightning> I use those, too, sure
[19:21:29] <Moonlightning> But I also use j and k with leading counts
[19:21:35] <Moonlightning> I don't think you can do that in nano
[19:21:40] <RazorSharpFang> jump and.... kill?
[19:22:03] <Moonlightning> move down n lines, move up n lines
[19:22:24] <Moonlightning> part of the hjkl alternative to the arrow keys
[19:22:31] <Moonlightning> They're all on the home row. :P
[19:22:44] <Moonlightning> h is left, l is right; those are straightforward
[19:22:48] <AppleDash> Fun fact, did you know that nano doesn't work on a tty on a 3k or 4k screen?
[19:22:53] <AppleDash> It just claims "Screen too large"
[19:22:59] <Moonlightning> screen too LARGE?

[19:23:49] <RazorSharpFang> You mean the literal glyphs?
[19:23:58] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[19:24:11] <Moonlightning> I've found it an incredibly helpful mnemonic.
[19:25:24] <RazorSharpFang> So, j would be  down, and k would be up?

[19:40:06] <Compu> after all we're on 64 bit now

[19:40:20] <Compu> Moonlightning: theres a point where that becomes impractical
[19:40:21] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: 2038 is the 31-bit overflow, anyway :P
[19:40:25] <RazorSharpFang> 32-bit win10 is a thing.
[19:40:35] <Moonlightning> Compu: 63-bit times will last for billions of years, so

[19:42:10] <AppleDash> far*
[19:42:12] <RazorSharpFang> Don't you mean 128-bit?
[19:42:29] <AppleDash> RazorSharpFang: He's being dumb, just smile and nod
[19:42:29] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: times are signed for some odd reason
[19:42:40] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: okay, you said 2038. 2038 comes from 31-bit.
[19:42:48] <RazorSharpFang> wat
[19:42:51] <Moonlightning> The overflow for 32 bits is in 2106.
[19:42:53] <Moonlightning> Check it.
[19:43:00] <RazorSharpFang> What point is there of having negative times?
[19:43:10] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: …so you can represent times before 1970 :o
[19:43:21] * Sour_Sweet lolz
[19:43:35] <Moonlightning> I think that's actually what it's for.

[19:44:48] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: yes, but if it were unsigned, you couldn't represent times before 1970.
[19:44:56] <Moonlightning> You couldn't store or handle them.
[19:45:29] <Sour_Sweet> We can just start to store dates as DD.MM.YY again, that will cause no problems at all ........ until the year 2100 :P
[19:45:54] <Moonlightning> With a signed 32-bit time field, you can go all the way back to December 1901

[22:32:32] *** Quits: Datalink (Datalink@Datalink) (Connection closed)
[22:35:01] <HoneyDrops> Well that is unrelated, but yes, ideally all software would have publicly viewable source.  If you want a proper free market, it requires goods to be inspectable.
[22:35:43] <HoneyDrops> I am talking about a right to modify, source availibility makes that a whole lot easier, but decompile/recompile or just pulling up the binary in a hex editor works too.
[22:38:41] <init3> I got ya. I don't think companies should be required to make the source publicly available. I don't think that's fair to companies that need to make money off the product itself. 
[22:39:25] <init3> It is kind of shit you can't modify the binary without violating the EULA but if it is for personal use nothing is really stopping you. 
[22:39:51] <HoneyDrops> Source availability doesn't preclude them selling software.
[22:41:14] <AppleDash> Atlassian software is Java and not obfuscated
[22:41:22] <AppleDash> Bypassing license checks is a one-lien change with a decompiler
[22:41:24] <HoneyDrops> You can still have non-permissively licensed software that is open source.  You can still restrict the terms that you can share the source with others, and it's no different than the existing limits on binaries.
[22:41:26] <AppleDash> But they still make lots of money
[22:41:32] <AppleDash> line*
[22:42:28] <init3> Yeah but it makes piracy so much simplier. I guess that might be considered a moot point but there is the IP aspect too. If you are a competitor you can inspect the source to understand how something nifty is done. 
[22:42:38] <HoneyDrops> Piracy is already trivial.
[22:43:07] <init3> Don't just straight rip off the code but you can eaisly use what they are doing as a basis to make your own. 
[22:43:10] <HoneyDrops> DRM is, by the very nature of what it attempts to do, is inherently broken.
[22:43:19] <init3> True
[22:43:29] <init3> I'll give you that. 
[22:43:36] <HoneyDrops> As far as protecting functionality, none exists now anyway.
[22:43:37] <init3> I dunno about the IP aspect though. 
[22:44:17] <HoneyDrops> Nothing stops me from creating a functional equivilent of a program (well aside from patents, but that is another matter that needs fixing).
[22:44:28] <init3> Well if it is something unique and you have a novel approach someone can well rip off the way it is done though. 
[22:44:42] <HoneyDrops> If it's novel, then you can patent it.
[22:44:49] <HoneyDrops> Otherwise, tough cookies.
[22:44:58] <init3> Yeah, i'd fear an open source world would make software patents even more pervasive
[22:46:05] <HoneyDrops> And lets not pretend that a competitor won't just decompile or run it though a debugger.  Source code makes things easier, but doesn't make anything more or less possible.
[22:51:21] <init3> I suppose. I'm not a developer so maybe I'm not well versed enough to say.
