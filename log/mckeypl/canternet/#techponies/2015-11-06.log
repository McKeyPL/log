[00:00:20] <Seoson> Our firewall was setup to whitelist certain ports and block everything else while scanning HTTP and HTTPS
[00:00:28] <Colgate> sure, but if it spots a protocol it doesn't understand, it can just send a RST packet
[00:00:36] <Colgate> and breaking it
[00:00:38] <Seoson> I used an uncommon POP3 port for my SSH tunnel
[00:01:17] <Seoson> There are also tools that tunnel an encrpyted proxy connection over plain HTTP

[00:21:52] <Colgate> and then someone plugs it into your computer
[00:24:05] <Seoson> I'd probably switch the front USB ports off if I'd place it on my desk :P
[00:27:00] <Kinsley> I remember my university having two open Wifi networks. One was public, i.e. anyone can connect and there's no captive portal, but it blocked any traffic not on ports 80 or 443 going out to the wider internet, so I could SSH to the college labs, but not my home box. The other was limited to students and staff and you needed to log in to a captive portal, but it unblocked all the ports to
[00:27:02] <Kinsley> the wider internet.

[00:30:18] <Kinsley> I should look into running a proxy on my VPS to do adblocking for my phone.

[00:34:35] <Dawn> I just use the adblocker package on the iPhone
[00:34:38] <Dawn> \o/
[00:35:31] <Seoson> Does ABP work on the host file or via firewall (meaning it works inside apps) or is it a browser plugin, like on the desktop?
[00:35:59] <Seoson> iirc it didn't work on my device, so assume host/firewall
[00:36:04] <johnsey> browser addon
[00:36:14] <Dawn> Mine works in all of the apps and stuff
[00:36:16] <Seoson> Oh nice. I was not aware
[00:36:27] <Dawn> since it's a system plugin
[00:36:46] <Kinsley> I have a Note 4 on Verizon. I can't root it.
[00:37:09] <Kinsley> Therefore the tricks I used to use on my rooted S4 are no longer available. :'(
[00:37:11] <Seoson> No root exploit? That's sad
[00:37:27] <Moonlightning> What's sad is that you need an /exploit/ to get root access on YOUR OWN DEVICE. :V

[00:39:12] <Dawn> Free as in it's yours to control
[00:39:18] <Dawn> You have root out of the box
[00:39:23] <Dawn> just like on your own linux install

[00:39:48] <Dawn> How would you feel if like on all of the OSes you just listed your PC did not let you have root access?
[00:40:07] <Dawn> You picked up a ubuntu CD and shoved it into your PC and it didn't give you root access out of the box
[00:40:07] <Seoson> Dawn: My phone let's me use root.
[00:40:19] <Dawn> Plenty of them don't out of the box
[00:40:28] <Dawn> Just because one or two do doesn't define the market
[00:40:30] <Seoson> Dawn: I needed to unlock it, yes, but once that's done nothings stops me
[00:40:36] <Dawn> Sure
[00:41:01] <Eclipse> Seoson: most carrier phones you have to sploit to root
[00:41:18] <Dawn> But it shouldn't be necessary to unlock it to get root on the device @.@
[00:41:19] <Seoson> Unlocking is pain free. You'll loose any data present on the phone once.
[00:41:29] <Dawn> That shouldn't be necessary
[00:41:35] <Seoson> Eclipse: In the U.S., but not here
[00:41:37] <Dawn> I have the same complaint about the iPhone

[00:41:41] <Kinsley> I'm seriously torn about the Nexus 6P.
[00:42:19] <Seoson> I don't even have a simlock or anything even though it's a carrier sponsored device.

[00:42:29] <Eclipse> that is not the case in america

[00:42:57] <Moonlightning> Seoson: I updated once, and lost everything on my device.
[00:43:01] <Kinsley> I know!
[00:43:04] <Eclipse> i got a Nexus 6 like 2 months before :|

[00:43:47] <Seoson> I like how my phones fetches the IRC buffer faster than my desktop -.-
[00:44:45] <Kinsley> And Marshmallow is making it harder for users to achieve and use root.
[00:45:17] <Moonlightning> Seoson: I just added escape() filters to everything
[00:45:38] <Seoson> I select my phone on the basis wherever or not it will likely be supported by CM
[00:45:51] <Kinsley> There should be a test, like a quiz when you get your phone and if you pass, you can root with no consequences in terms of warranty and service.
[00:46:00] <Dawn> lol
[00:46:31] <Moonlightning> Seoson: apparently I missed a spot
[00:46:46] <Seoson> I'm using CM since my first Android smartphone was no longer supported by it's manufactur

[01:21:22] <init3> So I hear a password manager is a more secure way to go over recycling passwords. Fairly obvious I guess. Do any of you have suggestions on how to best do this? I'm open to using a cloud based service or setting up something on my home server I can access but I don't want to be locked out of my accounts if I am away from home.  Suggestions?

[01:22:45] <Seoson> (automated) I recommend Owncloud for that since it supports versioning
[01:22:47] <wolfyshy> Kinsley: it's not that kind of fuse.
[01:23:04] <wolfyshy> looking in to it, it's just a qfuse, it's for internal (i.e. break the phone open) tampering
[01:23:20] <Moonlightning> I use `pass`
[01:23:45] <Moonlightning> on the rare occassions when I need to log into something non-personal away from home and I can't remember the password, I SSH over my VPN and fetch it

[03:07:55] <ButterBean> basicly what i did is i broke up a dedi into smaller servers
[03:08:10] <ButterBean> the radiodj and mysql is running on the same vm
[03:08:38] <ButterBean> what i am trying ot do is get another server up turn off mysql on the radiodj server and make it talk to the database server 
[03:08:56] <ButterBean> then i have a script that needs to talk to the server once it is up so i can have a music request system
[03:09:38] <Seoson> Make sure to allow the user to connect from 3rd party hosts and change mysqld to bind to an external interface
[03:09:47] <Seoson> Should work without any problem

[08:45:12] <Googie> Moonlightning: I actually took a look at Weechat issue #132 for you. It's a little harder than you might think to modify.
[08:45:49] <Moonlightning> Go figure.
[08:46:24] <Googie> The function to add a nick to the nicklist is a public API... and takes the prefix directly as a parameter.
[08:46:57] <Moonlightning> Mmmmm.
[08:47:01] <Googie> It takes a C String, not a char, but then +ov != +o
[08:47:48] <Googie> And it's the wrong part of the code to work on determining which prefix is most important.

[08:49:34] <Googie> Weechat's source isn't too bad if you want to take a look at it.
