[05:45:53] <init3> Sure
[05:45:55] * Gladiolus laffs
[05:46:05] <JustAberrant> HT mattered a lot more when scheduling sucked
[05:46:11] * Dusk runs an ethernet cable from her house to Gladiolus'
[05:46:12] <RazorSharpFang> MY server is ALSO a p4.
[05:46:12] <JustAberrant> imo
[05:46:16] <RazorSharpFang> So I can't judge.
[05:46:18] <init3> What's your downstream though?
[05:46:33] <Colgate> pssh, dns amplification or bust
[05:46:35] * Gladiolus goes o3o
[05:46:41] <Dusk> JustAberrant: it was way worse when scheduling sucked
[05:46:44] <init3> Yeah, could do that too
[05:46:56] <Dusk> HTT has become a lot better due to better scheduling in HTT aware OSes
[05:46:56] <JustAberrant> though yeah, I guess you're still scheduling :>
[05:47:05] <init3> Most DoS attacks aren't CPU bound anyhow. 
[05:47:20] * JustAberrant shouldn't be talking tech right now :>
[05:47:29] <Dusk> are you not in the right state of mind?
[05:47:31] <Dusk> :oo
[05:47:38] <RazorSharpFang> Would you expect all people who use Steam for gaming to have a mouse with a scroll wheel AND a middle-mouse button ?
[05:47:43] <JustAberrant> I'm in a vodka state of mind ;p
[05:47:49] <Dusk> lol
[05:47:56] <init3> RazorSharpFang: Probably
[05:48:04] <Colgate> init3: well, not that kind of DoS attack, some certainly are :P
[05:48:08] <HoneyDrops> Why assume a mouse?
[05:48:09] <init3> Yeah
[05:48:17] <Colgate> you could make expensive queries to a sql server
[05:48:21] <Dusk> RazorSharpFang: well trackpads have that functionality and a lot of mice have scroll wheels
[05:48:22] <RazorSharpFang> HoneyDrops: Because it would make a lot of sense in control.
[05:48:24] <Colgate> that would be cpu bound
[05:48:36] <RazorSharpFang> Dusk: But can they middle-click on demand?
[05:48:46] <Dusk> Trackpads? Or mice?
[05:48:47] <HoneyDrops> Touchpad, trackball, trackpoint?
[05:48:52] <Colgate> mine does if I hit both buttons at the same time on the touchpad
[05:48:53] <Dusk> because both of those can
[05:48:57] * Googie is reminded of Wordpress's "long password" DoS
[05:49:00] <RazorSharpFang> I don't know what those are, actually.
[05:49:02] <Colgate> it is really annoying to do though
[05:49:08] <Colgate> and I hate it
[05:49:15] <init3> I was thinking UDP flood because I have a big pipe and as Gladiolus has maple-net I'm hoping my upstream is faster. (even though I'm joking)
[05:49:17] <Googie> There was no limit on password length, so... multi megabyte passwords for hashing everywhere!
[05:49:33] <init3> I don't /think/ a raw UDP flood is CPU intense but I unno.
[05:49:35] <init3> Never done it. 
[05:49:50] <HoneyDrops> RazorSharpFang: touchpad is the think on a laptop that you touch and it moves the pointer, trackball is like a ball mouse flipped over (you rotate a ball to move), trackpoint = thinkpad's keyboard clit
[05:49:50] <Colgate> no
[05:50:23] <RazorSharpFang> HoneyDrops: Would they be able to scroll up/down and middle-click?
[05:51:07] <Dusk> the first one yes
[05:51:15] <Dusk> the second one kinda if it has a middle mouse button
[05:51:20] <Dusk> the third one I have no idea
[05:51:36] <Colgate> !calc (3/4)^5
[05:51:37] <Dusk> actually
[05:51:44] <Dusk> the thinkpad has a hardware mmb
[05:51:47] <Colgate> ~calc (3/4)^5
[05:51:50] <Dusk> for use with the nub
[05:51:51] <Colgate> meh
[05:51:55] <Dusk> so yea it would work
[05:51:58] <Dusk> RazorSharpFang: why are you asking?
[05:52:10] <RazorSharpFang> I was going to use that as default-controls for a game.
[05:52:18] <Dusk> oh
[05:52:19] <RazorSharpFang> It'd be silly if pplz didn't have a mouse with those features.
[05:52:33] <Dusk> Uh I'd recommend against that yea.
[05:52:35] <HoneyDrops> Trackpoint can scroll, generally hold by holding button2 down
[05:52:40] *** Quits: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: )
[05:52:58] <HoneyDrops> (or button3?  the middle one)
[05:53:01] <HoneyDrops> button3
[05:53:09] <HoneyDrops> scroll is button4/5
[05:53:12] <Dusk> As far as games go I'd suggest sticking to mouse1,2 and 3.
[05:53:17] <HoneyDrops> ^
[05:53:21] <RazorSharpFang> Like, it's a arena-shooter like. 
[05:53:24] <Dusk> scrolling could be a weapon wheel sure
[05:53:28] <Dusk> that's fairly common
[05:53:36] <Dusk> but I'd also fallback map it to the number buttons on the keyboard
[05:53:38] <RazorSharpFang> So, you aim with the mouse, and fire using M1 M2 M3
[05:53:41] <Dusk> as that's the common way to do it
[05:53:53] <init3> Googie: That's genius. 
[05:53:57] <Dusk> well Id' only rely on m1,2
[05:54:04] <Dusk> I wouldn't rely on people having an m3
[05:54:11] <init3> I'll bet I ran into that before too but didn't know the cause. 
[05:54:13] <RazorSharpFang> But there's 3 weapons.
[05:54:24] <HoneyDrops> qwe keys??
[05:54:38] <init3> Well, I mean other than it is a DDoS. 
[05:54:39] <RazorSharpFang> You're already using WASD-like for movement.
[05:55:09] <RazorSharpFang> And you use the mouse pointer to aim. What else could you press?
[05:55:25] <Dusk> Why not use a key like f or v for the 3rd weapon
[05:55:39] <Dusk> especially if they have a cooldown and are a grenade or aoe thing
[05:55:45] <Dusk> as that's a common keybind for those
[05:55:47] <RazorSharpFang> Eh, Ctrl Shift or Alt would be more realistic. 
[05:55:58] <RazorSharpFang> Or maybe 'E'
[05:56:01] <Dusk> sure
[05:56:10] <Dusk> grenades are often mapped to g
[05:56:30] <Dusk> also, I'm exhausted so I'm gonna duck out
[05:56:33] <Dusk> good luck
[05:56:46] <RazorSharpFang> Maybe I could have M1 as primary fire, and M2 as special fire.
[05:56:55] <RazorSharpFang> With scroll to change special weapon.
[06:01:13] <RazorSharpFang> Would being able to place infinite mines be a bad idea?

[06:02:48] <Dusk> Sakura: make sure the port is open

[06:28:56] <JustAberrant> mm
[06:29:06] <JustAberrant> a lot of consumer routers will isolate wifi devices
[06:29:15] <JustAberrant> i.e. won't let them connect to other machines within your LAN
[06:30:25] <Sakura> So in other words, Linksys doesn't allow their routers to be used for IRC servers?
[06:30:36] <RazorSharpFang> That's just the default configuration.
[06:30:52] <RazorSharpFang> You should be able to tell it to bridge the WLAN and LAN.
[06:30:59] <Googie> Not quite that. More like not allowing devices over Wifi to connect directly to devices on LAN for security reasons.
[06:31:08] <Sakura> Ah.
[06:31:29] <Sakura> So, how do I disable without compromising the security of my devices?
[06:32:10] <RazorSharpFang> For my router (Netgear DGND3700v2) there's an option labeled: "Enable Wireless Isolation" that I unticked.
[06:32:54] <JustAberrant> I imagine most consumer gear it's going to be an on or off prospect ;p
[06:33:30] <RazorSharpFang> Totally
[06:34:05] <Sakura> Weird because my laptop connects to my phone as I use it as wireless speakers.
[06:34:28] <JustAberrant> LAN to WLAN is probably fine
[06:34:33] <JustAberrant> WLAN to LAN might be blocked
[06:34:49] <JustAberrant> either way, it could be something else
[06:35:01] <JustAberrant> just saying this is a common reason why <can't do something from my phone on my lan>
[06:36:13] <RazorSharpFang> Me, I'd also check that your phone isn't trying to access it through the LTE or whatevs
[06:37:17] <Sakura> Well, my laptop & phone are connected to a WLAN sooo... I should check if it's blocked by LAN
[06:41:39] <Sakura> What do I need to do to check exactly?
[06:42:23] <JustAberrant> what RazorSharpFang said.. poke around your routers settings for something with some combination of wifi, lan, and isolation

[07:29:24] <Moonlightning> what language are you talking about?
[07:29:27] <RazorSharpFang> Colgate: My syntax was lax.
[07:29:46] <Moonlightning> â€¦oh, just in general.
[07:29:56] <Moonlightning> Yeah, it's usually unary prefix ~
[07:30:07] <Moonlightning> In Rust, it's the same as logical not, thoughâ€”unary prefix !
[07:30:20] <Moonlightning> unary prefix ~ meant something else, which has since been removed
[07:30:40] <RazorSharpFang> That means you have a dedicated boolean type?
[07:30:47] <Moonlightning> Uh.
[07:30:50] <Moonlightning> most languages do.
[07:30:53] <RazorSharpFang> C
[07:31:10] <RazorSharpFang> ints are the best booleans.

[07:34:01] <RazorSharpFang> Just making sure, I'm a bit tired.
[07:34:05] <Moonlightning> proper bit-vector types pack eight booleans into one byte.

[07:35:19] <RazorSharpFang> That's 8 bits per byte!! How revolutionary!

[07:35:56] <Moonlightning> That's 60%
[07:36:12] <Colgate> bitmasks whee
[07:36:24] <Moonlightning> Anyway, that's as opposed to a naive vector of booleans, which just allocates the minimum amount of space for each element, which ends up being one byte unless something beneath it does further space optimizations.
[07:36:38] <RazorSharpFang> naive? 
[07:39:12] * RazorSharpFang is making pizza....
[07:39:24] <Phase> fun fact: in c++ vector<bool> is a bitfield
[07:39:43] <Moonlightning> I thought so
[07:40:04] <Moonlightning> Some random person told me it wasn't, though; that that kind of specialization wasn't possible in C++
[07:40:30] <Moonlightning> Rust just has its own type.

[07:41:41] <Phase> point of specialization is you don't need specific interfaces for a particular type and it will "do the right thing"
[07:42:26] <Moonlightning> â€¦huh?
[07:43:11] <Phase> Moonlightning, ie: you use vector<bool> and it'll do the bit-per-entry optimization
[07:43:29] <Moonlightning> I think I used the wrong word
[07:43:38] <Phase> ?
[07:43:44] <Phase> specialization? or?
[07:44:04] <Moonlightning> by /specialization/ I meant that you could e.g. provide a general vector<> implementation, but override that for vector<bool> to provide a different one.
[07:44:19] <Moonlightning> You're saying that you can do something with bool so that that happens without having to write a specific vector<bool>?
[07:44:21] <Phase> yeah, that's specialization
[07:44:32] <Phase> no i mean vector<bool> is its own implementation
[07:44:36] <Moonlightning> Ahh.
[07:44:41] <Phase> but that a user of the vector interface need not know about it
[07:44:55] <Phase> it moves that sort of optimization to the type, away from users of it
[07:44:59] <Moonlightning> Well, yeah. Abstraction.
[07:45:04] <Moonlightning> Always nice.
[07:45:40] <Googie> There's an awful lot of people who don't really know what C++ can do. I'm at least partially in that group :V
[07:46:05] <Phase> a lot of c++ programmers are probably using it like its java
[07:46:20] <Phase> and they're likely not good at java
[07:48:02] <Moonlightning> Huh?
[07:50:50] <Googie> Moonlightning: C++ is a really misunderstood language.
[07:51:12] <Moonlightning> Phase: what did you mean by using it like Java?
[07:52:16] <Phase> Moonlightning, everything in a method, templates used as generics, namespacing everything, and just generally verbose code
[07:52:33] <Phase> if you're using static methods in c++, you're probably doing something wrong
[07:52:45] * Moonlightning frowns.
[07:52:50] <Moonlightning> I thought templates were basically for generics D:
[07:52:59] <Moonlightning> andâ€¦why /wouldn't/ you namespace everything? That's what they're /for/, right?
[07:53:21] <Phase> they can be used as generics but aren't the same thing
[07:54:07] <Moonlightning> â€¦so why mention it as if it's a bad thing?
[07:54:14] <Phase> the restriction of what types you can use as a template argument are, by my understading, 'that the type must be compatible with the template types usage'
[07:54:34] * Moonlightning thinks he's too tired for this.
[07:54:39] <Phase> Moonlightning, c++ doesn't type-erase, nor does it have a base object
[07:55:04] <Moonlightning> What's the result of lack of erasure?
[07:56:06] <Phase> you can use any method, not just that of some parent type
[07:57:31] <RazorSharpFang> I don't understand any of this.
[07:57:37] * Phase is currently trying to set a users password from powershell
[07:57:45] <Phase> local user, not AD user, the latter is apparently trivial
[07:58:25] <Moonlightning> Aha.
[07:58:40] <Moonlightning> So if `Foo bar = Bar(...)`
[07:58:48] <Moonlightning> You can use Bar methods, not just Foo methods
[07:59:12] <Phase> that is type erasing
[07:59:33] <Phase> class<T> some_class { some_method(T arg) { arg.any_method() } }
[07:59:42] <Phase> is not
[08:00:13] <Phase> there is infact no first-class way to ensure T is a subclass of any particular type
[08:00:31] <Moonlightning> What happens if the T doesn't have that method though?
[08:00:40] <Moonlightning> â€¦oh, is that just a client-side compile-time error?
[08:00:52] <AppleDash> no, Moonlightning, it's a server-side one
[08:01:47] <RazorSharpFang> wat
[08:02:45] <Phase> Moonlightning, if T doesn't have that method it's a compile-time error, i *Think*, it might only error if some_method is called
[08:02:51] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not getting any of this.
[08:03:23] <Googie> In C++ it would be a compile time error.
[08:03:24] <Moonlightning> Phase: but you can compile your example. The error happens when -client- downstream code tries to pass in a T that doesn't have an any_method(), right?
[08:03:41] <Phase> when they instance the template yeah
[08:03:48] <Googie> The way that templates work, you can't just "compile" them.
[08:03:58] <Phase> Googie, so all usage within a template is type checked?
[08:04:00] <Googie> At least ahead of time.
[08:04:04] <Phase> at instancing time
[08:04:19] <Googie> It's checked when the downstream user compiles the template.
[08:04:36] <Googie> Which is actually one of C++'s big issues. You recompile templates a lot :V
[08:05:10] <Googie> Huge portions of the boost libraries for example are just plain header files with templates.
[08:05:39] <Phase> Moonlightning, templates can be considered a compile-time program, some_class<some_other_class> generates a new some_class for that particular set of arguments
[08:10:53] <Googie> If arg.any_method() doesn't exist, the compiler will error the first time you try to use that template with a T that doesn't have any_method()
[08:11:44] <Googie> Templates are a really interesting subject in C++. They were originally basically just for generics, but they became a lot more than that.
[08:14:24] <JustAberrant> templates make simple things good and complicated :)

[16:24:16] <Googie> Wait, seriously.
[16:25:29] <Googie> Apparently Patreon got "hacked" because they had a public instance of a web debugger thing that includes the ability to inject code from the web interface by design.
[16:25:56] <Googie> Apparently this debugger had been indexed on shodan for almost a month.
[16:28:47] <Googie> Even better. Apparently they were notified about it on the 21th and that they were working to /mitigate/ it. (The breach was on the 28th apparently)

[23:43:28] <mniip> Colgate, recovering an irc client's IP address from behind a virtual host
[23:44:42] <Colgate> sure, works on pretty much every irc server
[23:44:51] <Colgate> if you want to actually hide your IP here, use tor
[23:45:14] <mniip> it primarily depends on services' protocol module
[23:45:19] <Colgate> although, I don't think you can do it with just sinpircd
[23:45:25] <Colgate> I think you have to have services
[23:45:36] <mniip> there's a way to do it without services, but
[23:45:40] <mniip> it's much much more invasive

[23:48:20] <mniip> also, is there some dynamic parameter determining a channel's banlist size?
[23:48:33] <mniip> I've just created a channel and the banlist size of 69 is puzzling me
[23:50:34] <Colgate> it is in the config
[23:50:46] <mniip> so it's a constant value of 69
[23:50:51] <Colgate> yes
[23:50:52] <mniip> any particular reason?
