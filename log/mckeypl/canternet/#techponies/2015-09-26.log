[08:06:12] <tiwake> when I was there at the newyears, we stayed in a hotel really close to a fancy restaurant... they served really well made drinks.. lol
[08:06:18] <tiwake> kinda expensive
[08:06:22] <Colgate> lol
[08:06:33] <tiwake> but that was so good
[08:09:57] <tiwake> should I reserve a hotel room?
[08:10:15] <tiwake> at the same place
[08:10:21] <Colgate> if you want, I'd cover half
[08:11:28] <tiwake> maybe I'll call it in, so I can get a room where we wont bother anyone by being a bit noisy
[08:11:54] <tiwake> or are rooms typically determined at checkin?
[08:13:44] <Colgate> might be able to specially request
[08:14:19] <tiwake> I think I'll just reserve a hotel room, and ask it be in the corner at checkin

[11:48:12] <Googie> QoS is an odd beast.
[11:48:59] <Moonlightning> I don't know anything about it.
[11:49:43] <Moonlightning> But I would think I would be able to throttle connections if they go through my netbox.
[11:51:24] <ShivalWolf> its great for limiting housemates bandwith

[19:46:08] <Moonlightning> Isn't changing keys regularly kind of a thing?

[19:47:04] <Colgate> changing certs is annoying though
[19:47:14] <Colgate> and changing certs too fast makes cert pinning less useful
[19:47:46] <Googie> That's why they're building an automated system for it. Cert pinning is definitely a downside though
[19:47:56] <Colgate> and the "more secure" thing is trivial at best
[19:48:08] <Colgate> 4k bit RSA key isn't going to be cracked anytime soon
[19:48:16] <Colgate> certainly not within a typical 3 year length cert
[19:48:40] <Googie> It's not that, it's more if the certificate is leaked by accident or whatever. Or the domain changes owners.
[19:48:51] <Colgate> I could potentially see something with if the cert revocation system is offline
[19:49:12] <Colgate> you mean if the private key is leaked?
[19:49:15] <Colgate> then you revoke the cert
[19:49:19] <Colgate> done
[19:49:46] <Colgate> if something trusts the cert when it can't contact the revocation server, that's on the client
[19:50:41] <Googie> If you don't know it's leaked, or the domain changes hands. Also OCSP lists are apparently quite large
[19:51:06] <Colgate> if you don't know it is leaked, a short cert expiration time isn't going to help you there either
[19:51:10] <Googie> /CRLs
[19:51:33] <Colgate> they will just grab your new cert and use that one
[19:51:51] <Colgate> since they still have your private key, unless you regenerate your private key with every new cert(who does this???)
[19:52:45] <Colgate> also, now that I think about it, you need to make a new csr with each signing request, otherwise you use the same public key in the cert anyways
[19:53:21] <Moonlightning> > unless you regenerate your private key with every new cert(who does this???)
[19:53:23] <Moonlightning> who /doesn't?/
[19:53:32] <Moonlightning> I mean, what's the point of changing the certificate? Just get one for a longer priod!
[19:53:38] <Moonlightning> It's probably cheaper that way, anyway. :p
[19:54:59] <Colgate> Moonlightning: most CAs have a "renew" button that you jsut click, pay your 100$ or whatever, and get another signed cert with a different date from the same csr they have on file
[19:55:06] <Colgate> I'm quite positive that most people just do that
[19:56:21] <Colgate> and while changing the private key is the more secure thing to do, a 4k RSA key isn't likely to be cracked anytime soon
[19:58:03] <Colgate> it protects against you unknowingly being MitMed by a compromise, yes, that's the benefit
[19:59:13] * johnsey installs a cronjob that renews all of Moonlightning's private keys every 24h
[19:59:15] <Colgate> actively MitMed, as a passive would still be impossible
[19:59:22] <Googie> And that's why it's being automated. Short expiry times make CRLs easier to maintain, and the system will probably regen keys automatically (I haven't looked into it entirely)
[20:00:43] <johnsey> though it has to be said that most services use the plaintext private key because otherwise you'd have to enter your passphrase every time the service is restarted
[20:01:04] <Colgate> that's fine and dandy for those services, but what about services that's letsencrypt can't do that stuff automatically on?
[20:01:35] <Googie> That's definitely one of the major downsides
[20:01:56] <Googie> There's been some discussions about that that haven't really been resolved properly :.
[20:02:00] <Googie> :/
[20:03:06] <Colgate> there's quite a few things that require being restarting to change certs/keys, you could argue that is bad program design, but that's a different argument XD
[20:04:39] <Googie> Yeah. That's really the biggest downside of Let's Encrypt's model. At least to begin with it's fairly heavily oriented towards web servers
[20:05:17] <Googie> Not too hard to hook up other well designed stuff though I think
[20:05:19] <Moonlightning> Colgate: well, it does autoconfig for your webserver
[20:05:29] <Moonlightning> Presumably they'd sort something out for the people who want to do that
[20:05:44] * Moonlightning likes maintaining the stuff themself, though. None of this newfangled autoconfig weirdness. :p
[20:06:04] <Moonlightning> Just drop the cert in a directory
[20:06:07] <Hadjii> "you darn kids and your fancy newfangled autoconfig witchery"
[20:06:12] <Moonlightning> Maybe rotate them for me, if you like. I wouldn't mind that.
[20:06:22] <Colgate> they mean well and all that, but the more I hear about letsencrypt, the less I'm liking it :V
[20:06:43] <Moonlightning> ‚Ä¶actually, since services just use whatever's in /etc/letsencrypt/live, I'd just need to relost|restart
[20:06:46] <Moonlightning> reload *
[20:07:40] <Moonlightning> ‚Ä¶Insp supports changing keypairs without restarting anything, right? >.>
[20:08:53] <Googie> I kinda... a lot of it is a necessary evil. People need to start deploying SSL /everywhere/, by default
[20:09:09] <tiwake> I have a feeling https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/them-s-fightin-herds/x/9222319#/story wont make it to funding level
[20:09:12] <PinkiePieBot> [ Thems Fightin Herds | Indiegogo ]
[20:10:22] <Colgate> Moonlightning: yes, but the command has to be run from an oper connected to the ircd
[20:10:31] <Googie> Auto config and the automated update stuff is a huge part of that. The 90 day limits is interesting because that /should/ be the standard time period (potentially less), but in practice changing certs is too annoying for people to want to have an expiry limit that short
[20:10:32] <Colgate> you can't send it a signal from the cli or anything
[20:10:58] <Moonlightning> Colgate: maybe that should be changed‚Ä¶?
[20:11:08] <Moonlightning> Send like a SIGUSR1 or something
[20:11:13] <Moonlightning> Or just roll it into the HUP handler
[20:11:26] <Colgate> sighup is a rehash
[20:11:37] <Colgate> without rehashing tls
[20:11:52] <Googie> When Let's Encrypt takes off, I imagine I'll probably get integrated into Insp by default (not core, but in the supporting scripts)
[20:12:07] <Colgate> not sure if it is possible for modules to hook onto handling signals heh
[20:12:14] <Moonlightning> probably not x.x
[20:12:24] <Colgate> probably not, the event would have to be raised by insp's event handler
[20:16:05] <Googie> Not hard to accommodate by patching the core though. Might end up waiting for 2.2 though
[20:16:21] <Moonlightning> 2.2?
[20:16:36] <Moonlightning> You mean the one that's going to be in development until this time next year, at which point it'll be abandoned in favor of 2.3?
[20:17:45] <Googie> 2.2 is in fine condition, its just slow to actually decide that it's finished :V
[20:19:21] <Moonlightning> Really? Because there STILL isn't a 2.2 branch
[20:19:37] <Googie> master
[20:20:19] <Moonlightning> we /are/ still getting m_account_*, right?
[20:21:24] <Googie> Not in 2.2

[20:23:15] <Moonlightning> How's it going over there?
[20:23:46] <johnsey> I guess you could just attach to the running server process and invoke ModuleSSLGnuTLS's OnModuleRehash manually
[20:24:00] <Moonlightning> That sounds hacky, johnsey
[20:24:06] <johnsey> does it? hm
[20:24:12] <Moonlightning> ‚Ä¶yeah?
[20:24:20] <Moonlightning> Attach, like with a debugger? :P

[21:22:17] <Moonlightning> Can I raise the size of the entropy pool or something
[21:22:30] <Moonlightning> Make it like 64 MiB
[21:25:52] <HoneyDrops> You need to provide it "random" input to generate entropy.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)

[21:29:12] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[21:30:59] <Shutter> Moonlightning: Can't really blame atilla for taking time, considering he and SaberUK are like the only ones working on it. As for integrated services, that was never hard-slated for 2.2. I know some work has been done on it and there is interest in getting it later, but 2.2 is doing a lot of internal replumbing and the focus is there.
[21:31:45] <Moonlightning> Shutter: but it's been like three years now :C
[21:31:49] <Shutter> After 2.2 is done it will be easier to move down a release often path, as most the heavy lifting Atilla wants done will be done by then. If he so wishes to go down that path.
[21:32:05] <Moonlightning> Can't really blame me for being tired of waiting, can you? >.>
[21:33:30] <Shutter> If you are tired of waiting you should submit patches. Seriosuly, can't blame Atilla for not being done when he's doing almost all the lifting himself, on a hobby project.
[21:34:26] <Shutter> Besides, I don't think it's a crisis. 2.0 works pretty well.
