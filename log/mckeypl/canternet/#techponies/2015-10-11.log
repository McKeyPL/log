[01:36:53] <Moonlightning> I just had an idea :o
[01:37:02] * Hadjii sits and waits for this idea
[01:37:18] <Moonlightning> what if there was a syscall to atomically rewrite a file from a buffer
[01:37:37] <Moonlightning> This would be awesome for things like `weechat`s /save
[01:38:13] <Moonlightning> Just abstract the whole create-write-write-write-rename thing into the filesystem driver
[01:38:24] <Moonlightning> traditional filesystems can do that; CoW filesystems can do CoW magic

[01:56:54] <Phase> Moonlightning, what would a CoW filesystem do differently?
[01:57:23] <Moonlightning> Phase: …uhhhh…
[01:57:48] <Moonlightning> I dunno, but it'd be easier?
[01:58:12] <Moonlightning> atomically rewriting a file is easier on a CoW filesystem
[01:58:14] <Phase> XD
[01:58:21] <Moonlightning> I mean, from the filesystem's point of view
[01:58:42] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Pony-osmcfg.co.comcast.net)
[01:58:59] <Phase> the think you might do differently is refcopy the original, edit, then move it back, but that's a different operation
[02:00:07] <JustAberrant> :)
[02:02:20] <Moonlightning> Phase: It's easier 'cos file writes are already kind of atomic.
[02:02:30] <Moonlightning> Because CoW.
[02:02:46] <Moonlightning> You just need to bundle as many writes as it takes into one atomic operation.
[02:03:03] <Phase> data journaling should give you the same guarantees
[02:03:50] <Moonlightning> Doesn't journaling only cover individual write()s though?
[02:04:03] <Moonlightning> Don't both journaling /and/ CoW writing work that way?
[02:04:34] <Phase> i don't think there's any garuentee that multiple write()s happen in order
[02:04:59] <Moonlightning> by the same process? O.o
[02:05:07] <Phase> yeah
[02:05:21] <Moonlightning> But then bits of the file could get reordered O.o
[02:06:07] <Phase> i mean the order they're written to disk
[02:06:14] <Moonlightning> Oh.
[02:06:19] <Moonlightning> That's fine.
[02:06:33] <Moonlightning> They just either all need to happen (including the truncate, if applicable), or none of them.
