[03:26:37] <Moonlightning> that raises more questions than it answers
[03:27:08] <AppleDash> Oh?
[03:27:10] <Moonlightning> Clearly it's not different every time‚Ä¶is it static? Wouldn't that make it a password equivalent and kinda defeat the purpose? How often does it change?
[03:27:29] <Moonlightning> Why does it exit with a status of 1? XP

[03:28:27] <Moonlightning> and how'd you find out?
[03:30:29] <AppleDash> It got compromised because it's a secondary account I don't really care about so the password is reused, whoever did it got the password from a database dump of another site
[03:30:42] <AppleDash> I found out because I got a password and email change email in quick succession

[03:34:58] <AppleDash> but I've had this account for like 4 years and I use it like once per year
[03:34:59] <Seoson> I'm very happy with KeePass 2. I still haven't changed the majority of passwords however
[03:35:49] <Moonlightning> I'm in a weird place.
[03:36:58] <Moonlightning> My passwords used to be terrible, but at this point they're nearly all a combination of six common words, and two related to the specific service
[03:37:20] <Moonlightning> common as in shared, not as in used frequently in English

[15:06:33] <DataByte> my manual won't allow cranking unless the clutch is in, even if it's in neutral
[15:07:20] <DataByte> not sure why you'd want the brake pedal depressed, but not always a bad thing
[15:11:01] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> 1) its an automatic, and 2) i'm bypassing the neutral start safety and putting it on a latched relay
[15:11:28] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i'd prefer if anyone else were to start the rig to move it, they not accidently start it in gear and run someone else over. or run through a wall
[15:12:23] <Stik> yeah mine too DataByte 
[15:12:30] <bronygeek> I think pretty much any car, auto or manual, won't start unless it's in neutral, park in the case of automatic, or clutch down in the case of manual
[15:12:41] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i had an '84 i built the same way this one is coming along, but i had a 4.3L Chevrolet V6 with a set of 229 (3.8L) heads, 4bbl carb, dual plane intak manifold, big cam, and no neutral switch
[15:12:48] <Stik> my older cars don't care
[15:12:58] <Stik> think it's a modern thing to assume people are stupid :)
[15:13:06] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> ^
[15:13:33] <bronygeek> ehh, that's true
[15:13:36] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i've workedo n toyotas with a button on the dash to override the neutral/clutch safety switch so you could start it in gear (4wd models are the only ones i've seen this option in)
[15:13:46] <DataByte> i'm not sure you /can/ start an engine in gear.. unless it's a really low gear that the starter can move the vehicle with
[15:13:56] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> <.<
[15:13:57] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> >.>
[15:14:01] <Stik> you can lump them forwards on the starter
[15:14:06] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> I could start that 4.3 in gear, and it would drive away
[15:14:12] <DataByte> cool xD
[15:14:22] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> though i had a 3500rpm stall speed torque converter <.<
[15:14:23] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> >.>
[15:14:31] <bronygeek> used to do that with tractors all the time when I was younger DataByte, after about two years I had to replace the starter. ;)
[15:14:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> and 4.10 gears
[15:14:35] <DataByte> then again, i have a low-hp economy car.. 
[15:15:43] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i need to figure out how to get an additional 60ish horses out of my old 4.0 >.<
[15:15:56] <DataByte> question, though... why would you /want/ to start a vehicle while it's in gear?
[15:16:05] <Stik> i guess you woulnd't really
[15:16:08] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> stall in traffic, or off road
[15:16:16] <Stik> but older cars just didn't bother with the complexity of trying to stop you
[15:16:38] <Stik> or you don't have a clutch i guess
[15:16:50] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i had a problem where a woman cut out infront of me, texting, not paying a bit of attention, stopped in my lane, i hit the brakes hard enough to trigger the ECU to go into emergency mode and kill the fuel pump to prevent a fire in the event of a collision
[15:16:52] <Stik> my friend tells me his dad drove a car for weeks without a working clutch
[15:17:07] <DataByte> i'd just rather be in control of the forward motion of the vehicle, even if it does take the extra few seconds to get rolling
[15:17:09] <Stik> dunno how much truth is in that tho :P
[15:17:24] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i was unable to restart the engine untill i got the vehicle into a parking lot, put it into park, turned the key off and back on twice, then to neutral
[15:17:29] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> >.< i seriously hate EFI at times
[15:17:52] <Stik> that does sound like a nuisance
[15:18:17] <DataByte> bigger nuisance: the person you nearly killed
[15:18:18] <Stik> i think it might dislike my "spirited" nature :D
[15:18:37] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> true DataByte
[15:19:18] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> if i had been on a call with someone (i use the aux port on my phone so i can use my sterio as a speaker phone) all they would have heard would have been a very LOUD string of profanity the entire time i was trying to come to a stop without brakes after the engine died
[15:19:26] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> (lost vacuum, power steering and hydroboost)
[15:19:37] <DataByte> ugh
[15:20:17] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> yeah, and the local govt decided that "drivers education is a luxury, not necessary for the safe operation of a motor vehicle"
[15:21:10] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> o_o...... the only thing they did CORRECTLY lately, they made it a class A misdemenor to be texting while driving in this state, a primary offence, if you are cought texting while driving, or are involved in an accident where texting is suspect, you are required to pay a 650dollar fine, AND show up for court
[15:21:59] *** Quits: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-vg6lgl.bigpond.net.au) (Connection closed)
[15:22:22] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> if you are pulled over for another issue and are cought texting while driving, the officer then can charge a fine in excess of 650 dollars (maximum seatbelt fine in this state currently) and require drivers education
[15:22:33] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> basicly the same thing for a DUI
[15:23:26] <DataByte> here, they're working on including marijuana useage into the DUI definition, and setting the threshold pretty high
[15:23:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i just wish there were a law against stupidity tbh
[15:23:40] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> that sounds like a good idea DataByte
[15:23:43] <DataByte> even though recreational use of the drug is still illegal
[15:24:35] <Lapsus> Over here it's $1000 and 3 demerit points on your licence for using a cellphone when driving, lol
[15:25:03] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> nice
[15:25:13] <Lapsus> it still doesn't stop anyone
[15:25:25] <Lapsus> but it's nice to see people get hit with that now and then
[15:25:35] * DJ-C0L7[CSS] nods
[15:25:44] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> and people wonder why i have a dashcam in my 4x4
[15:25:59] <Lapsus> I want to get one for sure, I've had enough goddamn close calls
[15:26:05] * DJ-C0L7[CSS] nods
[15:26:22] <Lapsus> ideally one forwards and one backwards but I'm broke as hell, so whatever
[15:26:30] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> thats the biggest reason i used my cell phone as a camera for the last few months, i'm working on a centeral DVR setup that uses CCD cameras and i'm thinking of using my ras-pi

[18:27:41] <Googie> ARIN just announced that they now have more requests for IPv4 address space than they are able to fill.
[18:28:18] <bronygeek> We knew it was coming...
[18:28:48] <bronygeek> supposedly Comcast is now giving clients public IPv6 addresses.
[18:31:09] <Googie> http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/plotend.png
[18:31:26] <Colgate> bronygeek: they do, however, they are giving me a /64
[18:31:36] <Colgate> which is... inconvenient for actual use
[18:31:40] <Googie> America does have one of the largest IPv6 deployments.
[18:32:59] <Googie> According to Google. The largest
[18:33:13] <bronygeek> Colgate: People are gonna start using Dynamic DNS like crazy.
[18:33:14] <Googie> Still virtually no ISPs offering IPv6 here in Aus.

[18:33:41] <Colgate> bronygeek: I don't see why that would change any
[18:34:55] <bronygeek> sorry, misread it. I don't know a ton about networking, how is getting /64 inconvenient?
[18:36:15] <Googie> IPv6 has a bunch of stuff which defines /64 as the smallest subnet size. It's not technically required, but if you only have a /64, it makes it more annoying to have a complex, publicly routable network.
[18:36:48] <Colgate> most importantly, it makes running ipv6's stateless autoconfig a pain
[18:37:10] <Colgate> since that assumes each computer has a /64 to work with, which is not the case
[18:37:20] <bronygeek> aaaahhh, I get it.
[18:37:42] <Colgate> I can work around it, but I don't really feel like doing so
[18:40:14] <bronygeek> Forgive me if I'm stuck in ip4v thinking, but couldn't the modem/router assign each device an address within that subnet?
[18:41:01] <Colgate> yes, but then you're running dhcpv6, which stateless autoconfig was designed to get rid of in this scenario
[18:41:19] <Colgate> this is about progression >.>
[18:41:21] <bronygeek> ah, ok.
[18:41:47] <bronygeek> I see the appeal in an ad-hoc configuration, but it does complicate some things.
[18:44:26] <Shutter> Colgate: Weird. My ISP gives me a /48
[18:44:33] <Shutter> No (good) reasons for them not to.
[18:45:01] <Colgate> eh, I can see a good reason for not giving a /48, but not a /56
[18:45:12] <Colgate> /48 is a ton of addresses for a home user
[18:45:57] <Colgate> kind of wasteful really
[18:46:14] <bronygeek> cause /64 is totally not enough
[18:46:15] <Colgate> that's why whatever RFC that was that said to do /48s to endpoint networks was changed to be /56
[18:46:30] *** Quits: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21) (Quit: quit)
[18:46:45] <Colgate> bronygeek: if you want all the features of ipv6, it really isn't

[18:47:29] *** Unixkitty is now known as Awaykitty
[18:48:46] <bronygeek> How so Colgate? because of the autoconfig?
[18:48:47] <Googie> There's a lot more to IPv6 than just adding a bunch more bits to the address size.
