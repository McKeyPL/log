[03:02:30] <Moonlightning> Daaaaamn
[03:02:31] <Moonlightning> the news today
[03:03:40] <Moonlightning> Russian military vehicles hovering near undersea network cables; bacon et al's new classification as maybe|possibly|probably carcinogenic; California's high-speed rail project from SF to LA going overdeadline and overbudget; San Francisco's battles with the contractor doing work on water mains and gas pipes; Los Angeles and its way of dealing with the homeless
[03:04:43] <wolfyshy> the beeb reported that the US media complex is going way overboard with that carcinogenic meat thing
[03:04:53] <Moonlightning> In order: What the actual fuck can you not just /stop/ you fucking shitheads | Nnnoooooooooooooooooo—wait what? | I /told you./ I told you! It's not happening until 2080 or something. :V | Groaaaaaaaan. Seriously? | Uh…yay, I guess?
[03:05:07] <wolfyshy> they showed that in the UK you have a 6% chance of developing bowel cancer if you never eat red / processed meat, and 7% chance if you eat it daily.
[03:05:20] <Moonlightning> YAY~
[03:05:22] <wolfyshy> yes it is a 1% chance increase
[03:05:25] <wolfyshy> it is NOTHING like smoking
[03:05:27] <Moonlightning> So we're good on that front :D
[03:05:32] <Moonlightning> woot woot woot woot
[03:05:32] <wolfyshy> http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34615621

[03:07:49] <Moonlightning> Russia hangin' round dose cables doe :|
[03:08:04] <Moonlightning> they be like…“let's fucking netsplit the Internet!”
[03:08:35] <Moonlightning> I mean, I don't care about them tapping or messing with the streams; the Internet should be untrusted /anyway/
[03:08:45] <Moonlightning> but if they fucking damage those cables :/
[03:08:54] <Moonlightning> IF THEY FUCKING DO IT
[03:09:08] <Moonlightning> EVERYBODY should start condemning them
[03:09:10] <Moonlightning> No. Just /no./
[03:09:22] <Moonlightning> Ya don't DO THAT SHIT?
[03:25:14] <One-Trick> i hate being stuck using sharepoint
[03:31:20] <Moonlightning> x.x ?
[03:39:20] <Moonlightning> …can I call informal fallacies (as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies#Informal_fallacies ) /rhetorical fallacies/? After some examination, I don't think they count as /logical/ fallacies (those would be just the formal ones), but /informal fallacy/ doesn't seem quite as intuitive.
[03:39:21] <PinkiePieBot> [ List of fallacies - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[03:41:19] <One-Trick> Mm. misleading vividness. get this one a lot.
[03:44:34] <Moonlightning> We went into a TAILSPIN and crashed into a HILLSIDE and the plane /EXPLODED/ in a giant /FIREBALL/, and /EVERYBODY DIED!/
[03:44:40] <Moonlightning> …except for me! You know why?!
[03:46:00] <Kinsley> Because it didn't actually happen?
[03:48:05] <Moonlightning> 'cause I had my tray table up!

[03:48:51] * Kinsley hits Moonlightning
[03:49:16] * Moonlightning lets out a loud moan. “Harder~!”

[03:51:57] <Moonlightning> D:<
[03:51:57] <PinkiePieBot> Cheer up, Moonlightning, all of your friends are here!
[03:52:09] <Moonlightning> I won't cheer up! Your maintainer just… ;-;
[03:57:06] <Kinsley> >implying I've done any maintenance for Pinkie at all in the last few months.
[04:03:42] <Moonlightning> …owner? author? My point stands :<
[04:12:49] <Kinsley> Well, me punching you in the dick doesn't negate Pinkie's point.
[04:13:06] <Kinsley> Perhaps I'm just a shitty friend?
[04:16:55] <Moonlightning> :(
[04:17:18] * Kinsley hugs Moonlighting and massages his poor, bruised... ego.
[04:17:52] * Moonlightning leans into Kinsley, sniffling.
[04:18:42] <wolfyshy> well you /did/ ask Kinslet to hit you harder.
[04:18:48] <wolfyshy> Kinsey
[04:18:52] <wolfyshy> guh
[04:22:03] <Kinsley> Try again?
[04:22:32] * Kinsley nuzzles Moonlightning and pets, whispering and cooing soft reassurances
[04:23:03] <wolfyshy> Kinsley
[04:23:04] <wolfyshy> \o/
[04:23:08] <Moonlightning> Yeah, but /harder/ doesn't mean /in a different place/…
[04:23:16] * Kinsley golfclaps
[04:23:26] <Kinsley> It doesn't not, either. :P
[04:23:40] * Moonlightning closes his eyes and huddles up against Kinsley.
[04:23:52] <Moonlightning> it /usually/ means in the same place, or at least a similar one
[04:24:19] <Kinsley> Also, who's to say that I wasn't aiming for your junk in the first place, hmm?
[04:26:00] <Moonlightning> :(
[04:26:36] * Kinsley hugs Moonlightning again
[04:27:13] * Kinsley isn't that mean, she just wanted to make a point.
[04:28:39] * Moonlightning whimpers.

[05:45:08] <One-Trick> only issues i remember was it failing to mount while using systemd, because lvm hadnt started yet. havent had this issue, so far, with openrc

[11:12:02] *** Quits: Datalink_ (Datalink@Datalink) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[11:16:35] <Stik> probably depends on the heater
[11:17:26] <Stik> my boiler senses water flow, so it's the pump that needs controlling, and that's just a simple 240v mains 
[11:19:00] <Stik> a cleverer system would involve solenoids on each of the radiators, and some awareness of which rooms you spend your time in at different times of the day
[11:19:24] <Stik> so it'd make sure the bathroom was warm when you were going to get up in the morning for work, and the kitchen was warm around dinnertime, etc
[11:19:28] <Stik> that'd be awesome
[11:19:49] <Stik> would take it a while to learn your routines i suppose
[11:20:00] <Moonlightning> That requires some form of AI, though.
[11:20:10] <Stik> heh AI makes it sound sinister
[11:20:19] <Moonlightning> Not to me?
[11:20:31] <Moonlightning> Anyway, if you have a routine you follow most of the time, you can probably describe it with relatively simple rules.
[11:20:35] <Stik> it would just require some pretty simple data analysis, rather than an ai ;)
[11:20:44] <Moonlightning> > data analysis
[11:20:52] <Stik> yeah but i'd want it to learn those instead of me telling it
[11:20:53] <Moonlightning> As opposed to you writing a file with a few simple rules.
[11:21:11] <Moonlightning> If you don't wanna write the rules, good luck getting the tools to have it do analysis. :p
[11:21:24] <Stik> it'd be quite easy
[11:21:43] <Stik> or maybe i only say that because my job is data analysis tools
[11:22:42] <Stik> but anyhow, do it by week day and hour, by room, then accumulate how much time spent in each

[11:24:45] <Stik> hehe
[11:25:10] <Compu> anyways, if it depends on which system then how can u use one thermostat for nearly any heater?
[11:25:58] <Stik> if it's only got two wires then they kind of have to be the power supply don't they
[11:26:08] <Stik> so it'll just be whatever your mains voltage is
[11:26:16] <Compu> no, the thermostat i have is battery powered
[11:26:26] <Compu> 2 AAs
[11:26:47] <Stik> what, and the heater is powered off that?
[11:26:53] <Compu> no
[11:27:15] <Compu> 2 wires im talking about the wires going from the heater to the thermostat
[11:27:20] <Stik> oh right
[11:27:21] <Compu> not the power to the heater
[11:27:35] <Stik> probably just shorts them out to turn it on
[11:27:46] <Stik> might even be the mains supply too
[11:27:51] <Compu> my mains voltage is 120v
[11:28:08] <Stik> stick a multimeter on it when it's running i guess, and see what happens
[11:28:19] <Compu> would if i owned a multimeter

[11:30:21] <Compu> Stik: and no it cant be a direct power switch cuz the heater takes a few minutes to turn off after the thermostat tells it to shut off
[11:30:45] <Stik> hmm dunno then
[11:30:48] <Compu> even if i completely remove the thermostat the heater still takes a few minutes to shut off
[11:30:54] <Stik> all you can do is investigate
[11:30:59] <Stik> does the thermostat have a model number?

[23:51:15] <Seoson> Parking domains should be illegal
[23:51:19] <Seoson> -.-
