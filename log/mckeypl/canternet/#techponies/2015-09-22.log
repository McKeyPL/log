[02:47:48] <Gigabit> is there anyway to repair/replace headphone connectors? Well I know there is but.. is it worth it?
[02:49:23] <JustAberrant> sure
[02:49:47] <Gigabit> My logitech g230 headphones, the ends are both bent and theya re not making good contact in the ports
[02:49:50] <JustAberrant> you can buy the connectors on sites like mouser and digikey for at most a few bucks
[02:50:13] <JustAberrant> little soldering, little heatshrink, should be good as new
[02:50:27] <Gigabit> So its not to bad of a fix then?
[02:50:39] <JustAberrant> baring anything crazy, shouldn't be
[02:50:56] <JustAberrant> assuming you can solder
[02:51:58] <Gigabit> barely
[02:52:04] <JustAberrant> far as I can tell from photos, the jacks look pretty standard
[02:54:30] <JustAberrant> those jacks range anywhere from like $3 to like $50 .. depending on how high quality you want ;p
[02:54:42] <JustAberrant> given that those headphones are like $50 or so.. I'd probably go lower range ;p
[02:56:06] <JustAberrant> http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/SP-3501/CP-3502-ND/96987
[02:56:07] <PinkiePieBot> [ SP-3501 CUI Inc. | CP-3502-ND | DigiKey ]
[02:58:11] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> are the headphones damaged, or is the jack on the comp busted?
[02:58:41] <Gigabit> Its the connectors themselves, they are bent pretty good from dogs and me..
[02:59:04] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you can clip the connectors off and attach new connectors, but it'll take a little soldering
[03:01:05] <Gigabit> I always forget to check connections first, then software -.- and in this case I am positive it is hardware related
[03:02:57] <JustAberrant> it's not exactly a tricky soldering job, but the wires in headphone cables tend to be thin, and you can easily melt the connector or the wire if you get the temp/timing wrong
[03:03:03] <JustAberrant> so best to buy a few extra connectors
[03:04:00] <JustAberrant> also you pretty much need either a "third hand" dealie or another person to hold the wires in place while you solder
[03:05:03] <Gigabit> Wonder if I can find them on amazon, the ones I did find were rated horribly
[03:06:16] <Gigabit> wait I did find them
[03:06:24] <Gigabit> http://www.amazon.com/Black-Plastic-Housing-Headphone-Connector/dp/B00MFRZ2SG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1442883929&sr=8-2&keywords=3.5mm+replacement+jack

[03:06:39] <Gigabit> and I can get those with helpinghands for 9 bucks
[03:06:41] <JustAberrant> hehe, there you go
[03:07:33] <JustAberrant> although those are shitty helping hands.. you'll want to cover the teeth on those aligator clips with electrical tape or something
[03:07:50] <JustAberrant> otherwise it'll bite into the insulation
[03:09:25] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i've used pieces of vinyl tube before over the jaws to keep from damaging the insulation on wire on those cheaper helping hands rigs

[03:10:52] <JustAberrant> hehe, well you're getting like 10 connectors for the price of 1.. what did you expect ;p
[03:13:12] <Gigabit> I like this one I found, lot better reviews but 6.99 ea
[03:14:02] <JustAberrant> if you don't care what it looks like, you can buy a cheap male to male cable (usually sold as "aux" cables for connecting an mp3 player to a car), cut it in half, and splice it ;p
[03:14:40] <JustAberrant> probably easier, but will look like absolute shit

[03:20:17] <Moonlightning> I've probably asked this before, butâ€¦how do you pronounce /etc?

[03:22:23] <Gigabit> I wonder if logitech will warranty it?
[03:22:40] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i would think so if they are under warranty
[03:23:46] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: I spell it out, but I tend to do that with most acronyms
[03:24:32] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: if it's damaged from use, I doubt it

[07:48:48] <Starthunder> I tried playing with Tcl a few years back, messing with an implementation of Uno in Tcl for eggdrop
[07:49:41] <Phase> it's worth knowing imo
[07:49:42] <Drunkgate> eggdrop is the only experience I have with tcl as well
[07:49:52] <Phase> not a tool for every job, but worth learning
[07:49:59] <Phase> other user is expect
[07:50:13] <Phase> i think gimp has tcl scripting, they added python as well recently
[07:54:32] <Starthunder> Maybe I should just go with one of the existing btrfs backuppy things
[07:54:43] * Starthunder really likes doing things her way. Perhaps too much.
[08:04:00] <Starthunder> This is confusing
[08:04:00] <Starthunder> why is the sshd option `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` for a weird password thing?
[08:04:00] <Starthunder> And you want to turn it off?
[08:04:00] <Starthunder> What if pubkey auth, if not challenge-response?
[08:04:00] <HoneyDrops> Phase: that is why region-based licensing needs to end.  It shouldn't matter where you happen to be physically located at all on the internet, for anything.
[08:06:11] <HoneyDrops> Same with console and dvd regioning --  Needs to end.  Same stuff sold everywhere to everyone, for the same price and under the same terms (excepting differences required to comply with taxes and the legitimate differences in cost of shipping).
[08:09:25] <Starthunder> good luck getting that to happen under capitalism, until represent.us happens everywhere
[08:09:32] <Starthunder> and until everyone actually cares

[20:10:23] <Starthunder> You're not the only process on this system. Other apps need RAM, too. :V

[20:13:55] * Gladiolus nibbles on Colgate's connection
[20:14:16] <HoneyDrops> There is no possible way to make a "good" web browser as long as one's goal is to support the modern web.
[20:16:14] <Starthunder> Throw everything out and start over? HTTP 4.0, HTML 7?
[20:18:41] <HoneyDrops> Won't fix the problem.
[20:20:23] *** Quits: MistVeil (aqua@Pony-hahd0r.static.axtel.net) (Quit: Saliendo)
[20:20:52] <HoneyDrops> The problem is the misguided attempt to effectively turn a document viewer into an platform for application development.  You have to reject the idea of youtube, facebook, google's office thingy, etc. as things that should exist within a web browser to even get to a place where you can hope to "fix" it.
[20:21:32] <Gladiolus> death to flash
[20:22:26] <HoneyDrops> Like online video?  There are really only two sane options: provide a URI to a stream and let VLC or mpv handle it.  Or better, just provide a URI to the movie file for download.
[20:23:05] <HoneyDrops> There is no reason to shove video playback into a HTML/CSS document viewer.
[20:26:17] <HoneyDrops> Flash is still a symptom of the disease, or maybe more accurately an opportunistic infection.
[20:26:50] <Gladiolus> "there's no reason to do thing" ~we do thing anyway because convenience~
[20:26:53] <Gladiolus> computers.txt
[20:28:12] <HoneyDrops> It would be nice if HTML <next number> abandoned concern with how things are displayed and focused on proper semantic labeling, and leave display up to the client.  We're still paying for that mistake.
[20:29:56] <HoneyDrops> A website should just be the actual information, and tagged to make it easy for the browser to parse for the context of each bit of information.  What fonts, colors, alignment, size, etc.  should no be the websites concern, rather that is the domain of the user/client.
[20:33:00] <HoneyDrops> Imagine being able to toggle off a website's menu or side bar or any other element, universally with simple hotkeys?  Imagine being able to pick a unified formatting for everything to use, and it can be applied to everything?  Imagine being able to trivially automate scraping data from any website and not having to worry about having to hack around every little display tweak someone decides
[20:33:02] <HoneyDrops> they need to do?
[20:34:23] <HoneyDrops> Also, would be nice, but unrelated to above to have a revision history of every website, ever.  (like you could take any URI and add date=<UNIXTIME> and it would give you the website exactly as it appeared at that time)
[20:35:00] <Starthunder> People wouldn't like that.
[20:35:14] <Starthunder> especially with the right-to-be-forgotten shit
[20:35:19] <HoneyDrops> That last bit would be perfect for actually making meaningful citations.
[20:36:30] <Starthunder> Personally, I usually don't mind letting websites dictate their style.
[20:36:38] <Starthunder> Syntax highlighting and all thatâ€¦
[20:36:48] <Starthunder> I wouldn't want to have to recreate all that myself.
[20:37:14] <HoneyDrops> I have sympathy for the right-to-be-forgotten, but I have accepted that is largely a forgone option.  I think efforts are better spent getting humanity to a place where we simply don't care that a prime minister drunkenly shoved his penis into a cooked pig.
[20:37:59] <HoneyDrops> You read something like that, shrug, "Ok that's odd, but it doesn't impact anything." and move on.
[20:38:07] <Starthunder> ^
[20:38:36] <Starthunder> right to be forgotten is similarly a symptom of a different thing
[20:39:13] <HoneyDrops> Largely the right-to-be-forgotten isn't about the information not still being there, but rather the specific problem of people making a fuss over what other people did/said for no good reason.
[20:40:08] <HoneyDrops> However, if you make a statement, and it does materially impact your fitness for something, yes it should be taken into account.  You don't have the right to hide something you said/did that is materially relevant.
[20:40:49] <Starthunder> You can't expect to do /anything/ publically and have everyone forget about it.
[20:41:05] <Starthunder> NB: the Internet consist largely of public spaces.
[20:41:25] <HoneyDrops> We just need to get people to be better at learning to correctly identify what matters and ignore the other fluff, as "juicy" as it might be (and really, we just need to move past the idea of gossip)
[20:41:35] <Starthunder> Yeah.
[20:41:47] *** Quits: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: )
[20:42:41] <HoneyDrops> Still, while I sympathize with the right-to-be-forgotten, it is a misguided attempt to apply a technical/legal solution to what is really a human behavioural problem.  Bluntly: it doesn't work.
[20:43:39] <Starthunder> Yeah.
[20:44:37] <HoneyDrops> Technical problems require technical solutions, legal problems require legal solutions, logistical problems require logistical solutions... trying to mismatch solution domains with the problem's domain just creates more problems, while generally failing to address the original problem in any meaningful way.
[20:53:38] <HoneyDrops> But anyway, having a reliable and universal time-domain record of websites would be a huge boon to being able to use them meaningfully as citations.
[20:54:01] <Starthunder> use btrfs for your document filesystems \o/
[20:54:26] <Starthunder> snapshot on every change
[20:54:47] <HoneyDrops> Essentially.  I like the idea of turning the web into what is effectively a massive, distributed filesystem.
[20:56:10] <HoneyDrops> Would make a lot of things easier, like archiving whole sites locally.

[22:14:10] <Compu> so i been wondering, my laptop runs ubuntu 14.04, if i clone my mechanical 120 GB HDD over to a 120 GB SSD will ubuntu know to handle all the TRIM stuff and everything automatically?
[22:15:11] <Starthunder> Compu: AFAIK, TRIM is filesystem-dependent.
[22:15:20] <Compu> Starthunder: ext4
[22:15:24] <Starthunder> And most filesystems have an `ssd` and|or a `discard` mount option.
[22:15:38] <Starthunder> Compu: for root? What about your other filesystems?
[22:16:10] <Compu> Starthunder: my boot partition is also my data partition, i did the default ubuntu filesystem install
[22:16:29] <Starthunder> Compu: what? And it didn't give you a separate /boot? I find that hard to believe
[22:16:53] <Compu> Starthunder: i did the install back in 12.04
[22:17:06] <Compu> and have since used the OS upgrade
[22:17:13] <Starthunder> even if /home|/usr|/var are all on the same partition as /, to my knowledge there's almost always a separate /boot
[22:17:26] <Compu> maybe there is, i dunno

[22:23:22] <Compu> Starthunder: no idea, thats how the ubuntu 12.04 installer set it up
[22:23:54] <Compu> Starthunder: so anything i would need to change after cloning to an SSD?
[22:26:23] <Starthunder> Compu: yeah, update the mount options to be more appropriate to your SSD

[23:27:21] <Starthunder> I know the story hereâ€¦
[23:27:29] <Starthunder> But why can't you just do the file copy as HoneyDrops recommended?
[23:27:46] <Compu> because hassle
[23:28:16] <Compu> and the only guy i know of that has the hardware needed to do this stuff is not at all familiar with anything new
[23:28:21] <Compu> let me put it this way
[23:28:51] <Compu> he happily gives people computers with less than 512 MB of RAM and says that its enough
[23:28:56] <Compu> for full on ubuntu
[23:29:34] <Compu> he used to just run old, out of date versions of ubuntu but apparently he stopped doing that, he refuses to do anything i suggest like using Lubuntu instead
[23:30:29] <Compu> since im younger (it also might be that im female as well) i think he dismisses anything i say because he runs a business and thus must know more than i ever could
[23:31:05] <HoneyDrops> What hardware do you need?  A 7$ SATA-to-USB adapter is all you need, plus a flash drive w/ some sort of bootable linux env.
[23:31:36] <Starthunder> ^
[23:31:52] <Compu> yeah but we struggle to afford anything that isnt absolutely necessary
[23:32:16] <Compu> the only reason i even got a new hard drive was because my old one was starting to age
[23:32:28] <HoneyDrops> You put the SSD in the system, hook up the old drive via USB, boot off the usb flash drive, partition, mkfs, mount, rsync/cp -a, chroot, grub-install, unmount and reboot
[23:32:49] <HoneyDrops> It's almost exactly like installing gentoo, minus building a kernel XD
[23:33:52] <HoneyDrops> If you want to dd, it's the same drive config, but just dd rather than partition/mkfs/mount/copy/chroot/grub
[23:34:11] <Compu> HoneyDrops: again, im not actually doing the ssd thing, im busy dealing with getting my slowly dying desktop 1 TB HDD cloned 
[23:34:12] <HoneyDrops> If you have access to a desktop, you can even do it on that, provided you can connect both drives
[23:35:02] <HoneyDrops> (I actually suggest using another system, as it will be faster to not use USB.)
[23:36:05] <Compu> cant afford another system
[23:36:11] <Compu> this other guy can
[23:36:54] <HoneyDrops> Do you have any access to any computer with two sata ports?  (one can even be in use, any existing drives can be disconnected)
[23:37:34] <Compu> my desktop has 2, 1 for the optical drive and 1 for the HDD
[23:37:44] <Compu> its the one that is having it's HDD cloned
[23:40:39] <HoneyDrops> Ok, make a bootable flash drive, disconnect the optical, hook the new drive up in place of the optical, and clone.
[23:40:50] <Compu> too late for that
[23:41:02] <Compu> i sent it off to be cloned on saturday

[23:43:15] <Compu> i called at around 2:30 and its now nearly 5:45
[23:47:26] * HoneyDrops wouldn't trust someone else with her drives.  However, many might consider her marginally paranoid.
[23:47:51] <Compu> i have no choice really, we dont have any money left this month
[23:48:09] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] understands completely and agrees with HoneyDrops
[23:51:03] <HoneyDrops> He's doing this for free?  I mean, no service is going to charge less than what a 2GB or less usb flash drive costs.
[23:53:32] <Compu> yeah he is cuz hes my step grandmother's son
[23:56:31] <HoneyDrops> If you still had the drive, I would have happily mailed you a flash drive.  I have a bin of about a dozen 512MB-1G ones I got for free.  They are branded with some bank/legal firm logos, and have awful I/O speeds, but make nice give-aways for utility/emergency boot disks.
[23:56:49] <Compu> mmm
