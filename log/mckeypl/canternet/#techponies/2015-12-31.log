[02:42:16] <Moonlightning> vi over nano, definitely
[02:42:24] <JustAberrant> but yeah, at that point may as well just use eclipse or whatever ;p

[02:43:51] <JustAberrant> right, which is my point
[02:44:25] <JustAberrant> making vim do all the things eclipse and friends will do is possible, but it's a pain in the ass and imo not worth it
[02:44:55] <JustAberrant> vim is good for config files and scripts and quick edits and such, but that's about all I use it for these days
[02:45:08] <vi[NLR]> same
[02:47:57] * Moonlightning uses vim nearly exclusively.
[02:48:26] <JustAberrant> I even find myself using eclipse's svn integration more and more.. I still drop down to the cli client to deal with any serious issues, but day to day merging and conflict res, so much quicker through eclipse

[02:59:53] <HoneyDrops> The fact Java coding relies so much on an IDE I see as a weakness.
[03:00:24] <Crabtree> early days for me, I'm teaching myself python as my first language
[03:00:24] <HoneyDrops> If you need an IDE there is something wrong with the language.
[03:00:35] <JustAberrant> no argument there, but it is what it is 
[03:01:27] <JustAberrant> a lot of the java-esq languages/wrappers aim to fix a lot of that, but still, definitely one of the less nice parts of java
[03:02:05] <JustAberrant> although the other side of that is that in general it's a very verbose language, which I don't really see as a flaw
[03:02:46] <JustAberrant> but having an IDE that will automatically fill stuff in is almsot a must
[03:02:57] <JustAberrant> * in is almost
[03:03:25] <HoneyDrops> Verbosity must add clarity and expressiveness to be worthwhile.

[03:03:53] <JustAberrant> java has a distinct lack of special syntax compared to other languages
[03:04:09] <JustAberrant> the entire language operates on a small set of mechanics, which means you can easily see what just about anything is doing
[03:04:10] <HoneyDrops> In my (limited) experience with Java, at lot seemed to be verbose for the sake of it.
[03:04:28] <JustAberrant> the downside is there's few shortcuts for common things
[03:04:29] <HoneyDrops> I still prefer C.
[03:04:55] <JustAberrant> well, overkill OO is another hallmark of java, which I also agree becomes problematic for some stuff

[03:16:38] <JustAberrant> that's actually another downside of java, there's a lot of overhead in getting a java environment going
[03:16:45] <JustAberrant> it's really more apt to medium and large scale systems
[03:16:54] <JustAberrant> especially things like app servers
[03:17:27] <JustAberrant> although maven is pretty reasonable, it's a complex system, but using it in the basic "compile and give me a jar" sense is fairly straight forward
[03:18:01] <JustAberrant> and there's gradle, which I actually don't like, but one of the "selling points" is it uses it's own non-xml dsl
[03:18:16] <JustAberrant> personally I don't get XML hate, never have.. I like XML
[03:18:53] <HoneyDrops> It's a pain to edit.
[03:19:05] <JustAberrant> I dunno, I don't think so
[03:19:16] <JustAberrant> _and_ as with everything else in the java world, the solution is an IDE ;p
[03:19:20] <HoneyDrops> Unless you have dedicated tools to basically hide it away.
[03:19:26] <JustAberrant> i.e. eclipse with the maven plugin ;p

[03:24:32] <Moonlightning> Like, what the fuck is this…the owner of the Oakland Raiders wants the city to use //taxpayer dollars// to build them a new stadium?
[03:24:33] <Phase> sportsball is the pride and joy of $country
[03:24:43] <Moonlightning> Doesn't Oakland have ENOUGH BUDGET ISSUES AS IT IS?

[03:28:45] <Phase> doesn't have to be dickwaving, though often is
[03:29:05] <Phase> and being so money laden doesn't help
[03:29:23] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: I will admit, things like gradle and maven are why java is such a terrible experience on linux ;p
[03:29:27] <JustAberrant> especially gentoo
[03:29:43] <Phase> on linux?
[03:29:45] <Moonlightning> And this is why I don't want to live on this planet anymore
[03:29:52] <Phase> gradle and maven are cross platform
[03:29:58] <JustAberrant> because at it's core, maven is just a very specialized package manager
[03:29:58] <Phase> they can be terrible on any platform
[03:30:12] <JustAberrant> well, maven and gradle are fine
[03:30:14] <Phase> maven is the one what does namespace mangling isn't it?
[03:30:21] <JustAberrant> the problem is when you try to use them _and_ a package manager
[03:30:42] <JustAberrant> and gentoo is deadset on not just letting maven do it's thing
[03:30:55] <HoneyDrops> Exactly, I guess I see Java tend to make and use their special little tool, when there are general tools already.
[03:31:10] <Phase> gentoo demands user control of the build process
[03:31:11] <JustAberrant> problem is the general tools are insufficient
[03:31:47] <JustAberrant> the big thing maven does that package managers don't is the multiple versions thing, portage inda does that with slots, but not anywhere near to the level maven does
[03:31:50] <Phase> yes but they're completely replacing the toolchain rather than adding the missing pieces
[03:32:11] <JustAberrant> well java isn't tied to linux specifically, and even if it was, not to a specific distro
[03:32:21] <Phase> which gives you enterprise quality products like ant
[03:32:29] <Phase> which are utterly terrible scripting languages
[03:32:37] <JustAberrant> hehe, well, ant was attempt 1
[03:32:41] <JustAberrant> and wasn't _that_ bad
[03:32:42] * Phase hasn't used maven but is real salty over ant
[03:32:45] <Phase> it is that bad
[03:32:53] <JustAberrant> it got better when ivy came along
[03:32:54] <Phase> you're writing a *script* in *XML*
[03:33:03] <JustAberrant> but yeah, maven came along because ant was such a huge pain ;p
[03:33:12] <Phase> there is SO MUCH CODE and it can't even do a partial rebuild
[03:33:16] <Phase> so it's slow as fuck
[03:33:19] <JustAberrant> maven was basically "yeah, we're getting rid of all the bullshit you have to do to make ant work"
[03:33:19] <Phase> and a pain to write
[03:33:44] <JustAberrant> because pretty much everyone wrote the same basic ant script, so maven was like, "we'll just assume that's what you want to do and handle it out of the box"
[03:33:59] <Phase> so it's built atop ant?
[03:34:04] <JustAberrant> no
[03:34:34] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: ports/portage should be the model for every OS.
[03:35:08] <JustAberrant> meh, I like it, but it doesn't make sense for most
[03:35:41] * HoneyDrops clings to her ports-like systems.
[03:35:42] * JustAberrant has used gentoo since sometime around 2003, very shortly after it came out .. but even I accept it's not for everyone
[03:36:30] * HoneyDrops highhoofs JustAberrant.  Also been using it since around then, spring 2004... freshman year spring break: Install Gentoo!
[03:36:45] * Phase doesn't use gentoo but sees the appeal
[03:36:54] <JustAberrant> it was sold to me as "slackware with a package manager", which isn't true at all, but still ;p

[03:37:34] <JustAberrant> honestly I don't even care about the source aspect or control aspect any more
[03:37:46] <JustAberrant> I like that they don't monkey with packages as much as debian
[03:37:55] <JustAberrant> and generally have much less of a high-horse FOSS attitude
[03:38:06] <JustAberrant> that's what always bugged me about debian, so many mangled packages
[03:38:20] <JustAberrant> I mean I get it, it's the RMS distro, but still
[03:38:26] <Phase> all the larger ones tend to do some fiddling
[03:38:42] <JustAberrant> if you're gonna ship a gutted mplayer/mencoder/etc and a messed up firefox, at least rename it
[03:38:48] <Phase> different conventions and policies, it's bound to happen
[03:39:02] <JustAberrant> mplayer-withoutTheActualCommonlyUsedCodecs or something
[03:39:09] <Phase> i'm fairly sure debian does rebrand firefox
[03:39:15] <JustAberrant> yeah, they do (now)
[03:39:19] <JustAberrant> I remember when it happened
[03:39:25] <JustAberrant> and it was _exactly_ because of that meddling
[03:39:44] <JustAberrant> mozilla basically told debian they couldn't call what they were shipping firefox because they'd penised with it so much
[03:39:45] <Phase> and the codec stuff kinda is a legal problem
[03:40:07] <JustAberrant> well yes, but still, it's annoying
[03:40:15] <JustAberrant> also the way they used to push gcj
[03:40:33] <Phase> instead of the jvm?
[03:40:35] <JustAberrant> making you jump through an insane amount of hoops to get an actual functioning java toolchain
[03:40:49] <Phase> somehow that doesn't surprise me
[03:40:49] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[03:40:51] <HoneyDrops> Well the issue was debian wanted to backport security patches for firefox.
[03:41:24] <JustAberrant> for some time they refused to have java in the repo at all
[03:41:41] <Phase> yeah, debian has that issue where it applies its policies to all packages
[03:41:42] <HoneyDrops> Adding a repo isn't that hard
[03:41:52] <JustAberrant> and then there's the damn wrapper scripts and symlinks
[03:41:52] <HoneyDrops> But the overlay system portage has is nicer
[03:42:02] <Phase> it makes sense for backend stuff, but firefox you want up to date
[03:42:05] <JustAberrant> I mean, gentoo has gone that way, but debian is the master of it
[03:42:12] * Phase needs to look into portage/ports type stuff
[03:43:09] <JustAberrant> anyway, I get the debian appeal, but it's like python, it just seems to piss me off through 1000 little issues ;p
[03:43:22] <Phase> you know whats a good idea? keeping your firefox build 10 versions behind to remain compatible with firefox from 10 versions ago
[03:43:29] <Phase> thanks debian!
[03:43:38] <Phase> stupid debian policies
[03:43:52] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:44:24] <Phase> fedora + centos works better than debian + debian for desktop + server setups
[03:44:34] <JustAberrant> I like redhat/centos for work stuff
[03:45:09] <JustAberrant> I'd never want it on my own machine, but as far as a hassle free mostly works out of the box system that's easy to update.. it's pretty solid
[03:45:24] <JustAberrant> and kickstart is decent for automated deployments
[03:45:33] <Phase> i wouldn't use centos on a desktop, great as a server os though
[03:45:50] <Phase> and fedora is rolling release but with actual testing
[03:45:53] <JustAberrant> plus a lot of stuff is tested with it, so things tend to just work out of the box

[03:56:08] <HoneyDrops> MC needs a package manage for mods so badly.
[03:56:26] <JustAberrant> pff, it has them, they are just horrifying
[03:56:41] <HoneyDrops> The entire system of how modpacks are done now is just awful.
[03:57:00] <HoneyDrops> I have some hope for wonko-the-sane/quickmods from MultiMC.
[03:57:08] <JustAberrant> well yes, because minecraft doesn't have an official proper api, forge is a mess, and most mods are written by gamers ;p
[03:57:32] <JustAberrant> FTB could be argued as package manager-esq, but it is _such_ a clusterfuck
[03:57:51] <HoneyDrops> The fact that lauchers and packs are linked is weird to me.
[03:58:59] * Phase wants the idea of a modpack to go away on the user side
[03:59:11] <Phase> you should be able to join a server and have your client figure it all otu
[04:03:36] <HoneyDrops> There are some security issues with that.
[04:04:01] <HoneyDrops> Given mods are just java code, there is no sandboxing.
[04:05:03] <Phase> such issues could be solved via os-level sandboxing
[04:05:44] <Phase> but in general i imagine people are joining servers run by their friends, or within a community, not random
[04:06:33] <Phase> or if you want to get real fancy, modpack makers could sign their builds
[04:06:56] <HoneyDrops> Modpacks should be just a list of mods+versions and config patches.  Then the package manager fetches the mods from teh repo.
[04:07:36] <Phase> which is also fine and could be implemented within minecraft itself, i think vazkii talked about doing that
[04:08:16] <JustAberrant> well, mod authors are _very_ weird about how their mods are distributed, which makes any kind of general package manager damn near impossible
[04:08:20] <HoneyDrops> Also this removed the copyright implications of modpacks
[04:08:44] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: just wget it from where ever they upload it
[04:08:55] <HoneyDrops> they don't want other hosting it, fine
[04:09:05] <Phase> no you miss the point, some of them are REALLY weird

[04:09:41] <HoneyDrops> Easy: exclude them and let them sit along in their corner
[04:09:51] <Phase> no, but not doing minecraft anything anymore
[04:09:54] <HoneyDrops> Bees?  Forstry is FOSS
[04:10:00] <Phase> HoneyDrops, that's what people do more or less
[04:10:13] <JustAberrant> only when they reach insane levels of crazy
[04:10:13] <Phase> factorization isn't in modpacks anymore, far fewer users
[04:10:21] <JustAberrant> baseline level of crazy people tolorate
[04:11:03] * Phase has thought of making a pure open-source pack
[04:11:10] <Phase> you know, outside of minecraft itself
[04:11:11] <HoneyDrops> My modpack is almost entirely FOSS, or OS+CC
[04:11:32] <Phase> but i've also thought of porting minecraft to html5 so maybe i'm not the best person to draw ideas from
[04:11:33] <JustAberrant> it could be done, there are some good mods that are open source
[04:11:38] <HoneyDrops> CoFH is the main exception, but they are at least sane and resonable.
[04:12:04] <Phase> CoFH... required by thermal expansion?
[04:12:22] <HoneyDrops> I meant CoFH mods, that included TE
[04:12:26] <Phase> ah
[04:13:04] <HoneyDrops> There are a lot of FOSS mods, even more if you count CC :/
[04:13:31] <Phase> JustAberrant, eloraam is making redpower into a full minecraft-ish game
[04:13:41] * HoneyDrops suppresses urge to rant about CC and code.
[04:13:44] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:13:54] <JustAberrant> once project red showed up people really stopped caring about redpower
[04:14:18] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: hehe, I use CC extensively, so I feel that ;p

[04:14:38] * JustAberrant write a thing to turn pixel art into lua scripts to control turtles to make pixel art :>
[04:14:57] <JustAberrant> and the code is _horrifying_ but it works really well
[04:15:17] <JustAberrant> also zooming out of the code in a graphical text editor is cool cause at the beginning of the generated code is the image represented as a huge array
[04:15:23] <JustAberrant> and it kinda looks like the thing it'll draw
[04:15:25] <HoneyDrops> I think RP3 is on the Duke Nukem Forever dev schedule.
[04:15:36] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/minecraft/script_zoomed.png  <-- old pic ;p
[04:16:21] <Phase> HoneyDrops, probably
[04:16:29] <Phase> rp2 more or less was
[04:16:35] <JustAberrant> but yeah, the script will automatically pull wool from an enderchest and fuel as needed, it's.. actually ridiculously effective :>
[04:16:50] <aji> nice work JustAberrant
[04:20:12] <JustAberrant> I made it awhile ago, and someday I want to re-write it and maybe write my own pixelart editor (cause the one I used, miencraft structure planner, is godawful)
[04:20:30] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: creative commons is not for software :(
[04:20:33] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it works ;p
[04:20:41] <HoneyDrops> You make them sad :(
[04:21:05] <JustAberrant> meh ;p
[04:21:14] <HoneyDrops> I do wish MC modders would stick to normal licenses.
[04:21:31] * JustAberrant though you meant computercraft @ CC
[04:21:34] <HoneyDrops> But they love to roll their own weird ones, or take a normal one then utterly break it.
[04:21:44] <HoneyDrops> I prefer OpenComputers.
[04:21:50] <JustAberrant> well yeah, see "modders are really weird about licensing" ;p
[04:22:07] <HoneyDrops> Something about CC being closed source especially rubs me the wrong way.
[04:22:21] <JustAberrant> hmm, I thought computercraft was open source
[04:22:24] <HoneyDrops> More than in general I dislike using something closed source.
[04:22:24] <JustAberrant> I could be wrong though
[04:23:18] <HoneyDrops> It might have changed, but last I checked it was closed source. 
[04:24:08] * HoneyDrops has a gnumeric table of all the mods she considered to use in her pack, and has no public repo listed and license is marked "Closed"
[04:24:35] <HoneyDrops> But that was last spring?
[04:24:54] <JustAberrant> when it comes to minecraft I don't really care to much about open source-ness
[04:25:14] <JustAberrant> I mean, artistic things in general are a bit different, because people like to maintain control over "their" mod
[04:25:20] <JustAberrant> which is why I think they are so weird about the licensing
[04:25:26] <Phase> computer craft is closed and the author is a little salty over opencomputers
[04:25:44] <JustAberrant> hmm, yeah, for some reason I thought it was open, but yeah, doesn't look like it
[04:26:01] <JustAberrant> like, utilitarian stuff, you put the source out, someone improves it, fantastic
[04:26:12] <Phase> "but i OWN it!"
[04:26:22] <Phase> "YOU CANT HAVE MY THING"
[04:26:30] <JustAberrant> but artistic stuff, you put your thing out there, someone changes it in a way that differs from your vision, it becomes more popular
[04:26:32] <Phase> said every second mod dev
[04:26:43] <HoneyDrops> Too bad anyone can just clone it, copyright doesn't cover functionality~
[04:26:52] <JustAberrant> sure, and that is what happens
[04:26:56] <Phase> opencomputers is a superset of computercraft
[04:27:03] <HoneyDrops> -_- I had to beat that concept into some MC modders.
[04:27:39] <JustAberrant> but in general I can at least appreciate the difference in mindset
[04:28:10] <HoneyDrops> OC is a lot more balanced (to the extent balance really exists in a game like MC) and really more fun.
[04:28:12] <JustAberrant> at least closed someone has to put a lot of work if they want to do their own version of yours
[04:28:14] <Phase> they are different in mindset but opencomputers has so much more development, i'm sure you can configure it to be more or less computercraft if you really want
[04:28:20] <Phase> and it's compatible with the cc api last i checked
[04:28:37] <HoneyDrops> OC is awesome.
[04:29:11] <JustAberrant> I can see the fear that you'd spend a year working on a mod, and someone could then basically change a bunch of stuff and that become the dominant version
[04:29:12] <Phase> it is a little hard for one guy to compete against githubs population of mc fans
[04:29:43] <HoneyDrops> And that's why FOSS wins :D
[04:29:47] <JustAberrant> especially where issues like balance are _so_ contentious
[04:30:03] <HoneyDrops> Minetweaker is a godsend
[04:30:15] <HoneyDrops> (+ modtweaker)
[04:31:02] <JustAberrant> also just cause I ran into it, perl kinda has the whole package manager vs their own tool thing (going way back in topics) ;p
[04:31:14] <JustAberrant> to a lesser degree than java, but still ;p
[04:31:45] * Phase really is tempted to port minecraft to html5
[04:31:53] <JustAberrant> bleh ;p
[04:31:53] <Phase> there's a few jar->js compiler
[04:32:00] <JustAberrant> why in gods name.. ;p
[04:32:00] <HoneyDrops> C + lua!
[04:32:08] <JustAberrant> double bleh ;p
[04:32:22] * JustAberrant would love to see minecraft re-written in java, but properly ;p
[04:32:34] <JustAberrant> if there was a serious effort to do so, I'd probably contribute
[04:32:47] <JustAberrant> but it seems like all the minecraft clones fall into the exact same traps as the original
[04:32:48] <Phase> there's a C++ server implementation
[04:32:55] <JustAberrant> yeah, and it's not great ;p
[04:33:02] * Phase never tried to use it
[04:33:10] <Phase> a scale-out mc server would be amazing
[04:33:12] <Phase> minecraft the mmo
[04:33:19] <Phase> thousand person builds
[04:33:20] <JustAberrant> better than stock, but they didn't address the big problems 
[04:33:27] <JustAberrant> exactly 
[04:33:38] <JustAberrant> _multi_fucking_threading_
[04:33:48] <JustAberrant> if I was gonna re-write minecraft, that would be at the very core
[04:33:53] <Phase> they could multi-thread chunk generation but for whatever reason don't
[04:33:56] <JustAberrant> right from the beginning, how do we make this more scalable
[04:34:06] <JustAberrant> because that's the huge problem with minecraft+mods right now
[04:34:19] <Phase> well that's always going to be an issue
[04:34:31] <JustAberrant> honestly what's needed is a team of actual software developers to sit down and _design_ it first
[04:34:34] <Phase> and reimplementing the server side of mc means reimplementing the server side of mods too
[04:34:49] <JustAberrant> well yes, would have to be a ground-up re-think
[04:35:13] <JustAberrant> but yeah, I actually did a really _really_ cough scale and feasibility calculation
[04:35:35] <JustAberrant> I figure it would take 4 people about 6 months to do a proper detailed design of minecraft+mods
[04:36:13] <HoneyDrops> A better MC implementation if doomed because the current modders are too invested in the current clusterfuck.  See: MS Windows.
[04:36:18] <HoneyDrops> s/if/is/
[04:36:30] <JustAberrant> well, the nice thing about java is it fixes that problem
[04:36:36] <JustAberrant> more or less anyway
[04:36:41] <HoneyDrops> We're maybe finally, blessedly, killing off Win9x APIs and software.
[04:36:53] <Phase> HoneyDrops, they have done more than one engine overhaul in mc
[04:37:01] <JustAberrant> either way, the client can be shitty imo ;p
[04:37:02] <Phase> 1.3 and 1.8 were the biggest
[04:37:08] <JustAberrant> actually that's my weakness
[04:37:25] <HoneyDrops> From what I head 1.8 is a mess.
[04:37:28] <HoneyDrops> hear*
[04:37:33] <Phase> which is why you saw a lot of mods killed dead in 1.3
[04:37:48] <HoneyDrops> The entire rendering model is insane.
[04:37:52] <Phase> server/client merge ultimately improved the multiplayer experience, but killed mods that couldn't handle it
[04:37:56] <JustAberrant> I feel like I could actually bring a lot to an effort to re-implement the server, it's parallel to what I work on professionally (large scale highly reliable type stuff), I have very little experience with user interfaces or graphics
[04:38:05] <Phase> HoneyDrops, i'm hearing 1.8.8 is once again usable, and in some ways an improvement
[04:38:26] <Phase> and the resource pack stuff is nice
[04:38:50] <JustAberrant> but the kind of weird inter-connected threading stuff that makes minecraft end up single threaded, that's the kind of stuff that I really dig into
[04:39:33] * Phase would almost call threading a non-issue in java
[04:39:41] <HoneyDrops> Really I would just like to see MC fossed and a forge-level modding api.
[04:39:41] <Phase> i mean you have a sync keyword
[04:39:49] <JustAberrant> hehe, it's not _quite_ that simple ;p
[04:39:57] <Phase> almost litterally a do the right thing keyword
[04:40:06] <JustAberrant> oh I disagree entirely ;p
[04:40:21] <Phase> not quite but if you can't thread a java app you have no business handling threads
[04:40:21] <JustAberrant> it's a usually does what should be done but often not optimally keyword ;p
[04:40:37] <Phase> non-optimal but correct
[04:40:52] <Phase> optimization is better done in response to profiling than ahead of time
[04:40:55] <JustAberrant> in the case of something like minecraft you need worker threads but they still all need to sync up
[04:40:58] <Phase> you *will* get it wrong
[04:41:12] <JustAberrant> it wouldn't be as simple as just syning the shared resources
[04:41:17] <Phase> i am still amazed chunk generation isn't threaded
[04:41:23] <Phase> that's a purely functional thing
[04:41:40] <JustAberrant> you would need to build a model where you have different "wait" points depending on the type of action 
[04:41:43] <Phase> just spin off a thread or two for chunks, keep them outof the game thread
[04:41:43] <HoneyDrops> From what I hear MC is the example of how not to do anything.
[04:41:59] <JustAberrant> yeah, world gen is trivial to thread, there were even mods that tried to add it
[04:42:02] <Phase> i think notch has admitted as much
[04:42:10] <JustAberrant> but the tick stuff isn't trivial at all
[04:42:26] <JustAberrant> being able to have a threadpool processing ticks would require design
[04:42:48] <JustAberrant> you'd need to group them by shared resources and as I said, by waitpoint
[04:42:53] <JustAberrant> and balance them on a performance curve
[04:43:01] <JustAberrant> possibly dynamically
[04:43:31] <JustAberrant> even more ideally split out read from modifies
[04:43:52] <JustAberrant> or but yeah, like I said, way more than just wrapping everything in sync blocks ;p
[04:44:05] <JustAberrant> and definitely requires a group of people to sit down for a few months and graph all this stuff out
[04:44:30] <JustAberrant> I do agree that trying to over-optimize early is a bad idea, profile and fix is a thing
[04:44:37] <JustAberrant> but you have to have the framework in place to tweak
[04:45:28] <JustAberrant> you won't get the tweaking right, but you can have everything structured properly so you can say "yeah, in a lot of cases tick processing is being held up by a lot of read operations on this type of resource" and tune accordingly
[04:46:32] <JustAberrant> also this is one reason I think agile can be a mess, some stuff can't be designed "as you go" and needs to be done up-front
[04:46:55] <JustAberrant> and I think threading and data flow tends to fall into that category when things get complicated

[15:49:14] <Sour_Sweet> Well apart from seeing timeouts there really isn't much of an error message. TCP based lookups work fine.
[15:50:08] <Sour_Sweet> I suspect some sort of network filtering, but even my default gateaway doesn't answer to UDP based lookups.
[15:51:15] <johnsey> tried other dns servers, too?

[15:52:46] <johnsey> time to call up your ISP and bitch at them i guess
[15:52:46] <Sour_Sweet> TCP works for those
[15:53:07] <Sour_Sweet> I don't even know if it's them (also not my network)
[15:53:22] <Sour_Sweet> Could be some networking gear here doing the filtering
[15:53:31] <johnsey> then prolly best to test it on the gateway
[15:54:03] <johnsey> or traceroute
[15:55:20] <Sour_Sweet> I didn't even know software would soft fail to TCP when UDP lookups don't work
[15:57:24] <Sour_Sweet> To be very honest I never was in a situation where UDP based DNS lookups don't work. At least the default gateaway anwsers useally in restricted setups.
