[10:07:08] <init3_tablet> Haha right?
[10:07:40] <init3_tablet> I miss my Nexus 7 :(
[10:08:29] <Phase4> iirc ios dev kits are ~$900
[10:08:41] <Phase4> you're not going to see many good free apps full stop
[10:09:35] <init3> Yeah. Don't you have to pay even more for Apple to 'review' your app to allow you to put it on the app store?
[10:10:27] <Googie> Dusk: Didn't you say GlowingBear was decent on iOS ?
[10:11:05] <Phase4> init3, probably, apple wants their cut wherever they can get it
[10:12:18] <Googie> I spent a while looking for a client a while back, never found anything decent, and ended up moving over to Android for unrelated reasons anyway.
[10:13:41] <init3> Yeah. I used to have a Nexus 7 until it got stolen. Only reason I have an iOS device is because it was given to me after that. 
[10:14:26] <init3> There isn't a way to throw another OS on an iPad is there?
[10:14:38] <Gigabit> Which gen?
[10:14:58] <init3> Original
[10:15:19] <Gigabit> I ask because when I had my iPad first gen, I was going to toss android on it and I could have sworn there was a way.
[10:15:31] <init3> Intresting
[10:15:34] <Phase4> quick google says the kernel has indeed been ported
[10:16:09] <Googie> IIRC there's been a few different projects, never really "stable" though
[10:16:27] <Phase4> doesn't seem to be a terribly large interest in it though

[10:49:08] <init3> Hmm. But would it serve me much better than any standalone web IRC client in that case then? 
[10:51:47] <Googie> Since it's using the weechat backend, yeah
[10:52:12] <Googie> Even if your connection drops out completely, when you reconnect, you'll be back exactly how you were.

[11:29:40] <tiwake> or whatever else
