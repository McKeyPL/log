[00:06:34] <HoneyDrops> Seoson: the problem with relying on companies for "protection" is there is no assurance they will always be aligned with your interests.  More importantly, unlike a representative govt (in theory), there is no reliable mechanism to force them to realign.  I hold little love for governments, but I hold none for corporations.

[00:13:48] <HoneyDrops> Overall, despite my complaints, the situation is overall pretty good.  Basically by every objective metric, as a species we are more propserous, more free, safer, and more equal than any point in human history.  The trends are all very positive, sure we slip back at times (like income equality over the past 60 years, but compared to 100 or 1000 years ago we're way better).
[00:15:15] <HoneyDrops> I have little reason to think that trend won't continue, despite the current snags we're creating.  I'd just rather avoid the minor regressions, if at all possible.
[00:17:41] <HoneyDrops> And despite what 24/7 news would make you think, violence is waaaaay down too.  It's not low enough (zero), but that's going to take a long time.

[02:23:04] <Seoson> Sweet Luna why is there no minimal creative effort required for patents ...
[02:23:30] <Seoson> There is in Germany for copyright at least
[02:24:46] <HoneyDrops> In theory there is, but the patent office is understaffed and too often the one who reviews lacks adequate expertiece in the field to really make a meaningful judgement on what constitutes "sufficiently novel"
[02:27:20] <HoneyDrops> Fortunately, patents still expire quickly enough.  For all the problems patents have (eg: software patents).  They at least are fixed by the clock in a mostly sane timescale.
[02:27:43] <HoneyDrops> Copyright is what needs the most fixing.
[02:28:27] <HoneyDrops> Copyright is currently abused to restrict things in ways it was never originally intended to cover.
[02:29:10] <HoneyDrops> EULAs, limits on how users modify things they buy, etc. should never have been viable impositions.
[02:29:10] <Seoson> I'd argue the other way around :D
[02:30:48] <HoneyDrops> Software and hardware vendors should have absolutely no standing to say how their products are modifies or used post sale.  They can refuse to support or warranty, but they should not be able to forbid others from changing the products post sale or sharing how to make those modifications with others.  (However, they can limit the production and distrobution of copies to others)
[02:31:50] <Seoson> But they effectily don't have much of an influence

[02:36:47] <HoneyDrops> Well tough for them, numbers are not protected by anything.
[02:37:31] <Seoson> Since everything can be represented as a number, numbers are indeed subject to copyright
[02:37:38] <HoneyDrops> Well arguably trade secret, but if you give someone soemthing with the number inside or the means to derive the number... well you failed to protect it.
[02:38:13] <HoneyDrops> The thing the number represents can be copyrighted, but not the number itself.
[02:38:14] <Seoson> So do you fail to protect your music CD just because you handed it to a customer?
[02:38:29] <HoneyDrops> No you failed to protect it as a trade secret.
[02:38:49] <HoneyDrops> Which one could argue private keys are.
[02:39:25] <Seoson> Copy protection isn't meant to make the data unshareable, it just increases the difficulty
[02:39:41] <HoneyDrops> The contents of a CD are "protected" by copyright.  The form/operation of the CD is protected by patents.
[02:42:58] <Seoson> The thing about patents vs. copyright is: You create an operating system that does something awesome and new. By copyright law I'm not allowed to steal your code - which is something I'm fine with. By patent law I'm not even allowed to write my own implementation and improve the original idea
[02:43:24] <Seoson> Not even talking about 2 people having the same idea
[02:43:35] <HoneyDrops> I agree, bad patents are baaaaad.
[02:43:47] <HoneyDrops> and make zero sense in software

[02:44:07] <Phase> you can write and improve upon it
[02:44:14] <Phase> it just gets real confusing if you want to distribute it
[02:44:19] <HoneyDrops> the entire idea of things like patents on codecs is utterly insane
[02:44:54] <Phase> if we're going to have patents on things software the period needs to be massively shortened
[02:45:09] <Phase> whats it now, 14 years? that makes sense if you need to spin up a manufacturing process
[02:45:13] <HoneyDrops> 15y
[02:45:16] <Phase> but software has no such cost
[02:45:33] <Phase> so it hinders innovation rather than encouraging it as patents are intended to do
[02:46:13] <Seoson> And you should only be allowed to use patents in court that you either actively use or have valid plans to use or license
[02:46:18] <HoneyDrops> 15y for a proper, novel, idea isn't unreasonable.  But there is no valid justification for the length of copyright for any work, regardless of merit.
[02:47:05] <Phase> Seoson, but yeah i think you can engineer something based on someone elses patent, and even file a patent for your changes, but selling a product does mean licensing their patent

[03:18:49] <Phase> an individual algorithm is a bit too general, a specific application or arrangement of algorithms though such as a codec does seem patentable

[03:24:01] <tiwake> Phase: I thought they didnt, but I could be wrong
[03:26:46] <JustAberrant> hah, dream on ;p
[03:27:04] <wolfyshy> is this conversation prompted by the microsoft v corel thing?  because on another network, in another galaxy, far far away, we were talking about this too
[03:27:09] <HoneyDrops> Oh, I know that is just a dream.
[03:27:18] <HoneyDrops> But it would be a wonderful world :)
[03:27:23] <Phase> corel is still around?
[03:27:29] <wolfyshy> I found a link where a microsoftie actually said "the ribbon UI is no longer specially licensed, use it as any other common control in comctl32"
[03:27:39] <wolfyshy> so the fact MS is suing corel over using the ribbon UI
[03:27:41] <HoneyDrops> Apparently, and alive enough for MS to bother suing.
[03:27:46] <wolfyshy> is uhm
[03:28:00] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: maybe for you, I'd probably be out of work ;p
[03:28:02] <wolfyshy> well, it has serious ramifications for all Windows apps, considering comctl32 has things like 'tabs' and 'tick boxes'
[03:28:02] <Phase> "Microsoft claims Corel violates copyright on nine patents through the "look and feel" of its products, in Federal Court." what the actual fuck
[03:28:05] <Phase> NINE patents
[03:28:17] <Phase> ribbon is covered by AT LEAST 9 patents
[03:28:18] <tiwake> wait, what?
[03:28:18] <JustAberrant> well, actually I wouldn't, but software as a career would be really shitty ;p

[03:28:33] <PinkiePieBot> [ ITUNES TERMS AND CONDITIONS: The Graphic Novel ]
[03:29:00] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: well in my ideal world, you'd only be writing software because you enjoy it or maybe some fun money, not because you need to inorder to house, feed, and clothe yourself/your family.
[03:29:23] <Phase> so it's over corel office looking too much like ms office
[03:29:30] <wolfyshy> what would you suggest instead, HoneyDrops?
[03:29:50] <tiwake> HoneyDrops: at least half of all software wouldent exist because of that
[03:29:58] <wolfyshy> I always wonder what people like you think people like me should be doing instead.  I've tried other jobs and other career paths.  I'm not good at anything else.
[03:30:02] <Phase> http://www.wordperfect.com/static/img/content/products/wp_ho/lp/screenHomeOffice.jpg i mean they look similar
[03:30:19] <HoneyDrops> wolfyshy: basic income, for a short term, at least until we get post scarcity.
[03:30:19] <wolfyshy> I'm good at writing software and enjoy getting paid for it.
[03:30:23] <Phase> but that's not a patent case, look and feel comes under separate laws i'd imagine
[03:30:30] <wolfyshy> Phase: nope, design patent.
[03:30:33] <wolfyshy> Phase: like apple v samsung
[03:30:48] <Phase> with their patent of the black rectangle?
[03:30:51] <HoneyDrops> wolfyshy: whatever you want to do, what you spend your life doing should be based upon what you enjoy, not what pays.
[03:31:00] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: I honestly don't know if I want that kind of world
[03:31:25] <Phase> surely that belongs under trademark law
[03:31:53] <HoneyDrops> If that is sit in your room and clop.  Fine!  If you want to study math for 80+ years, fine!  If you want to learn to be a doctor and treat patients?  Great!
[03:31:58] <JustAberrant> very least I don't think it's happening in my life time
[03:32:01] <tiwake> HoneyDrops: scarcity only exists because of lawyers
[03:32:34] <JustAberrant> to get to that point you'd have to have some kind of magic AI to do all the things people wouldn't do unless they were paid
[03:32:39] <JustAberrant> at which point, why do anything at all
[03:32:43] <wolfyshy> ^
[03:32:47] <JustAberrant> the AI can probably do it better than you anyway
[03:32:57] <HoneyDrops> Because it's fun?
[03:32:59] <wolfyshy> the logical conclusion of this is doing absolutely nothing
[03:33:13] <wolfyshy> because children will grow up in a world where there are no rewards for anything
[03:33:15] <Phase> the ideal conclusion looks like star trek
[03:33:18] <wolfyshy> so they will not have any drive to do anything
[03:33:21] <HoneyDrops> You do things because you enjoy them, not out of an obligation.
[03:33:34] <JustAberrant> dunno about you, but there has to be purpose in things for me to find them fun, I have a hard time doing things just cause
[03:33:36] <HoneyDrops> Some very well might choose to do nothing.
[03:33:38] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: human beings (and most other mammals) don't work that way.
[03:33:45] <wolfyshy> what JustAberrant said ^
[03:34:15] <JustAberrant> sure you could code "for the fun of it", but if you have a magical machine that will code for you, it becomes kinda empty
[03:34:18] <HoneyDrops> I always find most value in internal motivations.  External more often than not world paradoxically.
[03:34:42] <Phase> for the sake of bettering yourself
[03:34:49] <HoneyDrops> We have computers that play chess better than any human, but we still play chess.
[03:34:56] <JustAberrant> Phase: sure, but at that point, to what end
[03:35:03] <HoneyDrops> By that arguement, if someone is better than you in something, why do it?
[03:35:03] <Phase> for the sake of bettering yourself :P
[03:35:05] <Phase> that is the end
[03:35:06] <tiwake> Phase: everyone would end up like Vogon's from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
[03:35:07] <tiwake> lol
[03:35:28] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: money, power, etc
[03:35:41] <HoneyDrops> You do things for the experience, the knowledge, the fun.
[03:35:47] <JustAberrant> I'm not the best programmer in the world, but I'm an ok one, ok enough that someone pays me
[03:35:58] <Phase> we didn't stop playing chess just because computers are better at it
[03:36:01] <JustAberrant> and logically be getting better I can make more money, etc
[03:36:15] <tiwake> HoneyDrops: no, that shouldent be the only reasons
[03:36:26] <wolfyshy> https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/aylin/when-coding-style-survives-compilation-de-anonymizing-programmers-from-executable-binaries/
[03:36:30] <wolfyshy> this is fascinating
[03:36:43] <JustAberrant> life right now is a competition, and I think that drives most people
[03:36:53] <JustAberrant> if you take that away, life would be kinda dull
[03:36:55] <HoneyDrops> I am trying to find a nice way to say, "I pity your worldview"  If I did things only because I had to, or to make money... I would hate it.
[03:37:09] <wolfyshy> 'only' being the key word
[03:37:14] <Phase> "We are able to de-anonymize executable binaries of 20 programmers with 96% correct classification accuracy" nice
[03:37:15] <tiwake> I love my job
[03:37:16] <JustAberrant> not _only_ but it's a factor
[03:37:16] <wolfyshy> I write software because it pays me money AND because I enjoy it
[03:37:23] <wolfyshy> if you take either one of those away, it probably would reduce my drive
[03:37:26] <tiwake> I wouldent do my job though if I didnt have to worry about money
[03:37:26] <JustAberrant> and I think a necessary one
[03:37:30] <JustAberrant> it also adds value to it
[03:37:31] <Phase> now they just need to find who satoshi really was
[03:37:33] <HoneyDrops> But if there nothing you'd do even if not paid to?
[03:37:37] <tiwake> I would do a lot of other stuff though XD
[03:37:39] <HoneyDrops> is*
[03:38:17] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: I work on my own hobby stuff obviously, but I do so because I want to achieve some goal and I like it
[03:38:22] <JustAberrant> vs getting paid and I like it
[03:38:27] <tiwake> if I got more money for doing it per hour I'd be doing other things and my current job less
[03:38:37] <JustAberrant> i.e. if I could just download something that did what I was writing, I probably would
[03:38:58] <HoneyDrops> I find more enjoyment in making it myself.
[03:39:07] <JustAberrant> I'm writing a simplified pub/sub SOA middleware because such a thing doesn't exist and I want one
[03:39:11] <JustAberrant> it's a motivation
[03:39:15] <HoneyDrops> I'll happily code a little tool that I could find elsewhere.
[03:39:24] <JustAberrant> if I could get an AI to write one, writing it myself would feel empty
[03:39:39] <wolfyshy> I wrote a pretty big software even though there were many others, because all the others were terrible
[03:39:42] <tiwake> HoneyDrops: just because you need 3 lifetimes to do what you want to do does not excuse yourself from doing what needs to be done right now :P
[03:39:42] <HoneyDrops> If only to experience it, learn something, and have some fun.
[03:39:43] <wolfyshy> mine is less terrible
[03:40:08] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: meh, I feel like that's a very uncommon view ;p
[03:40:36] <HoneyDrops> tiwake: currently there is a lot that is "needed" but pretty much all signs point to chipping away at that until little to nothing remains.
[03:40:37] <JustAberrant> life needs legitimate challenge
[03:41:09] <HoneyDrops> The challenge is whatever goals you set for yourself, to try and do something better than you did before.
[03:41:52] <tiwake> alright, I'm going home, done enough with work for today
[03:41:53] <HoneyDrops> You're only guaranteed competitor is yourself.  You can always try to improve and do something, if only a little, better.
[03:42:03] <HoneyDrops> err, Your*
[03:42:24] <JustAberrant> meh, I'd find that boring without an actual concrete reason
[03:42:33] <HoneyDrops> :(
[03:43:17] <JustAberrant> in the kind of world you talk about, knowledge itself would be useless, so why have it
[03:43:38] <wolfyshy> two generations later, all children feel that way, and humans stop existing
[03:43:39] <HoneyDrops> because knowledge is intrinsically enjoyable to learn and master?
[03:44:02] <JustAberrant> wolfyshy: hehe, that, yeah ;p
[03:44:15] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: to a very small segment of the population maybe ;p
[03:44:36] <HoneyDrops> I'm pretty sure people would still procreate, would take a hell of a lot more to get them to stop that.
[03:44:49] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: I await your next FORTRAN framework
[03:45:10] <tiwake> ha
[03:45:18] <tiwake> cheers to that
[03:45:41] <HoneyDrops> Hmm, I can put it on the list ;)

[03:47:22] <HoneyDrops> Right now I have felt to cut for a mobile we're making.
[03:47:30] * HoneyDrops waves.
[03:47:47] <JustAberrant> but there won't be any needed cause who needs laptops when life is just eating and sex ;p

[03:48:42] <wolfyshy> I suppose in a way, you are simply reducing humans back to other animals

[03:49:58] <wolfyshy> man HoneyDrops you're pretty much taking all the fun out of life by making it entirely fun.
[03:50:13] <JustAberrant> right, even most hobbies people are still driven by competition

[03:54:56] <wolfyshy> as one final example, art
[03:55:09] <wolfyshy> if we had AIs to draw everything we wanted, what would be the point of drawing or sketching or anything?
[03:55:24] <wolfyshy> sure, you can enjoy doing it, but nobody is going to consider you a good artist when an AI can do it 100x better
[03:55:32] <wolfyshy> so what's the motivation for even trying?
[03:55:33] <Sombra> Princess Celestia's dark past comes back to her, when a group of cult-like ponies come to Canterlot, introducing themselves as "burned ones" and remind her of her of the much less kind and loving monarch that she used to be.  The burned ones swear their loyalty to her, but believe that in her current form she is "sick" and believe it their divine duty to cure her, by any means necessary.

[03:57:38] <HoneyDrops> Art is to express yourself, as long as humans have something to express, art will be made.
[03:57:58] <JustAberrant> pff, to many it's to express themselves better than everyone else ;p
[03:58:29] <JustAberrant> or at least try
[03:58:50] <HoneyDrops> Why do people make transistor radios from parts when you can just buy them?  Why do people make cpus from 7400 series ICs? 
[03:59:32] <JustAberrant> honestly, in a lot of cases to discuss them with their ham buddies and/or write about them on make
[03:59:46] <JustAberrant> not saying that's the only motivation, it isn't
[03:59:52] <JustAberrant> but I think it's a factor for a lot of people
[03:59:59] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> why do people rebuild old antique tubeset radios when you can buy modern ones, -> because they can
[04:00:22] <HoneyDrops> and it's... say it with me!  FUN~
[04:00:29] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> indeed xP
[04:00:35] <JustAberrant> well yes, but the "and" is important ;p
[04:00:37] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> and you learn a lot about operation

[08:40:21] <Phase> so it's bad and probably going to get worse
[08:40:23] <Moonlightning> well, I'd say that's cool
[08:40:29] <Moonlightning> but it's obviously not cool
[08:40:36] <Phase> hence the user reviews and curater systems
[08:40:41] <Moonlightning> I mean, okay, on the one hoof, indie devs yayyyyy
[08:40:44] <Moonlightning> on the otherâ€¦

[08:42:02] <Googie> I think someone must have pulled it.
[08:42:55] <Phase> someone needs to make a "piece of shite" tag
[08:43:12] <Moonlightning> :P
[08:43:43] <Phase> Moonlightning, only contention i have is if they're going to crowdsource quality control, and be just the shopfront, then they should reduce their cut
[08:43:57] * Googie also likes that game that claimed to be really really hard, and have a ton of puzzles.
[08:44:03] <Phase> ikr
[08:44:05] <Googie> There was no solution to the first puzzle, and no other levels existed.
[08:44:13] <Phase> xD
[08:45:13] <Phase> and the paid modding thing needs work if that happens again
[08:45:19] <Phase> like a lot of work
[08:45:34] <Phase> and i don't think the 70% publisher cut is viable
[08:45:50] * Phase does like that valve made the number not only public, but very visible
[08:46:00] <Moonlightning> Wat? O.o
[08:46:13] <Phase> remember the paid skyrim mods?
[08:46:30] * Googie would rather just paid mods not happen.
[08:46:45] <Googie> It's not that modders don't deserve to get paid, but I think money corrupts a community like that :(
[08:47:07] <Phase> oh it went to shit real fast
[08:48:24] <Phase> openness in how money is distributed is a very good feature though, that one piece of it worked real well
[08:48:45] <Phase> now they just need quality control and a better launch
[08:48:58] <Phase> something between nothing and all of it all at once preferably
[08:52:20] <Googie> Eh, it's more just that it turns things from everyone cooperating for mutual gain, to "Why should I help you if you'll just make money from it"

[17:55:51] <Dashie> i really hope y'all checked your server logs this morning
[17:55:59] <AppleDash> ?
[17:56:02] <Dashie> specifically, your httpd access logs
[17:56:09] <Dashie> go audit them. 
[17:56:11] <AppleDash> Any particular reason?
[17:56:19] * Dashie nods
[17:56:37] <AppleDash> Go on
[17:56:52] <Dashie> Well, I would assume this was something done targetting the entire netspace
[17:56:55] <Dashie> Just go cat your log
[17:56:57] <Dashie> you'll see
[17:57:15] <Dashie> It's.....amusing, and strangely beautiful, in its own way
[17:57:27] <AppleDash> My logs would appear to be literally empty
[17:57:28] <Dashie> i wont spoil the fun
[17:57:41] <Dashie> your $httpd access log?
[17:57:45] <AppleDash> Yes
[17:57:47] <Dashie> o.0
[17:58:35] <Dashie> sure you checked the right log?
[17:59:11] <AppleDash> http://puu.sh/mdOIY/804cdf8fc1.png
[17:59:12] <AppleDash> explain this
[18:00:05] <Dashie> wut
[18:00:06] <Dashie> no
[18:00:08] <Dashie> wrong log
[18:00:14] <AppleDash> ?
[18:00:19] <Dashie> $ cat /var/log/nginx-access.log
[18:00:24] <AppleDash> Um
[18:00:31] <AppleDash> That doesn't exist because I didn't configure it to exist.
[18:00:49] * Dashie sighs
[18:00:56] <Dashie> well, im not spoiling the surprise
[18:00:58] <AppleDash> I'm just trying random logs; they all are empty all of a sudden
[18:01:03] <AppleDash> For some absurd reason
[18:01:03] <Dashie> hmm
[18:01:36] <Dashie> $ curl http://yourshit.is.fuck.ed/sorrybruh.txt
[18:01:37] <HoneyDrops> Did they get rotated?
[18:01:44] * Dashie shrug
[18:01:56] <Dashie> reminds me, i should actually set up a cronjob to rotate my logs
[18:01:59] <Dashie> shit's getting big
[18:02:06] <Dashie> took almost a minute to finish cat-ting
[18:02:11] <AppleDash> Nah, logrotate has been broken for years
[18:03:26] <HoneyDrops> I'm not running an httpd, so I have no logs to check~
[18:03:37] <AppleDash> Nothing out of the ordinary in the previous log
[18:04:19] <AppleDash> For any site; including the default
[18:05:30] <Dashie> hmm
[18:05:40] <Dashie> odd. maybe it was targetted after all
[18:05:42] <AppleDash> Same on another server
[18:05:50] <Dashie> but...that'd be really weird
[18:06:19] <AppleDash> Do share
[18:08:06] * Dashie hums
[18:12:59] <AppleDash> Hmm?
[18:14:55] <Dashie> alright, now that i've confirmed others saw it...
[18:15:10] <Dashie> tl;dr CCC booped a huge number of servers with a message, that's all
[18:15:25] <Dashie> it was amusing :3
[18:15:29] <AppleDash> CCC?
[18:15:53] <Dashie> .-.
[18:16:18] <Dashie> oldschool hacker organization. they run a pretty decent infosec convention each year
[18:16:35] <AppleDash> I see

[18:17:04] <PinkiePieBot> [ Chaos Computer Club - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[18:17:29] <AppleDash> Ah
[18:17:46] <AppleDash> Apparently a huge number didn't include anything I own!
[18:19:41] * HoneyDrops has been following the CCC this year.  Though I still have a ton to catch up on.
[18:21:15] <AppleDash> They missed the opportunity to call it the Kaos Komputer Klub
[18:22:59] <Colgate> HoneyDrops: really have no idea what I'm looking for :P
[18:23:12] <AppleDash> I think you mean Dashie, Colgate
[18:23:21] <Colgate> Dashie: yes that
[18:24:04] * HoneyDrops squeaks and curls up into a ball.
[18:31:24] <Dashie> Colgate, check httpd's access log around 0100 - 0200 UTC -5
[18:32:35] * Colgate goes back 6 more hours or so
[18:37:01] <Colgate> Dashie: yeah, I'm not seeing anything in that timeframe
[18:39:47] <Dashie> goddamn ponies with their goddamn weird ass horse server configs... x3
