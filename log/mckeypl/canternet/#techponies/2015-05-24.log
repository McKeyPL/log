[10:23:30] <Twilightlicious> is it normal to have files modified in the future :P
[10:23:41] <Gigabit> Is it a Microsoft based OS this is occurring on?
[10:23:47] <Twilightlicious> lol mhm
[10:23:53] <Gigabit> Then yes its nornal
[10:23:59] <Twilightlicious> But i've never had a file like that
[10:24:02] <Gigabit> Normal* even
[10:24:07] <Twilightlicious> and i've always sorted my files by Date Modified
[10:24:27] <Twilightlicious> I believe i downloaded the file on my Cell Phone
[10:24:37] <Gigabit> I dunno what causes it but I have had similar things happen too. Or files that end up created in 1960
[10:24:57] <Twilightlicious> i think that has something to do with it having an invalid date
[10:25:14] <Twilightlicious> it'll revert to show the earliest date possible.

[13:48:51] <Changing_Winds> ok having some computer issues and as much as i hate to admit it i cant figure out the problem, gonna post what it is and hope that someone might be able to help me providing of course that this is the right place
[13:51:55] <Changing_Winds> Windows 7, there was a power brown out this morning that seems to have crippled my computer, first i was booting up the computer it would get to the desktop and would give me the error of C://user/Changingwinds/Desktop is corrupted or unreadable, ended up going into the recovery drive and brought up the CMD prompt and did a simple CHKDSK /f  after about 20 minutes and a bunch of corrupted files later it finished rebooted computer an
[13:53:04] <Changing_Winds> now wont boot to windows at all, startup recovery does nothing, cant system restore,  but it does go to the recovery console with no problem, turned off auto reboot on system fail and i got a blue screen, bluescreen reads:
[13:54:11] <Changing_Winds> Stop: C000021a {fatal system error} the initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000000 (0xc0000001 0x000107b0) the system has shut down
[13:55:47] <cyborg_ar> Changing_Winds: what windows version?
[13:56:04] <Changing_Winds> 7
[13:56:09] <cyborg_ar> hm
[13:56:34] <cyborg_ar> this seems to be the kind of failure that merits a reinstall
[13:56:48] <cyborg_ar> i'd get one of those utility disk and run a disk check
[13:57:10] <Changing_Winds> thats what i was afraid of, not because im worried about reinstalling but more because i dont have any real way to get a windows 7 disk
[13:57:13] <cyborg_ar> but looks like some crucial system file got corrupted
[13:57:54] <Changing_Winds> yeah thats what i was figuring, was hoping someone would tell me i am wrong though
[13:58:04] <cyborg_ar> sorry :(
[13:58:38] <cyborg_ar> did it get to do a disk check before bluescreening though?
[13:58:47] <Changing_Winds> eh its no big deal, ive been meaning to upgrade to windows 8 anyway cuz i have a product key for it while i dont have one for 7
[13:58:59] <Changing_Winds> yea i can still go into the recovery mode and run a check disk
[13:59:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> have you tried a last known good configuration 
[13:59:04] <cyborg_ar> downgrade to windows 8?
[13:59:15] <Changing_Winds> yea was the first thing i tried Shival
[13:59:29] <Changing_Winds> and cyborg only temporarally until windows 10 launches
[14:00:04] <cyborg_ar> is 10 100% compatible with windows 7 stuff?
[14:00:15] <Changing_Winds> because while part of me wants to just grabthe windows 10 insider preview i know i probrobly shouldnt
[14:00:28] <cyborg_ar> i see no reason to use windows other than 100% compatibility with existing software
[14:00:59] <cyborg_ar> and drivers
[14:01:01] <Changing_Winds> eh ill keep using windows just because of my PC games
[14:01:13] <cyborg_ar> well those are software :)
[14:01:58] <Changing_Winds> lol
[14:02:27] <Changing_Winds> and a little bit of hardware because of capture cards
[14:02:47] <cyborg_ar> anyway some of my software doesnt work on windows 8 so it's crap at being windows :)
[14:03:13] <Changing_Winds> honestly the only reason i consider using 10 is because i wanna try the XBOX remote play
[14:03:46] <cyborg_ar> anyway yeah, windows 7 recovery mode is usually pretty robust, so something pretty bad happened there
[14:04:58] <Changing_Winds> ya i mean i have hope that its not a hardware issue just because i can still get into recovery mode with no problems and i can still run normal shit using the command prompt in there such as chkdsk and i can even rebuild the MBR
[14:05:43] <Changing_Winds> so like i am guessing that when i did the chkdsk /f it deleted something that it shouldnt have
[14:06:15] <Changing_Winds> because before the chkdsk /f it was still booting at least but it was giving me the corrupted message on all user based folders
[14:09:06] <Changing_Winds> Im really not sure if i should do the windows 8 upgrade or the windows 10 insider preview upgrade does anyone have experiance with either that can give me advice?

[14:14:42] <Changing_Winds> Cyborg am i at least right in my assumption that being able to access the recovery mode and being able to chkdsk is a good sign that its a software issue and not a hardware
[14:15:44] <init3> So I know I'm in a pretty small minority of folks who got hooked on KDE after version 4 came out (and got decent). Anyone play with PLasma 5? Is it worth swtching to if I already like Plasma4?
[14:17:47] <init3> And I know I came into this late Changing_Winds, but it usually means your core hardware is alright, but not always. If there is a chance of a bad video card it letting you do that wouldn't rule that out at all usually. 
[14:18:07] <init3> So, tl;dr: maybe. 
[14:18:17] <Changing_Winds> already tried removing my video card to no avail
[14:18:44] <Changing_Winds> thats like tech support 101 remove all extra hardware
[14:18:46] <init3> Well, what is it even doing? I kind of missed that part or it is beyond my scrollback. 
[14:20:14] <Changing_Winds> condensed version is that power outage knocked out computer, was booting into windows with a message that my user folders were corrupted or unreadable, did a chkdsk /f to try and fix that through the recovery mode and it made it so the computer is in an infinate reboot loop
[14:20:47] <init3> Ew
[14:21:05] <init3> Hmm. THe computer was on?
[14:21:15] <Changing_Winds> yea there was a random brownout
[14:21:24] <init3> EWWW
[14:21:41] <init3> I fucking hat brownouts. 
[14:21:43] <init3> hate
[14:21:53] <Changing_Winds> yea
[14:22:15] <cyborg_ar> well from the first bsod message it's definititely a missing/corrupted file
[14:22:36] <Changing_Winds> that the only BSOD message
[14:22:37] <init3> I mean, it doesn't preclude just a corrupt FS, but if I were you I'd just do some hard drive diagnostic tools just to be safe.
[14:22:43] <cyborg_ar> if there was a hardware issue, the bsod would have been triggered by a driver
[14:23:11] <Changing_Winds> also tried a safemode boot and it fails on the same file every time i try it
[14:23:24] <init3> Does Windows still let you do a repair reinstall like XP did? 
[14:23:31] <cyborg_ar> if the hardware was so bad to cause init to trigger a bsod, you wouldnt be able to run chkdisk
[14:24:48] <Changing_Winds> safe mode fails on classpnp.sys
[14:25:05] <init3> How early into the boot does it fail? Like super quick?
[14:25:12] <cyborg_ar> maybe you could transplant it from another windows 7 install
[14:25:27] <Changing_Winds> umm it tries to boot for about 20 seconds before it fails
[14:25:42] <Changing_Winds> could be shorter thats just an estimate
[14:25:57] <Changing_Winds> dont have another windows computer to transplant it from
[14:26:17] <init3> What verson of 7 is it?
[14:26:39] <Changing_Winds> windows 7 home  sp1

[14:31:30] <Pony_10499> i would have no way to get it on my harddrive even if you did drop box it init
[14:31:51] <init3> Yeah. I knind of doubt it'd help anyway. 
[14:32:03] <init3> I mean you could use a linux live CD.
[14:32:08] <Pony_10499> also already checked Bios HHD controller
[14:32:23] <init3> You just try swapping it?

[14:32:31] <init3> To whatever it isn't now/
[14:32:33] <init3> ?
[14:32:48] <init3> THe power outage may have reset the BIOS.
[14:33:07] <Pony_10499> eh i just downloaded windows 10 insider, and am already writing it to a boot disk
[14:33:07] <Pony_10499> and ya i swapped it and then swapped it back
[14:33:30] <Pony_10499> Bios check was the 2nd thing i did
[14:33:35] <init3> Got ya. 
[14:33:55] <init3> I mean, a failure on that particular file could mean a ton of things. 
[14:34:11] <Pony_10499> yeah i know thats kinda why i checked in here to see if i was missing anything
[14:34:19] <init3> Right
[14:34:39] *** Pony_10499 is now known as Changing_winds
[14:34:43] <init3> I mean, I'd say just do a repair reinstall from the boot disk.
[14:35:04] <init3> But if you want to take it as an oppurnity to switch to 10 it is a damn fine one. 
[14:35:26] <Changing_winds> i know right, usually i wait till some weird failure to swap OSes anyway
[14:35:35] <Changing_winds> so maybe its just my computer telling me to feed it 10
[14:35:51] <init3> Despite how I feel about beta/unproven OSes that's your call :p
[14:36:10] <Changing_winds> way i see it 10 has to be better than 8 LOL
[14:36:25] <init3> Though I don't know if I'd rather you use 8.1 really. 
[14:36:28] <init3> Truf.
[14:36:49] <init3> You could just solve all your problems and install linux. 
[14:36:54] <Changing_winds> and if nothing else it gives me a chance to use all the windows 10 features that i wanna try out like the XBOX remote play
[14:36:59] <init3> But ya know. I may be a tad biased. 
[14:37:26] <init3> What's that?
[14:37:38] <Changing_winds> hell if it wasnt for a motherboard failure back during the windows 7 beta i would still be on windows XP
[14:37:48] <init3> Heh
[14:37:52] <Changing_winds> oh windows 10 lets you play your XBOX One games
[14:37:56] <Changing_winds> using the XBOX app
[14:38:02] <init3> Huh
[14:38:15] <init3> But I assume you still have to have an xbox eh?
[14:38:25] <Changing_winds> yea you need to have the XBONE to do it
[14:38:31] <init3> Haha
[14:38:41] <init3> Microsoft, you shiesty bastards. 
[14:39:02] <Changing_winds> init3 I am disabled so i have all 3 current gen game systems anyway because well i cant leave the fucking house and i cant work
[14:39:19] <Changing_winds> so i figure its something i can at least try out
[14:39:28] <init3> Got ya. 
[14:39:35] <init3> Shit, I'd play with it for sure. 
[14:39:51] <init3> I am just not all that into console games.
[14:39:59] <init3> Really video games in general much anymore. 
[14:40:19] <init3> Except for LoL. THat fucking game...
[14:40:23] <Changing_winds> eh video games at this point are an escape from a harsh reality for me so the more ways i can play the better
[14:40:46] <init3> They all kind of seem to blend together for me. 
[14:41:25] <init3> When I was a kid, if I got bored of a FPS I could just switch to an RTS and it'd be like doing something completely different for me.
[14:41:52] <init3> Now it is all 'video gaming' and I have a limited tolerance for how long I can usually do it. 
[14:42:09] <Changing_winds> honestly im so bored with gaming that i just downloaded a bunch of demos off the japanese PSN
[14:42:22] <init3> Heh.
[14:42:46] <init3> When I get bored I just start hacking. I think that's why I love linux so much.
[14:43:13] <init3> Flash player does some random tiny thing that is a minor annoyance?
[14:43:13] <Changing_winds> lol
[14:43:31] <init3> Open it with a hex editor and change that shit.
[14:44:00] <Changing_winds> see i cant even think about hacking, anything that could be even slightly constrewed as illegal puts me into a panic
[14:44:18] <init3> I mean hacking in the traditional sense. 
[14:44:47] <Changing_winds> hell thats the reason i dont just download a windows 7 disk
[14:44:48] <Changing_winds> lol
[14:45:16] <init3> As in 'one who hacks' not 'one who cracks infosec systems'
[14:45:52] <init3> Depends on the community but it a lot of deeper tech circles hacking does not usually mean cracking. 
[14:45:59] <init3> *in
[14:46:13] <init3> I used to do all that when I was a kid though lol. 
[14:46:41] <Seoson> Cracking != Hacking != Cheating but most people don't get that :P
[14:46:57] <init3> Smart ass 13 year old with a dial-up modem and USENET.
[14:47:33] <init3> I should have been caught so many times when I was younger. 
[14:47:50] <Seoson> ^
[14:48:07] <init3> I mean, I did use comped dial-up accounts but I wasn't hiding my phone number. 
[14:48:29] <init3> Like, caller id wasn't really a thing then so much.
[14:48:37] <init3> So I never even thought about it. 
[14:48:47] <Changing_winds> all i know init is anyone who intends to stay on windows better hope windows 10 is good since they have already said they arent going to be doing any more paid updates after 10, everything else will just be like Mac OS does with the free updates
[14:48:56] <Seoson> Oh that's like a minor thing. I did credit card fraud, used exploits on a number of websites and sold pirated software :P
[14:49:20] <init3> I was just saying how I connected. Not what I did ;P
[14:49:21] <Seoson> I used to be a very bad person I guess
[14:49:45] <init3> I thought a comped dial up account would protect me is what I mean. 
[14:49:57] <init3> While I was doing the more shady things. 
[14:50:01] <Changing_winds> i spent a little time in jail  i never wanna even think about doing that again
[14:50:18] <init3> I have too but not for computer fraud. 
[14:50:41] <init3> Kinda wish it was. Get more geek cred. 
[14:51:03] <Seoson> I didn't never even had a legal notice, but I was pretty paranoid back than also. Means I used proxies to do shady stuff.
[14:51:10] <Changing_winds> right what i went in for was more of a life destroyer than a credability harness
[14:51:22] <init3> Aye
[14:51:56] * Seoson nows wears a white hat.
[14:51:59] <init3> In my case I am having a hell of a time getting work because of that record, even though it's been 5 years now nobody will touch me. 
[14:52:00] <Seoson> now *
[14:52:19] <init3> You know my exploits as a kid were never for profit. 
[14:52:43] <init3> I just broke in, pretty much did the 'kil-roy was here' thing and left. 
[14:53:16] <Seoson> We didn't have much money than and I funded my whole IT equipment that way. 
[14:53:19] <init3> But I never fucked with financial stuff. I was too paranoid to do that. 
[14:54:26] <init3> I dunno. I was very young and from a upper middle class home so I never thought of making money with it. 
[14:54:50] <init3> Not that I was like spoiled as a child, I just never wanted for anything important. 
[14:54:53] <Seoson> Started with my mom's old machine and later had a high end gaming rig, two monitors and other valueable stuff.
[14:55:01] <init3> Haha
[14:55:26] <Seoson> When my parents started asking too many questions I stopped
[14:55:26] <init3> I get awfully tempted to put on that black hat again. Especially the longer I go without work. 
[14:56:12] <Seoson> I never hurt consumers back than either. My ethics wouldn't allow that
[14:56:49] <Seoson> That wasn't the case for companies
[14:56:55] <init3> Ahh. I think I know how you mean. 
[14:57:26] <init3> I hear it is a lot eaiser to get caught now, but I wonder if that is actually true. 
[14:58:23] <Seoson> Seeing the number of canceled payments because of "e-mail hacking" and stuff we have to do every day makes me believe it's still easy.
[14:59:36] <Seoson> However companies have invested in fraud prevention. The do browser fingerprinting and similar now.
[15:00:36] <Seoson> They* That wasn't the case when I was active. A reliable source of proxies was all I needed.
[15:01:54] <init3> What I've always had an issue with is how you go from valid cc info to cash or items. I know some people will get shit delivered to them off a stolen cc. I have no idea how they don't get caught doing that. 
[15:02:06] <init3> Suppose you could just buy bitcoins now though. 
[15:04:28] <Seoson> Never did that. Used virtual goods to transfer into real cash. However you could buy a "packstation" service on shady forums that would handle the problem for you. As far as I know they used abandoned buildings
[15:06:00] <Seoson> Also paysafecards worked really well.
[15:07:31] <Seoson> There are still on the top list of cyber criminals even though they are much harder to cash out these days. Also prepaidcredit cards with no ID attached to them.
[15:07:31] <init3> What is a packstation like a package forwarder?
[15:07:37] <Seoson> Yeah

[15:51:40] <Changing_winds> it gave me error code 0xc0000021a then it rebooted itself and worked
[15:52:02] <init3> It was giving all different kinds of error codes before?
[15:52:13] <Seoson> Also you only need one version (32 or 64) and can get all versions by editing a specific file in the iso.
[15:52:33] <Changing_winds> ive listed about 6 error codes ince i came in init
[15:53:02] <init3> I am too lazy to check the scrollback. I was just guessing based on my idea it is bad memory. 
[15:53:15] <init3> Spoiler: pretty sure it is.
[15:53:34] <init3> I mean if it works it works but I'd not bet on it staying okay. 
[15:53:36] <Seoson> If it's a randome thing it sure sounds like memory-
[15:53:45] <Changing_winds> ive gotten 0xc000021a 0xc000000001 0xc00000094
[15:53:53] <Changing_winds> and a couple others that im not scrolling back to check
[15:54:02] <init3> Those codes mean practically nothing though. 
[15:54:21] <Googie> Seoson: 
[15:54:25] <Googie> Wait, whoops
[15:54:33] <init3> It is mostly just the Windows kernel saying "What the fuck?"

[15:54:54] <Googie> The digitalRiver "official" Windows ISOs all got taken down a while back :(
[15:54:59] <init3> Which is why I suspect memory.
[15:55:05] <Changing_winds> im just gonna throw the fucking thing in the woods at this point
[15:55:10] <Seoson> Oh really? Didn't know that

[15:55:55] * Seoson still has DreamSpark
[15:56:15] <Googie> They redirect to a Microsoft page now asking if you want to do software recovery/enter your serial now.
[15:56:57] <Seoson> Yeah http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery which should work I guess.
[15:57:09] <Changing_winds> if both sticks died on me im pretty well fucked
[15:57:12] <Googie> It's a pain to wget or whatever.

[18:52:51] <Moonlightning> > Some people like to think of `self` as `.` and `super` as `..`, from many shells’ display for the current directory and the parent directory.
[18:52:53] <Moonlightning> Uh.
[18:53:03] <Moonlightning> Those are actually directory entries, though, right? >.>
[18:54:27] <mniip> every sane filesystem has . and ..  as actual directory entries
[18:58:07] <sleumas2000> is that true of NTFS?
[18:58:20] <sleumas2000> (I don't use command line on NTFS too often)
[19:03:43] <Sukasa> I'm fairly certain NTFS supports . and ..
[19:03:51] <Sukasa> at least on windows it seems to resolve them well enough
[19:06:53] <sleumas2000> fair enough
[19:07:24] <sleumas2000> I never use CMD, and I have no oppurtunity to use NTFS with a BASH shell
[19:07:46] <sleumas2000> considering I keep Windows and Linux as seperate as possible
[19:07:52] <sleumas2000> because windows is a very delicate ecosystem

[19:33:23] <Moonlightning> > The operating system couldn't be loaded because the kernel is missing or contains errors.
[19:33:27] <Moonlightning> How do you not know the difference?
[19:33:30] <Moonlightning> I hate stuff like this.
[19:33:39] <Moonlightning> “Foobar is missing or corrupt.” Well, which is it??
[19:34:11] <Moonlightning> There is a MASSIVE difference between “this file doesn't exist” and “there is something wrong with the structure I expected from this file”
