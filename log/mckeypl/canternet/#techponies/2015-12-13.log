[01:44:30] <Sombra> So I know that you can't SLI two different graphics cards.  However, can you plug both of them in, and dedicate one to physX?
[01:45:23] <Sour_Sweet> I believe you can
[01:45:38] <Sour_Sweet> same goes for CUDA iirc
[01:46:29] <Sour_Sweet> Also the fact that you cannot use two different cards in SLI is an artificial restriction by nVidia

[03:19:08] <PinkiePieBot> [ shell - Why do I have to cd out of a deleted directory? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange ]
[03:19:16] <Starthunder> So I knew the answer to this question already
[03:19:22] <Starthunder> But it kinda raises a couple more.
[03:20:51] <Starthunder> If I make a directory, change to it, then unlink it, it becomes truly empty pending deletion (i.e. even the . and .. entries are removed)
[03:21:02] <Starthunder> But I can still use .. to go up one directory
[03:21:04] <Starthunder> Wat.
[03:31:07] <tiwake> Colgate: poke
[03:32:10] <tiwake> hmm
[03:32:31] <tiwake> anyone know what the overhead is for wireless G connection?
[03:32:51] <tiwake> or have a guess at
[03:35:25] <ShivalWolf> isnt the stadnard wireless overhead like 22%
[03:36:08] <ShivalWolf> also wireless doesnt just have an overhead that causes problem
[03:36:18] <ShivalWolf> other access points or wireless on the same channls also block
[03:36:53] <ShivalWolf> as wireless CTS packets to stop/start transnmission
[03:38:31] <ShivalWolf> also bluetooth and other 2.4ghz stuff shitting all over the specturm
[03:39:10] <ShivalWolf> 802.11 has to respect bluetooth but not the other way round
[03:39:23] <ShivalWolf> so bluetooth really can mess with wireless if theres alot of it doing alot of bandwith in the area
[03:48:43] <Starthunder> On a completely unrelated note, anypony know that tall comic with a ton of nested hypotheticals?

[07:11:32] <Kinsley> I can see where they're coming from: if an object is (considered) art, then the copyrights for that art should belong to original creator and license must be granted by that creator for further, derivative use. HOWEVER.
[07:12:24] <Kinsley> If an object has utility beyond art, like a chair, or desk, or lamp, or phone or computer or whatever, then it's not really art, it's a thing you use.
[07:12:47] <Kinsley> The design may be important, yes, perhaps even the primary purpose for being, but a chair is not a painting.
[07:12:47] <HoneyDrops> But a photo of a object doesn't compete with an object.
[07:12:55] <Kinsley> Exactly.
[07:13:22] <Kinsley> Plus, I would argue for fair use: photographing a model who happens to sit in a chair, for instance.
[07:13:23] <HoneyDrops> I could maybe see an argument for a photo of a purely visual work, eg: a painting.  
[07:13:55] <HoneyDrops> Still, the basic policy should be: you can do whatever you damn well please with your things.
[07:14:00] <Kinsley> Or a photo that just contains a chair, or a video that contains a chair, but the focus is on something else.
[07:14:07] <Kinsley> ^^
[07:14:21] <tiwake> meh
[07:14:41] <HoneyDrops> Which is where European stuff like "moral rights" are silly to me.
[07:14:42] <tiwake> I need to figure out why the wireless randomly drops on one of the two bands
[07:15:34] <Kinsley> Copyright law is dumb and broken and helps no one.
[07:15:41] <HoneyDrops> You buy a copyrighted work, it's yours to modify as you please.  You can't make and distribute copies, but you should be utterly free to change your copy however you like.
[07:16:21] <Kinsley> I'd even make an argument for being able to distribute the modifications.
[07:16:48] <HoneyDrops> You should at least be free to distribute the information to allow others to replicate your modification.
[07:16:53] <Kinsley> Like an alternate dust cover for a book.
[07:17:11] <HoneyDrops> I was thinking things like patches to software.
[07:17:11] <tiwake> Kinsley: but if its a book and you change one letter...
[07:17:23] <Kinsley> Or a script that takes an ebook and modifies certain pages or words to make it interesting or highlight certain things.
[07:18:10] <Kinsley> tiwake: but if I gave you a set of instructions or pages to a book to change that book in any way, I'm not violating the copyrights of the author. The modification is separate.
[07:18:36] <tiwake> oh
[07:18:38] <tiwake> yeah
[07:18:48] <Kinsley> But if I gave those modifications to you and you applied to some other book or edition of the same book, then it might not make any sense.
[07:19:30] <tiwake> any ideas what to look for in this wireless router?
[07:21:24] <Starthunder> That creates more problems, though.
[07:21:29] <tiwake> http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Image:Acces_point.jpg
[07:21:40] <Starthunder> If you diff source code, the resulting patch includes bits of the original.
[07:22:46] <tiwake> AccessPoint is what I'm configuring, or trying to anyway
[07:23:09] <tiwake> maybe I need a different dd-wrt build
[07:26:09] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: you can do diffs that don't include the original work.  They are a bit trickier, but it's possible.
[07:28:06] <HoneyDrops> eg: Replace char# w/ X, repeat.  Just offset/change.  It only works against a very specific original, and more advanced techniques can be more robust, but the idea that you can communicate the modifications w/o the parts original work is sound.
[07:29:37] <HoneyDrops> But that aside, the very idea that someone feels they can sell me something and still have a say in how I use or modify it rubs me the wrong way.
[07:32:16] <HoneyDrops> Which is why I completely oppose DRM and any devices or software that are locked from the user (the idea that uses must exploit flaws to root phones, consoles, etc is wrong).  The user should be the /only/ arbiter of what their possessions do (or do not do, as the case may be).
[07:36:09] <Starthunder> Agreed.
[07:36:13] <Starthunder> any ideas how to make that happen?
[07:39:51] <HoneyDrops> For the foreseeable future I am not optimistic that things will change, however nor will the fact that securing devices against the user be a doomed endeavor.
[07:40:46] <HoneyDrops> There are at least still enough people who can and will break the locks, if for no other reason than the challenge of breaking them.
[07:43:22] <HoneyDrops> The lovely thing about computers is, they don't care, and there isn't any way to make them care.  They are general purpose, and any attempt to make them otherwise always amounts to an artificial lock.  And every lock will eventually be broken...
