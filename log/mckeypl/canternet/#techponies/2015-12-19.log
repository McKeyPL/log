[00:00:04] <Kinsley> A member of Bernie Sander's campaign staff was fired for accessing data on the DNC's servers that belonged to Hilary Clinton's campaign.
[00:00:12] <Moonlightning> …
[00:00:17] <Moonlightning> wait, they /fired…/
[00:00:23] <Kinsley> Yes, fired.
[00:00:26] <Colgate> mniip: some guy working for the sanders campaign found a bug that allowed them access to clinton's DBs
[00:00:26] <Moonlightning> …okay, minimal effort.
[00:00:29] <Moonlightning> THIS IS STUPID
[00:00:32] * Moonlightning drops thread
[00:00:46] <Colgate> they did a few queries, to see the scope of the vulnerability
[00:01:02] <Colgate> "Uretsky said he was trying to investigate the data issue, to see what information was vulnerable on their end, so he could adequately report it to the software company. He said his team did not export any data. He said he intentionally left a record of what he was doing in the system and did not try to hide his actions. "
[00:01:20] <Moonlightning> Anypony know how to DANE?
[00:01:37] <mniip> [01:58:19] <sortie> 'Luthor' is a kickass name for a lex(1) implementation
[00:02:00] <Moonlightning> Freenode pointed out that I need records for constructed names for every name I want the service to be accessible from
[00:02:10] <Divide|TechSupport> HahahahahahahAHAHAHA.
[00:02:15] <Moonlightning> e.g. _6697._tcp in addition to _6697._tcp.irc
[00:02:23] <Divide|TechSupport> Customer called in, asking if we can help them get access to US Netflix.
[00:02:32] <Divide|TechSupport> Nope, nope, NOPE, goodbye.
[00:02:39] <mniip> Divide|TechSupport, and you work for?
[00:02:41] <Moonlightning> …oh, I thought you were laughing at mniip
[00:02:43] <Moonlightning> disappointing
[00:02:44] <Divide|TechSupport> Rogers in Canada.
[00:02:47] <Moonlightning> ++mniip, by the way
[00:02:47] <Sour_Sweet> But U.S. Netflix <3
[00:03:04] <Divide|TechSupport> Oh, I don't disagree, but it's not something we can provide service for at aaaalll.
[00:03:06] <Kinsley> It's called a VPN.
[00:03:06] <Colgate> Divide|TechSupport: hehe, maybe they will discover VPNs, or not, probably too complicated :P
[00:03:24] <Divide|TechSupport> I'm sure they might, but they called their CANADIAN ISP asking if we can give them US Netflix.
[00:03:46] <Colgate> I can get US IPs from OVH in their CA datacenter
[00:03:49] <mniip> should've called comacast
[00:03:52] <Colgate> it isn't that impossible!
[00:04:01] <Divide|TechSupport> We can't do so legally.
[00:04:14] <Divide|TechSupport> Licensing agreements, et al.  So, no.
[00:04:48] <Kinsley> Geo-blocking based on IPs is stupid, though.
[00:04:55] <Moonlightning> …why do I always use /etc/ when listing more than one and /et al/ when using only one?
[00:04:56] <Sour_Sweet> Doing licensing with IPs is silly
[00:05:14] <Moonlightning> /foo, bar, etc/ but /foo et al/
[00:05:35] <Sour_Sweet> Go the Steam way if you want something half decent or just drop it :D
[00:05:45] <Divide|TechSupport> I concur, Sour_Sweet, but ISPs continue to do so.  And so we continue to attempt (with a very gentle touch) access... and so on and so forth.
[00:05:48] <Kinsley> Like, if I'm a US resident, and I cross the border into Canada, I can no longer access content restricted to the US. Even though Amazon ships tons of shit to me on a regular basis, even though my Netflix subscription is tied to a US billing address and a US bank issued card.
[00:06:10] <Divide|TechSupport> Kinsley: Hey, I agree.  I absolutely and completely agree.
[00:06:18] <Divide|TechSupport> I just can't do anything about it because /legal things/.
[00:06:34] <Moonlightning> DANE, anypony?
[00:07:09] <Kinsley> Moonlightning: it's actually two different things, et al is for lists of names only, et cetera is for lists of anything else. Either can be used after providing one item from a list.
[00:07:13] <Sour_Sweet> Solution: 5$ US VPN
[00:07:22] <Sour_Sweet> Or use a VPS*
[00:07:33] <Moonlightning> Kinsley: oh really o.o
[00:07:37] <Sour_Sweet> Or you could use a 3rd party VPN of cause
[00:07:45] <Moonlightning> Damn…Oxford only said //et al/ means /and others//
[00:07:59] <Sour_Sweet> But I don't feel good letting them access my traffic.
[00:08:21] <Kinsley> "and others" meaning like "Paper authored by Moonlightning, et al" when you, me, and PinkiePieBot write a paper on how shit her code is.
[00:08:40] <Moonlightning> Or, more appropriately, in citations.
[00:09:08] <Moonlightning> “Because of the blatant disregard for style (Moonlightning et al, page 42)”
[00:18:58] <mniip> et al = et alii
[00:19:08] <mniip> where alii (alius) usually refers to a person

[00:47:52] <GigaWork> why?
[00:47:57] <Moonlightning> Googie: well, with property rights in the idiotic state they are, I'm sure it can be /made/ to be illegal to e.g. change the admin password from the default

[02:10:08] <Gigabit> Because the tech guy that came out today is a fucking dumbass and EVERY little thing I have told the isp, he spewed off the same shit, and suddenly they are right
[02:10:43] <Gigabit> I asked them to put in a dish receiver instead of a nanostation. They told me it would make no difference at all, and now suddenly.. they are putting one in because the tech guy said to
[02:11:12] <JustAberrant> no idea what your exact situation is, but personally I'd just treat whatever their stuff serves up as the internet
[02:11:47] <JustAberrant> i.e. if they provide you a router/switch/wireless ap with NAT, put your own router behind it and do double NAT
[02:11:49] <Gigabit> I explained that the focal patteren is more directed with the dish and would be better for connectivity, I was told I have no clue what I am talking about and now they are doing exactly that
[02:12:49] <JustAberrant> i.e. leave their stuff untouched, but don't rely on it for anything but getting packets out to the interweb
[02:13:00] <Gigabit> I don't care if people are smarter then me, but jesus fuck, if someone is right about something, don't say they are not and provide shit service, then turn around and do exactly as was said

[02:14:28] <JustAberrant> well, in fairness that's pretty normal for any ISP
[02:14:43] <JustAberrant> like I said, best to just treat them as a pipe and do all your own actual networking
[02:14:44] <mniip> whoa
[02:14:49] <JustAberrant> and definitely using your own gear

[02:14:53] <Gigabit> even though I conversed with one of the techs that left the company (while he was employed) and he even backed me up on how I setup the network
[02:15:42] <Gigabit> Ya I know JustAberrant.. trust me I have bitched, moaned, complained many times about needing to buy a good router and the people I live with wont.
[02:16:12] <Gigabit> Also the tech tried to tell my cousins that "A virus probably is in the router" Meh could be, they arte shitty devices
[02:16:27] <JustAberrant> honestly even a shitty router that you control is better
[02:16:35] <JustAberrant> and you can get some pretty damn cheap decent routers
[02:16:44] <JustAberrant> or just get a cheap box with dual eth and run pfsense

[02:22:07] <JustAberrant> yeah, I'd say it's time to move.. preferably somewhere with non-shit internet ;p
[02:22:44] <Gigabit> Oh I had a place in mind, 118 a week everything included but, you cannot bring your own furniture of any kind, and they do not have computer desks in the rooms
[02:22:59] <Gigabit> its a bed, end table, chair, dresser
[02:23:08] <JustAberrant> that's.. a weird kinda place

[02:23:45] <ShivalWolf> sounds really dodgy
[02:23:47] <Crimson_Tail> Because 100,000 feet is just a third way up to true space
[02:24:37] <Gigabit> It's one of those, low income working persons week to week renting. No lease, booted for 2 days late payment
[02:25:00] <ShivalWolf> so is is really dodgy

I've no idea how to retrieve the OEM key, please, #techponies, you're (one of) my only hope(s)!
[13:01:19] <tiwake> Obaskyr: the hard drive died? or is it only mostly dead?
[13:01:45] <Obaskyr> died died.
[13:01:49] <tiwake> cause if its all dead the only thing you can do is go through its pockets for loose change
[13:02:37] <Obaskyr> The OEM key is written to the BIOS though isnt it, so I shouldnt need the old HDD to recover it?
[13:03:10] <tiwake> I donno... that confuses me too, about what to do if the drive dies
[13:03:27] <tiwake> but I don't need to worry about keys and licenses and stuff, cause linux
[13:04:58] <Obaskyr> I really wish I could linux, but autodesk software, PS, zbrush...
[13:13:50] <Phase> if its the right version of 8 i *think* it should pull from the bios on its own

[13:23:07] <Obaskyr> Also, what good is a program going to be when I can't install windows? :P
[13:25:40] <Phase> you can install windows
[13:25:54] <Phase> there's a grace period if you don't enter a key during the installation
[13:26:35] <Obaskyr> Up untill windows 7 you could, on 8.1 you cant advance the install without a product key  it seems.
[13:26:38] <Phase> much as i hate windows, the way they try enforce licenses these days is quite reasonable
[13:26:42] <Phase> you sure?

[17:27:06] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i.e. a coworker here used cast-to-device to play a video on his xbox one and now he is unable to delete the file because it says its in use by cast-to-device even when he is offline
[17:28:03] <Sour_Sweet> If it's just about the file you can remove the lock with certain tools
[17:29:15] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> tried using unlocker and it told us that nothing was using the file, used unlocker to attempt to delete the file, and it was unable to delete because it was in use, i selected the option to delete the file on reboot, it failed to delete, i used eraser, that failed, and we used his webroot avs shred option, and that failed

[22:12:59] <JustAberrant> depends on if you want 1g or 10g

[22:14:35] <JustAberrant> 1G stuff seems to bein the $100 range, 10g you're into the $600+ range
[22:14:44] <JustAberrant> but I imagine you can probably find cheapie and overpriced versions of each

[22:17:48] <JustAberrant> my view is probably skewed cause company I work for likes spending lots of money on stuff ;p
[22:18:28] <JustAberrant> though I've never heard of chelsio
[22:18:54] <Taloverae> The company I work for also doesn't shit on IT, and we usually get whatver we want
[22:19:32] <Taloverae> Heck, I've only ever touched an SFP module when a remote switche went down; transferred all the things into the replacement

[22:25:41] * JustAberrant was out supporting some testing out in the field and I got to replace a controller card in a cisco switch
[22:26:09] <JustAberrant> (it failed during the test and I was the only one closest to a hardware guy (I'm a programmer/systems integration guy))
[22:27:01] <JustAberrant> after the fact when they put in the procurement to replace the one from spares I got to see it
[22:27:19] <JustAberrant> ... not.. cheap
[22:27:41] <Taloverae> Yeeeep.
[22:29:52] <JustAberrant> I mean it's all markup and overhead and because they can, but yeesh
[22:30:33] <Taloverae> The price is whatever people are willing to pay...
[22:30:52] <JustAberrant> hehe
[22:31:03] <JustAberrant> well, the stuff I work on is all very complicated because it's not really our gear
[22:31:29] <JustAberrant> it's the governments, but we are responsible for it..
[22:31:40] <JustAberrant> but procurement has to go through all the RFP nonsense/etc
[22:32:21] <JustAberrant> which means pretty much only the big guys can sell anything to us because any smaller supplier can't handle the sheer amount of BS associated with it
[22:33:08] <JustAberrant> which means it is _way_ easier to buy literally millions of dollars worth of network gear from cisco than by a specialized $500 diagnostic tool from some small company
[22:33:20] <Taloverae> Mm, big companies do enough business to warrant having dedicated people to wade through the BS
[22:33:20] <JustAberrant> * buy
[22:33:58] <JustAberrant> indeed.. if your cisco or hp or dell it's worth it to get on the authorized sellers list and get all the certifications and pay someone to fill out paperwork until they lose their mind
[22:34:26] <JustAberrant> it's just ironic that the whole purpose of it all is to make it "fair", but in a lot of ways it serves the opposite purpose
[22:36:04] <Taloverae> It's extra fair to the guy who has the most favors to call on

[22:44:41] <Sombra> Question
[22:44:57] <Sombra> I have an SSD, and I want to get another SSD.  And what I want to do is... have those two SSD's appear as one partition, what do?
[22:45:18] <JustAberrant> well, first think about if that's actually what you want to do
[22:45:24] <JustAberrant> then look into raid0
[22:46:13] <Sombra> Okay, how do I do that.
[22:46:25] <JustAberrant> you google it ;p
[22:46:58] <JustAberrant> seriously, it varies from platform to platform, and there are specifics relating to what you want out of it, you'll want to read up on it
[22:48:11] <JustAberrant> your mobo might be able to do it for you (though often shitty and sometimes requires windows/drivers to work), you can do it in software (no idea what windows has, but linux has md), or you can buy a dedicated hardware card to do it (which has pros and cons)
[22:49:05] <Webster> You can also mount the second drive as a folder on the first if you want.
[22:50:41] <Sombra> Maybe I don't want to, since it'd be raid 0, surely, I'd have no disadvantages as far as speed goes to having two seperate SSD drives.
[22:51:24] <JustAberrant> with raid0 you get a speed boost, but you take a hit on reliability
[22:51:43] <JustAberrant> if either drive fails you basically lose everything
[22:52:39] <JustAberrant> which is fine if you've got backups and are willing to use them
[22:52:43] <Sombra> Also, is there any difference physically between socket 2011 and socket 2011v2? As in, would I be able to put the same heatsink/cooler between both of them?
[22:52:54] <Sombra> I have my important stuff backed up on my HDD
