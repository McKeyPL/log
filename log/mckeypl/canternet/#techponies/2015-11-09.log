[05:14:12] <Webster> Did you get this used?
[05:14:23] <Compu> i think this house has lead in it or something, even my cell phone signal drops to 2 bars when im inside
[05:14:54] <Webster> Might be the antenna was ripped off.
[05:14:56] <Compu> oh yeah i did, for free, it belonged to some guy's grandma and he didnt want it cuz he didnt use records so we got it for free
[05:14:59] <Compu> no
[05:15:04] <Compu> theres no antenna hole
[05:15:09] <Webster> It'd be a tiny hole.
[05:15:12] <Webster> Probably on the bottom.
[05:15:20] <Compu> and when i move the power cord the reception changes on fm
[05:15:25] <Webster> I have a similar unit. Same radio dial. Same three knobs. Motor burned out.
[05:15:31] <wolfyshy> Compu: concrete can do that too.
[05:15:37] <Compu> motor is fine
[05:15:53] <Webster> Might be the power cord is coupling noise or FM frequencies coincidentally.
[05:16:08] <Webster> So moving it reduces noise/increases FM signal.
[05:16:19] <Compu> Webster: not even a tiny hole
[05:16:33] <Webster> Usually they put it through a transformer so you'd lose any FM signal anyway. Unless there's some weird extra wire thing going on.
[05:16:52] <Webster> For safety certs they can't have high voltage and low voltage together.

[05:17:03] <Compu> i just looked, theres only a bunch of circular holes on the back for cooling it looks like
[05:17:34] <Compu> i can take a picture if that helps
[05:17:47] <Webster> Anyway, just saying, those are pretty shit units. Not sure about yours specifically, just they tend to be pretty miserable.
[05:17:55] <Webster> If you want.
[05:18:01] <Webster> I can go look at mine to see where the antenna comes out.
[05:18:09] <Compu> u have one?
[05:18:14] <Webster> It's literally just a 26AWG or smaller wire.
[05:18:18] <Webster> A similar one.
[05:18:22] <Compu> lemme get a pic and u can compare the backs
[05:22:15] <Webster> Nah, mine's coming out of a tiny hole in the back next to the cooling holes.
[05:22:51] <Compu> Webster: i dont have that tiny hole, 1 sec i took the pic

[05:28:17] <Webster> Similar looking back.
[05:29:02] <Webster> I've seen head phones used as an antenna replacement on phones and MP3 players that have FM playback.
[05:29:14] <Webster> AM is probably just the iron stick antenna inside.
[05:29:31] <Webster> Probably has an internal FM antenna too which is a bit shit.
[05:30:23] <Compu> :P
[05:30:29] <Compu> i dont wanna open it up
[05:30:48] * Webster shrugs.
[05:31:02] <Webster> Don't need to if you don't want.
[05:31:31] <Compu> i wish i knew an audiophile irl
[05:32:09] <Webster> From what I've seen okay record players start around $100.
[05:32:20] <Compu> yep
[05:32:23] <Compu> too expensive
