[05:39:19] <Moonlightning> It's just like any other use of %

[05:39:36] <Moonlightning> format_string % things_to_put_in_the_string
[05:39:48] <Moonlightning> If there's more than one, you make it a tuple
[05:39:55] <Moonlightning> which is weird, but that's how it is
[05:40:01] <init3> BUt I was under the impression for encryption it is designed to use LDAP or MySQL to handle password hashes for it. 
[05:40:42] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> my first experience with LDAP gave me a headache untill i figured out how to make it work the way i needed it to (started blind with no documentation >.<)
[05:41:37] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i dont see why you couldnt use something like apachee or something else besides MySQL to handle encryption, but then again any kind of encryption algorithm should be able to handle the process as long as it does the required hash/salt, how do most routers handle it
[05:41:45] <init3> I have plenty of LDAP experience, I set up about 900 servers on one because I was sick of just about everyone having root passwords to my boxes and no accountability for them fucking thwm up. 
[05:42:18] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> beware the power of a moron with adminstrative powers
[05:42:37] <init3> But I can't see a reason to run something so complex on my home server simply for wireless auth. 
[05:42:45] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> right
[05:43:07] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i think someone did a writeup on hackaday a while back where they used a ras-pi as a radius server for a guest ap
[05:43:44] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i want to say they used either apachee or nginx
[05:43:47] <init3> MEh, I've never done RADIUS before so I want to do a standard debian install. 
[05:43:57] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> thats what i did
[05:43:58] <init3> Like using HTTPS auth?
[05:44:33] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i think they had it setup like some resturants are doing now where you have to go in, enter your email address, and the server generates a temporary password thats good for 24hours and emails it back to the user
[05:44:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> so they get something like 3 minutes of internet access to check their email before the connection is killed and it requests the password to proceed to the internet
[05:45:50] <Moonlightning> You can do a lot in three minutes.
[05:45:53] <init3> Hmm.
[05:46:38] <init3> Yeah, right now I live far enough in the boonies where an open WAP is fine but I am probably going to be moving to an apartment soon so probably having some level of guest auth is going to be needed.

[06:01:39] <Gigabit> Well.. wouldn't a resistor do that too?
[06:01:50] <RazorSharpFang> Like, suppose half of the file has been read using the FILE, and fgets
[06:02:15] <RazorSharpFang> And then the second program attempts to open it using mode 'w'
[06:02:40] <init3> I am pretty sure it is going to be told to wait. It might be at the kernel level. 
[06:03:05] <RazorSharpFang> So, I don't have to worry about file contents being written over when I've opened a file for reading?
[06:03:07] <init3> Oh, actuallly. 
[06:03:18] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: no, you do have to worry abotu that
[06:03:20] <init3> Think of physical limitation of the hard drive. 
[06:03:31] <init3> The head can't be in two places at once. 
[06:03:38] <RazorSharpFang> I do have to worry about that?
[06:03:43] <init3> Well, i mean, not practically. 
[06:03:54] <Moonlightning> One of the operations will block for an instant while the head finishes what it's doing and moves over to the other place.
[06:04:17] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: say process A opens a file for reading, and reads 1 kilo.
[06:04:30] <Moonlightning> Then process B opens the file for writing with O_TRUNC
[06:04:36] <Gigabit> okay damn.. I need a resistor indeed. they are calling  it a diode but the image shows a resistor
[06:04:37] <Moonlightning> And immediately after, process A tries to read another kilo.
[06:04:46] <Moonlightning> Process A is going to get EOF, not the next kilo of what used to be there.
[06:04:46] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, that's what I was wondering about
[06:04:55] <RazorSharpFang> Holy poop, really?
[06:05:00] <Moonlightning> Yes.
[06:05:06] <Moonlightning> Files don't become copy-on-write when you open them for reading.
[06:05:13] <Moonlightning> You're not guaranteed to see the file as it was when you opened it.
[06:05:19] <RazorSharpFang> Poop.
[06:05:28] <Moonlightning> And there is no way to put a mandatory lock on a file.
[06:05:39] <RazorSharpFang> Shoot.

[06:05:43] <Moonlightning> If you're going to have readers and writers of files within your own software, you can use advisory locks, though.
[06:06:04] <Moonlightning> But if some other process comes along and decides to mess with a file…too bad. You just gotta deal with it.

[06:42:22] <init3> I'm trying to get a straight answer of what it /does/ support. 
[06:42:49] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i just looked through my wireless settings for my cards on this box, i'm not seeing LEAP by default
[06:43:13] <init3> It's gonna be under WPA3 enterprise. 
[06:43:17] <init3> err WPA2
[06:43:20] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> that'd be why i didnt see it lol
[06:43:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> my current wireless config is WPA2, TKIP, CCNP
[06:43:55] <init3> Can you see if there are any auth types for WPA2 enterprise?
[06:44:04] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> just a sec
[06:44:11] <init3> Thanks
[06:45:01] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> looks like i just have WPA, WPA2, WPA2,CCNP, WPA2 TKIP, and WPA2 AES

[06:46:35] <init3> I /think/ windows supports that out of the box. 
[06:47:15] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> you have to go into the device advanced settings in older windows to enable, but yes, all windows should support that one from NT3.0 forward
[06:47:46] <init3> Ok. Herm
[06:48:44] <init3> Do you have an option for WPA2 enterprise? You said you didn't right?
[06:48:46] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> ahh, i had to enable radius support in the adapters firmware settings
[06:48:58] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i do now
[06:49:15] <init3> hmm
[06:50:15] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i have peap and smart card auth no leap
[06:50:25] <init3> Hmm
[06:50:42] <init3> PEAP sucks because you need to get your client a certificate. 
[06:50:44] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> looks like it uses EAP-MSCHAP V2 on this box
[06:50:56] <init3> Ok, I think I can do that. 
[06:51:06] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> do you have a domain controller or workgroup?
[06:51:18] <init3> No
[06:51:27] <init3> Well, a workgroup I suppose. 
[06:51:36] <init3> A samba share is all it is really. 
[06:51:38] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> a workgroup with shares should work, something like "WORKGROUP" or "LABNET" here
[06:51:43] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> that should be fine
[06:52:09] <init3> The RADIUS server will be handling the wifi still 
[06:52:17] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> nod
[06:52:49] <init3> BUt I wonder if you need a cert for that. 
[06:53:09] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> nice "authentication methods, Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2), Enable fast reconnect, enable quarantine checks, disconnect if server does not present cryptobinding TLV"
[06:53:38] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> you can even manually tell it to connect to a server upon connection after validating the cert
[06:55:04] <init3> Hmm. Does that mean I have to give the client a cert first? Tht's a deal breaker for me. 
[06:55:34] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i wouldnt think so
[06:55:50] <Googie> MSCHAPv2 doesn't need a client cert.
[06:56:20] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i would think the client would request info from the server upon connect, the server should then hand over a cert the first time it connects and completes the handshake if i remember correctly
[06:57:20] <init3> Right, I just mean a cert for server identity.
[06:57:29] <init3> Well, we'll see

[07:20:06] <init3> GREAT SUCCESS!
[07:20:52] <init3> Protip: when testing an authentication protocol it is useful to use the right password for your testing account. 
[07:21:09] <init3> I was like Why in the fuck is this failing to auth. 
[07:21:50] <init3> Now let's see if we can make this password hashed. 
[07:22:06] <init3> (and probably something other than "password"
[07:22:12] <init3> )
[07:23:10] <Minuette> yeah, use password1, way more secure since it has a number
[07:23:24] <init3> Also, if either of you are going to try this the other thing I noticed (it may just be my AP) is that if you stop the RADIUS server, you need to restart your AP after you start it again. 
[07:23:28] <init3> Totes.
[07:23:31] <Moonlightning> For testing? Pick a random common word.
[07:23:57] <Minuette> depends on your AP, the ones we have at work can handle that
[07:24:00] <init3> Usually I actually use "derp" for testing on the LAN. 
[07:24:16] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> or P@55w0rD_1

[07:28:57] <Googie> Well, NTP doesn't really have much room for information leaks like cryptography does.
[07:29:20] <init3> But if I'm not mistaken there are some super huge prime numbers used and if you know what they are you can break the encryption much eaiser. 
[07:29:23] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> most of the standards that the NSA have a say in, have backdoors embedded that allow the NSA access

[13:04:47] <RazorSharpFang> Wouldn't your bot be configured to respond to pings?
[13:05:00] <RazorSharpFang> And I do know that canternet DOES typically do a ping request on login.
[13:05:03] <Cydie> it is
[13:05:20] <Cydie> I did put the PING command
[13:05:23] <Googie> If you don't respond to the initial ping, you can't complete registration.
[13:05:50] <Cydie> PonyChat worked though
[13:05:57] <RazorSharpFang> That's tripped me a few times, Googie.
[13:06:04] <Cydie> here's the code tho
[13:06:07] <Googie> Yes, they use a different IRCd.
[13:07:04] <Googie> We've got m_conn_waitpong loaded, which won't allow for registration to complete until after the initial ping has been responded to.

[13:12:25] <RazorSharpFang> Bleeeh
[13:12:42] <Cydie> Phase: yet it disconnects
[13:12:59] <Cydie> i dunno what Googie said
[13:13:03] <RazorSharpFang> Make it dump all received traffic to a file.
[13:13:09] <RazorSharpFang> Inspect it.

[13:13:22] <PinkiePieBot> [ RFC 2812 - Internet Relay Chat: Client Protocol ]
[13:13:22] <johnsey> read it.
[13:14:07] <Cydie> canternet uses this rfc?
[13:14:35] <RazorSharpFang> Uhh, isn't that the IRC Protocol itself?
[13:14:40] <RazorSharpFang> Everyone uses it.
[13:15:06] <Phase> http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459 actually
[13:15:08] <PinkiePieBot> [ RFC 1459 - Internet Relay Chat Protocol ]

[13:19:33] <Phase> registration looks the same as normal
[13:19:38] <Phase> you DO need to respond to a PING
[13:20:01] <Cydie> so i do PING?
[13:20:13] <RazorSharpFang> No, PONG.
[13:20:13] <RazorSharpFang> Ping -> Pong
[13:20:17] <RazorSharpFang> It's all part of the game.
[13:20:59] <Cydie> i really don't know to explain this is python cide
[13:21:00] <Cydie> *code
[13:21:06] <Phase> Cydie, http://i.imgur.com/QR2VtfD.png
[13:21:18] <RazorSharpFang> Look, it's going to say PING SOMESTRINGHERE
[13:21:29] <RazorSharpFang> You need to say PONG SOMESTRINGHERE
[13:21:32] <Phase> ignore the CAP lines, what's important is the PING from the server, and the PONG in response
[13:21:34] <Phase> ^ RazorSharpFang
[13:22:13] <RazorSharpFang> This is the computer equivalent of saying: "If you exist, say 'I am a loser' " *pause* "I am a loser" >: )
[13:22:16] <Phase> Cydie, which exists to stop clients that don't actually implement irc, such as the one you're writing :P
[13:22:24] <Phase> that particular ping anyway
[13:22:42] <Phase> pre-registration ping is one way to block http post spam, or similar attacks
[13:23:00] <ShivalWolf> yeah the irc post thing was fun
[13:23:40] <Phase> chary/shadow/elemental have a POST command that disconnects you if used pre-reg
[13:24:36] <ShivalWolf> seems pointless now days to code up irc connection yourself
[13:24:40] <ShivalWolf> twisted works fine
[13:24:54] <johnsey> unless you wanna use python3
[13:24:55] <ShivalWolf> its evil

[13:37:46] <Phase> Cydie, also a PING message need not have a :
[13:38:23] <Phase> infact no message need have a :
[13:38:46] <Phase> could omit the : from your USER message for example
[13:38:48] <RazorSharpFang> ShivalWolf: I'm the opposite of a fridge in my build.
[13:39:09] <ShivalWolf> RazorSharpFang: more a lightbulb or a toaster?

[13:39:37] <RazorSharpFang> ShivalWolf: I'm more a lamppost. Tall and skinny.
[13:40:13] <ShivalWolf> RazorSharpFang: hmmm an IoT lamp post

[13:47:40] <Princess_AppleDash> Also that code is not the best, that's not really how your supposed to parse IRC lines (also that's not the correct way to find if a string contains another string)  @ Cydie
[13:48:19] <Cydie> any best code? that's the only pattern i know
[13:49:20] <Princess_AppleDash> If you want to do something basic you can tokenize the string on whitespace using split() and go from there
[13:49:39] <Princess_AppleDash> Personally I'd use an IRC line parsing library
[14:14:28] <Princess_AppleDash> Would anyone be interested in buying a system with an i5 2320, 16GB of RAM, no GPU, and 2TB HDD? If so, how much? What if I threw in a GPU like a 750Ti? (I'm not selling, I'm just wondering if in general it would be worth selling)
[14:24:20] <roflin> woops I accidentally a whole overflow, now I understand why it didn't work with certain configurations...
[14:32:25] <Princess_AppleDash> What
[14:37:27] <roflin> I tried storing a value much larger 2x10^9 in an int... so sometimes i would get negative numbers for a duration... which are invalid.
[14:37:57] <roflin> not to mention is actually Undefined what happens when signed numbers overflow.
[14:38:13] <roflin> in c++ that is.
[16:02:55] <RazorSharpFang> I assume it's up to the dev to prevent rollover issues
