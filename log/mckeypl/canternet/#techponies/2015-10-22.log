[00:48:54] <Static_Breeze> All right, got a question here. I've been going through thread stuck in device driver blue screens since I upgraded to windows 10 and it usually happens when I'm watching long videos or watching videos for an extended duration. Usually when a headset is plugged in. I've updated all my drivers since this issue started occurring, how can I figure out what the source of the problem is?
[00:49:52] <Colgate> not really, probably a driver incompatability with windows 10
[00:50:01] <Colgate> all you can do is eitehr update or revert drivers
[00:50:58] <roflincopter> maybe the bluescreen contains a reference to the .sys causing the problem hence the driver causing the problem?
[00:51:04] <roflincopter> if you have mini dumps enabled you should be able to read them using a program.
[00:51:12] <roflincopter> but I gotta get some sleep now.
[00:51:15] <Colgate> sure, you can figure out what driver is causing the problem
[00:51:23] <Static_Breeze> Would it be easier for me to just reformat back to 8.1? Or would that possibly screw me over further? How would I activate the mini dumps?
[00:52:01] <wolfyshy> Static_Breeze: do you have a file named C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP
[00:52:21] <Colgate> computer > properties > system properties > advanced > startup and recovery > write debugging information
[00:52:30] <Colgate> damn I hate guis
[00:52:35] <Colgate> so many steps -.-
[00:52:39] <wolfyshy> that feel
[00:52:53] <wolfyshy> anyway, if you can get a .dmp file out of your computer, when I finish work I will help
[00:52:59] <wolfyshy> it is straightfoward but long.
[00:53:01] <Colgate> that's where it is on win7, can't say for sure on any other OS :P
[00:53:29] <wolfyshy> Colgate: it's okay, I'm sure there is some equally cryptic powershell command for it
[00:53:31] <Static_Breeze> I found the file but have nothing to open it with.
[00:53:35] <roflincopter> can confirm its still the default in win 10
[00:53:43] <wolfyshy> Set-DumpState -Computer local -DumpType 1 -Enabled True
[00:53:45] <wolfyshy> or something
[00:53:47] <roflincopter> %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP
[00:53:51] <wolfyshy> note I pulled that out of my butt
[00:54:09] <wolfyshy> any similarity to real powershell, living or dead, or purely coincidental
[00:55:19] <Colgate> you might be able to find something in event viewer as well
[00:55:23] <Static_Breeze> Okay my computer already has the dump auto enabled.
[00:55:33] <Colgate> just filter for critical events, that would show it if it exists
[00:55:47] <wolfyshy> I thought STOPs were Errors, not Criticals
[00:55:59] <wolfyshy> Criticals are usually logged by like, nmi and pcie_serr
[00:56:16] <wolfyshy> both of which I have seen on server-grade hardware running 2008r2...
[00:56:29] <Colgate> well, I mean
[00:56:40] <Colgate> if the computer halts because of it
[00:56:47] <Colgate> I would *hope* that would be classified as critical
[00:58:58] <wolfyshy> http://techfiles.de/dmelanchthon/images/HyperVR2Bugcheck0x00000101_C4C4/Bugcheck.png
[00:59:00] <wolfyshy> Error.
[00:59:26] <wolfyshy> the only Critical would be "The system has been booted after shutting down improperly" from Kernel-Power
[00:59:31] <wolfyshy> I was a windows admin for 10 years
[00:59:42] <wolfyshy> and I hated every minute of it, for reasons like that :P

[08:17:26] <Googie> I'm not really sure why that would be more of a push. cgroups aren't inherently bad, and that directory is basically the cgroup equivalent to /proc
[08:19:51] <Googie> If you explore it, you can see all the processes's groups running under their user's cgroups running under the systemd cgroup.

[11:58:06] <Stik> sup
[12:06:56] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> hows it going
[12:11:11] <Stik> feeling grumpy at work
[12:11:15] <Stik> boss is being irritating again
[12:12:09] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> sounds like most supervisor/managment positions
[12:12:30] <Stik> yup :(
[12:12:43] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] offers Stik a hug
[12:14:08] * Stik returns hug
[12:14:21] <Stik> i will sit here and grumble silently at her
[12:14:52] <Stik> i just always feel like manager jobs could be done by someone on about a quarter of the pay
[12:15:05] <Stik> and perhaps then they wouldn't think they were so great and would just manage things quietly
[12:15:20] <Stik> their job is to organise, not design or dictate or plan technical work
[12:15:36] <Stik> her role is to make sure i have the things i need to get on with my work
[12:16:04] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> sounds like here
[12:16:47] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the seargant at this post is good, its the major that you have to watch out for, he tends to look for /any/ excuse to complain and refuse to give us a raise in pay
[12:17:21] <Stik> sucks :(
[12:17:39] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> this time its because we neglected to inform him that we had recieved a new building, and that one of our officers is complacent in his work
[12:18:33] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i.e., he neglected to secure two external doors, that would have allowed an unauthorized individual complete access to the front offices and engineering areas

[16:50:39] <RainbowHacks> damn
[16:51:02] <RainbowHacks> i get 23 gigs of full lte and then unlimited deprioritized (not throttled) LTE o.o
[16:52:53] <Sour_Sweet> I get 2GiB and pay an awful lot for that :P
[16:53:16] <johnsey> 23 GB? that sounds suspiciously like sprint
[16:54:29] <johnsey> at least you got the FCC in the US
[16:54:52] <RainbowHacks> johnsey, T-Mobile, actually.
[16:55:14] <Sour_Sweet> O_o
[16:55:36] <Sour_Sweet> Why don't they offer such service in their home country? -.-
[16:55:39] <johnsey> ah, missed the part in the news where it said that it's the same limit t-mobile has
[16:56:13] <johnsey> Sour_Sweet: because nobody here complains loudly enough.
[16:56:35] <johnsey> and if you switch to a different carrier, you end up with the same caps
[17:00:44] <Sour_Sweet> data caps here are even getting lower. When mobile internet started to become a thing you'd be able to get 10 GiB. Those times are over ....
[17:02:59] <johnsey> because data usage is going up and it's easier than ever to make money by making people pay for temporary upgrades
[17:04:32] <RainbowHacks> Sour_Sweet, because T-Mobile USA is technically an independant company, though Deutsche Telekom is the majority shareholder o.o
[17:04:58] <RainbowHacks> caps came back in the states for a bit but they're going away again
[17:05:18] <RainbowHacks> tmobile doesnt even throttle you down anymore. they just deprioritize the traffic, if you have the unlimited plan.
[17:05:28] <RainbowHacks> (if you have a capped plan, yeah, you get bumpd down to 3G)
[17:08:01] <Sour_Sweet> ISPs need to die a horrible death. Mobile data plans are a joke here ...
