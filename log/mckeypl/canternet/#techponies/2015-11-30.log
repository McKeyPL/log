[00:04:54] <mniip> init3, well there you are
[00:05:05] <init3> Ok yay
[00:05:10] <init3> o3o
[00:05:33] <mniip> oεo indeed
[00:05:38] <init3> I thought it would be weird for that same nick to be on a different network. 
[00:06:01] <mniip> I use this username consistently across all places
[00:06:15] <mniip> in fact the only places where I use something else are the ones who disallow 5-letter nicknames
[00:07:37] <init3> init3 is something I came up with within the last 2 or so years. I registered jasonvw on freenode like 3 years ago and never bothered to make an alt nick. Also that's my username on a lot of linux forums and I don't mind being messaged on freenode if someone wants to talk to me. 
[00:10:05] <mniip> now I'm trying to recall where else have I seen you
[00:10:44] <init3> On freenode or a different network?
[00:11:51] <init3> Let's see. I'm init3 on Canternet, Foonetic, irchighway (only because of #fimfiction) and ponychats.net. jasonvw on freenode only. 
[00:13:09] <mniip> <init3> On the other hand.. it /does/ involve sentient ice cream cones so I'm not sure if that;'s terrible enough to be funny or just plain terrible.

[00:14:53] <mniip> and here I am existentialising about how another 2 years have slipped past
[00:15:17] <init3> Oh geez my "Cadence tries to take over the world in collusion with Wal-Mart and ice cream" dream
[00:16:19] <init3> Hehe I used to chat a lot on #equestriadaily but mostly talk in other channels nowadays, though I am always in there. 
[00:17:51] <mniip> welp
[00:17:55] <mniip> we talked in 2013
[00:20:26] <mniip> something about distinguishing VPSes from hardware servers
[00:20:38] <mniip> [14:29:52] <init3> It's a linux box?

[00:27:26] <init3> I lost my original nick registration but I am like 90% sure my first logon was July 3rd 2012

[01:10:29] <Seoson> I sure there is one
[01:10:37] <Seoson> Probably quite a lot actually
[01:11:00] <Seoson> And thanks to the way web browsers work I can access all of them
[01:11:09] <JustAberrant> will a browser let you do that, I thought it would restrict it to logic.harvard.edu
[01:11:20] <Seoson> You can set the domain
[01:11:35] <Seoson> If you're under the same main tld
[01:12:00] <Seoson> Also you can submit POST and GET requests via JS and fetch their result
[01:12:22] <JustAberrant> doesn't that have to be explicitly set in the cookie though @ domain
[01:12:30] <JustAberrant> which.. ok.. maybe they do..

[03:50:39] <Phase> yeah, it's a symlink
[03:51:09] <Moonlightning> It should become a regular file if the original gets unlinked :o
[03:51:14] <Googie> I don't think it's a regular symlink.
[03:51:25] <Moonlightning> how do you have an irregular symlink?
[03:51:37] <Moonlightning> I mean, it's a different part of the system that resolves them, right?

[14:50:04] * Dashie snugs
[14:50:16] <Moonlightning> I asked the /channel/ to read it. Nopony has. ;-;
[14:50:27] <Moonlightning> well, at least, nopony's /said/ they have
[14:50:42] <Moonlightning> and if you don't say anything, how'm I supposed to know
[14:51:29] <Moonlightning> mniip: if you want it to be under /part, then add an argument (a /proper/ argument) to /part indicating voluntary vs forced, and deprecate /kick
[14:51:48] <Moonlightning> The long arguments are not intended for machine parsing.
[14:52:00] <Dashie> i took a peek last night o.o
[14:52:14] <Moonlightning> And? o3o
[14:53:50] <mniip> [16:48:10] <Moonlightning> But then /users/ can fake that, which isn't good either.

[14:56:20] <Moonlightning> Still, it adds complexity and defeats the purpose of having a separate command.
[14:56:38] <Moonlightning> Also, that's not a /request./ :V

[14:56:45] <Moonlightning> /remove can't.
[14:57:02] <mniip> it's a request to the server

[20:06:49] <Gigabit> So Amazon is offering unlimited* storage to the cloud for 5$
[20:07:14] <Gigabit> the conditions are, the files have to be music video or pictures
[20:07:37] <Gigabit> now.. can't you disguise a compressed folder as one of those? 
[20:10:10] <Stik> probably
[20:10:16] <Stik> seems like they'd call bs if they caught you tho
[20:10:21] <Stik> and then you've lost all your stuff :)
[20:10:55] <Gigabit> thats what backups are for
[20:12:18] <Stik> i suppose you could try and encode your data into legitimate image
[20:12:27] <Stik> there's a name for that isn't there, steganography or something
[20:12:52] <Gigabit> I dunno, I know I am a cheap bitch and if I can save data I do it
[20:13:13] <Gigabit> Hell I saved almost 10 bucks yesterday on a logitech gamepad f310 by pricwe matching at walmart
[20:13:23] <Stik> although you'd be stuck if they decide to resample everything for you :)
[20:13:44] <Stik> i've got to that age now where saving money starts to seem less important than saving time :(

[20:19:09] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: most box cleanup software is crapware
[20:19:23] <Moonlightning> apparently
[20:19:50] <Moonlightning> You wanna reclaim space…Windows has a thing; on other OSes, do it by hoof
[20:19:53] <Gigabit> I have a key for advance system optimizer. Lifetime license 
[20:20:02] <Moonlightning> [11:19:09] <+Moonlightning> Gigabit: most box cleanup software is crapware
[20:20:18] <Gigabit> Ya, I know most is
[20:20:20] <Moonlightning> Wanna save money? Sell the key for slightly under retail price.
[20:20:25] <Moonlightning> And do cleanup by hoof.
[20:20:32] <Sour_Sweet> CCleaner and Adwcleaner for Windows, nothing for Linux on my part ;-)
[20:20:35] <Moonlightning> Know your filesystems.
[20:20:41] <Gigabit> That's why I only use one. Couldn't remember the name until I found my text file with the key in it
[20:20:44] <Moonlightning> Know where your caches et al are, and drop them
[20:20:54] <Moonlightning> by hoof
[20:21:15] <Gigabit> I didn't but this, I was "given" it as compensation for being tucked out of 2 months pay
[20:21:57] <Sour_Sweet> Adwcleaner is quite useful though. Windows installer love to drop a bug or two
[20:22:07] <Gigabit> Actually I liberated the license from illegal useage at the repair shop I worked.
[20:22:07] <Sour_Sweet> installers*

[20:28:48] <mniip> in other news
[20:28:56] <mniip> I made an ANSI escape code -> IRC color code converter
[20:29:11] <Gigabit> It was illegal that the boss was using the license on every computer that came into the store when it was a one PC license.  So when it came time to renew the license I applied it to the store card, sent the email to mine and saved the new license for myself, which it has only been used on PC since renewing it

[20:30:27] <Moonlightning> Regardless, it's illegal to withhold pay like that…
[20:30:28] <mniip> that was vim output

[20:30:56] <Moonlightning> what is this, codegolf?
[20:30:58] <mniip> yes
[20:31:08] <Moonlightning> …really? :o
[20:31:13] <mniip> I had to find some oneliner
[20:31:31] <mniip> I could paste htop screendumps, but they would be a bit too big
[20:32:37] <Gigabit> Ya I know it is Moonlightning, the bastard owes me like 4000 
[20:32:48] <Gigabit> I was the one that got it withheld from me
