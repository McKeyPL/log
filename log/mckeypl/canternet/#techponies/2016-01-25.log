[00:35:16] <Sour_Sweet> Yay LE automation works ... NOT. Got a lovely mail on my root account that the cronjob failed to issue a new cert(Sanity checks I put in place failed, so it send a mail). Turns out I'm not the only one having issues and it looks like they messed something up server side. Official response on the forums says just "try again" (which admittedly works at least after a few tries), but how am I
[00:35:17] <Sour_Sweet> going to tell my cronjob just to "try again"? I guess now I have to make it periodically check if all things are alright which will cost me another few hours. God long cert lifetimes were easy :P

[11:42:44] <Moonlightning> > The Super key refers to several different keys throughout keyboard history. Originally the super key was a modifier key on the Space-cadet keyboard. Recently "Super key" has become an alternative name for the Windows key when using Linux or BSD operating systems or software that originated on these systems.[1]
[11:42:46] <Moonlightning> ...what?
[11:42:50] <Moonlightning> No, you've got that backwards.
[11:43:16] <Moonlightning> //"Windows key"// is an alternative name for the //super// key.
[11:43:25] <Gladiolus> Not to most people.
[11:43:39] <Moonlightning> No, this is objective.
[11:43:43] <Gladiolus> The windows key has seperate origins anyway, IBM keyboards before 95 don’t have it.
[11:43:52] <Moonlightning> It's like saying /photocopier/ is an alternative name for /Xerox machine/ :V

[17:50:14] <Moonlightning> What's the leading u for?
[17:50:17] <Crimson_Tail> But it might be something like rxvt-unicode or something
[17:50:23] <Crimson_Tail> Leading u is for unicode
[17:50:27] <Moonlightning> Ahh.
[17:50:46] <Crimson_Tail> It's pretty much the same as rxvt but works with unicode
[17:51:12] <Moonlightning> So it's probably just rxvt with a `unicode` useflag or something
[17:51:49] <mniip> * x11-terms/rxvt-unicode
[17:53:23] <Moonlightning> Ahh, missed that. Thanks. ^.^
[17:54:31] <Crimson_Tail> Also its appearance depends on the .Xdefault file if any
[17:55:16] <Moonlightning> What's iso-14755?

[22:30:02] <Not-Renny> Your memory is borked .-.
[22:30:15] <Quindo> I think I found the issue
[22:30:17] <Not-Renny> That is actually what my brain does half the time
[22:30:37] <Not-Renny> Or more than half the time... What went wrong?
[22:30:43] *** CyberJacob is now known as zz_CyberJacob
[22:30:46] <Quindo> this environment creates a #%@$# ton of metadata files.
[22:30:59] <Quindo> And the raid these are on is FAT32 or something.
[22:31:15] <Quindo> so it is bloating the 2 KB files up to 32KB
[22:32:17] <Not-Renny> Well if you know any fixes for this that would also work on people brains, let me know.

[23:09:52] <Moonlightning> Or that, but then you need app-level support for it

[23:10:24] <Moonlightning> and appending to a file in an archive without rewriting the archive needs support archive-format-level support
[23:10:27] <Moonlightning> and also sounds generally hard
[23:11:12] <Quindo> In a 3 man company you do not need that much automation
[23:11:28] <Quindo> rather, we will just change our bahaviour .
[23:17:03] *** Joins: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there)
[23:32:10] <Moonlightning> Well, my original solution just means changing filesystems
[23:32:20] *** Quits: Duck (Duck@non.stop.nyan.cat) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:32:31] <Moonlightning> /nah, we'll just change our behavior/ is also a redflag for me :I
[23:32:47] <Moonlightning> On a completely unrelated note, I pulled the disk from my old laptop, and holy /shit/
[23:32:49] <Moonlightning> it's light as fuck
[23:32:57] <Quindo> so,
[23:33:07] <Quindo> the thing about changing the filesystem is this...
[23:33:12] <Moonlightning> Like...this SATA-USB thing I have is heavier than the actual disk
[23:34:15] <Moonlightning> It's fuckkin' silent, too. If I put my ear /right up next to it/, I can just /barely/ hear this little broken whine
[23:34:48] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:34:49] <Quindo> So yes.  changing the file system might fix this issue.
[23:35:10] <Moonlightning> What filesystem are you currently using?
[23:35:32] <Moonlightning> I feel like the exts /probably/ handle tons of tiny files well?
[23:35:51] <Moonlightning> ...actually, isn't the block size or whatever 4 KiB? I'm pretty sure it's 4 KiB.
[23:36:17] <Quindo> mmmm the raid is not telling me what type of file system it is using
[23:36:22] <Moonlightning> ...
[23:36:32] <Quindo> it is an external raid enclosure
[23:38:58] <Quindo> So, I would rather change a small bit of the project archival process, then to "Take down all network storage, reformat all network storage, restore network storage from backups"

[23:41:41] <Quindo> Moonlightning Keep in mind, this is NOT a proper server rack or anything like that.
[23:42:15] <Moonlightning> :I
[23:42:39] <Quindo> if any parts of this system were none internal, I would totally be agreeing with you.
[23:45:06] <Moonlightning> Ooh. The disk is lukewarm now.
[23:45:17] <Quindo> :O
[23:47:18] <Moonlightning> whoa, trippy...
[23:47:27] <Moonlightning> If I run a finger over the surface of the disk, it feels like it's vibrating
[23:50:16] <Gladiolus> wolfyshy, I might be interested in a g3 processor now
[23:50:34] <Gladiolus> not willing to spend much but if I can boost this 300mhz to 600 and still keep os8.6 hey cool
[23:50:45] <Moonlightning> Uh-oh. I hope I have enough space.
[23:51:18] <Quindo> Moonlightning What are you doing?
[23:51:30] <Moonlightning> Dumping my old laptop's disk.
[23:52:11] <Moonlightning> Context: laptop died; jumping through hoops to get my stuff back because Apple vendor lock-in
[23:52:15] <Gladiolus> or 450 is as fast as they got i gess
[23:52:33] <Gladiolus> lol to my 2016 brain 300 to 450 seems like nothing but that’s a 50% improvement
[23:53:23] <Moonlightning> hmm...stuff inside my tmux session is lagging
[23:53:30] <Moonlightning> kinda
[23:53:40] <Moonlightning> though tmux itself isn't (at least not the clock)
[23:54:25] <Moonlightning> > Data, single: total=305.00GiB, used=146.58GiB
[23:54:35] <Moonlightning> And about 152 GiB left to copy. Man, this is gonna be close.
[23:59:51] <johnsey> Moonlightning: if you pick up the disk and tilt it in all directions, you can feel some awesome gyroscopics on top of the vibrarions!
