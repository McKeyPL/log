[02:46:53] <AppleDash> I'm just wondering if either situation would cause problems
[02:46:59] <AppleDash> I despise checked exceptions
[02:47:13] <JustAberrant> pff, they are an awesome tool if wielded properly ;p
[02:47:18] <AppleDash> Like, my fucking new URL("http://google.com") is NEVER going to throw a fucking invalidurlexception or whatever

[02:47:28] <AppleDash> So I'd rather just make my method throws Exception and be done with it
[02:47:48] <JustAberrant> yeah see that's using it poorly ;p
[02:48:00] <AppleDash> lol
[02:48:08] <AppleDash> It's not my fault that Java uses it internally
[02:48:47] <JustAberrant> generally there's a higher level base exception you can catch when you end up in a situation like that
[02:48:47] <Moonlightning> let uri = Uri::new("https://www.google.com/").unwrap();
[02:48:48] <PinkiePieBot> [ Google ]
[02:49:06] <JustAberrant> where you have a bunch of pidly exceptions that you want to handle in the same way
[02:49:49] <AppleDash> I don't want to handle them
[02:50:01] <AppleDash> The best handler would be a System.exit(0) because everything's fucked anyways if that happens
[02:50:14] <JustAberrant> sigh ;p
[02:50:27] <Moonlightning> sure, exit SUCCESSFULLY in that case.
[02:50:33] <Moonlightning> best thing to do, //obviously//
[02:50:56] <JustAberrant> in the _odd_ case where that's legitimate (Thread.sleep and similar) I usually create wrappers in some Utilities class
[02:51:18] <AppleDash> Yeah, I've already wrapped Thread.sleep()
[02:51:24] <AppleDash> Because that throwing an exception is not OK
[02:51:33] <AppleDash> I have a wrapper for making a new URL, too
[02:51:40] <AppleDash> But my IDE complains that "the return value may be null"
[02:51:43] <JustAberrant> it sounds like you're doing it wrong ;p
[02:51:49] <AppleDash> Which is even worse because it makes shit yellow
[02:51:49] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[02:51:53] <Moonlightning> Step one: stop using Java
[02:51:59] <AppleDash> I don't want to be using Java

[02:52:42] <AppleDash> I expect daily progress updates.
[02:52:48] <JustAberrant> python is a fucking mess comparatively, I'll take the annoyance of being forced to do something with errors rather than the ability to effortlessly or even unintentionally ignore them
[02:53:04] <JustAberrant> seriously though, you have to understand the core benefit of exceptions
[02:53:07] <JustAberrant> namely...
[02:53:10] <JustAberrant> try {
[02:53:15] <JustAberrant> / a whole bunch of code
[02:53:33] <JustAberrant> catch (SomeException e} { 
[02:53:38] <JustAberrant> / common way of handling errors
[02:53:39] <JustAberrant> }
[02:53:43] <JustAberrant> that's what makes them powerful
[02:53:45] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: error: catch without try
[02:54:01] <AppleDash> I get that, JustAberrant
[02:54:04] <AppleDash> Exceptions are fine
[02:54:09] <Moonlightning> also, you've got a few stray `/`s in there
[02:54:10] <AppleDash> /CHECKED/ exceptions are not
[02:54:16] <JustAberrant> vs the c method of 10 million if statements
[02:54:45] <AppleDash> If I, as a programmer, know that a certain exception will NEVER happen unless the universe has MAJOR issues
[02:54:48] <Sour_Sweet> But I love 10kk if statements :D
[02:54:49] <AppleDash> I shouldn't have to catch it
[02:55:11] <AppleDash> I have the logs from this application for the past 3 years in its data directory
[02:55:19] <AppleDash> Every error message is verbose
[02:55:23] <JustAberrant> meh, the _huge_ pile of c++ code that fails in horrific ways because devs didn't deal with some exception to me is enough proof that requiring exceptions to be dealt with is a good thing
[02:55:26] <AppleDash> If I grep for half of them I bet they don't show up
[02:55:35] <AppleDash> Because they have never happened and will never happen
[02:55:46] <Moonlightning> let uri = { match Uri::new("https://www.google.com/") { Ok(uri) => uri, Err(_) => unreachable!() } };
[02:55:46] <PinkiePieBot> [ Google ]
[02:56:20] <JustAberrant> most programmers are idiots, and even the ones who arn't make mistakes, the more a language forces (or at least reminds) the programmer to do the right thing the better imo
[02:57:18] <AppleDash> But it's not the right thing
[02:57:41] <Sour_Sweet> Which in case of Java means every exception is written to the log. Thanks to a shitty program my 1.8 TiB HDD filled up in 3 days.
[02:57:43] <JustAberrant> the phrase "that could never happen" is a huge red flag
[02:58:06] <AppleDash> Please
[02:58:17] <AppleDash> Tell me when new URL("http://google.com") will ever throw an exception
[02:58:17] <PinkiePieBot> [ Google ]
[02:58:18] <JustAberrant> and the _rare_ case where it's true doesn't justify taking away that safety net
[02:58:35] <Phase> AppleDash, what language?
[02:58:38] <AppleDash> Java
[02:59:14] <JustAberrant> 3 years from now they decide to change http:// to somethingelse://
[02:59:19] <Sour_Sweet> We could all agree on reversing domains and using com.google instead :D
[02:59:20] <JustAberrant> unlikely but could happen
[02:59:33] <Phase> isn't URL the one that does a dns request as part of equality?
[02:59:35] <AppleDash> then they will probably keep in backwards compatability
[02:59:43] <AppleDash> Phase: I'd hope it doesn't
[02:59:49] <JustAberrant> probably but not guarenteed
[02:59:54] <Phase> URL is the one that does a dns request as part of equlity
[03:00:06] <AppleDash> I don't equal it
[03:00:08] <AppleDash> I just use it
[03:00:13] <Phase> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29
[03:00:14] <PinkiePieBot> [ URL (Java Platform SE 7 ) ]
[03:00:31] <Sour_Sweet> a URL does not need to have a valid domain. Why would it do that?
[03:00:38] <Phase> java.net.URI is the replacement without the stupid
[03:00:43] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: either way, MalformedURLException derives from IOException, which if you are doing anything with the URL you probably need to catch anyway
[03:00:55] <Phase> Sour_Sweet, if the domain name in two urls refers to the same ip, they're considered equal
[03:00:58] <AppleDash> Or I can just throws Exception
[03:01:03] <AppleDash> Because if the GET to the URL fails
[03:01:08] <AppleDash> then the app can't continue anyways
[03:01:27] * JustAberrant sighs..
[03:01:42] <JustAberrant> you should have some graceful way of handling a fatal error
[03:01:46] <Sour_Sweet> Phase: I don't know java, but that sounds messed up.
[03:01:48] <AppleDash> Sure
[03:01:58] <JustAberrant> throwing an unchecked exception so the JVM shuts down isn't exactly a good one
[03:02:00] <Phase> AppleDash, the compiler (Especially the java compier) can't know that a fixed string is valid at compile time for URL's constructor
[03:02:02] <Sour_Sweet> Well I don't know much Java ;-)
[03:02:13] <AppleDash> In main(), try { doAllTheShit(); } catch (Exception e) { log(e); cleanup(); exit(); }
[03:02:20] <Sour_Sweet> I've written a thing or two but I doesn't count really
[03:02:30] <Phase> AppleDash, also it will throw an exception if the http protocol isn't registered on that machine for whatever reason
[03:02:31] <AppleDash> Phase: I am aware
[03:02:35] <AppleDash> But I, the programmer, knows
[03:02:55] <JustAberrant> that attitude is the reason for much of the shitty code out there..
[03:02:56] <Phase> so there are situations where it can throw an exception
[03:03:05] <Phase> however unlikely they are

[03:03:38] <JustAberrant> to put things into perspective, it's what pretty much every PHP programmer says when you bring up how shitty PHP is
[03:03:52] <JustAberrant> you're basically coding java with the mentality of a PHP coder
[03:04:03] <AppleDash> But I don't like PHP for various reasons
[03:04:06] <Phase> exception specifiers are a pain
[03:04:28] <JustAberrant> "loose typing and lack of any sane error handling is fine because I just won't make any mistakes!!" == wordpress
[03:04:43] <AppleDash> lol
[03:04:51] <AppleDash> I'm saying like
[03:05:04] <AppleDash> If I have a string constant that I know to be a valid URL that is being used to initialize a URL object
[03:05:04] * Phase wants more powerful type systems (in particular overloading) for writing cleaner code
[03:05:12] <AppleDash> I shouldn't need to catch an exception if it's invalid
[03:05:39] <AppleDash> Anything more complex than that and yes I realize I can make mistakes and that they are likely to happen
[03:05:46] <mniip> Phase, you mean typeclass polymorphism?
[03:05:49] <Phase> foo = new URL("[somewhere]"); bar = new URL("[somewhere else]"); a != b
[03:05:56] <Phase> um
[03:06:08] <Phase> foo = new URL("[somewhere]"); bar = new URL("[somewhere]"); foo != bar
[03:06:15] <Phase> breain bsuy
[03:06:15] <AppleDash> lol
[03:06:27] <AppleDash> I'll stick to Python
[03:06:34] <AppleDash> where most libs take a string as a URL anyways
[03:06:41] <Phase> == is reference equality because it's primitive equality and references are a primitive
[03:06:49] <Phase> stupid java
[03:06:50] <JustAberrant> bleh, python is a cesspit of shitty code ;p
[03:07:08] <AppleDash> I do have one argument for PHP, though
[03:07:16] <Phase> oh and operator overloading is omitted "because it's too unintuitive" except String + String gets to be all special like
[03:07:31] <AppleDash> Tell me this
[03:07:40] <AppleDash> What if I have a page where one line of text needs to change depending on the date.
[03:07:41] * JustAberrant is honestly ok with both of those @ overloading and equality
[03:07:41] <AppleDash> That's it.
[03:07:44] <AppleDash> Is PHP sane?
[03:07:55] * Sour_Sweet has more in favor of PHP, but the cause is lost here.
[03:08:03] <JustAberrant> overloading in c++ tends to make things messy imo
[03:08:04] <Phase> and syntax sugar was similarly considered too hard yet the last, what, 3 versions of java have been piles of syntax sugar
[03:08:56] <Phase> JustAberrant, having, say, a complex number type and then being able to do complex + complex, or complex + simple, is so much nicer than having a pile of functions around for doing that
[03:09:22] <JustAberrant> yeah mathy things and stringy things are the only places it really makes sense
[03:09:46] <Phase> instead of add_complex(a, b), add_complex_and_simple(a, b), a.add_complex(b), and so on
[03:10:03] <Phase> and overloading can work with the languages primitives
[03:10:21] <Phase> JustAberrant, it's the place where it's most obviously meaningful
[03:10:31] <Phase> beyond that, stuff like operator[] on generic containers
[03:11:03] <Phase> operator* allowing for 'smart pointers' (reference counting) without a pile of new syntax
[03:11:10] *** Joins: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-k1obka.optusnet.com.au)
[03:11:13] <JustAberrant> I've always felt that something.get(whatever) isn't terrible
[03:11:15] <Phase> lets not talk about operator<< because that's stupid
[03:11:27] <JustAberrant> hehe, yes, I hate the stream stuff in c++
[03:11:40] <Phase> JustAberrant, but why do arrays have one syntax and my own containers another?
[03:12:03] <JustAberrant> primitive arrays have one syntax, even the java collections use regular methods
[03:12:25] <Phase> java lacks overloads, they have to be methods
[03:12:47] <Phase> and arrays are another special snowflake of the jvm
[03:13:30] <JustAberrant> meh, there are things in java that bug me, but that's not one of them ;p
[03:13:41] <Phase> a lot of the problems with java are because it's such a thin wrapper over the jvm
[03:13:41] <JustAberrant> my main gripe is the loss of type info at compile time for things like generics
[03:14:00] <Phase> generics are type-erasing because of jvm limitations :P
[03:14:06] <Phase> purely a compile-time check
[03:14:07] <JustAberrant> indeed
[03:14:13] <JustAberrant> and it's annoying ;p
[03:14:22] *** Quits: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-k1obka.optusnet.com.au) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:14:26] <JustAberrant> it severely limits some of the reflection hackery I like to do ;p
[03:14:27] <Phase> for containers they work fine
[03:15:07] <JustAberrant> but I still would argue that everything sucks more
[03:15:15] <JustAberrant> c++ is old and stogy 
[03:15:16] <Moonlightning> Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuust
[03:15:18] <JustAberrant> python is a mess
[03:15:30] <JustAberrant> rust, I don't get the point of at all
[03:15:36] <JustAberrant> ruby, bleh
[03:15:51] <Sour_Sweet> There is Go
[03:15:53] <Phase> rust has a lot of syntax overhad that time will hopefully thin down, at least from what i've seen
[03:16:04] <JustAberrant> perl, much as I love it, hasn't aged well either
[03:16:59] <JustAberrant> .NET isn't that bad except for being tied to Microsoft and not having as broad a toolstack as java
[03:17:12] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: high-level systems programming; memory safety without garbage collection.
[03:17:24] <Phase> JustAberrant, biggest thing attracting me to rust is that it makes lifetimes part of a type, so ^
[03:17:27] <Moonlightning> Yes, it's possible to achieve those now. Welcome to 2016.
[03:17:36] <Phase> also compile-time thread safety
[03:17:44] <Moonlightning> Yep.
[03:17:47] <Moonlightning> Easy concurrency.
[03:17:51] <Moonlightning> Again, welcome to 2016.
[03:17:57] <JustAberrant> meh ;p
[03:18:18] <Phase> optional reference counting
[03:18:37] * Phase understands that the refcount types are expressed purely in rust
[03:18:51] <JustAberrant> the syntax is icky though ;p
[03:18:58] <Sour_Sweet> I like C#/.NET a lot. With mono it's quite powerful
[03:19:00] <Moonlightning> What about the syntax is icky?
[03:19:00] <Phase> a really cool trick: there's two refcount classes
[03:19:04] <Phase> rc and arc
[03:19:08] <Moonlightning> Rc and Arc *
[03:19:23] <Phase> Rc is not atomic and thus not thread safe, Arc is
[03:19:42] <Sour_Sweet> The time where you have to call OS APIs by hoov for a simple dialog box should be long gone.
[03:19:43] <Phase> Arc is marked as Sendable, which is the de-facto trait for "this type is thread safe"
[03:19:58] <Sour_Sweet> hoof*
[03:20:06] <Moonlightning> Well, there's Send and then there's Sync
[03:20:19] <Phase> Rc isn't, so you get the faster one with no atomics but it's a compile error if you try use it across a thread boundry
[03:21:43] <Phase> JustAberrant, probably better than C++, and there's not a lot of good choices for low-level languages with powerful type systems
[03:22:01] <JustAberrant> Ada ;p
[03:22:11] <Phase> isn't that the thing VHDL was based on?
[03:22:26] * Phase hates vhdl compilers
[03:22:29] <Sour_Sweet> 17 KiB/s download rate. I'm surprised my IRC client still works.
[03:22:32] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:22:39] <JustAberrant> I dunno, I mostly work in mid to high level stuff
[03:22:41] <Phase> worse than msvc, i segfaulted every single one i used
[03:23:02] <JustAberrant> been awhile since I've had to write anything low level
[03:25:01] * Phase wonders what sort of security issues servo will have
[03:43:08] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: well, are you receiving anything less than 34 lines (each of them exactly 512 bytes long) every second?
[03:49:03] <HoneyDrops> Sour_Sweet: the time of dialog boxes should be long gone :p

[06:24:44] <Phase> it doesn't STOP me from working on code, but it massively slows me down and generally makes the experience miserable
[06:24:49] <aji> inline initialize a Set?
[06:24:55] <aji> probably with something in google guava in all honesty
[06:25:03] <aji> guava makes writing java more like writing python
[06:25:06] <aji> short of just writing groovy
[06:25:14] <Phase> it was an irc client, set of supported caps
[06:25:27] <aji> honestly i don't see what's so bad about
[06:25:33] <JustAberrant8> if it's gonna be fixed, I'd use a primitive
[06:25:43] <aji> HashSet<...> caps = new HashSet<>();
[06:25:46] <Phase> there's no primitive Set<>
[06:25:47] <aji> caps.add("the first one");
[06:25:49] <aji> ...
[06:26:07] <JustAberrant8> ^ that's how I'd probably do it if I ran into the situation
[06:26:11] <Phase> aji, i wanted it near some other stuff about sets
[06:26:28] <aji> also if you're not writing java with an IDE specifically intended for writing java,
[06:26:30] <Phase> wasn't in the constructor, was a static class member iirc
[06:26:32] <aji> yer gonna have an extremely bad time
[06:26:47] <JustAberrant8> ^ that too, I'll admit that's kinda stupid but it's true
[06:26:49] <aji> java has static{} blocks for that
[06:26:52] * Phase was, and sees that as a HUGE flaw in the language
[06:26:58] <JustAberrant8> java doesn't lend itself well to vim ;p
[06:27:07] <aji> lisp has the same flaw tbh
[06:27:08] <JustAberrant8> it really does need something like eclipse to deal with a lot of the bs
[06:27:18] <aji> writing lisp without emacs paredit is wtf why would you do that

[06:27:47] <aji> hello tiwake 
[06:27:49] <Phase> aji, i was not aware of static{}, and that's still not much better than the inline subclass-constructor-nonsense, in terms of syntax
[06:27:57] <aji> Phase: sure
[06:28:05] <aji> but at least you can go back and edit java
[06:28:10] <Phase> AppleDash, inline subclass, overrides the constructor

[06:29:41] <mniip> seriously
[06:30:19] <Phase> aji, i'll admit that the one thing it does very work is persisting
[06:30:23] <mniip> "computing A*B is too expensive, let's represent A with p(x) and B with q(x), and interpolate p(x)*q(x)"

[06:32:11] <Phase> rephrase which?
[06:32:17] <aji>   Phase | aji, i'll admit that the one thing it does very work is persisting 
[06:32:20] <Phase> oh, does very well XD
[06:32:27] <aji> persisting what?
[06:32:31] <Phase> just persisting
[06:32:38] <Phase> java programs and libraries tend to continue to work
[06:32:58] <Phase> which for its market is perfect
[06:33:07] <Phase> and it's better than the cobol it replaces
[06:33:42] <Phase> i mean given the choice between java and a stackless imperative language from the 80s
[06:33:49] <aji> ah, yeah
[06:33:58] <aji> i think the aggressive namespacing policy helps with that a bit too
[06:34:04] <aji> and the free dynamic linking
[06:34:29] <Phase> despite the namespacing there's built tools which rejig the namespaces to avoid version conflicts
[06:34:37] <aji> i've seen those
[06:34:49] <aji> they republish a dependency or something under a namespace they control, right?
[06:34:52] <aji> like com.google.org.apache.whatever
[06:34:54] <Phase> i'd rather how python handles namespaces but i guess it's fair
[06:34:55] <aji> those?
[06:34:56] <mniip> so yeah, imagine A=123 and B=456. we represent A with p(x) = 1*x^2 + 2*x + 3, and B with q(x) = 4*x^2 + 5*x + 6. p(10)=A, q(10)=B
[06:34:58] <Phase> yeah, something like that
[06:35:03] <aji> yeah, that's a bit of a hack imo
[06:35:10] <aji> but the alternative is way more sinister
[06:35:12] <Phase> welcome to java :P
[06:35:13] <mniip> then we compute p(1)*q(1), p(0)*q(0), p(-1)*q(-1)
[06:35:22] <aji> java just picks the first thing in the classpath that fits the dependency
[06:35:24] <mniip> and interpolate p(x)*q(x) from 3 data points
[06:35:37] <aji> though there are probably alternative loaders that look for conflicts too
[06:36:04] <aji> mniip: in all honesty, that's fascinating
[06:36:10] <aji> it's like reed-solomon error correcting codes
[06:36:14] <mniip> the trick is that all you need to do is to multiply the 3 values you got by the inverse of the ((0 1 0) (1 0 -1) (1 0 1))

[06:36:28] <mniip> and since those values are hardcoded
[06:36:33] <mniip> the matrix inverse can be hardcoded too

[06:38:19] <aji> well if you think about it,
[06:38:35] <aji> when doing RSA you need to take the exponent of a thousand bit number
[06:38:40] <aji> where the exponent is also thousands of bits

[07:21:41] <mniip> I used to host a server for a rather close group of friends
[07:21:48] <Moonlightning> I dunno about being on a big pony server. I thought it would be nice to—yeah!
[07:21:50] <mniip> maybe 20 people, at most 7 online at a time
[07:21:57] <Moonlightning> There used to be a #LunasLoft server, too
[07:22:06] <mniip> then that server was moved to one of the friends
[07:22:19] <mniip> and then he made it open and I kinda gave up playing on taht server
[07:23:58] <Moonlightning> I'm still really new

[07:25:47] <tiwake> there are so many different servers
[07:25:50] <tiwake> for all the things
[07:26:10] * JustAberrant8 prefers small servers too
[07:26:29] <JustAberrant8> like a small group where everyone mostly knows everyone and you know no-one is gonna be a dick
[07:28:28] <tiwake> well
[07:28:50] <tiwake> big servers have some mods that make such a thing sane

[07:29:41] <JustAberrant8> sure, but I still prefer a smaller group
[07:29:43] <tiwake> they handed it off to poniarcade
[07:29:55] <tiwake> and it seems to not be as busy now
[07:30:28] * JustAberrant8 also can't play vanilla minecraft any more, totally burned out on it.. and it's almost impossible to have a decently sized server with any of the more serious mods
[07:31:25] <tiwake> ha, yeah
[07:31:49] <GeekBrony> I used to host my own MC server for a few bronies, but meh, it ended up to be a waste of resources :c
[07:32:24] * JustAberrant8 ran an FTB server for awhile, but got to the point where it was pretty much maxing the CPU and using ~16G of ram
[07:32:52] <JustAberrant8> and that was with like maybe 10 active-ish players, think the 
[07:32:57] * GeekBrony is using his server to host a radio network off of his home internet
[07:33:27] <JustAberrant8> the whole not-multithreaded aspect of minecraft really annoys me :(
[07:33:54] <JustAberrant8> I mean you can keep pounding in memory, but single core cpu performance becomes a limiting factor
[07:34:02] <HoneyDrops> MC is a perfect example of how not to code a game.
[07:34:21] * JustAberrant8 nods
[07:34:29] <JustAberrant8> it's a great concept terribly executed
[07:34:38] <Moonlightning> someone should rewrite it in Rust
[07:34:44] * Moonlightning prods AppleDash
[07:35:20] * HoneyDrops votes for C and lua.
[07:35:34] <JustAberrant8> problem is the kind of creative people who can come up with a compelling game and really flush it out can't tend to code
[07:35:50] <JustAberrant8> and the type of people who could write a really efficient minecraft implementation would never have come up with it :>
[07:35:54] <HoneyDrops> You don't flesh it out, that is the main flaw with Mojang these days.
[07:36:04] <HoneyDrops> MC is an engine, and you let mods handle content.
[07:36:15] <AppleDash> Hello Moonlightning
[07:36:20] <HoneyDrops> Vanilla is just the crappy demo.
[07:36:30] <AppleDash> I am not rewriting Minecraft in Rust
[07:36:40] <tiwake> do it filly
[07:36:52] * Moonlightning would help!
[07:36:57] <mniip> what what what no
[07:37:02] <mniip> HoneyDrops, no
[07:37:22] <AppleDash> If you want to write Minecraft in a language do it in C++

[07:37:55] <AppleDash> Why not?
[07:37:57] <mniip> C#
[07:37:57] <AppleDash> It'll accept plugins
[07:38:00] <JustAberrant8> well, unless you create a python or java binding

[07:38:27] <mniip> LoadLibraryEx
[07:38:28] <JustAberrant8> because most modders barely do java
[07:38:44] <JustAberrant8> a few like eloram are serious coders, but most are gamers with a good idea fumbling about
[07:38:48] <JustAberrant8> that doesn't work well with c++
[07:39:09] <HoneyDrops> That was why I said C /and/ Lua.
[07:39:41] <HoneyDrops> Lua is for easy-mode modding, and you can get into the C for advanced stuff.
[07:39:55] <Moonlightning> Rust and Lua, and you've got a deal
[07:40:08] <mniip> just do it in alan
[07:40:10] <HoneyDrops> So you can have your 8000 lucky block clones, should the world feel that needs to be a thing... one was more than the world needed.
[07:40:56] <JustAberrant8> bleh, lua makes me want to piss blood
[07:41:12] * JustAberrant8 has written enough lua to know he doesn't like it :D
[07:41:31] <HoneyDrops> Lua is ok, it makes a really good language to embed in a program.
[07:41:32] <mniip> wat
[07:41:46] <HoneyDrops> Better than having pet languages for each program.
[07:42:06] <JustAberrant8> sure, but of the two I'd take python over lua
[07:42:12] <JustAberrant8> and I don't really like python either..
[07:42:28] <mniip> but python is huge
[07:42:30] <JustAberrant8> but yes, I do get the utility of lua for that kinda thing
[07:42:37] <HoneyDrops> I still don't like python putting meaning in whitespace.
[07:42:41] <JustAberrant8> meh, size hasn't mattered since the early 90s
[07:43:07] <HoneyDrops> You tell that to my Zipit Z2 w/ 32MB of ram :P
[07:43:07] <mniip> well we have a game whose distribution is 3.5MB
[07:43:12] <mniip> imagine shipping python with that
[07:44:16] <JustAberrant8> you could probably strip down the standard lib and all that
[07:44:23] <Moonlightning> You can.
[07:44:27] <mniip> python is useless without that
[07:44:34] <JustAberrant8> but even if you say you're game will be 1G, at this point people would probably shrug 
[07:44:39] <JustAberrant8> * your
[07:44:44] * HoneyDrops slaps JustAberrant8.
[07:45:06] <HoneyDrops> :I  1GB is massive for a game.
[07:45:17] <JustAberrant8> is it really?
[07:45:30] <HoneyDrops> You know how many NES roms fit in that!?  Like /all of them/
[07:45:49] <Moonlightning> Aren't a lot of the bigger ones on the order of 16..32 gigs?
[07:45:56] <Moonlightning> Portal 2 is like…6, IIRC
[07:46:01] <JustAberrant8> ^
[07:46:07] <Moonlightning> I was shocked that Minecraft was less than 1
[07:46:07] <JustAberrant8> [02:42:41 am] <JustAberrant8> meh, size hasn't mattered since the early 90s
[07:46:08] <JustAberrant8> ;p
[07:46:23] <HoneyDrops> What the hell are they doing to get a game that size?  Uncompressed bitmap and wav resources?
[07:46:30] <JustAberrant8> also keep in mind the minecraft distributable then downloads a huge chunk of resources

[19:44:02] <Gigabit> wow.. yahoo is so fucking dumb.. emailed because my cousin doesnt have access to his email account, it was hacked. And they emailed a support ticket to the email
[19:46:09] <JustAberrant8> that's pretty standard
[19:46:28] <JustAberrant8> if it was someone pretending to get access to your account, you'd want to know about it
[19:47:09] <Gigabit> ya but before they had the option to call them too and now it is gone
[19:48:03] <JustAberrant8> if he didn't set up an alternate way to get access to his account, he's basically fucked anyway ;p
[19:48:16] <Gigabit> the hacker changed it
[19:49:11] <JustAberrant8> never dealt with yahoo, but means you'll probably need to provide ID to prove you're info matches that signed up with 
[19:49:25] <JustAberrant8> and if he used fake info like, pretty much everyone does, then you're doubly fucked ;p
[19:50:45] <JustAberrant8> either way, if you really want to talkto a person I'm sure there's a generic support number on their site somewhere

[20:53:34] <WorkingData> in this case, the page always loads slower than it should, and I traced it down to the custom font: it downloads the font file each time a page is browsed
[20:55:35] <HoneyDrops> Do you really need that custom font?  Font choice should be left to the browser (as it is the prime authority on how the information will be displayed).
[20:57:13] <WorkingData> some icons i use are derived from special characters in that font set
[20:57:45] <WorkingData> sure, i could turn them into png icons, but it looks like they'd still be downloaded each time - doesn't resolve the issue

[21:25:47] <WorkingData> Request Headers: Cache-Control:max-age=0
[21:25:50] <HoneyDrops> The site should focus on making the information available, to be displayed how the client wishes.  You shouldn't even assume a human client, maybe a script is parsing the site info.
[21:27:07] <HoneyDrops> Focus on making it clear what the information means (semantics and context) and regular organization.  How the user decides to display it is up to them.
[21:28:55] <HoneyDrops> Wouldn't it be lovely if you could just curl | awk-like-script |less almost every website and view articles text only, and ditch uunneeded UI, banners, headers/footers, etc? 
[21:30:26] <Sour_Sweet> +1 for XML valid HTML and accessibility ;-)
[21:30:30] <WorkingData> not helpful for my problem :P
[21:33:14] <WorkingData> I'm not sure why the client is sending the request reader for no cache..
[21:34:37] <Phase> HoneyDrops, lynx?
[21:34:50] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: That's why you separate content and presentation, yeah

[21:42:52] <Moonlightning> This isn't too good an example, because the page is very simple.
[21:44:54] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning, well if more sites let you access their db directly that would be a plus.

[21:47:00] <HoneyDrops> "task"?

[21:49:30] <HoneyDrops> Based on what I've seen they already can't, or at least not efficiently.  *gets twitchy anytime she sees someone manually scanning text for a word*

[22:09:59] <HoneyDrops> Voice interfaces are basically a dumbed down, and more nautural-language-centric incarnation of a command interface.
[22:10:03] <Moonlightning> Siri is a (vocal) CLI, without the precision and power of the CLI. :P
[22:10:41] <HoneyDrops> Well precision is possible to recapture, as is power.  However, it is doomed to be slow, and typing is faster than talking.
[22:10:49] <Moonlightning> Uh
[22:11:12] <Moonlightning> I dunno about you, but I can talk faster than I can type
[22:11:20] <JustAberrant8> yeah but its popular because of the hands free aspect
[22:11:44] <JustAberrant8> not any utility over a point and click interface
[22:11:56] <Moonlightning> What I can't do, though, is pronounce a nontrivial command line
[22:11:58] <HoneyDrops> I can generally express more complex ideas in text faster.  Text also affords the ability to look over what I did/are about to do.
[22:12:35] <Moonlightning> Well, if you're going by command-line standards…
[22:12:35] <JustAberrant8> thats great, but its not coming back to the masses
[22:13:45] <Moonlightning> `rsync -rlthP foo bar` is certainly faster than “synchronize the `foo` directory to `bar`, recursively, preserving symlinks and mtimes, with partial files and progress indicators, and with human-readable units”

[22:14:04] <Moonlightning> But the voice interfaces we see are not going to allow you that kind of precision anyway
[22:14:14] <Moonlightning> Not until we get AI
[22:15:21] <HoneyDrops> Don't need AI, need better speech-to-text, but there is nothing inherently limiting about a command-based interface in speech vs a command-based interface in text.
[22:15:59] <Moonlightning> We're not going to see (manestream) speech-to-text piped into a shell. :P

[22:17:32] <HoneyDrops> Though really this is all stop-gap until we perfect the UI: it is a (to the user) seamless integration of computer and mind.  The end game is that any bit of information stored on a computer should be as easy to recall than any other memory.

[22:21:49] <HoneyDrops> At least I see no point in making any such a distinction.  No reason we don't equip all of humanity with the entire sum of human knowledge, and external co-processing.  Imagine what we'd be able to do then?  Schooling would be the brain adapting to comprehension and processing, and training oneself to utilize external systems to handle what could be offloaded to them (eg: no human should
[22:21:50] <HoneyDrops> ever need to do arithmetic)
[22:22:05] <HoneyDrops> Again, this is /long term/  I doubt any of us will live to see that.
[22:24:02] <WorkingData> Sour_Sweet: I want(ed) the page itself to be reloaded each time, so the headers i have on the page itself are "Cache-Control:no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0; Pragma:no-cache"
[22:24:13] <WorkingData> might it be applying that to all of the resources, too?
[22:25:42] <Sour_Sweet> Certainly looks like it. It would be unusual otherwise for the browser to reload static files.
