[01:08:50] <Jouva> I had a surprisingly pony filled day today at work. Co-worker who's been stressing out over fixing some issues with our API was going a bit nuts last week. Today I posted a Lesson Zero twilight .gif in our work chat, saying that was him working on the API. He's seen the show and likes the characters but doesn't seem to be much interested in the show otherwise.
[01:09:34] <Jouva> He was very amused and had an eye twitching Twilight full screened on one of his monitors most of the day
[01:10:15] <Jouva> That and another co-worker on our team said that since we needed to come up with a name for the team, he suggested Team Twitchy Pony

[22:33:07] <Moonlightning> I'm really seeing the usefulness of CoW filesystems here >.>
[22:33:30] <Moonlightning> This is the second copy I'm making of a 388 GiB directory
[22:33:49] <Moonlightning> And the filesystem is just ext4
[22:33:51] <Moonlightning> so it's taking /ages/
[22:36:44] <roflin> cow filesystems?
[22:37:05] <roflin> Copy on Write?
[22:39:42] <Moonlightning> yeah
[22:39:58] <Moonlightning> Like ZFs and BTrFs
[22:40:46] <Moonlightning> Gonna take another 2.75 hours or so, if it goes at a consistent rate
[22:42:05] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: Can you explain CoW filesystems to me?
[22:42:52] <AppleDash> Is that just where it essentially symlinks copies of the same file all to the original but makes a new copy when it's changed?
[22:43:00] <AppleDash> s/it's/one of the new copies is/
[22:45:14] <Moonlightning> Basically, yeah. Obviously, they're not really implemented as fs-level symlinks. They're called reflinks.
[22:46:11] <Moonlightning> Oh, and the userspace code has to support reflinking (else it'll just create a proper copy, which will take just as long)
[22:46:18] <Moonlightning> (s/proper/traditional/)

[22:49:32] *** Quin2 is now known as Quindo
[22:49:43] <Moonlightning> cp doesn't reflink by default, though…
[22:49:57] <Moonlightning> > It's not the default since for robustness reasons one may want a copy to take place to protect against data corruption. Also for performance reasons you may want the writes to happen at copy time rather than some latency sensitive process working on a CoW file and being delayed by the writes possibly to a different part of a mechanical disk.
