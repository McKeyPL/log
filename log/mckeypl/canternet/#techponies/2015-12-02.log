[03:09:32] <init3> Does anyone here work with Oracle database servers?
[03:09:48] <Phase> with its SQL or the database itself?
[03:10:09] <init3> Moreso the server level. 
[03:10:19] *** Terrabyte is now known as Vega
[03:10:36] <Phase> none then
[03:11:04] <init3> I am just curious if anyone knows about how differences between running it on a Windows box or a Linux server. 
[03:11:34] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> depends on what you are trying to do?
[03:11:59] <init3> Well I mean, we are talking a huge production database. 
[03:12:40] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> Linux gives you a little more control without as many troubles caused by background services
[03:12:40] <Phase> i would say to call oracle
[03:12:57] <init3> The suggestion migrating the database to a Windows platform makes sense. I am new to this company, but I can't see any reason you'd want to run the server on Windows really.
[03:13:04] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> also linux is more stable, but definately what Phase said, call Oracle
[03:13:38] <Phase> huge database implies some kind of support contract, so ask them for advice
[03:13:47] *** Quits: LordShadowWing (LordShadowW@Pony-meil2p.machlink.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:13:53] <init3> Yeah, we do have one. 
[03:14:01] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> are they trying to roll everything into one box?
[03:14:09] <init3> no
[03:14:11] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i.e. server 2015*
[03:14:18] <Phase> 2012*
[03:14:22] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ah
[03:14:28] <init3> Definitley not. We have several DB servers standalone. 
[03:14:31] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> could be worse, atleast its not '08R1
[03:14:46] <init3> Lol Vista server edition
[03:14:47] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] shudders and has flashbacks
[03:14:51] <Phase> i mean 2012 because server 2015 isn't a thing
[03:15:10] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> R2 was okay, but had problems, its no server '02
[03:15:18] <Phase> 2003'
[03:15:31] <Phase> the numbers man
[03:15:41] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> derp, i havent messed with windows server outside of tech, i tend to work with Linux servers
[03:16:29] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> just a sec
[03:16:30] <Phase> work has a copy of server essentials and standard, because licensing reasons
[03:16:37] <init3> Well I got this new job so I am not in a position to be making decisions yet, but I am getting the feeling the bossman only knows windows and therefore we should be a MS shop. 
[03:16:39] <Phase> stupid licensing
[03:16:58] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> sounds about right
[03:17:01] <init3> But I don't think the other Systems Engineers want to see that. 
[03:17:04] <Phase> init3, with permanent IT staff?
[03:17:11] <init3> Yeah
[03:17:35] <init3> I mean, when I interviewed I told them I know linux and a little windows and I got hired. 
[03:17:38] <Phase> i wouldn't expect bossman to do any admin then
[03:18:06] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the only part of the server cert i got that i didnt like, was having to learn the differences between R1 and R2 in server '08, then when we deployed we had to use server '03 after going out of our way to learn '08
[03:18:12] <init3> So I am kinda suprised at this suggestion that we should move to Windows. 
[03:18:44] <init3> Why would you hire a linux guy to administer a mostly Linux environment if you plan to move to Windows?
[03:19:40] <init3> I dunno. I just don't get the appeal of Windows servers unless it is AD/Exchange
[03:19:51] <Phase> yeah, that's why work has it
[03:19:57] <Phase> otherwise i'd go pure linux
[03:20:03] <Phase> stupid ad
[03:20:25] <Phase> and then a month after i do that they announce changes to windows 10 that would allow freeldap to run windows boxes
[03:20:36] <init3> Right. That's pretty much the way this place is setup now. Windows boxen for internal IT. 
[03:20:38] <Phase> anyway
[03:20:49] <init3> And push GPOs?
[03:20:57] <Phase> init3, ask oracle, they may just say to use oracle enterprise
[03:21:19] <Phase> init3, samba ad can push GPOs, afaik it's just a bunch of policy objects in a folder
[03:21:29] <init3> Ahh
[03:21:54] <Phase> you could merge remote gpo's into local policy anyway
[03:22:25] <Phase> the addition was the ability to resolve users and groups from ldap directly, without active directory
[03:22:39] <Phase> you can get kerberos tickets without, now they fixed the other half
[03:22:43] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> derp, i forgot i had this iso on my drive
[03:22:54] <init3> I mean, I am happy with the new gig, I just have anxiety about the prospect of somehow wandering into being a Senior Syseng of an all windows network. 
[03:23:13] <init3> Like, that is NOT my career goal. 
[03:24:04] <init3> Funny thing about oracle though. Apparently their licencing is per core. 
[03:24:16] <Phase> MS licensing is also
[03:24:20] <Phase> wait, core?
[03:24:21] <init3> They found out one of our DB servers was on a VM cluster. 
[03:24:24] <Phase> not socket, core?
[03:24:52] <init3> And told us we would have to pay licencing for every core in the entire CLUSTER
[03:25:02] <init3> it was a single core VM
[03:25:10] <Phase> wow
[03:25:24] <init3> Rite?
[03:25:26] <Phase> did you?
[03:25:52] <init3> Fuck no it was a QA server so we bought a dell desktop and stuck it in the DC lol.
[03:25:56] <Phase> XD
[03:26:26] * Phase hugs postgres
[03:26:32] <init3> Rite?
[03:26:38] <Phase> i briefly used oracle sql at uni
[03:26:40] <Phase> and my god
[03:26:43] <Phase> it HATES you
[03:27:02] <init3> Thankfully we have DBAs and devs to deal with the SQL
[03:27:13] <init3> I'm not going to be touching that. 
[03:27:35] <init3> If the oracle service is accepting connections I'm fucking out. 
[03:27:53] * Googie had never heard one good thing about Oracle
[03:28:08] * Phase hasn't either
[03:28:29] <init3> I have been /told/ it scales really well but I dunno. 
[03:28:54] <Phase> ever DB vendor says that
[03:29:19] <init3> Apparently someone was doing a report on the prod Oracle server today and the CPU of an 8 core xeon was pegged all afternoon. 
[03:30:01] <Phase> wonder if it has EXPLAIN
[03:30:09] <Phase> cause like EXPLAIN ANALYZE is the best thing
[03:30:24] * init3 is confus
[03:30:46] <Phase> init3, it's a postgresql command
[03:31:01] <init3> Ahh
[03:31:07] <Phase> EXPLAIN gives you the query planners plan
[03:31:17] <init3> I know a little MySQL but that's about it. 
[03:31:34] <Phase> EXPLAIN ANALYZE give you the plan, and runs the query showing you its estimated costs vs the actual costs
[03:31:49] <Phase> MySQL is crap
[03:32:01] <init3> I know
[03:32:05] <Phase> it's the PHP of SQL Servers
[03:32:11] <Phase> so perfect match
[03:32:16] <init3> Yep.
[03:32:34] <init3> I've been a LAMP admin for yeeeears
[03:32:40] <init3> Like 6 or some shit
[03:32:50] <init3> So I'm glad to be done with that shit. 
[03:32:55] <Phase> nothing against apache though
[03:33:14] <init3> Yeah Apache is solid. 
[03:33:17] <Phase> it's kinda aged but they've been improving it, especially against the more modern competition
[03:33:28] <Googie> Apache gets far too much hate these days
[03:33:34] <Phase> PHP is being gradually improved
[03:35:02] <init3> Still, so much of my LAMP job was basically Wordpress and the like. 
[03:35:35] <init3> Fucking sick of that shit so this Oracle mixed environment is like a breath of fresh air. 
[03:35:57] <init3> But I still fear Linux being phased out. That'd make me the sads. 
[03:37:12] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i dont see linux going anyware anytime soon
[03:37:17] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> brb

[05:42:38] <init3> I get the feeling it won't be for a long time if anything does happen. Hopefully by then I'll have enough clout to at least make the suggestion it is a poor idea. I am pretty sure the other guys who actually have to touch the servers feel the same way.
[05:43:21] <init3> My boss just started a few weeks before I did, so who knows. 
[05:43:29] <Phase> could just do cost/benefit
[05:43:52] <Phase> $2k per two sockets for standard, $5k per two sockets for datacenter
[05:44:00] <Phase> and you gain?
[05:44:10] <init3> Right. That's part of the reason I was asking. I want to understand what exactly is better about it. 
[05:44:28] <Phase> for mysql and postgres windows is measurably slower just due to an inferior io layer
[05:44:44] <init3> Yeah
[05:44:50] <Phase> windows intergrates better with windows
[05:44:56] <Phase> that's about the only reason i use it
[05:45:35] <init3> Right and I have no issues with the DCs being winderps. That makes sense to me. 
[05:45:53] <Phase> winderps
[05:45:57] * Phase writes that one down
[05:46:38] <Phase> my god
[05:46:50] <Phase> oracle-xe installer wants to change all sorts of kernel parameters
[05:47:03] <Phase> not dealing with that
[05:47:38] <init3> Actually come to think of it, the email server is Zimbra, so that might even be a linux box too. The file servers are samba. I know that. 
[05:48:22] <Phase> ooo, zimbra looks nice
[05:48:23] <init3> My first interview was before my boss started. They said that they use Linux whenever possible then. 
[05:48:25] <Phase> exchange compatible?
[05:48:36] <init3> With a connector yes
[05:48:40] <Phase> awesome
[05:49:50] <Phase> oh nice, centos package
[05:49:59] <Phase> oh, centos root image
[05:50:02] <Phase> close enough
[05:50:04] <init3> So here is what I am kind of getting the feeling is happening. This guy doesn't know linux but has to head a department that used Linux whenever possible before him. It is his department so he can run it how he wants so he is thinking we should be on MS. 
[05:50:34] <init3> Now, I think he'll gget pushback from the sysadmins and the syseng team. 
[05:50:48] <init3> And probably from finance for the licencing costs
[05:51:00] <init3> So I dunno. 
[05:51:16] <init3> Not to mention the time and labor cost. 
[05:51:18] *** Quits: Webster (Webster@Pony-jrej46.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:51:27] <Phase> well unless oracle says otherwise (and i doubt they will), there's no real gain
[05:51:31] <Phase> so it's that simple
[05:51:52] <Phase> he'd have to explain to everyone why the change is being made at cost for a measurable loss in ability
[05:52:43] <init3> Right. I just asked in here because I know I am extremely biased towards linux. I am really not sure if there is some advantage that I just can't see because I am a linux guy. 
[05:53:01] <init3> But then again most of us in here are linux people too lol. 
[05:53:05] <Phase> :P
[05:53:38] <Phase> and tbh if you install windows you're installing server core anyway
[05:54:05] <Phase> and that means you need windows machines to manage your servers unless you want to run cmd through remote desktop
[05:54:26] <init3> And knowledge of just a different CLI. 
[05:54:45] * Phase has been sorta learning powershell
[05:54:56] <init3> And making fun of powershell was like the first conversation we all had when I started. 
[05:55:01] <Phase> xD
[05:55:13] <Phase> it's just a bit eh
[05:55:25] <Phase> not quite a shell, not quite a script, drawbacks of both
[05:55:35] <init3> haha I like that
[05:56:30] <Phase> given the choice, powershell > batch scripts, but you'll need to work around powershell at times since it's a typed language
[05:56:48] <Phase> which is not what you expect from a shell, coming from both batch and bash
[05:57:04] <init3> I can't wait until we get out WAN upgrades. The internet is so slow there. Like 8 T1s or something like that. Switching for 50/50 fiber and 80/20 cable for backup. 
[05:57:29] <init3> I think I'm going to get to do the honors on that. ^^
[05:57:35] <Phase> "our internet is so slow, we only have 50/50 and an 80/20"
[05:57:41] <Phase> *sitting here with 4/1*
[05:57:53] <init3> No, that's what we are getting
[05:57:57] <Phase> ah
[05:58:04] <init3> We have like 8 t1s
[05:58:11] * Phase forgets what t1 is
[05:58:17] <init3> 1.5
[05:58:28] <Phase> still better than mine
[05:58:41] <init3> True 
[05:58:49] <Phase> though probably more stetched than a place what makes food
[05:59:25] <init3> Still, we have a datacenter that serves out our application over the web on site and like 40 employees.

[06:07:44] <Phase> facebook needs to run proxies so we can take advantage of free facebook traffic deals

[06:07:54] <init3> Haha
[06:08:11] <Phase> that would totally be cheaper than buying traffic legit you have no idea

[06:18:50] <Phase> it's under downloads
[06:19:06] <Phase> i just don't know how you add exchange to that, and i hate getting quotes
[06:21:22] <init3> Should be a free download I think. Just look for the Zimbra Outlook connector.

[06:23:38] <Phase> stupid windows licensing
[06:23:58] <Phase> putting everything on one box is a bad practice but my god does windows make it an enticing
[06:23:58] <init3> You do? I thought you just needed a windows pc for outlook.
[06:24:11] <Phase> init3, only lists msi downloads for the connector
[06:24:21] <init3> That is just client side
[06:24:37] <Phase> ohhh
[06:24:42] <init3> So outlook can connect to your zimbra server
[06:24:57] <Phase> excuse me but i'm a derp
[06:25:11] <init3> lol it's coo
[06:25:45] <init3> Zimbra does have a reasonable web interface too.
