[00:57:53] <tiwork> is that the new movie?
[00:58:09] * JustAberrant hasn't seen it yet, but I probably won't for like .. years.. so I'm cool ;p
[00:58:27] <init3> It's the best one yet imo. 
[00:58:45] <init3> I do recommend it having not really recommended 1 or 2.
[00:58:50] * JustAberrant actually hasn't seen any of the movies or the last 3 episodes for that matter.. really should get on that
[00:59:19] <init3> EG gets better as you go
[00:59:25] <tiwork> heh
[00:59:33] <tiwork> yeah
[00:59:42] <tiwork> well
[00:59:43] <init3> 1 is meh 2 is decent and 3 is actually good. 
[00:59:44] <tiwork> yeah
[00:59:46] <JustAberrant> yeah, I'm not really opposed to the movies.. just never really got around to it

[01:10:59] <JustAberrant> well that sure sounds plausible :>
[01:12:19] <init3> Oh right. I feel it is my duty to inform y'all there is a really good free dyndns service with 89,777 domains and among them is awesomepony.net, flutterpony.org and ponyhost.xyz. http://derpy.awesomepony.net is already taken I'm afraid but I felt here was a place I should drop the PSA. 
[01:12:20] <PinkiePieBot> [ DERP! ]
[01:12:57] <init3> Best part is all it takes is a curl to update your host. 
[01:13:28] <init3> But yes Compu. It being magic it still means fuckall if it is EM. 
[01:13:51] <Compu> init3: shush its information on how magic works
[01:14:28] <Colgate> isn't there a standard for how dyndns works?

[01:24:31] <Compu> init3: how u get a subdomain to only point to a pic on ur server?

[01:25:05] <init3> Well there is an index.html if that's what you are asking.

[01:25:19] <Moonlightning> Compu: run a webserver, return a short HTML document with just an <img> for /
[01:25:24] <Compu> init3: oh u just have a server with only a derpy pic being hosted
[01:25:40] <Sour_Sweet> It's called vhosts
[01:25:54] <init3> Well that's not all it is doing by any means, but that is all it is doing on http. 
[01:25:56] <Sour_Sweet> You can have more than one website per server under different domains
[01:26:03] <init3> Aye
[01:26:12] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: yeah but how
[01:26:16] <Moonlightning> Make sure you have the TLS thing
[01:26:17] <Moonlightning> SNI
[01:26:32] <Moonlightning> Make sure you have SNI on, and you're serving over HTTPS for /everything/
[01:26:33] <Sour_Sweet> ^ if you need it for outdated crap
[01:26:45] <Colgate> well, SNI doesn't really have to do with http vhosts
[01:26:47] <Colgate> :P
[01:26:52] <Compu> oh i dont have https
[01:26:54] <init3> Yeah, but there is no need for HTTPS if al lyou are serving is a picture of a pony. 
[01:26:57] <Moonlightning> well, okay, what I /mean/ is make sure shit is browser-trusted
[01:26:58] <Colgate> you can SNI 1 host, then in your get request have a different domain
[01:27:33] <Moonlightning> So you don't serve 404s for things if ponies s/http:/https:/ and look like an idiot douchebag :V
[01:27:42] <init3> Also, I don't own the actual domain awesomepony.net Compu. This is a free dynamic DNS domain. 
[01:28:10] <Moonlightning> What does /dynamic DNS domain/ even mean?
[01:28:21] <Compu> init3: yeah i know, i used to use compucraft.mooo.com before i got compu.ml
[01:28:23] <Colgate> it is a dynamic rr
[01:28:27] <Sour_Sweet> Compu: This is the apache2 config for the domain I just posted http://pastebin.com/XrV3f7WX

[01:28:29] <Colgate> :P
[01:28:29] <Moonlightning> any domain can be a dynamic one, yes? just turn the TTL down for the relevant RRs
[01:28:35] <Moonlightning> nothing special about it
[01:28:40] <init3> Yep
[01:28:41] <Colgate> sure
[01:29:04] <Sour_Sweet> Moonlightning: And have a host that allows nameserver API updates
[01:29:17] <Colgate> ^ see RFC I posted earlier
[01:29:42] <init3> Or run your own nameserver and just do a simple script
[01:29:45] <Compu> Moonlightning: oh god TTLs, i asked freenom what numbers i could put into the TTL box on their page when updating entries and they literally told me to figure it out
[01:29:51] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah but some host don't have an API to update their nameservers. init3 indeed
[01:30:00] <Moonlightning> Compu: oh, there're recommendations for that
[01:30:02] <Sour_Sweet> Only a crappy UI
[01:30:08] <init3> True
[01:30:45] <Sour_Sweet> My last host didn't have any kind of API for example, so I did a cname for my dyndns
[01:30:50] <Compu> Moonlightning: they TTL box only allows certain numbers and so far the only one i know works is the default one which is something like 1400
[01:30:55] <Moonlightning> it's like 1129 or 2129 or something
[01:30:59] <Moonlightning> got a 2 and a 9 in it

[01:31:46] <Compu> i dont know how to do it myself
[01:31:50] <Compu> and its a free domain
[01:32:18] <Moonlightning> Free…yeah, I dunno, they might not let you do that then
[01:32:18] <Sour_Sweet> Some domains and hosts have restrictions. BUT if you can change your NS record you can use a service that allows updates via API
[01:32:49] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: if something is placing restrictions on you beyond the ones outlined in the standards, I say bleh. :P
[01:32:51] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: ????
[01:33:04] <Sour_Sweet> Both Cloudflare and Namecheap provide free nameservers for example
[01:33:12] <Compu> Moonlightning: yeah but cant really complain when u get it for free

[01:33:33] <Colgate> iunno
[01:33:35] <Sour_Sweet> There are other services, but the number of them I'd trust is fairly limited

[01:34:48] <Moonlightning> 'cos I don't ever hear anypony recommending Google as a registrar :P

Later on a program I've compiled myself, not touched in a few months crashed as well. Checked syslogs: Nothing unusual. I decided to fully restart the server and it did not start. After a quick dive into rescue mode and the server restarted with it's

[15:38:21] <init3> I wouls thing bad memory Sour_Sweet. Is it software RAID?
[15:38:30] <init3> *would think
[15:38:47] <Moonlightning> Wow, the code for Cookie Clicker is HORRIBLE
[15:39:08] <Sour_Sweet> It is software RAID indeed
[15:39:12] <Moonlightning> That's not how you do weighted probabilities
[15:39:39] <init3> Yeah, especially with it being SW RAID I'd think bad memory. 
[15:39:49] <init3> non-ECC to boot?
[15:39:54] <Moonlightning> Why is there one function for achievement lookups, item lookups, and upgrade lookups?
[15:41:26] <init3> Because whomever made cookie clicker wanted the code to be as annoying as the game?
[15:41:58] <Moonlightning> I almost want to help. Where's the repo? :V
[15:42:01] <Sour_Sweet> init3: yes.
[15:42:31] <init3> Yeah. I'll bet you are on to something with memory there. 
[15:43:15] <init3> I wish ECC wasn't so damn expensive. That shit is dank. 
[15:58:44] <RainbowHacks> o.o
[16:02:28] <Moonlightning> o3o
[16:02:28] <Sour_Sweet> Yep defect memory -.-

[20:00:40] <Sour_Sweet> Sakura: I don't think a free VPS can be of a decent quality. I'd be way too worried to run anything of value on such a service - just my 2 cents.
[20:01:58] <wolfyshy> Sakura: ec2 does a free X-month trial I think, beyond that no, there are none
[20:02:14] <wolfyshy> I used to work in hosting before I left it, all of the low tier ones are just that: low tier.
[20:02:54] <RazorSharpFang> Does that include the AWS free tier?
[20:03:26] <wolfyshy> I meant companies, but tbh, the free tier gets kind of ... you know "nice" on a server?  it lets you set priorities?
[20:03:34] <wolfyshy> let's just say in my testing, AWS free tier is niced heavily
[20:03:50] <wolfyshy> network I/O starves a lot
[20:04:01] <wolfyshy> disk I/O is a crapshoot, sometimes it's fast, sometimes it starves too
[20:04:11] <RazorSharpFang> wolfyshy: So, expect speeds to be inconsistent?
[20:05:54] <Sour_Sweet> Apart from that I don't consider a trial period free.

[22:32:53] <PinkiePieBot> [ Nvidia plans to lock Game Ready drivers behind GeForce Experience registration | PCWorld ]
[22:33:42] <RazorSharpFang> Key words: "Game Ready drivers (tm)
[22:33:43] <wolfyshy> there was an english link posted here last night
[22:34:05] <RazorSharpFang> Sour_Sweet: It's not drivers for the hardware, it's game-specific drivers, I think.
[22:34:08] * imamail is ripping cd's like it was 2005
[22:34:20] <Sour_Sweet> RazorSharpFang: Game ready drivers are the lastest drivers
[22:34:46] <RazorSharpFang> If you don't register, you'll still get the quarterly releases.
[22:34:47] <Sour_Sweet> The regular drivers are released once a quater something
[22:34:49] <RazorSharpFang> It says in the article.
[22:35:08] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah I knew ;-)
[22:35:15] <Sour_Sweet> But it's still crappy
[22:35:33] <RazorSharpFang> Well, it's better than them NOT releasing drivers.
[22:35:40] <RazorSharpFang> It's better than them not getting WHQL testing.
[22:43:36] <johnsey> it's a bit of a strange move but nothing keeps you from using a mailinator-type address
[22:46:31] <Kinsley> The move doesn't affect me, because I already use Geforce Experience for Shadowplay and whatnot... but that doesn't make the decision any less shitty.
[22:48:13] <Sour_Sweet> I'm using it as well, but considering the crappy UI I'd probably switch to a third party app if it provided auto driver updates. Their optimization thing suggest weird things, but Shadowplay is nice I guess
[22:53:08] <Kinsley> It has weird priorities.

[22:54:30] <Sour_Sweet> It suggests me to put textures for GTA V on high instead of very high. WHY? I have freaking 4GiB of VRAM. It's not that I'd care.
[22:56:26] <Sour_Sweet> BUT it enables FXAA. No you can keep your washed out images!
[23:03:10] *** CyberJacob is now known as zz_CyberJacob
[23:12:19] <RazorSharpFang> Is FXAA different to antialiasing?
[23:13:08] <Sour_Sweet> There are multiple types of AA. FXAA is only one of them.
[23:13:51] <Sour_Sweet> There is MSAA for example which is better (BUT causes more GPU load)
[23:14:04] <Sour_Sweet> or TXAA which is an nVidia thing

[23:17:49] <Sour_Sweet> No it's generally a good thing. It get's rid of the "edges" on the side of polygons

[23:19:35] <RazorSharpFang> Sour_Sweet: The right image looks less blocky.
[23:20:06] <Sour_Sweet> Yes. Especially the ropes and windows
[23:20:25] <Sour_Sweet> It's not the best image due to L4Ds grain filter, but you get the idea
[23:20:59] <RazorSharpFang> I can't seem to get antialiasing on WebGL canvas. Is it lacking support at the moment?
[23:21:24] <Sour_Sweet> Depends on the browser I think. I'd need to check that
[23:21:51] <Sour_Sweet> I know for example that firefox did lack AA on a 2d context
[23:22:17] *** Joins: Aoshi (Aoshi@Pony-4ho.5di.90.128.IP)
[23:25:56] <wolfyshy> fx has AA but it depends heavily on gpu
[23:25:58] <wolfyshy> and OS
[23:26:30] <wolfyshy> for instance, on linux + intel GPU, webgl is severely gimped for me
[23:39:06] <imamail> err, that's antialiasing that gets rid of stuff you mean i guess

[23:47:19] <Sour_Sweet> Well they make APUs (Or whatever intel calls them)

[23:48:29] <RazorSharpFang> APUs?
[23:49:07] <imamail> well, if this pic is not lying the next edition will have more GPU than CPU :b http://hsto.org/storage2/9a2/2b7/610/9a22b7610f24ab5fe8d82501be6c9f0d.png

[23:53:12] * imamail wonders what that "A" stands for o.O
[23:53:24] <Kinsley> Accelerated, I think.
[23:53:39] <Kinsley> APU is an AMD marketing term for their line of CPU + GPU combos.
[23:54:07] <imamail> oh....lets make new terms to confuse everything a bit more i guess :)
[23:54:11] <Kinsley> And I say that Intel doesn't make GPUs in the sense that HD Graphics/Iris/Iris Pro aren't their own discrete chips.
[23:54:53] <imamail> idk, i think describing them as a graphics "unit" still suits it fine
[23:55:30] <Kinsley> Maybe I'm just a dinosaur who likes her CPU and GPU to be separate and upgradable with little fuss.
[23:56:27] * Sour_Sweet doesn't use APUs either.
