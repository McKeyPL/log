[01:48:11] <Starthunder> It's not possible for multiple interfaces to have the same v6 address, is it.
[01:48:17] <Starthunder> Even if they're on the same machine.
[01:48:57] <Colgate> why wouldn't it be?
[01:49:37] * Starthunder longblinks.
[01:49:38] <Colgate> # ip addr add ::1 dev eth[01]
[01:50:05] <Colgate> both devices now have the ip address of ::1
[01:50:27] <Starthunder> Uh. Okay. Any caveats?
[01:51:25] <Colgate> only if layer 2 matters to you
[01:51:48] <Colgate> since now both are advertising that they have that ip address to arp requests
[01:51:53] <Starthunder> No, I don't think.
[01:52:16] <Starthunder> One interface is Ethernet; the other is Wi-Fi
[01:53:28] <Starthunder> Wait…does this mean I can assign the same address to /clients/ with multiple interfaces? o3o
[01:54:02] <Colgate> you can assign any IP you want to an interface :P
[01:54:25] <Starthunder> Yes, but without Weird Things™ or Bad Things™ happening. :p
[01:54:52] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: what you want is a "bridge"
[01:55:24] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: I have "bridged" the ethernet and wifi ports on my FreeBSD router, so it is 10.0.0.1 on both interfaces
[01:55:34] <wolfyshy> you can do the same in linux
[01:55:42] <wolfyshy> I think the command is 'brctl' and you may need a package
[01:56:10] <Starthunder> :?
[01:56:19] <Colgate> what is your end goal here anyways?
[01:56:21] <Starthunder> What do you gain from doing that over simply assigning the same address multiple times?
[01:56:26] <wolfyshy> net-misc/bridge-utils on gentoo, bridgeutils on debian
[01:56:44] <Colgate> a single mac address for layer 2
[01:56:49] <Colgate> and a single itnerface to work with
[01:56:52] <wolfyshy> well it is an IP address conflict to have multiple MACs with the same IP
[01:56:58] <wolfyshy> yes that is correct ^
[01:57:06] <Starthunder> Uh…none, really, besides not having multiple different addresses for multiple different machines (besides the temporary ones)

[01:58:12] <Starthunder> I don't suppose there's any DHCP options to get clients to bridge automatically
[01:58:33] <wolfyshy> no, you would set the client to bridge and ask for a DHCP lease off the bridge interface
[01:58:38] <wolfyshy> which would automatically assign the IP to the bridge
[01:58:54] <wolfyshy> I'm buried in work or I would set up an example on debian to show
[01:59:04] <Starthunder> Grr.
[01:59:16] <wolfyshy> DHCP's scope is interface-level, not computer-level
[01:59:32] <wolfyshy> it would not make sense for DHCP to tell a computer to bridge interfaces, because that changes the interface itself
[02:00:23] <wolfyshy> consider a multihomed computer connected to two different networks; if both have DHCP, both are going to set the interfaces differently
[02:00:34] <Starthunder> Mmmm.
[02:00:42] <wolfyshy> welcome to enterprise networking ;)
[02:00:55] <Starthunder> What about just leaving the conflicts? >.>
[02:01:23] <wolfyshy> it's a crapshoot based on {insert a bunch of acronyms here including ARP} which interface gets the packet.
[02:01:29] <wolfyshy> it won't work
[02:01:34] <Starthunder> :<
[02:01:59] <wolfyshy> bridging is pretty fun though, esp with eth+wifi
[02:02:10] <wolfyshy> I can just plug in an ethernet cord into my laptop and get gigE, then unplug and nothing drops
[02:02:15] <wolfyshy> :D

[03:40:14] <One-Trick> it uses their repo and its maintained meticulously, or so its stated
[03:40:54] <One-Trick> other than that, its not bringing anything spectacular. most security-minded users already use a lot of this

[03:49:21] <JustAberrant> you thought you had thought of everything, but unfortunately while you were out buying condoms and vodka, a rogue team of stone masons, plumbers, and a general contractor snuck into your house and replace your bed with a large ornate mall fountain

[03:49:55] <JustAberrant> you've got dinner cooking on the stove.. it'll be done in 30 minutes, but you have to stir it every 10 or it'll burn

[03:51:04] <HoneyDrops|Half> A live CD can be handy to provide a ro env if you are concerned about an infected system.

[06:47:48] <Starthunder> Because copying a swath of text, opening a new HTTP-client tab, navigating to a pastebin, and pasting it all is a real pain in the plot.
[06:49:32] <HoneyDrops|Half> Almost every pastebin service can be used via a script. 1. combine with xsel, 2. ???, 3. profit.
[06:49:50] <Googie> Sorry, ignore me. I have a dislike of IRCCloud. It's technically competent, but I dislike seeing a proprietary service "on the cloud" take over :/
