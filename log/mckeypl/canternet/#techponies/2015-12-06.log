[00:03:19] <Gladiolus> huh that's neat
[00:03:26] <Gladiolus> ddr2 and ddr3 on opposing slots- both at once?
[00:03:31] <Gladiolus> i doubt it that seems impossible lol
[00:03:41] <AppleDash> Noth both at once
[00:03:54] <AppleDash> Also, my system can draw 1.2kw if you ask it nicely
[00:08:06] <init3> kek https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVceXYwWwAAMNDU.png
[00:08:07] <WuBzY> when it does your like thats not nice! and you look your power bill :D
[00:10:32] <Colgate> init3: wat
[00:10:44] <init3> Right?
[00:10:52] <Colgate> I guess it depends on your definition of "major"?
[00:11:08] <Colgate> I define major as being the company with the most value in stock!
[00:11:15] <Colgate> all the rest of them are minor
[00:11:18] <Colgate> yup
[00:11:21] <init3> Right?
[00:11:39] <Colgate> I think apple still holds that title at least
[00:11:56] <init3> Or maybe they define "computer company" as a company that manufactures Macs. 
[00:12:58] <AppleDash> WuBzY: I haveno power bill
[00:13:24] <Sour_Sweet> O_o Why is that AppleDash?
[00:13:46] <AppleDash> Just a thing in the building I live in
[00:13:50] <Colgate> AppleDash has their own perpetual motion machine
[00:13:58] <Gladiolus> holy lol apple
[00:14:18] <AppleDash> All utilities are a fixed fee that is basically the average usage
[00:14:33] <Sour_Sweet> That seems like ... a horrible idea
[00:14:40] <AppleDash> If I start using like my entire service 24/7, everyone's bill might go up a couple dollars next year
[00:15:01] <AppleDash> (Actually, the meeting for that is soon, I should probably start now)
[00:15:45] <Sour_Sweet> That way there is no incentive to safe energy
[00:16:57] <Sour_Sweet> Also that would probably be a bad deal for me, cuz I use less energy than the average even though me computer is turned on almost all the time
[00:17:30] <AppleDash> It works out for me because I don't need to worry
[00:19:27] <JustAberrant> hehe, with an arrangement like that I imagine if you (or someone) started using insane amounts of power they'd investigate ;p
[00:19:42] <AppleDash> Mhm :P
[00:19:43] <JustAberrant> i.e. if you started running a massive btc mining operation or whatever
[00:19:48] <AppleDash> Thing is
[00:19:56] <AppleDash> There are no meters
[00:20:11] <AppleDash> I have been in the room where every unit on my wing of my floor joins
[00:20:23] <AppleDash> It's just a bunch of beefy breakers, one for each unit
[00:20:25] <AppleDash> No metering at all
[00:20:34] <JustAberrant> well yeah, but it's easy enough to go down the the breaker panel and amp clamp everyone's circuit until they find the culprit
[00:20:34] <Colgate> probably metered at the building itself
[00:20:40] <AppleDash> True :P
[00:23:20] * JustAberrant pays for power the ol` fashioned way :(
[00:23:36] <JustAberrant> actually that's not entirely true, I have time of day billing, which is pretty sweet
[00:24:00] * AppleDash somehow manages to get a clamp ammeter around JustAberrant
[00:24:11] <JustAberrant> power from 11pm to 7am is half the normal rate
[00:24:19] <JustAberrant> and all day sat and sunday
[00:25:11] <JustAberrant> meep ;p
[00:25:27] <JustAberrant> .. actually been thinking of hooking up a timer to my hot water heater
[00:25:33] <AppleDash> o.o
[00:25:33] <JustAberrant> no idea if it would be worth it though
[00:25:59] <JustAberrant> the downside is during winter, for part of the day the rate is 1.4* normal.. 
[00:26:18] <JustAberrant> but I did the math, and basically even if I don't change my electrical usage, I still come out on top by several hundred dollars
[00:26:44] * JustAberrant tends to do dishes at night anyway and laundry on weekends
[00:27:02] <JustAberrant> so it's actually a good deal :)
[00:27:24] * JustAberrant has an ETS system but the controller is broken and not sure if I want to get it fixed
[00:34:36] * Sakura waves at chat "Nyu!"
[00:39:10] * JustAberrant gently taps AppleDash i the toe with a ballpeen hammer
[00:39:16] <JustAberrant> * in the
[00:39:30] * AppleDash falls over
