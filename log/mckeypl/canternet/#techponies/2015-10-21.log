[00:35:48] <wolfyshy> I FINALLY FOUND THE QUOTE
[00:36:01] <wolfyshy> I was looking for it two months ago in related to a discussion we were having here about encryption and DRM
[00:36:19] <wolfyshy> I believe it was HoneyDrops that said "DRM is dumb because eventually, no matter what it is, it will cracked"
[00:36:27] <wolfyshy> Edgar Allen Poe said it best
[00:36:31] <wolfyshy> "It may be roundly asserted that human ingenuity cannot concoct a cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve."
[00:36:55] <wolfyshy> I love that quote and I think of it every time I read about DRM, but I couldn't find it
[00:36:56] <wolfyshy> but I did now :3
[00:38:25] <HoneyDrops> Well what is DRM?  Alice gives Bob a ciphertext and the key and tries to hide the key so Bob can only get the plaintext under Alice-approved circumstances.  However, the fact remains Bob has access to the ciphertext and the key, nothing will ever change that.

[01:20:46] <Gigabit> Odd.. For some reason port 5000 is opened on the repeating router
[01:23:45] <Sour_Sweet> So turns out when you use Cloudflares NS servers they'll generate a valid SSL cert for your domain name even if you don't use their CDN/WAF
[01:24:32] <Phase> well they are a CA
[01:25:38] <Sour_Sweet> Cloudflare is not a CA itself
[01:26:05] <Phase> in that they have trusted ca certs
[01:26:22] <Sour_Sweet> They use COMODO and (I don't exactly recall but think) GlobalSign
[01:28:24] <Sour_Sweet> In any case that means a valid cert in the hand of a third party without the actual need. Sounds like a bad idea
[01:29:04] <Phase> that actually could be quite bad
[01:29:20] <Phase> because you can add any domain you please to cloudflare
[01:29:46] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah but it'll only issue the cert when you set the NS records.
[01:29:48] <Phase> pass mitm'd connections to a cloudflare account you control, without cert pinning...
[01:30:20] <Phase> Sour_Sweet, so they dont generate it until it finds NS records?
[01:30:28] <Sour_Sweet> Yes
[01:30:51] <Phase> which implies domain control, so that's about equal to any other validation
[01:33:27] <Sour_Sweet> Correct, BUT you don't need to explicitly authorize them. So if you're a security sensitive person and only use their CDN for HTTP content (and not for HTTPS e.g. logins) they'll end up with a valid cert anyway.
[01:36:27] <Sour_Sweet> Which could mean trouble since a government might not be able to force them to forge a key, but they can very well request access to existing ones.
[01:37:02] <Phase> i wouldn't be using ssl as security against any government
[01:39:13] <Sour_Sweet> For passive attacks it works. Using pfs it even provides protection against "store now get key later" attacks.
[01:40:30] <Phase> sorta
[01:40:37] <Phase> the remote server could still just log session keys
[01:41:05] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah, but the remote server is my server ;-)
[01:42:35] <Sour_Sweet> Sensitive applications use key pinning, so they're safe. I still don't like the idea of somebody else having a valid cert without my explicit permission.
[01:42:59] <Sour_Sweet> Or better the need for them.

[02:45:05] <HoneyDrops> http://www.eevblog.com/2014/02/24/element-14-holding-orders-based-on-us-government-watch-list/
[02:45:41] <Colgate> so... you just think anything government can just look at your stuff willy nilly?
[02:45:41] <Phase> unless you count something like ssh but i don't pick and chose based on resistance to attacks from governments
[02:46:31] <Phase> Colgate, if they had reason they have the resources
[02:46:55] <Colgate> yes, but you might as well make it as expensive as possible for them, no?
[02:46:56] <HoneyDrops> I trust ssl, however I may not trust the other end (which is in many ways the larger problem.)
[02:47:01] <HoneyDrops> ^^
[02:48:02] <HoneyDrops> You cannot stop a determined force with effectively unlimited resources.  However, the current state of the net makes it way easier that it should ever have been to monitor on a mass scale.
[02:49:04] <Phase> Colgate, with SSL, they not only have more control over the average ssl endpoint, but can easily get certs made if they need to MITM
[02:49:37] <Colgate> depends on how you verify the cert, sure
[02:50:27] <HoneyDrops> Our goal is not to utterly thwart every attempt, but to deny them any and all low hanging fruit and restrict them to only making targeted efforts, thus effectively limiting them to cases where they have legitmate cause to bother with the effort.
[02:50:41] <Phase> plus within their jurisdiction, its completely legal to do so (within reason (hopefully))
[02:51:18] <HoneyDrops> The entire system of trust with ssl certs has problems, but that is not insurmountable.
[02:54:01] * Phase wishes name contraints were widely deployed
[02:56:07] <Phase> though i guess letsencrypt avoids the issue
[02:56:33] <HoneyDrops> I still think we need to move away from the concept of centralized trust arbiters.
[02:57:35] <Phase> To what?
[02:57:54] <HoneyDrops> Keys are self-signed, and all you know is the signer of the cert is consistent.  For things like banking, you are hand-delivered it by a bank employee on a RO USB drive, and you load it yourself on your system yourself and those keys verify all network services for that bank.
[02:59:52] <HoneyDrops> It puts the decision of trust in the hands of the user, where it belongs.
[03:04:43] <HoneyDrops> For anything not absolutely critical, a web-fo-trust model would be ideal.

[18:12:35] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: the problem is with privacy and security: there is no way to pass it off completely.  There is no way around the fact that the user must be involved in security.  You can add all the tools, policies, and advice you want, but the user is part of the system, and often the weakest point.  They have to care to follow the policies and advice and use the tools, otherwise they do
[18:12:37] <HoneyDrops> nothing.  I also don't demand a high level of knowledge in my fields (which would be physics, btw), but at least a minimal amount of familiarity with most every field in order to have a basic competency when dealing with anything that touches on those domains.  You should have a grasp of basic bio, physics, chem, math/CS, computers, electronics, optics, medicine, logic & formal arguments,
[18:12:41] <HoneyDrops> etc.  More knowledge always better equips you for handling the world.  At least know enough to know when to defer to an expert, rather than overestimate your knowledge and understanding.

[23:19:52] <Moonlightning> So, #techponies, I'm thinking of running a simple file distribution thing on my server.
[23:20:59] <Moonlightning> Very simple. My idea is that I'll be able to specify a list of temporary usernames and passwords (and maybe IP addresses), and one user will be able to submit a request with a username+password pair and be served a file, once.
[23:23:20] <wolfyshy> so 0bin for files?
[23:23:30] <Moonlightning> Huh?
[23:23:45] <wolfyshy> http://0bin.net
[23:23:46] <PinkiePieBot> [ 0bin - encrypted pastebin ]
[23:24:13] <Moonlightning> > encrypted pastebin
[23:24:15] <Moonlightning> > no TLS support
[23:24:33] <Moonlightning> Yes, like 0bin, but not like 0bin.
[23:24:52] <Moonlightning> also, the page doesn't show much more than a header. Does it require Js? Mine won't require Js.
[23:25:01] <Moonlightning> Very simple in terms of the technologies.
[23:25:11] <wolfyshy> that is how it works
[23:25:20] <wolfyshy> the key is generated on the client using js
[23:25:23] <Moonlightning> HTML form, you submit it, server authenticates, serves file.
[23:25:26] <Moonlightning> No Js required.
[23:25:29] <Moonlightning> Nothing required 'cept basic HTML.
[23:25:33] <Moonlightning> and TLS, of course
[23:25:42] <wolfyshy> you give the url and the generated key hash to who you want to view the paste
[23:25:47] <wolfyshy> and they put it in
[23:25:54] <wolfyshy> it decrypts on the client side (using js)
[23:26:06] <wolfyshy> and bam, the server never once sees the key
[23:26:08] <HoneyDrops> That is actually a valid use-case for js. 
[23:26:33] <wolfyshy> it is also destroyed after one view (unless you allow it to be viewed multiple times)
[23:26:37] <wolfyshy> so yeah I like it
[23:26:51] <wolfyshy> open source too
[23:26:55] <wolfyshy> you can run your own on https if you want
[23:27:41] <Moonlightning> …maybe I'll do that
[23:27:48] <Moonlightning> but as an extra feature, after the initial thing.
