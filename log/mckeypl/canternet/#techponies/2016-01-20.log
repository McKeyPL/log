[23:45:42] <CompuDesktop> what is the linux-firmware package and is it ok to update it with apt-get upgrade?
[23:49:36] <Kinsley> Linux-firmware is a psuedo package that points to the latest version and it's supposed to updated with your kernel.
[23:49:38] <HoneyDrops> It is all of the icky binary firmware
[23:50:48] <Kinsley> So assuming you haven't held your kernel package to certain version, go ahead and update it with the rest of the kernel packages
[23:52:40] <CompuDesktop> its the only package that apt-get reports needs updating
[23:53:30] <CompuDesktop> its rather large for a package, 24.5 MB
[23:54:03] <HoneyDrops> Well it's the firmware for hundreds of devices.
[23:54:27] <CompuDesktop> well that was fast
[23:54:33] <CompuDesktop> suddenly theres a google chrome update
[23:54:43] <CompuDesktop> guess it just got released seconds ago
[23:55:13] <CompuDesktop> HoneyDrops: so is it something that would be needed for my computer to boot tho? just wondering
[23:55:55] <HoneyDrops> It is needed for some hardware support
[23:56:48] <CompuDesktop> new version chrome 48, apparently i have chrome 47
[23:57:00] <CompuDesktop> wonder what the update is
[23:58:11] <johnsey> firwmare is rarely needed for booting, more typically for wifi adapters, dvb adapters, soundcards, etc
[23:59:03] <johnsey> you can check dmesg for firware being autoloaded
[23:59:05] <HoneyDrops> Is intel CPU microcode included in it?
[23:59:23] <johnsey> i think it's separate
[23:59:28] * HoneyDrops is too lazy to check equery
[23:59:37] * HoneyDrops nods.
