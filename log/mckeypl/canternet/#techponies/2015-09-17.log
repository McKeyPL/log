[02:16:45] <Starthunder> How bad of an idea is it for me to use my VPS as the authoritative server or whatever for my domain? >3>
[02:17:28] <Seoson> Operating your own name server is a bad idea
[02:17:48] <Seoson> You will need at least two servers in 2 different subnets
[02:18:45] <Seoson> And you should make sure that there is a decent distance between those
[02:18:59] <Starthunder> At least two authoritative nameservers? I can't just run my own server that's authoritative for my domain, and let other servers be…non-authoritative?
[02:19:14] <Seoson> Depends on the TLD
[02:19:29] <Seoson> For .de domains you need a minimum of 2 in different subnets
[02:19:32] <Starthunder> .net
[02:20:03] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[02:20:11] <Seoson> I don't know about .net . However if you cannot meet those you shouldn't do it anyway
[02:20:38] <Seoson> It's bad practice
[02:20:48] <Starthunder> Why?
[02:21:00] <Starthunder> I mean…if the authoritative server's down, doesn't everything else just run on cached records?
[02:21:07] <Starthunder> Until they expire?
[02:21:13] <Seoson> Because you create an additional signle point of failure without any meaningful benefit
[02:21:33] <Seoson> There are hoster that will do DNS free for you
[02:21:49] <Seoson> Even if you don't like the one that comes with your domain
[02:22:06] <Starthunder> I see a meaningful benefit—full control over the domain. I can put in whatever records I like; I'm not limited to what some web panel deems valid.
[02:22:20] <Starthunder> A single point of failure, sure, but isn't the latency on it large enough?
[02:22:48] <Starthunder> If my server goes down, shouldn't everything be fine for long enough that I can hopefully get it back up before anything actually breaks?
[02:23:26] <init3> It is not a hard requiement for any of the common TLDs to have two in different subnets. 
[02:24:07] <Seoson> I don't what this has to do with latency. A good DNS provider will let you do almost anything you want.  Last question depends on the TTL
[02:24:29] <Seoson> I don't know*
[02:24:52] <init3> Often times both name servers are on one box with many smaller websites, which is bad practice sure but consider many people run email, web, db and whatnot all on one box anyway. 
[02:25:06] <Starthunder> Well, because it's not like if all the authoritative servers suddenly stop replying to queries, the entire domain suddenly stops resolving
[02:25:11] <init3> If the DNS is held up but nothing else is it is pointless. 
[02:25:29] <Starthunder> Non-authoritative servers will continue to return the previous records for /some/ period of time.
[02:25:40] <Seoson> Apart from that hosting a nameserver is not necessarily easy. Well init3 what about mail?
[02:25:59] <Starthunder> I don't have any major services, anyway. :p
[02:26:01] <Seoson> If they find no MX record they won't bounce I guess
[02:26:10] <init3> Yeah it will

[02:26:38] <Starthunder> that's about it
[02:26:38] <Colgate> /shrug, I used to run bind, didn't find it that difficult to run
[02:26:44] <Colgate> certainly easier than a mail server
[02:26:54] <init3> It will bounce immediately though in fairness, instead of being queued for resend 
[02:27:02] <init3> bind is super easy to run
[02:27:09] <Starthunder> It /is/ running a DNS server, but that's currently set to only reply on loopback and VPN

[02:28:11] <init3> DNS amplification DoS. Look it up.
[02:28:23] <Phase> ShivalWolf, isn't that exactly the current situation?
[02:28:32] <Phase> and yeah, DNS ampliifcation
[02:28:38] <ShivalWolf> Phase: all the big ones have it off by default
[02:28:47] <ShivalWolf> problem is stupid people reconfigure to turn it on becuase they dont know what they are doing
[02:28:47] <Seoson> I basically see no reason to use your own nameserver
[02:29:12] <Colgate> Starthunder: yeah, it should
[02:29:17] <Seoson> Sure I have a bind running as well. It even has virtual domains, but I wouldn't run it gfor the public
[02:29:25] <ShivalWolf> though theres alot of stupid vendors with their modem/router devices where they leave recursion on the wan interface

[02:34:00] <ShivalWolf> its funny how bad some of these things are
[02:34:03] <Seoson> Thankfully open relays died a painful death ^^
[02:34:18] <Starthunder> Do `NS` records indicate /authoritative/ nameservers?
[02:34:24] <Seoson> Yes
[02:34:35] <Starthunder> Ahhhh.
[02:34:46] <init3> Starthunder: afaik NS records are the only thing your registrar has to have stored functionally. The registrar has both the IP and the name of the name server. 
[02:35:21] <init3> So authoritative just means for the domain itself.
[02:35:32] <Starthunder> I thought authoritative meant…
[02:35:35] * Starthunder …pauses.
[02:35:45] <init3> Like registrar level?
[02:35:54] <Starthunder> Not registrar…more /owner/-level.
[02:36:33] <Starthunder> This is the /official/ A record for foo.example.com. It's /definitely/ up to date and it's what the owner of example.com put in there.
[02:36:50] <init3> Oh
[02:36:57] <init3> nothing like that. 
[02:37:25] <init3> Unfortunately. DNSSEC is a thing to kind of make that sort of thing a reality but it's a long way out. 
[02:37:36] <init3> if IPV6 is taking this long....
[02:37:40] <Starthunder> Well, obviously without the guarantees crypto provides
[02:37:47] <Starthunder> but, y'know, besides that

[02:39:47] <init3> Ahh
[02:39:47] <Starthunder> Anyway, what's authoritative mean?
[02:40:07] <init3> Not caching is the simpliest way I'd say to expmain it. 
[02:42:39] <Gigabit> shit, VB won't show 64 bit OSes
[02:42:55] <init3> Hey I'm kind of curious though since I mentioned ipv6. Colgate: by chance is there an easy way you can (if you'd be willing) to pull the percent of connections to canternet that are v6? I /should/ be right now but something in my ipv6 stack is unhappy right now.

[02:43:48] <init3> That's not too bad really, though I guess considering ipv6 is pre 2000 it kind of is.

[02:44:36] <Colgate> init3: I literally just did /map and used the usercount on derpy

[02:45:20] <init3> Oh
[02:45:25] <Starthunder> an authoritative server (from a moral standpoint) is one that always accurately reflects the owner's will
[02:45:46] <init3> Okay. that makes sense then.

[02:52:01] <Phase> dns has a replication mechanism
[02:52:06] <init3> If they are set to^ that
[02:52:08] <init3> As slaves
[02:52:27] <init3> But you are replicating the entire server, not just a zone. 
[02:52:40] <Starthunder> Hmm?
[02:52:59] * Phase hasn't actually set up replication
[02:53:00] <Starthunder> I mean, I don't /run/ multiple DNS servers. So I'd have to get someone with many of them to agree to do that.
[02:53:20] * Phase would love a service that just runs slave dns servers
[02:53:36] <Starthunder> I can't do that? D:
[02:53:37] <init3> Well what I mean is you aren't just replicating yourdomain.com. DNS replication means replicating all zones on that server.

[02:54:07] <Starthunder> Err…well, the only zone that I own is blackl.net.

[02:55:17] <init3> That could be. 
[02:55:36] <Phase> not a complicated replication mechanism

[05:40:18] <Starthunder> Oh, I use the /Transfer DNS to Webhost/ to transfer DNS to my private server.
[05:40:22] <Starthunder> Okay. That makes sense. 9.9
[05:40:24] <Starthunder> Thanks, though, Rylee.
[05:40:53] <Starthunder> …wait…now I have a prerequisite paradox.
[05:41:02] <Starthunder> …oh no wait, no I don't.
[05:41:33] <Rylee> might want to look into the concept of glue records
[05:42:19] <Starthunder> Glue records are just the address records for the hostnames used in NS records, right?
[05:42:46] <Starthunder> …right, but they need to be hosted by the next level down
[05:42:51] <Rylee> sort of. they're records that the delegating server can return that are on the delegated domain. 
[05:42:53] <Starthunder> how do I make that happen again? 6_9
[05:42:58] <Rylee> not a clue w/ namecheap

[05:47:35] <Rylee> you're able to glue the same IP to different records and use them as two, maybe
[05:47:37] <Rylee> I think I do that
[05:49:47] <Starthunder> I mean…after I do this, I won't depend on Namecheap for anything except keeping the registration active, yeah?
[05:49:52] <Starthunder> It'll just be between the .net nameservers and me?

[05:52:34] <Rylee> basically
[05:53:36] <Starthunder> If your two-names-one-IP trick doesn't work, can I do something stupid like assigning a name to the unspecified address and using that as the second nameserver?
[05:53:44] <Starthunder> or does it check in with both specified nameservers or something? x.x
[05:54:49] <Rylee> it shuffles between them; yes
[05:55:46] <Starthunder> Heh. If I had a v6 adderss, I could probably put that on the second name and that'd /have/ to work

[05:58:47] <Starthunder> From somepony else's forum thread…
[06:00:04] <Starthunder> > It appears that they're not registered as private nameservers. To resolve this issue, you can contact your hosting provider and ask them to register these nameservers at a registry level (or create glue records for them).
[06:01:33] <Starthunder> …oh.
[06:01:44] <Starthunder> welp, okay, sugar-belle's IP is now ns1
[06:07:57] <Starthunder> Oh, what
[06:08:16] <Starthunder> Okay, so the authoritative nameserver is apparently dns1.registrar-servers.com right now
[06:08:39] <Starthunder> I added ns1->69.90.132.107 using their register-nameserver thing
[06:08:46] <Starthunder> and it's sitting there like yes, it was added
[06:09:13] <Starthunder> but if I run `host`, querying dns1.registrar-servers.com about ns1.blackl.net, it gives me NXDOMAIN.
[06:09:15] <Starthunder> WTF.
[06:09:27] <Starthunder> How can you be an authoritative nameserver and not return up-to-date information??
[06:12:02] <Starthunder> YAY~!
[06:12:12] <Starthunder> okay, added ns1 and dns1 both pointing to Sugar's IP
[06:12:24] <Starthunder> and it finally did the transfer, to those two 9.9
[06:17:38] <Starthunder> So…Sugar should be authoritative for my domain now, yeah?
[06:17:50] <Starthunder> Because, according to `host`, she's not setting the authoritative flag :<
[06:24:27] <Starthunder> that seems a configuration error though

[06:29:08] <Starthunder> Oh, that's odd. Authoritative flag's set for queries about sugar-belle, but not about @

[18:42:26] <johnsey> well, you're free to type the final dot

[19:13:33] <Seoson> bloody insecure XSS filters make my life harder than it needs to be -.-

[19:26:30] <Starthunder> Should I add SRV records for services that are intended for and available to only a select few, not the general public?
[19:26:40] <Starthunder> Like SSH and these VPN servers

[19:27:35] <Starthunder> …well, not SSH, 'cos that's host-specific
[19:29:22] <Starthunder> Apple seems to do that, though—it uses things like _afp._afpovertcp.example.local, which must mean something's got SRV records for that, even though it isn't public
[19:30:28] <Colgate> not very many services actually support srv records
[19:31:03] <Starthunder> yes, well I will
[19:31:27] <Starthunder> (^2 Because of this, we should really have a record type in between CNAME and SRV >.> )
[20:05:31] <Starthunder> Is having a subdomain with all private nameserver and address records okay?
