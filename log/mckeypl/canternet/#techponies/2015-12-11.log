[01:54:50] <Sour_Sweet> I prefer infusion ;-)
[01:59:57] <Sombra> So now that I have more imput, do I want an nvidia shield console or a steam link?
[02:00:38] <Sour_Sweet> Depends
[02:01:02] <Sombra> Depends on what
[02:02:09] <Sour_Sweet> Sorry had to chat in TS³
[02:02:40] <Sour_Sweet> iirc the shield console can run games on it's own. The steam link need gigbit ethernet and a powerful pc
[02:02:51] <Sour_Sweet> needs*
[02:03:31] <Sour_Sweet> Also with a shield console you'll need a nVidia graphics card now and in the future
[02:04:29] <Sour_Sweet> Keep in mind though that the shield console can run games on it's own we're talking about android games
[02:04:56] <Sour_Sweet> If it even can. I'm not up-to-date on that
[02:05:49] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah it's android
[02:09:06] <Sour_Sweet> I'd personally spend the money on better PC equipment anyway to play on my pc screen and use a FireTV stick for media (not game) streaming
[02:09:16] <Sour_Sweet> Or a FireTV Stick
[02:10:25] <Sour_Sweet> ehh ... FireTV or FireTV Stick.
