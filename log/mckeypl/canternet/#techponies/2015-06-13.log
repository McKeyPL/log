[04:00:43] <init3> So it looks like I may be forced to miss the episode tomorrow. What I most enjoy about watching it live is the Twitter and IRC reactions. I'm wondering if you guys have any ideas to 'record' and replay the aforementioned conversations in real time when I watch it later? I am thinking of simply opening everything and just recording my desktop but the question of the quality and actual video size (as in dimensions encompassing two monitors, IRC 
[04:00:45] <init3> client, brower and the stream) comes into play here. 
[04:00:59] <init3> As well as the issue of Twitter not automatically displaying new tweets. 
[04:01:09] <init3> Any ideas?
[04:01:38] <Phase> people have (or have had) the irc bit covered
[04:01:43] * Phase did it once
[04:02:08] <init3> Just a desktop recording type thing?
[04:02:21] <Phase> overcomplicated but yeah
[04:02:33] <Phase> had chrome in xvfb and all sorts of things
[04:03:44] <init3> Well, does anyone know of something I could use for a real-time twitter feed with full text (not just some "3 new tweets" bullshit?
[04:06:33] <init3> I almost feel like I could write something to do this with the API (as in a twitter replay, IRC would be pretty trivial) but it is probably more trouble than it's worth. 
[04:07:03] <init3> Also I am a shitty programmer so if I'd actually finish before tomorrow is anyone's guess. 
[04:15:18] <init3> Hey, there's an auto refresh extension. Now for how to record my whole desktop. Any suggestions? (Linux)
[04:21:50] <Webster> I know of one. I think it's desktoprecorder or something.
[04:22:04] <Webster> Used it with a browser plug-in as the UI though.

[05:49:04] <init3> _desu_: It looks nice though. 
[05:49:31] <_desu_> Glad you think so :)
[05:49:32] <init3> I am not a huge Tumblr user but one thing I thing might be cool is the ability to reverse the display order. 
[05:49:43] <_desu_> Oldest to newest?
[05:49:45] <init3> Aka chronological order
[05:49:46] <init3> Yeah
[05:49:51] <init3> FOr story blogs
[05:49:55] <init3> Just a thought. 
[05:50:22] <init3> Seems to be those are the ones I personally would most want to see protected from getting deleted 
[05:50:38] <_desu_> Right now it goes newest to oldest but that is a good idea and can easily be implemented. We will add that as an option. :)
[05:50:52] <init3> I figured it wouldn't be too hard. 
[05:51:08] <init3> What is your backend if you don't mind my curiosity?
[05:51:19] <_desu_> Python
[05:51:36] <init3> Ahh ok. You use a DB in there too?
[05:52:11] <_desu_> Well python is the bulk of it. There's a little PHP and yes we use postgres
[05:52:26] <init3> Ahh ok. 
[05:53:06] <init3> RDMSes are my guilty pleasure. 
[05:53:12] <init3> So I had to ask ;p

[05:56:27] <init3> It is a neat idea. I mean there have been a few blogs I am really bummed got deleted for whatever reason. 
[05:56:43] <init3> Especially the onese that are gone as the result of SJWs.
[05:56:48] <init3> *ones
[05:58:35] <_desu_> Yeah that's why my friend really wanted to get this project rolling. Before he would run httrack every few days on the blogs he liked, but that created tons of duplicate data
[05:59:21] <init3> Right. 
[06:01:19] <init3> Hmm... you don't grab tags though do you?
[06:02:35] <_desu_> We do we just haven't figured out the best way to process them yet
[06:02:52] <init3> Eh, if you don't already grab them it isn't worth the trouble for how often I think it'd get used, but the option to search or filter by them might be neat.
[06:02:59] <init3> I see
[06:03:49] <init3> Man, you are giving me the itch to code... something. 
[06:04:03] <_desu_> Like what? :P
[06:04:35] <init3> There is the problem.
[06:04:41] <init3> I have no fucking cue. 
[06:05:02] <init3> Honestly I am not any good at it but I get a kick out of it for sure. 
[06:05:27] <_desu_> I need to figure out how to use sphinxsearch with postgres for this... :(
[06:05:45] <_desu_> Unless one of you know of a search backend that's better
[06:06:17] <_desu_> And making things is fun, especially after days of debugging you have something that works :P
[06:06:34] <init3> Right. 
[06:07:22] <init3> And I don't. Mind you, when I was using SQL for the most part I was like 15. 
[06:08:02] <init3> I am kind of pissed with myself I let myself forget most of it. I mean, I sailed through a SQL class in college but that was super simple stuff. 
[06:08:02] <_desu_> Ugh. For whatever reason the database connection won't terminate and then after a few from runs we reach the connection limit....
[06:08:31] <_desu_> And oh fun. SQL at least was useful but now things like Mongo are becoming the trend
[06:08:51] <_desu_> And I don't know Mongo or any other weird dB system worth anything haha
[06:09:06] <init3> I am way, way more familiar with MySQL than Post. 
[06:09:15] <Googie> Mongo has been a bit of a fad.
[06:09:48] <_desu_> It's not that much of a learning curve imo
[06:10:02] <init3> I know the syntax is similar in post. 
[06:10:40] <Sol> I like Mongo. But maybe it's because I already loved JSON.
[06:10:41] <init3> But I meant more of the system configuration side. I could take a server with a 15-20 load, make a few my.cnf tweaks and have that bitch under 0.5
[06:11:36] <init3> Not to say I don't know SQL.
[06:11:58] <init3> I just don't really use it in my job at all. Getting server load averages down on the other hand...
[06:12:21] <init3> But there are better options than MySQL now.

[06:21:10] <init3> Heh. I feel like I stopped really learning web technologies (on a programming level) after like 2005. 
[06:21:29] <init3> You see, I became a freelance web developer for a while. 
[06:21:55] <init3> So I figured what it was all about and noped the fuck out. 
[06:22:04] <init3> But it is a lot different now. 
[06:22:06] <Sol> MySQL is still my goto for most web stuff. PHP/MySQL has the benefit of actually working on any old web host haha
[06:22:18] <_desu_> True
[06:22:33] <_desu_> Well thanks for your feedback everyone. I really appreciate it
[06:22:36] <init3> Yeah, PHP/MySQL is probably the only think I'm passable with. 
[06:22:44] <init3> No problem _desu_.
[06:23:53] <Sol> Been messing a lot with Laravel lately
[06:24:53] <init3> So to test my contingency plan for if I can't be around when ep 100 airs I had been recording one of my monitors for the last hour to see the file size and system load it'd cause. It is pretty weird to watch how you uuse your computer without actually using it. 
[06:25:12] <init3> I feel like it looks like I tpe way slower on video than when I am actually doing it. 
[06:25:22] <_desu_> I've go to take a final while it airs....
[06:25:31] <_desu_> *I've got to go
[06:25:40] <init3> Yeah. I might have to be pouring some concrete. 
[06:25:44] <_desu_> Good thing it's not in English... >.>
[06:25:56] <init3> Heh
[06:26:36] <Googie> PostgreSQL actually has pretty good native JSON support these days from what I've heard.
[06:27:09] <init3> But I don't like missing twitter and IRC reactions the most. I can DL the ep no problem, that is a non-issue but if I have it all recorded I'll just sync a HD video with the streams, account for commercials and I'll get the best of both worlds. 
[06:27:11] <Phase> yeah, json and jsonb row types
[06:27:31] <Phase> there's also hstore and xml for unstructured data in a row

[06:38:23] <_desu_> How big of a problem does it get server wise? Seems with all these people flooding the chat you would get a netsplit or something like that
[06:38:34] <init3> I dunno.
[06:38:43] <_desu_> Given how many people are here
[06:38:56] <init3> LEt me see something. 
[06:39:26] <Googie> The server population can roughly double
[06:39:41] <Googie> We've got capacity for way /way/ more people though.

[06:39:51] <PinkiePieBot> [ Canternet IRC Network - Stats ]
[06:40:11] <init3> I mean, it looks like that channel peaked at 348, which isn't too bad. 
[06:40:27] <init3> But I know that isn't the only channel that peaks during an ep.
[06:41:00] <_desu_> That's good :)
[06:41:10] <Googie> Each of our servers is probably capable of hitting at least 10k users each. There's just more for redundancy.
[06:41:51] <init3> Oh, there are total network stats. 
[06:42:28] <init3> Gonna have to have a look at it after tomorrow. 
[06:42:41] <Googie> Hehehe, those stats seem to be wrong. /lusers during the premiere this season hit 1999 concurrent users.

[06:44:53] <init3> And I don't think I can handle my laptop and a concrete mixer at the same time. 
[06:44:54] <Googie> It's pretty neat actually just how many people you can pack into a single IRCd if you are really determined.
[06:45:33] <Googie> I've heard about people running 60k users on a single InspIRCd instance in production (running a chat backend for a f2p game)
[06:45:38] <_desu_> What's the easiest component to saturate on an increase network?
[06:46:03] <init3> You mean IRC?

[06:46:13] <init3> I though it was a phone thing. 
[06:46:28] <_desu_> >inb4 disk space :P
[06:46:30] <Googie> It's really a good question. Most of the problems tend to be redundancy more than capacity.
[06:46:47] <init3> I honestly don't know. Most of the datacenters I worked for explicitly banned IRC servers. 
[06:47:10] <_desu_> I mean you wouldn't think it was network io? It's just text right?

[06:47:30] <init3> That's what I am thinking.
