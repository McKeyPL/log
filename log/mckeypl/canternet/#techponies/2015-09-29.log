[00:00:23] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> so for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction still holds true even for differentials in displacement
[00:00:32] <CrassyPaddles> this makes no sense, I'm reading something that says that coefficient of friction generally doesn't change with surface area

[00:01:15] <PinkiePieBot> [ How Surface Area Affects the Force of Friction - For Dummies ]
[00:02:22] <Webster> Coefficient of friction isn't the same as the force of friction.
[00:03:42] <CrassyPaddles> I know
[00:05:32] <CrassyPaddles> if in two cases, where one has higher friction, yet the normal force is the same, the only possibility is that the coefficient of friction changes.
[00:06:58] <CrassyPaddles> yet the only thing that changes is that I had less surface area in contact with the floor, and more in the other.
[00:07:15] <CrassyPaddles> but I'm reading that surface area does not affect the coefficient of friction.
[00:14:08] <CrassyPaddles> I guess in theory, practice is the same as theory
[00:14:35] <Webster> Surface area affects the force of friction.
[00:14:49] <CrassyPaddles> it would seem so
[00:14:53] <Webster> It is so.
[00:15:01] <CrassyPaddles> no, I know so, I have first hand experience with it

[07:13:49] *** Lapsus sets mode: -qo Lapsus Lapsus
[07:14:58] <Moonlightning> Hmmâ€¦so does this amateur radio thing run over TCP or UDP?
[07:15:48] <Lapsus> I did have one of the usb tuners running over tcp so that I could listen from anywhere on the lan, but apparently it's decided that tuning is for chumps

[07:16:33] * JustAberrant splits his look between Lapsus and Moonlightning 
[07:17:54] <Crimson_Tail> hm, radio
[07:18:57] <Lapsus> yeah apparently the range selection is broken somehow
[07:19:16] <Lapsus> er, the tuner is broken but the range selection works, derp
[07:19:45] <Lapsus> so I can listen to 99.9fm and pretty much nothing else
[07:19:59] <Moonlightning> 96.9
[07:20:20] <Moonlightning> Derp Radio :D
[07:20:25] <Lapsus> miiiiight try to justify ordering another sdr stick from dealextreme
[07:20:26] <Crimson_Tail> I have a radio that can do short wave and long wave, besides AM and FM

[07:43:20] <Datalink> http://www.arrl.org/ has educational resources, I personally used http://aa9pw.com/ to practice the test questions, then studied a lot of the cultural side of it as well

[07:43:43] <Datalink> hm, Pinkie grabs the last URL not the first, curious.
[07:43:47] <Moonlightning> png should do layers. That would be /awesome!/ People could publish their art with trivially-removable backgrounds. :p
[07:43:49] <Datalink> Moonlightning, that'd be too easy
[07:45:35] <Datalink> Lapsus, oh you're in Canada? the info should be similar but I don't know who the amateur radio group is for Canada.
[07:45:50] <Lapsus> It's the RAC over here
[07:46:24] <Lapsus> as far as studying goes, a lot of the stuff is the same, but IIRC the test is longer
[07:46:56] <Datalink> a lot should be related, culture wise too, especially since the US and Canada share a boarder
[07:47:33] <Crimson_Tail> I think I quickly learned how to read a binary clock
[07:48:20] <Moonlightning> proper binary, or binary-translated fields?
[07:49:07] <Lapsus> okay anyways bed
[07:49:22] <Lapsus> Datalink: talk more radio with me later :3
[07:49:33] <Datalink> night, sure
[07:50:10] <Crimson_Tail> Ya know, these kinda binary clocks http://www.incrediblethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/binary-clock.jpg
[07:56:57] <Moonlightning> So binary-translated fields.
[07:57:09] <Moonlightning> â€¦ehhâ€¦I guess that's still valid.

[19:05:07] <Colgate> "system interrupts" using 20% of the CPU on this machine seems excessive
[19:08:01] <Dusk> I've had that before
[19:08:19] <Dusk> Back when I had my 770 and integrated GPU on at the same time with displays on both
[19:13:54] <Colgate> this is on a server
[19:39:11] <johnsey> Colgate: a good time for watching /proc/interrupts
[19:40:02] <Colgate> hmm
[19:40:21] <Colgate> C:\Windows\System32\proc\interrupts doesn't work
[19:40:51] <johnsey> uhm that's because you tilted the /!
[19:40:55] <johnsey> or something
[19:41:15] <johnsey> ;)

[21:03:41] <init3> Well lookie who has the balls to join twitter: https://twitter.com/Snowden
[21:03:42] <PinkiePieBot> [ Edward Snowden (@Snowden) | Twitter ]
[21:04:56] <Colgate> "has the balls"
[21:05:10] <Colgate> didn't realize making a social media account took any sort of courage
[21:06:12] <init3> I dunno. Would you feel safe to post on an /American/ site when you are so rabidly wanted by said country?I don't care how many proxies you use, that's gutsy to me.
[21:07:26] <init3> I mean, I guess he is in a better position than most to know the capabilities of the government in tracking someone but shit. I think that takes cojones.
[21:07:30] <Colgate> sure, why not?
[21:07:35] <Colgate> what are they going to do?
[21:07:46] <Colgate> they already know where he's at, he isn't exactly hiding
[21:08:38] <init3> Oh? I hadn't realized that. I thought it was a "somewhere in Moscow" thing. 
[21:09:16] <Colgate> wonder if they posted any proof that it is him
[21:10:27] <init3> Well it's a "verified" account, whatever that means. I heard about the account through NPR, which isn't known to (though I realize it isn't impossible) publish bullshit. 
[21:11:21] <Colgate> without a digitally signed message from him, I wouldn't believe it
[21:11:26] <Colgate> he should know that
[21:12:00] <Colgate> nothing on that twitter account proves it is him, so for now, I will assume it isn't
[21:14:44] <sniperfox> Did everypony preorder Nexus 6P?
[21:18:46] <init3> Yeah, the twitter verification process does seem prone to abuse. The media is exploding over this assuming it is him. I'll take my chances and give it a follow :p
[21:20:23] <Colgate> didn't even hear about the nexus until now
[21:20:41] <Colgate> eh, don't need a new phone, mine is still working :P
[21:22:44] <Colgate> what is an "Android Sensor Hub"?
[21:23:30] <Colgate> or a "Hall sensor"?
[21:25:22] <init3> Fuck sake is that supposed t be a phone?
[21:26:13] <init3> Why are they getting so big? 
[21:26:31] <sniperfox> It's same height as prior nexus 6 but thinner width and less thick
[21:26:32] <Colgate> android 6P is too big, yes
[21:26:55] <sniperfox> Sensor hub lets you pick it up off of your desk and get a low power black and white display of your notifications
[21:26:57] <Colgate> I like the nexus 4 size :(
[21:27:08] <sniperfox> as well as use "OK google" without touching it
[21:27:12] <Colgate> eh, not needed, I have a smart watch now :P

[21:51:15] <Lapsus> Colgate: If you had ok google turned on, do you think this hilight would trigger it? :v
[21:52:18] <Colgate> why would it?
[21:52:40] <Lapsus> I was assuming your phone still read hilights out loud
[21:52:49] <Colgate> haha, dd printed a ":(" face when it failed
[21:53:04] <Colgate> that isn't related to the google now stuff at all
[21:53:13] <Colgate> I've never had google now enabled, I don't like it
[21:54:41] <Lapsus> No, I was wondering if it would be triggered by the phone itself saying "OK Google" if it were enabled
[21:54:59] <Lapsus> I would try, but mine's dead
[21:57:43] <Colgate> dunno, that would require me installing google now :P
