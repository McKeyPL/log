[01:19:12] <Moonlightning> how do I get lldb to step relative to the frame I've selected?

[01:23:13] <Seoson> We just found a critical security vulnerability in the MC Spigot/Bukkit Plugin AutoIn. If you're running this plugin deactivate autologin now!
[01:28:44] * JustAberrant opts not to
[01:30:03] <Sol> *gasp* Security vulnerabilities on an offline-mode server? Impossible
[01:30:29] <JustAberrant> minecraft _is_ a critical vulnerability
[01:30:47] <JustAberrant> unless it lets you do something outside the scope of miencraft, I mostly ignore them :>
[01:31:30] <Sol> But disabling its own checks to make sure people own the game and are who they say they are doesn't help
[01:32:26] <Seoson> Our server runs in online mode :P 
[01:33:01] <Seoson> We allow cracked players to join at the same time. This is the purpose of AutoIn
[01:34:44] <Sol> Must do some low level stuff with the server code then
[01:35:02] <Seoson> Yes modify packets to be exact.
[01:39:41] <Seoson> It works very well. The dev only messed up a convenience part. We're in touch with him to get it fixed. The exploit is complicated and works only under very certain circumstances. When it works however it has heavy consequences.

[02:28:57] * JustAberrant desn't use the plugin anyway, just curious
[02:37:21] <GigaWork> is there software for linux that can display notifications of events you tell it on certain days?
[02:38:28] <JustAberrant> I've actually noticed a distinct lack of decent calendar programs for linux
[02:38:32] <JustAberrant> like there's plenty
