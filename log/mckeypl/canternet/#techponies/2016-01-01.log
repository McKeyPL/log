[19:28:29] <PinkiePieBot> [ MHFD — foo.txt ]
[19:28:33] <JustAberrant> I think there's a lot of terrible web design in general out there, and I find a lot of sites stupidly hard to use
[19:28:49] <JustAberrant> but while that may some day be fixed
[19:28:55] <JustAberrant> I don't think the web is going to get simpler
[19:29:22] <JustAberrant> I'd be happy with a well designed site built on the large frameworks
[19:29:36] <JustAberrant> and ads arn't going anywhere until someone comes up with something better
[19:30:20] <JustAberrant> tracking and ad networks are theoretically optional, but I don't think they're going anywhere either
[19:31:05] <HoneyDrops> The upside of ad networks is it makes blocking them easier.

[19:33:05] *** Joins: Melanosuchus (quassel@Pony-jjcf32.as13285.net)
[19:33:33] <HoneyDrops> I assume it will end up in same battle spam + spam-filters does, and we can just hope maybe that it gets too damn expensive to craft and serve ads that get around blockers.
[19:33:42] * JustAberrant all about the minimalist design in general, but I do appreciate that ajax and similar can produce decent things
[19:34:51] <HoneyDrops> Simple, not minimal.  It should be easy to understand it's operation.
[19:35:42] <HoneyDrops> Minimal design lends itself to simple design, but just putting a clean veneer on a massive blob of complexity gets us nowhere.
[19:36:30] <JustAberrant> and on that note, I'm off for chinese food ;p
[19:36:53] <HoneyDrops> As I strongly agree with the last points:  the value of the internet is that anyone can pulbish anything.  I active dislike the fact that the current trend is to turn it into radio 3.0 (TV is radio 2.0)
[19:38:04] <HoneyDrops> We don't need to give large publishers another platform, we need a platform that eliminates the position of privilege.
[19:38:25] <Moonlightning> ^
[19:38:46] <Moonlightning> It's pretty good.
[19:38:59] <Moonlightning> Consumer uplinks should be symmetric, though
[19:39:05] <HoneyDrops> Well yes
[19:39:23] <HoneyDrops> Same as everyone should host their own (personal) website and email.
[19:39:42] <HoneyDrops> The idea of large, central, e-mail providers makes things like snooping viable.
[19:40:01] <HoneyDrops> The entire strength of the internet is the lack of centralization.
[19:40:21] <HoneyDrops> So no single force can exert any meaningful control or influence over the whole.
[19:42:55] <Sour_Sweet> But there is no way than I'm going to get everyone on the planet to follow my cult 6_9. We definitely need a truth department being able to correct every personal blog
[19:43:14] <HoneyDrops> DNS is too centralized, the idea of trying to block things you don't like by breaking DNS shouldn't even be a viable tactic.
[19:43:34] <Sour_Sweet> But it isn't
[19:43:49] <Sour_Sweet> DNS blocks are probably the most ineffective on the planet
[19:44:16] <HoneyDrops> Oh, it doesn't work well, but it gives the illusion it works, and can stop the really illiterate.
[19:44:33] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops, keeping people illiterate is a means for keeping them down.
[19:44:40] <Moonlightning> If people don't WANT to become literate, we can't help them.
[19:44:50] <HoneyDrops> The point it is should be very obvious that no one, no matter their resoruces, can stop someone else from publishing something on the internet.
[19:45:00] <Sour_Sweet> The illusion must be keept (Serious here) otherwise governments will enforce actual blocks
[19:45:19] <Moonlightning> Well, on the one hoof, that is true.
[19:45:29] <Moonlightning> On the other…having illiterate governments is generally a bad thing.
[19:45:38] <Moonlightning> is a generally bad thing *
[19:45:58] <HoneyDrops> The point is they need to be put in a situation where they are forced to confront the reality they cannot, nor ever will, be able to do anything about it.  Otherwise you will never get them to give up and leave it alone.
[19:46:58] <Sour_Sweet> As long as ISPs can simply laugh at regulations by implementing simple DNS blocks and tell their customers in the same act to use OpenDNS the situation isn't perfect, but at least you don't do actual censorship
[19:47:13] <Moonlightning> We need freer networking.
[19:47:39] <Moonlightning> Why do I have to pay an ISP for Internet access?
[19:48:28] <HoneyDrops> Ideally we'll move to some sort of mesh network.
[19:48:36] <Moonlightning> That's really really radical.
[19:48:51] <Moonlightning> Got anything less so?
[19:49:15] <Sour_Sweet> Onion routing for everything
[19:49:53] <Sour_Sweet> Every node in between sender and receiver doesn't know both parties involved in communication at any point and time
[19:49:58] <HoneyDrops> I don't think there is a non-radical means to make a radical change?  You're asking how to remove the control over the physical infrastructure of the internet - I am saying that everyone holds their own little piece and they all talk to each other.
[19:50:16] <HoneyDrops> That too, onion routing should be default.
[19:50:56] <Moonlightning> Well, okay.
[19:51:06] <Sour_Sweet> Onion routing is the next logical step after all other traffic is encrpyted
[19:51:14] <HoneyDrops> So many of the design choices our current tech is based on are very naive.
[19:52:11] <HoneyDrops> Encryption should have been default, and onion-like routing should have been default.  It never should have been possible for any central authority, or just a nefarious party, to monitor communications at the level it is possible to now.

[23:42:43] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: not only does the internet kinda pre-date publically available strong encryption, but is from a time where the overhead of such would have been non-trivial
[23:43:31] <HoneyDrops> I know, but we didn't fix these things quickly when it was possible to.
[23:47:53] <JustAberrant> meh, priorities and such 
[23:52:20] <HoneyDrops> At least now it seems we're working to fix it, I guess better late than never.
