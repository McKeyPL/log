[02:47:10] <ShivalWolf> there was something as well about cameras not being allowed to work at specific gps locations
[02:47:18] <ShivalWolf> and also cameras not working if a certain signal is received
[02:47:25] <Minuette> my camera doesn't have access to gps

[02:47:33] <ShivalWolf> it was specificly camera phones

[02:51:08] <ShivalWolf> they have a dress code but its the same as formal office stuff

[03:02:07] <Seoson> At least the passwords look more or less reasonable unlike passw0rd.

[03:10:15] <cyborg_ar> that's nuts
[03:10:27] <ShivalWolf> john oliver did a nice bit on gerrymandering which was kinda cool
[03:10:43] <cyborg_ar> here we always see minority parties get 2-5%, sometimes even 10% in every election
[03:11:00] <Seoson> Well you have politicians at the very least that have an opinion and fight for it (Even if influenced highly by companies). Our current leader is known for not making any statement on anything and people seem to love it-.-
[03:11:02] <cyborg_ar> and they get carried over to the national level

[03:16:32] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> a call center i worked for was trying to get permission from the FCC to install cellular jammers
[03:16:52] <ShivalWolf> lol
[03:16:54] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> when they got denied they decided to do it anyways and installed illigal chinese black-market boxes that blocked everything including 911
[03:16:55] <ShivalWolf> i think they speicficly deny that
[03:17:04] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> the FCC pulled their telcom permits to operate a call center
[03:17:08] <Phase> DJ-C0L7[EIT], XD
[03:17:09] <ShivalWolf> NICE
[03:17:23] <Phase> breifly looked at getting cell jammers here for some other reason
[03:17:25] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> and the FBI looked into the infraction of federal matters
[03:17:28] <Phase> turns out it's highly illegal
[03:17:38] <ShivalWolf> yeah it is
[03:17:52] <ShivalWolf> if your even caught importing them your screwed
[03:17:59] <cyborg_ar> yes
[03:18:01] <ShivalWolf> dont even have to be using it
[03:18:10] <ShivalWolf> just the import will get you a fine/jail time
[03:18:15] <cyborg_ar> it'd be nice if the police got hit with the same jammer
[03:18:15] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> in the united states it is illigal to block the use of 911 service for any reason, and in a high-rise building it is illigal for a company to tell you that you cannot have your cell phone with you on your person
[03:18:17] <cyborg_ar> hammer*
[03:18:33] <cyborg_ar> unless it's the US embassy
[03:18:36] <cyborg_ar> :)
[03:18:45] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> arent most embassys less than 5 stories tall?
[03:18:53] <cyborg_ar> ahh
[03:19:00] <cyborg_ar> missed that little bit
[03:19:03] <cyborg_ar> yeah
[03:19:07] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[03:19:07] <ShivalWolf> offical govermnt buildings can have restrictions though
[03:19:11] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[03:19:17] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> for security reasons they are the exception
[03:19:22] <ShivalWolf> yeah
[03:19:33] <cyborg_ar> what about banks?
[03:19:46] <ShivalWolf> cyborg_ar: banks cant even record audio on their security system
[03:19:50] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> only thing i can think for banks would be in the vault/secure parts of the building such as a skiff room
[03:20:26] <ShivalWolf> TSA arnt supposed to have mobile phones int he checking area
[03:20:28] <ShivalWolf> doesnt stop them
[03:20:44] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol the TSA are about as much of a federal orginization as fedex
[03:20:44] <cyborg_ar> yeah
[03:20:53] <ShivalWolf> lol
[03:21:02] <ShivalWolf> here theres several secure sites that you cant have am obile phone
[03:21:09] <ShivalWolf> you arnt allowed one inside the ASD for example
[03:21:13] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'd believe it
[03:22:03] <ShivalWolf> it sucks becuase some work i have to do with someoen at ASD has to all be done out of hours
[03:22:07] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> they recently made it a primary offence here to text while driving
[03:22:08] <ShivalWolf> as they cant access stuff at work
[03:22:40] <ShivalWolf> but the office is rather nice lol

[15:49:59] <MistVeil> Teeeeeech, came with another question regarding Ubiquiti's UniFi access points
[15:50:37] <MistVeil> Does anyone know if they can work as standalone APs (connected to a router, obviously), or do they need another specific product from Ubiquiti?
[15:51:10] <MistVeil> I know there's a software, but I already checked the FAQ and it's optional. No info about hardware, though :X
[15:56:31] <Princess_AppleDash> Probably!
[15:57:53] <MistVeil> I assume so as well, I was hoping someone here had experience with them, though :X
[15:59:01] <MistVeil> I'll Google-fu a bit more, thanks for the reply AppleDash
[16:00:35] <MistVeil> Oh, I probably didn't look hard enough, found the answer: They can work as standalone APs, you just need the software to push configuration into it
[16:00:52] <MistVeil> It doesn't have a web interface or anything like that, it's all from the controller software
[16:07:40] <Adelaide> This is crazy but
[16:08:03] <Adelaide> Why the hell I can connect to irc thru a tcp client
[16:10:26] <MistVeil> Because simplicity?
[16:10:45] <Adelaide> I downloaded a tcp client
[16:15:58] <Seoson> Ah telnet?!
[16:19:39] <MistVeil> I don't think it's the same thing
[16:20:13] <MistVeil> IRC servers have open TCP ports for IRC clients, right? It makes sense if you see it that way
[16:30:18] <Princess_AppleDash> Adelaide: Umm...
[16:30:25] <Princess_AppleDash> Because IRC is a protocol that works over TCP?
[16:33:07] <Adelaide> Because I think it's cool if you do it at the command line
[16:33:15] <MistVeil> ^ What Dash said
[16:37:04] <Adelaide> I'm gonna make an irc client written in Scratch
[16:37:25] <Adelaide> Yes it's possible that Scratch has TCP XD
