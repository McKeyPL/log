[00:00:24] <Kinsley> Gameplay should drive profits, not the other way around.
[00:00:29] <HoneyDrops> Which is why I feel that money corrupts all it gets involved in.  As soon as the goal deviates from "How can we make the best X." to "How can we make the most profitable X." the endeavor has been corrupted.
[00:01:24] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: well, profitability has to be a concern because if the game doesn't make money, the shop can't stay afloat and it doesn't happen at all..
[00:02:26] <JustAberrant> and building a game has enough stuff that's painfully annoying that few will do if they arn't being payed to do so (probably why there is a huge lack of real open source games)

[00:03:19] <HoneyDrops> We've been down this path, and I'm not inclined to beat the horse.  I maintain there is a fundamental problem with the entire economic model, and short of fixing that things will not get better.  Crappy products are a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself.
[00:03:27] * HoneyDrops likes Cata:DDA :D
[00:03:37] <HoneyDrops> http://en.cataclysmdda.com/
[00:03:40] <PinkiePieBot> [ Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead ]
[00:03:51] <HoneyDrops> Also nethack is always a great choice.
[00:04:44] <JustAberrant> there's a universe of difference between a text based game and something like bloodborne
[00:04:53] <Kinsley> Battle for Wesnoth is pretty great.
[00:05:19] <Kinsley> But I agree. There's a dearth of good open source games, but I think it has a few different causes.
[00:06:25] <Kinsley> Not being paid is certainly one, but reflects a reality of game development: depending on the genre, it's a painfully long process that involves many talented, creative people giving many, many hours of their time and energy to make.
[00:07:57] <HoneyDrops> There are SDL sprite UI's to both of those.  I think nethack even has an isometric frontend.
[00:10:00] <JustAberrant> sure, and I like angband as much as everyone else, but comparing something that can be written by one guy in a reasonable amount of time to a modern big-studio game is absurd
[00:11:16] * HoneyDrops would argue that the former is more reliably fun to play :x
[00:11:46] <JustAberrant> of course, which is why they are so exceptionally popular to the current generation of gamers and why new ones are being cranked out all the time?
[00:11:53] <JustAberrant> it's a niche, a nice one, but a niche all the same
[00:14:23] * Googie needs to play Cataclysm DDA again
[00:16:00] * Lapsus puts an oculus rift on Googie and loads up dwarf fortress
[00:19:43] * JustAberrant suddenly gets thoughts of angband vr
[00:20:30] <HoneyDrops> mmm, giant vector glyphs :D

[16:29:50] <JockeTF> DataByte: Books are nice! :D
[16:30:30] <DataByte> Just a bit of interest: I was working on making my site more mobile-friendly, and noticed that there was a new most-popular-before-it-was-deleted fic
[16:30:34] <DataByte> https://fimfetch.net/morgue
[16:30:36] <PinkiePieBot> [ Deleted Fics ]
[16:31:18] <DataByte> one author with a TON of likes deleted all of their stories
[16:31:38] <JockeTF> DataByte: A common theme for art. *_*
[16:32:14] <JockeTF> DataByte: Was that recently? I've been getting a spike in followers.
[16:32:52] <JockeTF> Good to know though. I really dislike when people do that.
[16:33:37] <DataByte> i looked up the author - apparently they were getting tired of harassment.. whatever that means
[16:33:38] <JockeTF> When lots of people start hunting down alternative sources you know that the stories meant quite a bit to some.
[16:35:16] <DataByte> I plan on adding search options for my archive - it's sluggish for a search engine, but it's at least a reliable archive of fics
[16:35:58] <JockeTF> Sounds good. :)
[16:36:33] <JockeTF> The most important part is that there are places to get a story if you need it. :)
[16:36:39] <DataByte> feel free to reference my site - i'm sure others would find it handy if they're only looking for one or two fics, and not the whole 8G+
[16:39:38] <JockeTF> Could be a good idea since I've been getting quite a few requests for single stories recently.
[16:41:24] <JockeTF> DataByte: Do you still keep embedded story images somewhere?
[16:42:38] <DataByte> yep :)
[16:43:14] <JockeTF> DataByte: As in those embedded with [img] tags in stories. :P
[16:43:29] <DataByte> yep, I know what you meant ;)
[16:43:39] <DataByte> I embed them in the epubs :D
[16:44:14] <JockeTF> Great! I know where to point people for that then.
[16:45:19] <DataByte> I think I'll have to update my cache html, too - point to my cached images instead of the original link
[16:48:27] *** Pony_20181 is now known as Dude
[16:48:43] <JockeTF> DataByte: I had a guy submit a pretty interesting idea, by the way. Using Google Cache for scraping story information that I can't get through the API.
[16:48:57] *** Dude is now known as Pony_48528
[16:49:45] <DataByte> I just scrape it from fimfic's site.. but google cache for the older stuff may be a great idea
[16:50:03] <DataByte> maybe even the wayback web archive
[16:50:41] <AppleDash> Is "I like alpacas" the secret entry phrase for the FimFiction downloading club?
[16:51:08] <JockeTF> Yeah, they've told me not to scrape due to server load. But, scraping Google cache should kind of help with that.
[16:51:25] <JockeTF> As long as Google doesn't hit the server again if the cache is too old, of course.
[16:51:42] <DataByte> I don't worry about their server load any more now that they have cloudflare
[16:52:09] <JockeTF> Well, I'm going to respect what they tell me I can and cannot do.
[16:52:48] <DataByte> I don't throttle the site for all it's worth, though - besides, I also have a website to host from the same connection xD
[16:52:59] <DataByte> and downloading during off-peak
