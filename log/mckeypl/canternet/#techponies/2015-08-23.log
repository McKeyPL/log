[13:49:46] <Lapsus> lol
[13:55:29] <init3> My wireless is pretty shit. The company that makes the wireless card in my laptop got bought out and hasn't made new drivers for it since like the 2.7.x branch and while drivers exist that work, the speed is always shit. 
[13:57:09] <init3> On the router side I have a WRT54G that's solid as a rock but only G or I have a .11n that's fast (even on my laptop) but needs to be reset every few days and sometimes can't connect to the RADIUS server for no reason whatsoever.
