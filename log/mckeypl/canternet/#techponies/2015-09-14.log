[02:18:17] * JustAberrant shrugs
[02:18:28] <JustAberrant> large numbers of people use terrible passwords, movie at 11... ;p
[02:18:55] <Starthunder> But…what kind of //person// would set 'DEFAULT' as a password?
[02:19:49] <Starthunder> /0?123456(7(8(9)?)?)?/, sure
[02:19:55] <Starthunder> 'password/, obviously
[02:20:06] <Starthunder> but…'DEFAULT'?
[02:20:39] <tiwake> people are so horrible with passwords in general...
[02:21:09] <Starthunder> No, I mean…it sounds like something a machine would set. <.<
[02:21:58] <Rylee> Starthunder: DEFAULT is probably a machine-generated thing
[02:22:56] <Starthunder> Exactly.
[02:23:23] <tiwake> it could be because the guy was 'setting up' some software and it had DEFAULT for the password by default... after dealing with that software for a while used it with everything else
[02:23:30] <tiwake> its really that bad

[02:33:16] <Googie> Might be a default value in the database or something, being used for test users or deactivated accounts.
[02:33:23] * Googie is just guessing off the top of his head.
[02:34:40] <Starthunder> That's silly. You should delete the password for deactivated accounts.

[02:57:48] <JustAberrant> well, there's also another angle

[08:40:47] <Googie> (Namely, how long am I going to be without internet because the copper needs to be cutover :V)
[08:40:56] <HoneyDrops> I'll ask here too, for good measure.  I've recently-ish had issues with my laptop locking up, sorta.  I thought it was a total freeze, but I discovered that actually it just isn't responding to any keyboard/mouse input, and I can't ssh in (it doesn't error, just `ssh laptop` and the command hangs indef).  Network /is/ still up and X is still updating the screen.  I know because I watched a
[08:40:58] <HoneyDrops> tmux sessions over ssh still display input from another system.  Nothing hinky in /var/log/messages, nor dmesg.  I cannot seem to trigger this on demand, but I /think/ it might be related to going on/off ac power.
[08:41:53] <Starthunder> TIL OS X has a kernel extension to prevent deleting things from Time Machine backups, and a helper program to let you override that.
[08:42:10] <Starthunder> >> https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/31679
[08:42:11] <PinkiePieBot> [ osx - How can I delete a file marked as backup item? - Ask Different ]
[08:43:14] <Starthunder> HoneyDrops: add `-v`s to the ssh invocation, see what you get?
[08:43:23] <Starthunder> sounds like an odd little problem
[08:44:07] <HoneyDrops> next time I will.
[08:44:54] <HoneyDrops> It's almost as if I can't spawn a process, but there is no reason I can think of that would cause the sort of system load that could cause that.
[08:48:15] <Seoson> The moment you realize that something as simple as a seedable random number generator in javascript requires an indepth search -.-
[08:49:53] <Seoson> Finally found one, but the solutions that were proposed on the way to get there ....
[08:50:16] <Googie> Depending on the quality of random numbers that you need, it's pretty easy just to write up your own generator. (Assuming there's no need for anything cryptographically secure of course)

[08:50:53] <Colgate> HoneyDrops: presumably the magic sysrq key still works, have you tried turning the keyboard to raw mode and switching to a tty?
[08:50:57] * Googie has done that for portability before.
[08:51:51] <HoneyDrops> Colgate: I've tried Ctrl+Alt+F1-3  I'd have to figure out how to input SysRq on this laptop keyboard :x
[08:52:27] <Colgate> my laptop is awful with the sysrq key as well, stupid function keys :(
[08:53:47] <HoneyDrops> I can say that ACPI-based keypresses also fail to register.  However the thinklight (fn+space) does work, but I'm pretty sure that is not handled at the OS level.
[08:54:19] <HoneyDrops> Not being able to ssh in, yet the network still being up is what really confounds me.
[08:54:45] *** Quits: GigaZzz (Gigabit@the.girly.colt) (Quit: Canternet Public Bouncer!)
[08:54:49] <Seoson> Problem is: Outputs needs to be chaotic (minimal input change results in drastic change of the output), well distributed between it's boundaries and unpredictable if you only know parts of the seed (goes with chaotic useally). While I could write something like this myself the chance of making a mistake is huge.
[08:56:10] <Googie> Yeah, an LCG is basically only useful for kinda mostly random numbers :V
[08:56:29] <johnsey> no printscreen key on that laptop?
[08:56:54] <HoneyDrops> Colgate: I can't exactly say how long this has been going on for.  I think 1-3 months, however it might not happen for well over a week or two, or like today within a few hours.
[08:57:01] <Seoson> The goal is to create a cheat safe distributed randome number generator. Looks fine now ...
[08:57:25] <HoneyDrops> johnsey: me?  X230, I use xmodmap to remap PrtSc to Menu for dmenu to use
[08:57:54] <HoneyDrops> I /think/ I might have started after going to 4.*.* kernels
[08:57:57] <Colgate> unreproducible problems are the worst :P
[08:58:59] <HoneyDrops> Yes they are :I
[09:00:48] <johnsey> I don't think xmodmap has.an effect on sysrq but i'd have to look it up
[09:00:54] <HoneyDrops> If it was just mouse/keyboard, I would guess X input drivers are to blame, but that shouldn't impact ssh.
[09:01:44] <HoneyDrops> Possibly-relatedly, Ihave has issues with my xmodmap changes being undone and the keyboard reverts to the default keymap.  My touchpad also gets re-enabled (I disable it in .xinitrc with synclient)
[09:02:34] <HoneyDrops> I would imagine sysrq is handled before X gets the scancodes.
[09:05:29] <johnsey> try disabling swap if you're using it and see if you can reproduce the problem
[09:07:59] <HoneyDrops> No swap, 16GB ram, and not even usign 20% of that 99% of the time.
[09:07:59] <johnsey> if the laptop responds to ping but not ssh or other inputs, it can also be that it's swapping hard
[09:08:29] <johnsey> ah
[09:10:02] <HoneyDrops> No notable system load either, a mostly idle firefox, few terminals, tmux sessions, few vim instances, maybe one gnumeric document.
[09:10:07] <Googie> It does sound like something that happens to me when IO is terrible.
[09:12:55] <Seoson> I've only encountered when a servers RAID died and it could no longer spawn any process.

[16:22:13] <Seoson> So I figured out how an Adobe Flash bug works that made me crazy years ago. -.-
[16:24:36] <Seoson> Flash had some clickjacking issues a few years ago where you could hijack clicks and place them on the flash settings menu to allow camera and mic input without the user knowing what you just did. I knew of the problem but I didn't knew how Adobe fixed it
[16:25:52] <Seoson> Turns out they go the lazy way and compare the actual rendered frame pixel by pixel that they fetch from the graphics card to check if the dialog is visible
[16:26:33] <Seoson> Since the dialog is independent of the browser's zoom level that sound like an easy solution, right? WRONG
[16:27:30] <Seoson> sounds* What they did not take into account is that the text in the dialog is - as well as other text on a website - freaking small.

[16:28:52] <Seoson> So if somebody with low vision visits a website they use magnifier software - like me for example. Result: You cannot click any button or option and you have no idea why.
[16:30:00] <Seoson> Of cause they do not display any kind of indicator or error message making it effectively impossible to know for those kind of people what's going on.

[17:20:41] <Blackjack> People might still need to use them

[17:20:46] <Blackjack> I use SpeedTest a ton
[17:21:38] <Seoson> Sadly there are a lot of legacy apps
[17:22:28] <Blackjack> And all the HDML5 speed tests I've tried are horridly inaccurate

[20:53:42] <Blackjack> no.
[20:53:52] <Blackjack> Because I can only pull about 10Mbps from my server
[20:54:01] <Blackjack> But from a local server (which I do not own) I can pull a full 120

[23:32:44] <Blackjack> Starthunder: Your command is also flawed
[23:32:44] <Blackjack> you're running a local mktemp, what happens if that temp file exists on the remote?
[23:32:54] <Starthunder> Does mktemp even check for that?
[23:33:23] <Blackjack> No idea
[23:33:43] <roflin> I thought it was guaranteed to give an unique file
[23:33:45] <Starthunder> I thought it just generated a random filename and relied on the fact that collisions are pretty dark unlikely
[23:35:36] <roflin> no mention of unique in the man page :(
[23:36:13] <roflin> ah but the posix function tmpfile does guarantee an unique temp file

[23:41:47] <Starthunder> Does the POSIX /program/ `mktemp` guarantee a unique file, though?
[23:42:12] <roflin> yeah dunno, the manpage doesn't mention it, so I wouldn't assume it.
[23:42:20] <roflin> I just got the 2 confused.
