[08:41:28] <Compu> why episode?

[08:43:39] <Kinsley> Like a config file, perhaps?

[08:44:15] <Kinsley> Unless I was super, duper dumb and published them in the source....
[08:45:02] <Compu> my bot has a lot more keys cuz it uses a lot more apis, but if u dont put keys in it just tells u u have to put keys in for commands and for functions in head.py it just doesnt use that API and goes back to using the old way of grabbing the title of the page

[08:53:04] <aji> then i guess there's no plaintext alternative!

[13:02:35] <Googie> C++14 is good, but compiler support is still limited, and you can't rely on every system having a compatible compiler.

[13:05:01] <RazorSharpFang> Do people still use CentOS? How old is that? Older than WinXP?
[13:05:33] <Googie> Well, C++11 was standardized in 2011, so that gives an idea on how new the standard is :P
[13:07:19] <RazorSharpFang> Quite new then.
[13:07:28] <Googie> But a /major/ improvement over C++03
[13:07:47] <Googie> And if you're learning, it's best to learn C++11 style.

[20:39:21] <Seoson> Colgate: Yes HPKP is indeed HTTP Public Key Pinning. The idea is to tell the browser via HTTP Headers which cert and private key pin it should expect in a given timeframe. When somebody hijacks the traffic with an otherwise valid cert the browser will refuse the connection if the pin doesn't match, so users are secure from that sort of attack as long as they've visited the site from a safe
[20:39:23] <Seoson> connection at least once.
[20:42:42] <Moonlightning> And if an attacker manages to get an otherwise-valid cert for the site, they can do the same.
[20:42:48] <Moonlightning> Talk about a double-edged sword

[20:50:17] <Seoson> Yeah, but if they can peform MITM attacks at get a valid cert somehow, they might as well just drop your connection. Also this would help against domain control hijacking via unauthorized registrar account access (happened more than once in the past)
[20:51:00] <Moonlightning> It's easier to prevent connections than to forge secure ones that validate.
[20:51:04] <Moonlightning> Far easier.
[20:51:52] <Moonlightning> And the damage you can do with the latter is far worse.
