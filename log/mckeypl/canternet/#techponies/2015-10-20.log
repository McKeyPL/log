[03:23:56] <Moonlightning> Is reencrypting swap when it's not being used much a /thing?/
[03:24:09] <Moonlightning> I feel like it should be a thing, especially on -servers- long-running systems
[03:24:46] <Moonlightning> Just, when the system's mostly idle and swap isn't being used much, move everything back into RAM and reinitialize swap
[03:26:51] <Colgate> ...why?
[03:27:09] <Moonlightning> The same reason you renegotiate session keys after a while?
[03:27:23] <Moonlightning> Also, to a degree, the same reason you encrypt swap at all?
[03:28:06] <Moonlightning> The old swap key no longer exists anywhere; an attacker couldn't /possibly/ get it and decrypt whatever's still in swap.
[03:28:55] <Moonlightning> Granted, the attack vector is unlikely, but crypto is //all about// taking precautions that turn out to be unnecessary most of the time.
[03:29:24] <Moonlightning> For example, I just netcatted an installer image clear across the world (Los Angeles to London) and then checked its hash.
[03:29:37] <Moonlightning> Guess what? The hash matched. The image was perfectly intact.
[03:29:51] <Moonlightning> I'm sure it would've turned out the same way if I /hadn't/ checked…
[03:30:02] <Moonlightning> MitMs are generally rare.
[03:30:09] <Moonlightning> But we guard against them anyway,
[03:30:29] <Webster> Keep two swap partitions. Turn off one, reinitialize it, turn it on, then do it to the other one next time. Put it in a cronjob?
[03:31:25] <Moonlightning> yeah, that's how you
[03:31:33] <Moonlightning> that's how you'd do it if you had multiple swap devices *
[03:31:41] <Moonlightning> But this could work in any configuration.
[03:31:46] *** RedHelper is now known as Princess_Cadance
[03:34:20] <Colgate> you can make a swap device on a file

[18:41:42] <GigabitPony> anyone know hexchats default log location?
[18:42:21] <DataByteBrony> windows or linux?
[18:42:27] <GigabitPony> winders
[18:43:21] <DataByteBrony> using application data or save to program folder?
[18:43:41] <GigabitPony> Um, not sure qwhat you mean
[18:44:02] <DataByteBrony> for me, on my work machine, i have it saved to program folder, so it's from there under ~\HexChat\config\logs
[18:44:17] <DataByteBrony> otherwise, check %appdata%
[18:44:27] <GigabitPony> I am not sure how to change the location is the problem x.x
[18:44:42] <DataByteBrony> linux is ~/.config/hexchat/logs (took me a while to find it, lol)
[18:47:11] <DataByteBrony> the location is set when you install - i'm not sure how to change, either
[18:47:11] <GigabitPony> only thing in %appdata%hexchat is 3 folders, one listed as scrollback which has the networks I am on in it, and text files of scroll back text
[18:47:11] <DataByteBrony> do you have logging enabled?
[18:47:11] <GigabitPony> yep
[18:47:11] <DataByteBrony> in the same folder as the scrollback folder there should be a 'logs' folder
[18:47:11] <DataByteBrony> if not a 'config'
[18:51:25] <GigabitPony> ah, found out how to change it

[18:51:58] <GigabitPony> ah, found out how to change it
[18:51:58] <GigabitPony> and found a folder in the location I specified, which has old hexchat log data and I cannot open the folders inside of it and cannot delete them

[19:25:36] <DataByteBrony> although i'd say mine is explaining what i can do with a program, and what i can't do - but that's the user i'm explaining it to, i thikn
[19:26:13] <quindo> I think that falls into the 8%
