[07:35:28] <Ruthalas> Anypony in here know of a way to determine if a PSU is being overtaxed? I am having crashes with no errors in event logs, and suspect that I may be overtaxing my PUS.
[07:36:02] <Ruthalas> Issue is that most online calcs say that it should be good.. I just can't determine a way to test that without shelling out money for a higher capacity.
[07:36:23] <ShivalWolf> run a burn in test
[07:36:45] <Ruthalas> What software? Specifically for PSU? Or just a stress test in general?
[07:36:52] <ShivalWolf> stress test in general
[07:36:59] <ShivalWolf> if it crashes
[07:37:22] <ShivalWolf> theres app to monitor cpu/memory/graphics voltages
[07:37:29] <Ruthalas> I've run furmark on my GPUs and CPU to see if they had issues under stress and didn't crsh the system.
[07:37:37] <Ruthalas> Do you have a recommendation?
[07:37:47] <Ruthalas> (app)
[07:38:05] <ShivalWolf> it was like mobomonitor or system power monitor
[07:38:07] <ShivalWolf> i cant remmber
[07:38:13] <ShivalWolf> im at work so i cant check what it was
[07:38:53] <Ruthalas> np, I'll look for that. Thanks ShivalWolf
[07:39:10] <ShivalWolf> there should be a number of them around
[07:39:27] <ShivalWolf> can log voltage and yeah if you see any major spikes dips around a crash
[07:39:33] <ShivalWolf> then its safe to say somthins taxing your psu
[07:39:38] <ShivalWolf> or its dieing of old age
[07:39:43] <ShivalWolf> and cant handle mains voltage drops
[07:39:52] <Ruthalas> Hmm. Good point.
[07:40:05] <ShivalWolf> mains power is soo not as stable as it should be

[08:09:50] <Phase> Moonlightning, an opcode is just a handful of bytes, which we already know is malformed and quite possibly not code
[08:10:09] <Phase> not sure how that'd be any more helpful than the instruction pointer
[08:10:18] <wolfyshy> objdump -d cod_compress.so then look at the address
[08:10:33] <wolfyshy> that number at the end is the load address, ip - load = 0x1a03 in to the binary
[08:10:46] <wolfyshy> which happens to be an AMD FMA4 instruction... and it's running on an Intel CPU
[08:10:50] <Phase> oh, yeah, it does list the relative address
[08:10:57] * Phase didn't see that
[08:22:54] <Moonlightning> Ahh, okay.
[08:23:21] <Moonlightning> Is the stack pointer useful at all, though?
[08:27:44] <Crimson_Tail> python processes have wonky behavior on windows when left idle for a while.
[08:36:08] <Phase> Moonlightning, might be, but a memory dump would be better in all cases

[18:19:50] <Moonlightning> How do I set up a bunch of webpages as a template and then a bunch of different sets of data to populate the template with?

[18:50:22] <init3> Hmm
[18:50:26] <Moonlightning> init3: uh…not really? I was guessing it'd just be embedded in the page, somehow
[18:50:32] <Moonlightning> I dunno how else it'd be done
[18:50:52] <init3> Well I just mean you aren't looking to populate it automagically right?
[18:52:00] <Moonlightning> I /have/ all the data, yeah.
[18:53:56] <init3> Are you trying to parse it?
[18:55:04] <Moonlightning> No. It's…not all that much data; I can rewrite it…by hoof…into any format required…I guess.
[18:56:54] <init3> Well probably with wordpress the simplest thing I can think of is to make a page the way you want, then copy it and modify the copy.

[18:59:38] <init3> Oh
[18:59:42] <init3> Herm
[19:00:11] <init3> Then it is going to go back to my first question: How much coding do you want to do?
[19:00:16] <Moonlightning> hence my asking about a template system
[19:00:25] <Moonlightning> How much coding is /a lot of coding/? 6_9
[19:00:33] <Moonlightning> I don't mind coding; I'm just new to it.
[19:00:55] <init3> I mean, not a ton but then again there is probably already a plugin that does this. 
[19:00:58] <Moonlightning> I didn't think something like this would be too involved
[19:01:09] <init3> And you'd essentally be coding your own plugin. 
[19:01:27] <init3> Well, that's exactly what you'd be doing. 
[19:01:43] <init3> So I don't know if that violates your 'no more plugins' thing.

[19:03:09] <init3> I was thinking ref them all to a single CSS. 
[19:04:08] <init3> I mean, if I were you I'd start by looking at wordpress plugins even if you aren't going to use them. See how they do it at least. 
[19:04:15] <Moonlightning> …WordPress doesn't have a proper way to CSS? :/
[19:04:21] <Moonlightning> how do you HTML without CSS
[19:04:24] <Moonlightning> I do not understand
[19:04:37] <Moonlightning> you cannot copypaste the style= attributes everywhere because MAINTAINABILITY!
[19:04:52] * Moonlightning used <style scoped> at the top of one page. That was fine when it was just one page…
[19:05:03] <init3> Well let be clear I don't know anything about CSS. 
[19:05:39] <init3> Well, you can nest CSS without it interfering with the overall page CSS can't you?
[19:05:51] <init3> So that might be a thing
[19:06:24] <Moonlightning> Sorry, um…there are multiple pages now.
[19:06:43] <init3> hue
[19:06:44] <Moonlightning> Ideally, this /wouldn't/ be WordPress, and I could just add a .css file and include it
[19:07:00] <Moonlightning> but it /is/ WordPress, and I'm pretty sure I won't be able to change that.
[19:07:04] <init3> Right. That's what I'm thinking. 
[19:07:24] <Moonlightning> So…how do you CSS with WordPress?
[19:07:40] * Moonlightning should probably make a disposable WordPress account for messing around.
[19:07:44] <init3> Not even sure if you can
[19:08:04] <Moonlightning> :/
[19:08:14] <Moonlightning> Again: how do you HTML without CSS? It doesn't make any sense.
[19:08:21] <init3> 1995
[19:08:40] <init3> In mah day...
[19:09:17] <Moonlightning> Are you saying that you're stuck in…
[19:09:20] * Moonlightning sunglasses
[19:09:22] <Moonlightning> NINETEEN
[19:09:24] <Moonlightning> NINETEEN
[19:09:27] <Moonlightning> NINETEEN NINETY-FIVE
[19:09:39] <init3> kek
[19:10:19] * Moonlightning steals all of init3's keks
[19:10:35] <init3> nuuu
[19:10:39] <init3> I had 40
[19:11:54] <Moonlightning> That's as many as four tens. And that's terrible.
[19:12:03] <Moonlightning> Anyway, getting back to…
[19:12:07] <Moonlightning> > In WordPress, the (X)HTML structure and the CSS style sheet are present but the /content/ is generated "behind the scenes" by various _template files_. The template files and the style sheet are stored together as a _WordPress Theme_.
[19:12:32] <Moonlightning> So…I'd need to add something to the theme? x.x
[19:16:28] <Moonlightning> I don't like WordPress. :|
[19:18:05] <johnsey> then don't use it :>
[19:18:34] <Moonlightning> can't. x.x
[19:19:12] <Moonlightning> Okay, workaround. Is there a way to embed a CSS file in an HTML file and then include it from elsewhere? >.>
[19:20:09] <init3> You don't want to fuck with the theme.
[19:20:52] <Moonlightning> Yeah. x.x
[19:21:10] <Moonlightning> I discovered yesterday that WordPress wraps everything in <p> tags, too :/
[19:21:19] <init3> Hehe yeah
[19:21:51] <Moonlightning> and that has this `#content p, #content hr, ... { margin-bottom: 24px; }` thing that makes it annoying when /I'm/ trying to set my /own/ margins on this page, thank you very much
[19:22:01] <Moonlightning> I guess maybe I'm trying to WordPress wrong.
[19:22:26] <Moonlightning> But raw HTML+CSS lets you do things so much better! You can just source an image and let the CSS auto-resize it to x% of the page!
[19:23:02] <Moonlightning> instead of having to fuck around in the visual editor and get it to align /almost but not quite well I've been at this for two whole minutes now and I have Y many other images so I guess that will have to be good enough/
[19:24:56] <Moonlightning> <.<
[19:24:56] <Moonlightning> >.>
[19:25:45] <Moonlightning> Maybe I'll just slap the CSS file up on some other server. 8D
[19:29:26] <init3> heh
[19:34:15] <Moonlightning> seriously, though. I'm at a loss for what to do.
[19:34:56] <Moonlightning> I can't duplicate the CSS across every page. Celestia forbid anyone would ever want to subsequently change the style of the pages.

[22:12:49] <init3> Holy shit
[22:12:56] <init3> THat is so fucking hilarious. 
[22:13:23] <init3> I bet all the people who spent years of their lives developing jailbreaks sure are pissed. 
[22:18:38] <init3> Maybe it's just the dank fumes, but I think any day you get to bust out your soldering iron is a good day.
