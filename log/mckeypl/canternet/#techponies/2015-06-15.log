[07:18:39] <AppleDash> It doesn't need to :P
[07:19:15] <Colgate> erm, maybe I'm missing your goal here?
[07:19:39] <AppleDash> Colgate: see link
[07:19:40] * AppleDash pings Colgate's broadcast address
[07:19:59] <Colgate> or you know, just look at arp tables?
[07:20:03] <AppleDash> yes
[07:20:07] <AppleDash> the point is to fill up the arp table
[07:20:26] <Colgate> oh sure, arp spoofing
[07:20:31] <AppleDash> fuck you
[07:20:35] <AppleDash> Read the link >.<
[07:20:39] <Colgate> ...what?
[07:21:01] <AppleDash> Basically, you ping the broadcast address on your network from any Windows machine and then check out the ARP table afterwards.
[07:21:01] <AppleDash> If you subnet is 192.168.1.X with a mask of 255.255.255.0, then you would ping 192.168.1.255. When you ping, you will get a Request Timed Out all four times, but don’t worry.
[07:21:16] <AppleDash> Next, type in the following command
[07:21:16] <AppleDash>     arp –a
[07:21:16] <AppleDash> You will now get a list of all the connected devices on your network along with their physical addresses! Pretty nifty trick.
[07:21:38] <Colgate> I don't see how this is related?
[07:21:44] <AppleDash> ...
[07:21:52] <AppleDash> What are we even talking about :P
[07:21:58] <Colgate> plenty of broadcasts are already going around with arp
[07:22:05] <Colgate> the ping does nothing
[07:22:09] <AppleDash> Well
[07:22:11] <AppleDash> I did arp -a
[07:22:17] <AppleDash> pinged the broadcast address
[07:22:20] <AppleDash> then did arp -a again
[07:22:26] <AppleDash> there were more entries the 3nd time
[07:22:30] <Colgate> maybe this is a windows idiocy?
[07:22:35] <AppleDash> I'm on Linux
[07:23:09] <Colgate> you are literally sending a packet to the broadcast, which is promptly dropped by every other system on the network
[07:23:21] <AppleDash> I have no idea
[07:23:27] <AppleDash> I don't know anything about networking remember
[07:24:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> i think the point is that while it doesnt respond to the icmp ping it still responds to the systems underlying arp query to identifys itself as online. but its only on your local segment
[07:25:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> but you could do that with any type of lookup for an ip
[07:25:17] <ShivalPonyWolf> it doesnt have to be a braodvast

[21:30:57] <Twilightlicious> Refering to the Xbox One announcement
[21:31:01] <Twilightlicious> that it will soon play 360 games
[21:31:48] <Twilightlicious> Xbox 360 is 3Ghz Tricore PowerPC
[21:32:06] <Twilightlicious> Xbox One is 2Ghz Octocore x86
[21:32:11] <Twilightlicious> Xbox One is 2Ghz Octocore x86
[21:32:18] <Twilightlicious> didn't mean to send twice :P
[21:32:44] <Twilightlicious> They said developers only need to approve their games for the system
[21:32:50] <Twilightlicious> but in my mind, you'd need to do a lot more than that.
[21:33:13] <Rylee> they probably have an emulator or a jit rewriter
[21:33:27] <Twilightlicious> Well of course emulation is required :P
[21:33:41] <Twilightlicious> But to Emulate 3Ghz PowerPC on 2Ghz x86
[21:33:46] <Twilightlicious> A concept i'm not grasping :P
[21:34:00] <Colgate> GHz isn't everything
[21:34:10] <Twilightlicious> Of course not
[21:34:10] *** Quits: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning) (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[21:34:22] <Twilightlicious> but throw in Emulation of a different Arch type
[21:37:10] <Twilightlicious> Unless developers are optimizing and recompiling their games, i'm impressed.
[21:37:45] <Twilightlicious> I do know that all games must be downloaded, the disk data isn't used for anything other than verification of ownership.
[21:38:38] <Twilightlicious> So it could be some sort of trickery.
[21:38:52] <Twilightlicious> When they first announced it i was like "Ugh, here comes some sort of Streaming crap"
[21:39:29] <Colgate> I wouldn't mind streaming in the same way the WoW client does it
[21:40:01] <Colgate> it downloads as you play, so you can play it before it finishes downloading all the content
[21:40:57] <Dusk> Twilightlicious: More cores with a more efficient architecture. It can be done.
[21:41:13] <Twilightlicious> Clearly.
[21:41:19] <Twilightlicious> Still, impressed.
[21:41:23] <Dusk> They're the only one with the intimate knowledge of how their machine's parts talk to each other too
[21:41:32] <Dusk> so making an emulator should have been a cakewalk
[21:41:44] <Dusk> but nooo
[21:41:47] <Phase> ppc<->x86 jit would be an off the shelf thing
[21:41:54] <Phase> gpu emulation would be trickier
[21:41:57] <Dusk> yea
[21:42:17] <Phase> unless they're doing some api level nonsense
[21:42:24] <Dusk> But again, Microsoft is the only company with the actual intimate knowledge of exactly how their hardware worked
[21:42:37] <Dusk> So I would have thought this would have been a thing sooner
[21:43:03] <Phase> which people have done, there's some experimental code somewhere for running x86+opengl binaries on arm
[21:44:01] <Dusk> mhm
[21:44:36] <Dusk> I'm still wondering how long it'll take for people to figure out how the consoles' APU setup talks to the components

[21:45:39] <Dusk> Emulation will be simpler, more than likely since it isn't /as/ custom and we're not trying to figure out another architecture and how to make it run on another :p
[21:46:58] * Colgate ports wine to arm
[21:47:21] <Phase> Colgate, actually it already has arm support
[21:47:31] <Phase> infact i think they beat microsoft to 64bit arm
[21:47:32] <Colgate> oh, well then
[21:49:00] <Phase> Dusk, actually i think one of the restrictions on the xbox was the inability to map pages as executable
[21:49:06] <Phase> so a static recompile wouldn't be too hard
[21:49:26] <Dusk> hm

[21:54:11] <ChaosDragoness> Alright techies, I got a real brainteaser of a computer problem for you. 
[21:55:26] <ChaosDragoness> Error: DNS probe finished no internet
[21:55:56] <ChaosDragoness> And here's the tricky part. None of the usual solutions have worked.
[21:56:56] <Colgate> I don't understand that error message
[21:58:00] <ChaosDragoness> It's an internet service error. It basically says it can't find a DNS server.
[21:58:32] <Colgate> well, do a traceroute and see where your connection dies
[21:59:58] <Dusk> ^
[22:00:16] <Dusk> You can also flush your DNS and specify your own DNS servers
[22:02:25] <ChaosDragoness> Just fyi, this isn't my problem, but since he has no internet, I'm being nice and relaying between you and him.
[22:03:01] <ChaosDragoness> He tried that Dusk, it didn't work.
[22:03:21] <Dusk> Uh
[22:03:28] <Dusk> is the adaptor itself broken?

[22:27:29] <Twilightlicious> Problem Solved.
[22:27:39] * Twilightlicious hides
[22:28:01] <Colgate> depends on what the issue is, if the DNS they are querying is down, sure
[22:29:35] <ChaosDragoness> He tried that too Twilightlicious
[22:29:51] <Twilightlicious> ping 8.8.8.8
[22:29:56] <Twilightlicious> See if it replies.
[22:30:17] <Twilightlicious> and not to insult anyones intelegence, but has he tried "reboot all the things!!"
[22:30:22] <ChaosDragoness> yes
[22:30:51] <ChaosDragoness> and 8.8.8.8 is googles DNS, and google is up so I'm going to assume that yes it's up.
[22:32:42] <Twilightlicious> Thats a terrible assumption to make
[22:33:03] <Twilightlicious> Also, it's not about testing if Google's DNS Service is up, but about if he is able to reach it

[22:34:38] <Twilightlicious> The section where Xbox One shows you the games you have yet to install isn't functioning
[22:34:53] <Twilightlicious> i assume because they're enabling backwards compatibility. 
[22:35:15] <Twilightlicious> could also be because my internet is acting up
[22:36:38] <ChaosDragoness> only backward compatability with certain multiplayer games unfortunately

[23:07:50] <Phase> "but not all of them, you'll have to buy them again"
[23:07:55] <ChaosDragoness> That's along with the other 15 that microsoft owns the rights too. Like Banjo Kazooie Nts and Bolts
[23:12:04] <Twilightlicious> Thats not true, Phase :P
[23:12:46] <Twilightlicious> if you owned them on 360, you own them on Xbox One
[23:13:46] <Twilightlicious> once they get Xbox Live back up and running, you'll see compatible 360 games appearing in your games list on Xbox One (Assuming you're a preview member)
[23:14:00] <Twilightlicious> if you're not a preview member, send me a friend request ;)
[23:15:42] <Twilightlicious> You can have microsoft Call or Text you when Xbox Live is fixed
[23:15:45] <ChaosDragoness> Not sure what a preview member is.

[23:15:54] * ChaosDragoness sends a friend request anyway
[23:16:05] <Twilightlicious> being a Preview Member gives you Beta updates
[23:16:14] <Twilightlicious> you test features before they go live to the masses
[23:16:38] <Twilightlicious> backwards compatibility is available to preview members today, and not to the masses until around October.
[23:19:31] <ChaosDragoness> ah
[23:19:48] <ChaosDragoness> Wonder when the list of compatible games will be up.
[23:20:21] <ChaosDragoness> I'm also wondering if it will only be games that you own digitally on the xbox 360
