[02:07:54] <nscoots> unlike good old giant pin and screw VGA/DVI/ Parallel
[02:08:27] <nscoots> same with micro usb really also...

[02:08:47] <AppleDash> lol
[02:08:54] <AppleDash> I like DVI and standard USB B

[02:09:11] <nscoots> usb-c I have yet to use but looks promising

[02:10:50] <Sour_Sweet> Apart from type c?
[02:11:05] <Phase> type c is the one i'm thinking of
[02:11:09] <nscoots> fire wire has been reasonable for well over a decade
[02:11:21] <nscoots> just no one used it
[02:11:22] <Sour_Sweet> Doesn't apple use type c now?
[02:11:25] <nscoots> as proprietary
[02:11:31] <nscoots> they do have type c now
[02:11:42] <nscoots> but shouldn't have needed it if they open sourced fire wire
[02:11:45] <Phase> is type c actually in stuff though
[02:11:50] <AppleDash> Didn't Apple make that laptop with only one port whatsoever which is a USB type C port?

[02:15:14] <Sour_Sweet> How did that piece of crap connector even passed any testing?
[02:15:14] <nscoots> microannoyance is totally worth reinventing the globe for
[02:15:19] <nscoots> think of the foals!!!
[02:15:38] <Phase> nscoots, it is quite easy to damage a micro-b connector by putting it in the wrong way

[02:16:07] <Sour_Sweet> "think of the foals!!!" Because I'm swearing? :D
[02:16:24] <Phase> but the real gain imo is the lack of that thing in connecters whats name i don't know is now gone

[05:26:37] <tiwake> what
[05:26:38] <tiwake> lol
[05:26:49] <tiwake> DJ-C0L7[EIT]: flow and temp are very important
[05:26:52] <tiwake> and very related
[05:27:20] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> tiwake if you are referring to hydroboost brakes
[05:27:34] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> which are a completely different subsystem
[05:28:03] <tiwake> I'm talking about most hydraulic systems that have a pump of some sort
[05:28:28] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> that would be a hydroboost system which uses your power steering pump/apparatus to operate the brakes as opposed to a vacuum servo
[05:28:56] <tiwake> oh, the context is car brakes?
[05:29:04] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> standard braking systems which use the vacuum servo your foot pressing the pedal is the charge applied to the braking apparatus
[05:29:14] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[05:29:32] <tiwake> meh
[05:29:50] <tiwake> donno what you are talking about, but all my car brakes have used hydraulics
[05:30:11] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> thats a standard system unless you have a 10,000Lb tractor-trailer rig which uses Pneumatic Brakes
[05:30:12] <tiwake> its a rather simple system, as it should be, no complicated electronic things

[05:30:55] <tiwake> ;)
[05:31:07] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> its like auto manufacturers have decided to go "hea, lets complicate this dead-simple system to a point where they are /required/ to bring the vehicle in to us to be worked on for /all/ services"
[05:31:27] <tiwake> they are going the consumerism rout
[05:31:35] <tiwake> like everything else manufactured these days
[05:31:41] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lets add ABS with 300 bleed points in just the cycling pump, then lets add another bleed point at the accumulator, and require a computer to get into the system so you can control the attack and decay because all pumps are not created equal
[05:31:44] <tiwake> excluding the stuff I manufacture
[05:32:16] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i hate ABS, i hate airbags, and i hate /most/ automatic transmissions

[05:35:05] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i drive a vehicle thats 28 years old, the newer one i picked up that i just started driving a couple of weeks ago is 25 years old
[05:35:12] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> which one Phase?
[05:35:15] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> airbags or abs?
[05:35:17] <Phase> both
[05:35:35] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> airbags can be triggered by trail obsticles that come into contact with either the bumper or the trigger apparatus
[05:35:41] <Phase> also ammerican airbags or rest of the world airbags?
[05:35:48] <Phase> american'
[05:35:52] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> abs can cause problems with braking as according to the abs computer it is a "slippery surface"
[05:36:38] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> so instead of allowing you to lock your wheels, it tries to continue to let the wheel rotate, which if you are on an incline can be a big problem, or in the case of a vehicle i had, the abs physically pulled us off of the road onto a soft shoulder and would not allow me to lock the brakes to stop
[05:36:42] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> resulting in a rollover
[05:36:54] <Phase> ah
[05:37:34] <tiwake> in the end its the car doing things I may or may not want it to do, regardless if I do or dont, I don't have a choice
[05:38:07] <Phase> DJ-C0L7[EIT], do modern offroad vehicles let you toggle abs?
[05:38:18] <tiwake> no I don't want the car doors to automatically lock when driving down the road
[05:38:20] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> depends on the price tag
[05:38:41] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> mercedees benz has a mode when the t-case is switched into any of the 4wd modes it disables ABS
[05:39:03] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ford Rapter pickups have a "smart abs" thats less aggressive and allows for more wheel lockup in 4HI and disables ABS in 4Low
[05:39:16] * Phase has been though a course that did emergency breaking
[05:39:22] <Phase> on tar you want ABS
[05:39:27] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> jeep just has the abs on all the damn time O_o for some reason, but the rubicon had an option where you could turn abs off if the lockers were engauged in low range
[05:39:47] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i've outbraked vehicles with ABS in my 27 year old 4x4
[05:39:50] <AppleDash> I feel like you could modify the thing to disable ABS
[05:39:50] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> without abs
[05:39:55] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you can
[05:40:00] <AppleDash> Is it illegal?
[05:40:04] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> most people just dont understand how simple it actually is
[05:40:12] <tiwake> AppleDash: probably not in texas ;)
[05:40:15] <AppleDash> lol
[05:40:18] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> not really, as long as you arent at fault in a wreck
[05:40:18] <Phase> DJ-C0L7[EIT], you can outbreak an ABS but it's intended for emergency situations
[05:40:31] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ABS is intended to maintain control in an emergency
[05:40:36] <Phase> yeah
[05:40:37] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it is not ment to stop the vehicle quicker, just safer
[05:41:40] <tiwake> jep, ABS is really only useful for wet or icy roads
[05:42:00] <Phase> tiwake, locked up turning wheels are useless
[05:42:23] <tiwake> normal road conditions, laying rubber will increase the overall fiction cause sticky rubber being layed down
[05:42:35] <Phase> at the cost of control
[05:42:39] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> if you understand braking, and performance braking you are able to come to within 3% of lockup on standard brakes and stop the vehicle quickly and safely
[05:42:57] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> without a full-lock scenario
[05:43:34] <tiwake> lived in montana for a few years, I understand icy roads :P
[05:43:40] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> another fun thing you cant do with ABS, Throttle Brake Manipulation

[05:46:05] <Colgate> there were 21+ con events, /shrug
[05:46:25] <Colgate> and they had non-alcoholic cider during the day, all you could drink
[05:46:33] <Colgate> wasn't the greatest stuff, but not terrible

[05:47:24] <AppleDash> That's a bit much
[05:48:08] <Colgate> whatever, had our own liquor too
[05:48:24] <tiwake> hmm
[05:48:30] <Colgate> mostly drank kraken and vodka/hpnotiq
[05:48:41] <Colgate> although this guy had some honey whiskey, that was pretty good
[05:48:46] <tiwake> that hpnotiq stuff is kinda meh
[05:49:00] <Colgate> it's a good mixer imo
[05:49:10] <tiwake> probably not bad as a mixer
[05:49:17] <Colgate> I wouldn't drink it straight
[05:49:20] <tiwake> but for what? its a mixed thing in its self

[05:50:49] <tiwake> Colgate: any idea how much latency a good network would add to access time for a SSD?
[05:51:08] <Colgate> a good network?
[05:51:14] <tiwake> 10G network
[05:51:30] <Colgate> uh, a few ms?
[05:51:31] <tiwake> so yeah, a good network
[05:51:51] <Colgate> are you building a san?
[05:52:03] <tiwake> I've talked about it a bit before
[05:52:43] <tiwake> I want to build a RAID array, with either a SSD cache or RAM disk cache, and computers in the house PXE booting from that server
[05:53:11] <tiwake> I was wondering how much latency would be added just considering the SSD
[05:53:58] <tiwake> it wouldent be noticeable for a hard drive really, cause access times are typically pretty slow, and a decent network would be faster than that by some larger margin
[05:55:15] <tiwake> but with a proper cache, I was just thinking about how much more latency would be added
[05:55:51] *** Quits: Gladiolus (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:56:06] <tiwake> a modern decent SATA SSD might have a 4k file access time of, just guessing, maybe 0.2ms, maybe a bit less
[05:56:40] <tiwake> ping time to my router and back is 0.35ms, but thats not what I would consider a "good" network
[05:57:14] <tiwake> donno
[05:57:18] <tiwake> thought I would ask :P

[06:17:40] <tiwake> DJ-C0L7[CSS]: I've been seriously considering building myself a car thats sane
[06:18:43] <tiwake> as in, putting in my own (open source) computer system of my choice, engine, etc. in a sane easy to work on way
[06:19:36] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> like the megasquirt DIY-FI setup
[06:19:47] <tiwake> donno what that is
[06:20:22] <tiwake> but I'm kinda torn between... enh, actually I've pretty much decided that I don't want to build my own frame
[06:20:36] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> the Micro squirt and Mega Squirt are fuel injection systems you design yourself, you buy the ECU then add what sensors you want, tune it, and adjust to suit your needs
[06:20:42] <tiwake> get a ford mustang frame or something, and go from there
[06:20:57] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> microsquirt does fuel injection only, megasquirt can do timing as well as fuel injection

[06:23:24] <tiwake> to be street legal you need headlights and a windshield... uh.. not sure if there are any other requirements
[06:24:13] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> O_o in Oklahoma you are required to have, head lights, brake lights, signaling devices, a windshield, seatbelts, and thats about it minimum
[06:24:19] <HoneyDrops> I think there are some basic requirements, but you can build one from scratch.  Insurance could be a bitch though.
[06:24:20] <Phase> yeah, i'm not sure what covers sale and what covers roadworthy
[06:24:32] <tiwake> you don't need signal lights
[06:24:34] <Phase> i don't think you can use a from-scratch car on australian roads
[06:24:42] <tiwake> hand signals are still legal to use
[06:24:57] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> you can use hand signals here in the US, but people dont seem to understand them
[06:25:12] <tiwake> true
[06:25:15] <tiwake> but still legal
[06:25:16] <Colgate> and only during the day
[06:25:21] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> nod
[06:25:25] * Phase would just have lights
[06:25:31] <tiwake> lights are easier

[06:28:22] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i had a "dirtrod" as my first vehicle
[06:28:25] <tiwake> is the term I've seen used
[06:28:38] <tiwake> no, it would not be a hotrod

[06:28:56] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> like my daily driver?
[06:29:05] <tiwake> thats what I would use it for
[06:29:39] <Phase> yeah, the way this is written australian laws are considered at the date of manufacture
[06:29:54] <tiwake> it would be a lot easier to use an existing frame
[06:30:00] <Phase> and constructing your own would make you a manufacturer

[06:30:11] <Phase> which includes running impact tests and so on
[06:30:17] <tiwake> that way I don't have to worry about trying to make doors or latches or w/e
[06:31:07] <HoneyDrops> At least in the US, as long as it met some pretty basic standards, and passes some roadworthy test, I think the only reamining issue is insurance.  Similarly, you can build your own aircraft and fly it.
[06:31:23] <tiwake> the other option was to buy a brand new car, or a relatively new car, and strip out all the electronic controller stuff, and rebuild that stuff to be sane
[06:31:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> in the U.S you take it to a tag agency, they do a quick inspection to verify that its safe, and thats it
[06:31:32] <HoneyDrops> There is just a minimal test that it can indeed fly/land to some minimal safety standard.
[06:33:03] <tiwake> I think the best option is to get a frame and build that into what I want
[06:33:34] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i'd love to lay my hooves on an M35A2D
[06:34:31] <tiwake> meh

[09:55:47] <HoneyDrops> As opposed to a copyright assignment clause where they set whatever terms for everyone, including you.
[09:57:14] <Moonlightning> So, you're only giving them full rights, as opposed to giving them full rights?
[09:57:16] <HoneyDrops> While they require you to allow them to basically do whatever, you still retain the right to do what you want with your submission and are free to set the terms for everyone else, except them.
[10:03:49] <HoneyDrops> There must be some agreement on submission that you are giving them permission to use your work in some capacity.  Otherwise they couldn't display it in any fashion without violating your copyrights.  Agreements like that are pretty standard for anything that displays user submitted works.
[10:06:03] <HoneyDrops> see: http://about.deviantart.com/policy/submission/  §3
[10:06:04] <PinkiePieBot> [ Submission Policy - DeviantArt ]
[10:11:41] <HoneyDrops> As for the specific things they list: reproduce, display, transmit, and publish are all a bare minimum to just display exactly what you upload.  Edit, compress, modify, prepare derivative works are to allow them to be able to rescale, re-encode, etc.  or even display stills/thumbnails.  adding a logo is likely for branding the video as part of the contest and captions are pretty
[10:11:43] <HoneyDrops> self-explaintory.
[10:11:45] <Moonlightning> This is stupid. The law should be written to allow for implicit exceptions when you're submitting a work to an entity that will be putting it on display.
[10:12:00] <Moonlightning> If you didn't want them to be displaying it, why would you be submitting it?
[10:12:21] <HoneyDrops> Well the law in dumb, and that's where we are - you need an explicit agreement.
[10:13:02] <Moonlightning> It also gives them broad sweeping powers to do literally anything, including misrepresent you.
[10:13:24] <Moonlightning> If they need it for scaling et al, they should SAY /for scaling et al/, so that they can't go and do ridiculous shit
[10:14:04] <Moonlightning> It also says /irrevocable and perpetual/, which means you can't ever decide you don't want it on their site anymore.
[10:14:08] <HoneyDrops> In theory yes, but they have to write something broad enough to cover their needs but not so specific as to miss some critical problem.
[10:14:31] <HoneyDrops> Well yeah, they don't want the liability of someone changing their mind then suing them.
[10:14:54] <Moonlightning> Well, obviously you can't change your mind and sue right away; you have to give them a reasonable amount of time to take it down.
[10:15:03] <HoneyDrops> Why not?
[10:15:13] <Moonlightning> That would also be unreasonable?
[10:15:13] <HoneyDrops> There is no requirement for you to give them notice.

[10:15:43] <HoneyDrops> Add it to the list of things that need to be fixed in copyright law?
[10:15:51] * Moonlightning groans.
[10:16:46] <HoneyDrops> Submission terms like that suck, but are the "best" we have until copyright as a whole is fixed (world-wide).
[10:20:33] * HoneyDrops hugs Moonlightning.
[10:21:07] * Moonlightning hides his muzzle in HoneyDrops' fur.
[10:21:14] <Moonlightning> Mrrrrf. -.-
[10:21:45] <HoneyDrops> Submission terms are just the ugly patch to hack around the underlying flaws.  Some are better than others, but they are at the moment a necessary evil.
[10:21:49] * HoneyDrops pat pats Moonlightning.
[10:22:17] <Moonlightning> speaking of patches to hack around underlying flaws
[10:23:10] <Moonlightning> Is there /really/ not a better way to use slices longer than 32 elements than https://stackoverflow.com/a/30903184 ?
[10:23:13] <HoneyDrops> Hell, they are generally better than academic papers.  Too many journals actually require you sign over the rights to the journal.  Meaning the people who wrote it cannot distribute it without permission from the journal.
[10:24:50] <HoneyDrops> Plus you pay for the submission, and people have to pay to access it.  If that were not bad enough, the reviewing is done by volunteers too.
[10:25:22] * Moonlightning frowns.
[10:25:25] <Moonlightning> The fuck?
[10:25:34] <Moonlightning> I thought science was supposed to be a /peer-reviewed/ field
[10:25:47] <HoneyDrops> It is, that is the volunteers.
[10:25:53] <Moonlightning> That's not peer-reviewed.
[10:25:59] <Moonlightning> That's //elite-//reviewd.
[10:26:05] <Moonlightning> With one more E.
[10:27:03] <HoneyDrops> Those volunteers are normally professors and researchers in the same field... not sure how much more "peer" you can get..?
[10:29:06] <HoneyDrops> The good news is several fields are fighting the abusive publishers, physics, CS and math most prominently.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access

[16:16:43] <Compu> anyways, i wiped it and got the OS up to to date and gave it to my friend to use as basically the android equivalent of an ipod touch, with google maps' new fully offline feature he can even use it with GPS
[16:18:00] <Compu> also it will probably last longer on battery with no sim card since it should turn off the cellular antenna
