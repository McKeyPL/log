[01:05:50] <RazorSharpFang> You know, I don't understand Orcale's business model. Where do they make their money from?
[01:08:07] <Midnight_Tinker> every time you question the oracle, it demands a sacrifice
[01:08:53] <Midnight_Tinker> also their enterprise software is balls expensive
[01:12:18] <ShivalWolf> stagefright vulnerbility POC - http://drops.wooyun.org/papers/7557
[01:13:39] <RazorSharpFang> ShivalWolf: I can't read uhmm... Chinese?
[01:14:10] <Gladiolus> Pretty sure it's from support contracts, RazorSharpFang.
[01:14:18] <Gladiolus> VirtualBox might be free, but support isn't.
[01:14:23] <Gladiolus> etc
[01:14:28] <ShivalWolf> RazorSharpFang: so use a browser with intergrated auto translate
[01:14:32] <ShivalWolf> and suddenly its not a problem
[01:14:40] <HoneyDrops|Half> last I checked Oracle ran on spite and orphan's tears.
[01:15:08] <HoneyDrops|Half> But yeah, support is crazy expensive.
[01:15:43] <RazorSharpFang> What does 'support' actually refer to?
[01:15:54] <RazorSharpFang> Product bugfixes? Updates?
[01:16:12] <Colgate> ShivalWolf: is there one that doesn't report back to a C&C?
[01:16:44] <Gladiolus> yes, yes, and also sending a dude to make sure a giant deployment works.
[01:16:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> Depends on the product.  Can be that they will fix your bugs for you when asked, can be they will help you migrate your old DBs to their software (but never away), etc.
[01:16:53] <Gladiolus> they also appear to do a looooot of enterprise stuff
[01:17:28] <HoneyDrops|Half> If you pay for Oracle support, if you want to do it, they will make sure you can.  As long as you keep the money flowing.
[01:17:55] <RazorSharpFang> You're basically just hiring Oracle then.
[01:20:14] <Midnight_Tinker> pretty much every large successful (non retail) corporation is a consulting firm on some level
[01:20:18] <HoneyDrops|Half> If you encounter a bug, or can't figure out how to do something, they will hold your hand though it, and your wallet.
[01:21:41] <Gladiolus> and your dick for a small extra fee
[01:24:27] <Midnight_Tinker> my dick cost a late night fee

[01:36:16] <PinkieShy> Hi, I am wondering if i install Ubuntu and i know it puts GRUB in the UEFI if i say like 1yr from now decide to like remove ubuntu, so i go into windows and use the disk management tool to remove the partitions for ubuntu would that also remove the GRUB boot loader from showing up in the UEFI Boot menu
[01:37:14] <Gladiolus> I believe that there's a specific EFI partition that contains boot loaders like that, but that could just be where windows puts it's specific boot-loader.
[01:37:37] <HoneyDrops|Half> If GRUB is installed to the UEFI partition, it would remain, but you could remove it from there.
[01:37:52] <PinkieShy> Gladiolus the kind of UEfI on this gateway laptop is limited
[01:39:10] <PinkieShy> How would i even access the UEFI partition using my windows recovery disc drive it has option to access UEFI firmware settings i click that and it just reboots the machine and takes me right to the UEFI menu stuff like i could access by holding done f2 at boot up
[01:39:23] <Gladiolus> It's a hidden partition 
[01:39:55] <Gladiolus> There's a few ways to access it in windows, not sure about linux.
[01:40:09] <HoneyDrops|Half> You can mount it under Linux like a normal vfat partition.
[01:40:33] <PinkieShy> Gladiolus If i get it to show up so its not hidden would a reboot make it hidden again?
[01:40:37] <HoneyDrops|Half> At least on my Thinkpad, I literally use the EFI partition as my /boot
[01:41:18] <Cepheid> Same, with my laptop.
[01:41:21] <Gladiolus> No, you would have to hide it again in windows.
[01:42:35] <PinkieShy> gladiolus how would that be done?
[01:43:02] <Gladiolus> Google for it, there's a few guides and I don't know it by heart.
[01:43:44] <Gladiolus> Why do you need to access it? What exactly is the problem? GRUB isn't working?
[01:44:16] <PinkieShy> No i haven't installed ubuntu yet but i plan on it soon i was just wondering just incase i were to install it and a few months later decide i don't need it no more
[01:46:28] *** Joins: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net)
[01:46:42] <PinkieShy> I love ubuntu :)
[01:46:48] <PinkieShy> i tested it on live usb and it works so fast 
[01:47:13] <Gladiolus> You should be able to remove grub relatively easily.
[01:47:56] <PinkieShy> ok
[01:49:21] <Gladiolus> I always couch my computer advice in indefinite articles to distance myself from being responsible for problems :)
[01:50:45] <Gigabit> I can barely be online, whats the command to list all running processes? So I can killall steamspidhere
[01:50:56] <Caerdwyn> ps aux
[01:51:03] <PinkieShy> Gladioslus wanna know something funny.. Microsoft caused a problem on my laptop 2 nights ago xD
[01:51:06] <Caerdwyn> or pidof steam
[01:51:14] <Caerdwyn> ps aux | grep "steam"
[01:51:30] <Gladiolus> lel
[01:51:36] <PinkieShy> They said my computer was compatible with windows 10.. I got it installed and it wouldn't boot right.. it kept crashing, i used the windows 10 recovery to reset and then still wouldn't work.. 
[01:51:40] <Caerdwyn> how about just.. killall steam
[01:51:42] <Caerdwyn> lol
[01:51:44] <Gladiolus> weird
[01:51:48] *** Joins: init3 (jason@init3.Is.Not.A.Clever.Poni)
[01:51:49] <PinkieShy> I contacted acer/intel about it they both told me my computer wasn't compatible.
[01:51:57] <PinkieShy> So Microsoft was wrong xD
[01:52:04] <Gladiolus> anything past a core 2 should work
[01:52:10] <Gladiolus> so i dunno my guess is acer just blows
[01:52:13] <Gigabit> okay so would it be kill pid then?
[01:52:17] <Caerdwyn> yes
[01:52:19] <Gigabit> because steam is acting up and being a sombitch
[01:52:21] <PinkieShy> I'm on Intel Pentium b960 with intel hd graphics (2nd gen i think?)
[01:52:33] <Gigabit> I told it to kill and it isnt x.x
[01:52:42] <Caerdwyn> Gigabit: ps aux | grep "steam" -> then 'kill pidgoeshere'
[01:52:48] <Caerdwyn> if it doesnt die right away, add sudo
[01:52:54] <Gladiolus> That should definitely support win10
[01:52:54] <PinkieShy> those specs would run linux would it?
[01:52:58] <Gladiolus> acer probably just got lazy
[01:52:59] <Gladiolus> also yes
[01:53:12] <Caerdwyn> kill does a SIGTERM by default. do a SIGKILL. 'kill -9 pidofsteam'
[01:53:37] <PinkieShy> Gladiolus why would Intel live support tell me the graphics card won't support 10? They told me it for 8.1 it only supports Legacy WDDM
[01:55:02] <Gladiolus> so it's intel being lazy then
[01:55:19] <Gladiolus> that's odd tho, see in the win10 beta i had to use 8.1 nvidia drivers
[01:55:23] <Gladiolus> they worked fine, more or less
[01:55:30] <Gladiolus> so intel's drivers just totally suck

[01:57:27] <Caerdwyn> ewwwww Colgate gtfo
[01:57:36] <PinkieShy> Gladiolus the crash ID was like System thread not handled.. then the computer rebooted surprising right this time and then it said out of memory.. but i have 500GB HDD and 4GB DDR3 ram

[06:17:54] <HoneyDrops|Half> I've been pleased with my Samsung 830, still working fine after 3 years.
[06:20:26] *** Joins: Gladiolus (SRQ@the.truth.is.out.there)
[06:31:58] <init3> I know Crucial used to be a top notch RAM manufacturer Gigabit. That was like early 2000s though. Not sure if they are still regarded as such. 
[06:32:21] <Gladiolus> I just buy the cheapest ram available, works for me
[06:32:34] <Gladiolus> i think right now i have some... ripjaws? it has a weird heatsink
[06:32:37] <Gladiolus> was the cheapest tho
[06:32:52] <Gladiolus> G.SKILL YO lol
[06:32:54] <HoneyDrops|Half> I had narrowed myself to Crucial, Samsung, and Intel when I was looking because those seemed to be the most reliable options, back in 2012.
[06:33:03] * JustAberrant throws frenchfries into the channel for everyone to play with
[06:33:06] <Gigabit> yeah
[06:33:07] <Gladiolus> oh SSDs, Gigabit is getting one?
[06:33:27] <Gigabit> Yeah my friend is loaning me 80 bucks to get a larger one
[06:33:27] <Gladiolus> Samsung and Intel are the highest price and best quality, everyone else plays a game of musical chairs.
[06:33:57] <Gladiolus> of note is that Apple uses samsung nand in their own stuff
[06:36:22] * JustAberrant narrows eyes.. that's why I use intel..
[06:36:40] <JustAberrant> (actually that's just a healthy coincidence, but I have been happy with intel for SSDs
[06:36:46] <JustAberrant> I had a crucial one die on me
[06:36:55] <Gladiolus> lel
[06:37:11] <JustAberrant> and some other one.. patriot or something.. made weird noises
[06:37:20] <HoneyDrops|Half> But Apple uses Intel's cpus ;)
[06:37:26] <Gladiolus> "heh apple" aside, if they can provide chips on that large a scale it's a good sign. 
[06:37:33] * HoneyDrops|Half still mourns ppc.
[06:37:40] <Gladiolus> I have a late-gen powerbook lol
[06:37:45] <Gladiolus> 15'' 1.67 with the hi-dpi
[06:37:47] <JustAberrant> well, I'm sure they'll switch to something else soon
[06:37:55] <JustAberrant> they wouldn't dare use the same architecture for too long
[06:38:00] <Gladiolus> It's such nice hardware but nothing runs on 10.4 ;_;
[06:38:02] <HoneyDrops|Half> Hopefully something non-x86.
[06:38:11] <Gladiolus> but i like x86
[06:38:15] <Gladiolus> my 90s videogames are x86
[06:38:41] <HoneyDrops|Half> x86 can stay around, but I hate that desktop computing is dominated by one cpu arch.
[06:38:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> I want to see 5-10 competing ones with about equal market share.
[06:39:01] <Gladiolus> not gonna happen
[06:39:06] <Gladiolus> not now anyway
[06:39:12] * HoneyDrops|Half can dream.
[06:39:23] <Gladiolus> you try breaking into the market now and you're gonna get every investor laughing
[06:39:39] <Gladiolus> "So it's you, and me, vs intels billions of dollars in research and marketting? pffahaha- ever heard of Cyrix?"
[06:39:45] <JustAberrant> maybe itanium will come back :>
[06:40:29] <HoneyDrops|Half> I'll fully admit I mostly want multiple cpu arch to make binary software distribution as painful as possible.
[06:41:03] <JustAberrant> won't happen for exactly that reason
[06:41:15] <JustAberrant> microsoft will pick one, apple will pick one, the others will die quickly
[06:41:47] <JustAberrant> hell, even the mainstream distros are getting tired of supporting multiple arches
[06:42:21] <JustAberrant> and a huge number of upstream projects won't bother making their code portable

[06:46:24] <Gladiolus> I would love multiple cpu /vendors/ but as a consumer ugh just one arch
[06:46:36] <Gladiolus> Whatever makes intel actually start competing though, man do that.

[06:46:50] <Gladiolus> gouging
[06:46:51] <Gladiolus> w/e
[06:46:54] <Gigabit> does amazon price match?
[06:47:11] <Gladiolus> Go IBM, release PowerDuo on that 12nm tech they announced.
[06:47:32] <Gladiolus> So much die space that includes an x86 dynamic recompliler! (is that a thing?)
[06:49:22] <HoneyDrops|Half> My position is software should be written to be portable and source distribution should be the default (even if not permissively licensed).
[06:49:35] <Gladiolus> "What do you think of apple?" "I thought the Shuffle was adorable."
[06:49:37] <Gladiolus> oh Cortana
[06:49:44] <Gladiolus> I love having fun with stuff lke that.
[06:49:49] <Googie> That is. JIT compilation is pretty common in emulators, but is still nowhere near as fast as native
[06:50:07] <Gladiolus> Could it do relatively fast x86 emulation though, like usable?
[06:50:30] <Gladiolus> Not for games and shiz but for office programs, so that Windows on Theoritical Power Processor could have some sort of backend for it
[06:50:49] <Gladiolus> That's the only way I see it working is if there's /some/ amount of compatability across the stream.
[06:51:12] <Gladiolus> Then you can advertise on your native strengths and "you can bring along your old software too if you need it"
[06:51:57] <Gladiolus> I would be all for buying a RISC processor if it's faster native, and I can still run some of my old x86 stuff.
[06:52:02] <Gladiolus> Otherwise no lol go away
[06:52:32] <Phase> Gladiolus, loongson
[06:52:37] <Googie> It should be possible.
[06:52:48] <Gladiolus> would it create licencing issues?
[06:52:58] <Phase> mips64 + some extensions, when combind with qemu patches, achieves ~80% native

[06:53:17] <Gladiolus> 80% native, Shit yeah I can live with that.
[06:53:21] <Phase> my bad, 70%

[06:54:03] <Gladiolus> Yeah I could live with "Your processor is now cooler running, faster at native apps, and can still run older apps at 70% native."
[06:54:16] <Gladiolus> 70% native will scale I imagine so 5 years from now it's faster than current native.
[06:54:27] * Googie wonders the legalities of that also
[06:54:29] <Gladiolus> why isn't this a thing then
[06:54:32] <Gigabit> I'm gunna get the mx200 because I also have 40 dollars in amazon credit
[06:54:50] <Googie> AMD/Intel own some IP on parts of the modern x86 ISA
[06:55:14] <Gladiolus> I like how AMD licences x86, and then Intel has to licence the AMD64 extensions. Or am I wrong about that?
[06:55:18] <Gladiolus> I gope I'm right because it's funny.
[06:55:30] <Gladiolus> IT'S A CIRCLE
[06:56:19] <HoneyDrops|Half> Can just wait for the patents to expire.  Sure that keeps newer extensions off limits, but a ton of stuff doesn't use them.

[08:28:31] <init3> Probably not what you are talking about but there is a WM called "awesome".
[08:28:31] <init3> But I'd recommend KDE,XFCE or Gnome in that order. 
[08:28:33] <JustAberrant> * used
[08:28:44] * HoneyDrops|Half uses dwm.
[08:29:19] <init3> KDE is heavy on system resources but has a shit ton of features. XFCE is super lightweight and has most everything you need and Gnome is kinda in the middle there. 
[08:29:31] <JustAberrant> or CDE :>
[08:29:41] <JustAberrant> I hear it's possible to get that running on linux now
[08:29:44] <JustAberrant> kinda wanna try it
[08:29:53] * JustAberrant used it a lot.. on solaris 2.something
[08:30:09] <init3> But those are DesktopEnvronments not WindowManagers which are a part of DEs but not all of it. 
[08:30:12] <HoneyDrops|Half> My WM journey was window maker (2005), blackbox (2005), fluxbox(2005-2006), fvwm (2006-2009), dwm (2009-).
[08:30:13] <JustAberrant> along with *violent shuddering* teamware, sccs, and sun studio
[08:31:02] * JustAberrant windowmaker > fluxbox > kde 3 > openbox > now a weird openbox + xfce mixture
[08:31:10] <HoneyDrops|Half> wait, err, weap 2005 to 2003. I forgot when I was in undergrad XD
[08:31:13] <HoneyDrops|Half> swap*
[08:31:18] <JustAberrant> errr
[08:31:25] *** Joins: Hickory (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[08:31:25] <JustAberrant> icewm between fluxbox and kde 3
[08:31:42] * JustAberrant stuck with icewm for a long damn time.. several years
[08:31:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> I never cared for DEs, never saw the point in them.
[08:32:27] <init3> I can see that
[08:32:33] <Gigaway> So would KDE on Ubuntu work?
[08:32:38] <JustAberrant> kde 3 wasn't bad, only thing you really get out of a DE vs a WM is it deals with some configuration for you
[08:32:40] <init3> Yeah
[08:32:43] <JustAberrant> and kde 3 did a decent job
[08:32:47] <HoneyDrops|Half> I've settled on dwm because it does everything I need a wm to do, and I know the codebase well enough I can (and did back in 2009) extent to fit my needs exactly.
[08:32:53] <Gigaway> Because I really dislike unity or what ever is default x.x
[08:32:57] <HoneyDrops|Half> extend*
[08:32:58] <init3> Me too
[08:33:15] <JustAberrant> I usually like to config everything manually, but kde 3 did have some "just works" appeal going on
[08:33:29] <Gigaway> So.. Can I use the software manager to install KDE?
[08:33:36] <JustAberrant> anyway, I'm going to bed
[08:33:37] <JustAberrant> `nite
[08:33:39] <HoneyDrops|Half> nini
[08:33:46] <Gigaway> Or do I need to do something special, and will it mess up all the binds?
[08:33:53] <JustAberrant> also kde 4 was terrible.. probably better now, but when it first came out if was absolute shit
[08:33:56] <init3> If you are decided to use KDE you probably want to decide between KDE4 and Plasma5
[08:34:03] <init3> PLasma is nice
[08:34:07] <HoneyDrops|Half> Gigaway: you can install it like any other package
[08:34:16] <init3> But a little unstable still. 
[08:34:20] <init3> Just a little
[08:34:26] <Gigaway> Isnt mint and Debian both KDE?
[08:34:31] <HoneyDrops|Half> You can install multiple DEs at once and swap between them if you really want to.
[08:34:37] <init3> Ming in cinnamon. 
[08:34:39] <init3> Mint
[08:34:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> If you use a login manager it should offer the choice.
[08:34:52] <init3> And debian doesn't have a default as far as I know. 
[08:35:01] <HoneyDrops|Half> debian kinda sorta defaults to gnome
[08:35:20] <init3> Ahh. I've never used Debian on a desktop. 
[08:35:23] <HoneyDrops|Half> But no one running debian has it install X and that out of the box.
[08:35:29] <Gigaway> Then which os was it I used that had KDE.. I know I used it before
[08:35:48] <Hickory> I preffer Xfce
[08:35:58] <init3> XFCE is nice
[08:36:11] <Hickory> Nice and simple, no googly windows or shit.,
[08:36:16] <init3> I used to be 100% for xfce but plasma5 kinda got me hooked. 
[08:36:40] <init3> Plus this IRC client, which integrates with everything. 
[08:36:51] <Hickory> Goddamn cinnabun or whatever it's called.
[08:36:55] <init3> <3 Konversation 
[08:37:16] <HoneyDrops|Half> weechat and irssi are the two correct irc client options.
[08:37:33] <HoneyDrops|Half> and you run them in tmux or GNU Screen.
[08:37:46] <init3> I use weechat normally as well. 
[08:38:26] <init3> But that's on my server for a mobile proxy. 
[08:38:26] <init3> And since I don't have internet right now...
[08:50:30] <HoneyDrops|Half> Gigaway, did you ever use Suse?
[08:50:49] <Gigaway> Nope
[08:51:37] <HoneyDrops|Half> Hmm, trying to think of which ones use KDE by default.
[08:51:42] <Gigaway> Kubuntu, xubuntu,Ubuntu,mint,Debian,raspbian. Those are all I have used
[08:51:53] <HoneyDrops|Half> Kubuntu uses KDE
[08:52:36] * HoneyDrops|Half giggles.  My neighbor is going to wake up to a surprise... they left their car windows cracked and it's pouring right now >_>
[08:52:45] <Gigaway> That explains it then. I used to dual boot windows 7 and Kubuntu
[08:53:19] * Googie is a fan of the i3 window manager
[08:53:42] <Gigaway> God I wish I could find a picture of the dakn UI I seen..

[08:54:41] <HoneyDrops|Half> i3 is a good choice, but I like dwm's tiling model.  People tend to prefer one or the other rather strongly.
[08:55:13] <Googie> I haven't really tried dwm. I maybe should just to get a feel for it at some point.
[08:55:44] <Gigaway> I guess deep down I want something customizable..but I can't do that yet x.x

[10:49:32] <Stik> because it's garbage-collected, you don't release memory yourself, you let the jvm sort it out

[11:00:29] <Seoson> So nice that when I increase the memory allocated to minecraft over a certain amountif the Java gc kicks in the game suddenly drops down to single digit frames for a few moments.
[11:01:32] <Stik> sounds like you might have some other problems than just the gc
[11:01:48] <Stik> shouldn't even be noticable with minecraft i wouldn't have thought
[11:01:58] <Stik> at least not if it's been written properly
[11:02:11] <Seoson> That's probably the point
[11:02:18] <Stik> that it isn't?
[11:02:31] <Seoson> That it isn't written very well
[11:02:35] <Stik> seems like they've had long enough by now to sort out the bugs like that though
[11:02:45] <Stik> not like it's not got any money behind it now, afterall :)
[11:02:51] <Seoson> Oh it's a relatively new thing
[11:03:20] <Seoson> I cannot tell you which version it introduced but it was above 1.6
[11:03:31] <Stik> guess they have a new bug
[11:03:48] <Seoson> I used to give MC ridiculous amounts of RAM
[11:03:50] <Stik> i haven't played minecraft in a while, had to uninstall it to stop myself spending all day building crap :|
[11:05:53] <Stik> i can believe that it's not written very well though, someone in here was trying to mod it a few months back and they were saying it still used opengl 1, which is very very old these days
[11:06:01] <Stik> and not a very good idea
[11:06:29] <Seoson> Java is a pain. While I like the idea to write a program only once and have it run on every plattform and the highlevel API is awesome, it just performs poorly. Nowadays I prefer .Net/Mono
[11:06:49] <Stik> yeah .net seems to be doing well these days
[11:07:14] <Stik> but i would argue that java doesn't perform any worse, badly written programs perform badly ;)
[11:08:36] <Seoson> Also the Java browser plugin "Applets" need to die a sudden death.
[11:09:27] <Stik> all plugins do really
[11:09:32] <Stik> (native ones)
[11:09:48] <Stik> i think the latest chrome has stopped supporting the java plugin anyhow hasn't it?

[19:57:01] <RainbowHacks> I used to make fun of gentoo, but y'all are one of the only distros holding out against that awful redhat malware these days.
[19:57:06] <RainbowHacks> so, kudos.
[19:57:17] <wolfyshy> :3
[19:57:25] <RainbowHacks> Gigabit, that's primarily used on FreeBSD for stuff installed from ports :P
[19:57:31] <wolfyshy> In Real Life I'm heavily involved in the gentoo community
[19:58:03] <wolfyshy> I was in FreeBSD until kib took over and decided to make it a hostile community for everyone
[19:58:16] * RainbowHacks doesnt really interact with the community at large
[19:58:28] <RainbowHacks> i just run the OS because it's stable, and sane.
[19:58:43] <Gigabit> oh..
[19:59:00] <RainbowHacks> Gigabit, yeah that directory probably won't show up on a linux box :p
[19:59:01] <Gigabit> yeah, kde is running a lot smoother
[19:59:43] <HoneyDrops|Half> RainbowHacks: I use Gentoo, Debian (all of my are still pre-systemd), Slackware, and OpenBSD on personal systems.  Back when I did support for a living, it was Mandrake, Debain, Suse, Fedora, and Ubuntu was just coming out.
[20:00:30] <RainbowHacks> HoneyDrops|Half, ah :3
[20:00:42] *** Joins: init3 (jason@init3.Is.Not.A.Clever.Poni)
[20:00:48] <RainbowHacks> I used slackware at my job until we changed hypervisors and could support FreeBSD

[20:00:59] <Gigabit> 50-greeter-wrapper.conf      50-unity-greeter.conf
[20:01:06] <HoneyDrops|Half> Oh, I guess I technically have some OE and Angstrom stuff too, but that's a bit different.
[20:01:11] <RainbowHacks> i've fiddled with most of the distros out there, Slack is definitely the most sane distro IMO
[20:01:29] <Gigabit> so.. which should I edit to make it so KDE is default? The unity greeter?
[20:01:40] <RainbowHacks> Not really a fan of OpenBSD. Too many people get lulled into a false sense of security
[20:01:45] <RainbowHacks> Gigabit, next time, PLEASE pastebin
[20:01:50] <RainbowHacks> people don
[20:01:59] <RainbowHacks> people don't like walls of text dumped in irc -.-
[20:02:06] <Gigabit> sorry, tired and forgot
[20:02:21] <RainbowHacks> HoneyDrops|Half, wolfyshy, high five for awesome unixy goodness!
[20:02:50] <wolfyshy> :D
[20:03:07] * RainbowHacks is currently at work being a linux support drone
[20:03:17] <RainbowHacks> aiming for ops though. hopefully will get it in the next 6 months.
[20:03:19] <HoneyDrops|Half> I'm not generally picky about what distro, BSD flavor, or even linux vs BSD.  For the most part knowledge translates between them, with just a few details that vary.
[20:03:21] <wolfyshy> I agree that OpenBSD gives people a false sense of security
[20:03:30] * Colgate just uses debian stable pretty much everywhere
[20:03:34] <Colgate> or centos
[20:03:34] <wolfyshy> just because the defaults are more secure than Free/Net, it doesn't mean you can just set it and forget it
[20:03:44] <wolfyshy> it takes effort to keep a system secure no matter what the defaults are
[20:03:50] <Gigabit> Okay so I found a file, 50-ubuntu.config and it has a lne that says user-session=ubuntu
[20:03:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> Obviously, security is a process, not a state.
[20:03:56] <RainbowHacks> I subscribe to the old-school hacker mindset. helping morons with their shitty wordpress sites annoys me (there's no intellectual challenge).
[20:04:03] <RainbowHacks> HoneyDrops|Half, AFUCKINMEN <3
[20:04:44] <RainbowHacks> (i mean i get paid very well to help morons, but still. money isn't everything, i'd like something that actually ustilizes my skillset >.< )
[20:05:11] <wolfyshy> RainbowHacks: meanwhile I'm fixing the firefox and dev-python/* ebuilds on gentoo and on my way to getting a commit bit
[20:05:14] <wolfyshy> RainbowHacks: I'm so excited ^.^
[20:05:31] <Gigabit> init3, after I get done working if you are available, may need your knowledge if I cannot figure this out on my own. for now toodles. work to do in here

[20:05:43] <RainbowHacks> wolfyshy, awesome :3
[20:05:46] <HoneyDrops|Half> While I did computer admin/support, and do hobby programming and electronics, my field is actually physics.
[20:05:52] <RainbowHacks> o:
[20:06:15] * RainbowHacks wanted to pursue physics at one point
[20:06:33] <HoneyDrops|Half> Gentoo is oddly enough, the distro I started on.
[20:06:49] <RainbowHacks> but then real life happened and i never went to college and worked a series of shitty jobs to barely survive and then was homeless and then magically got an amazing job and now i just dont have time to go to school
[20:06:57] * RainbowHacks nods
[20:06:59] * HoneyDrops|Half nods.
[20:08:10] * RainbowHacks really needsa to take some time to learn C
[20:08:39] <HoneyDrops|Half> Portage, for all it's flaws, still feels like one of the few sane package managers (and yes, I know the joys of Ports).
[20:08:48] * RainbowHacks really needs to take some time to learn a thousand different things. But the most important right now are C and lockpicking.
[20:09:37] <RainbowHacks> which reminds me, I need to order a set of lockpicks today after work.
[20:09:51] <Lapsus> :D
[20:09:53] <HoneyDrops|Half> I dabble in a bit of C.  C is very easy to pick up, the language is very simple.  The difficulty is you do have to understand how to build any complexity you require.
[20:10:16] <Lapsus> lockpicking is super fun :3
[20:10:47] <RainbowHacks> HoneyDrops|Half, I just haven't had the time to sit down and learn
[20:11:20] <RainbowHacks> which causes me problems because i have a really nasty inferiority complex and i compare myself to my friends who have been computering since the mid 90's, meanwhile I got my first computer in september 2010 >.>
[20:12:05] <Lapsus> RainbowHacks: I dunno, you're on IRC, you must be doing something right?
[20:12:09] <RainbowHacks> Lapsus, x3
[20:12:30] <HoneyDrops|Half> You're on IRC, using FreeBSD, you are doing something right.
[20:12:32] <RainbowHacks> I'm aware that I'm actually pretty damn good for someone that's only had a computer for just under 5 years.
[20:12:46] <RainbowHacks> But, I can't help comparing myself an dfeeling like an idiot
[20:13:35] <RainbowHacks> Granted, now I can remind myself I picked my first lock on my first try with two bended paperclips. (granted, it was a shitty 5 pin lock with all standard pins and i rocked it open instead of SPPing it, but still!)
[20:13:45] <RainbowHacks> and that makes me feel way less stupid c:
[20:15:34] * RainbowHacks used one as a tension bar and the other one in the keyway to fiddle the pins c:

[21:07:24] * Gladiolus cry
[21:07:28] * HoneyDrops|Half spritzes Gladiolus with a spray bottle.
[21:07:29] <Gladiolus> but but i have this, like
[21:07:39] <RainbowHacks> Do you have tits?
[21:07:46] <RainbowHacks> Cuz, I only sleep with people with tits o.o
[21:07:51] <RainbowHacks> Specifically wimminz
[21:07:54] <Gladiolus> okay then no sleeping just sex
[21:07:58] <Gladiolus> >:)
[21:08:01] * Gladiolus hisses at HoneyDrops|Half 
[21:08:03] * RainbowHacks snrk
[21:08:23] <RainbowHacks> but yeah. I'm a lezzybean. That doesn't mean I can't appreciate a compliment for what it is.
[21:08:39] * RainbowHacks also just gets flustered whenpeople call her cute
[21:08:39] * HoneyDrops|Half was just watering Gladiolus, flowers need moisture!
[21:08:41] <RainbowHacks> not used to it
[21:08:43] <RainbowHacks> >.<
[21:09:15] * Gladiolus blink, somebody understands his name!
[21:09:22] * Gladiolus enjoys the watering. :3
[21:09:44] <Gladiolus> well, everyone step back i'm gonna bring this around to it's logical conclusion
[21:09:48] <Gladiolus> RainbowHacks, post tits.
[21:10:00] <RainbowHacks> Gladiolus, I'm at work. No.
[21:10:16] <wolfyshy> RainbowHacks: don't post tits -.-
[21:10:19] <RainbowHacks> Also, no way in hell am I showing them off until I pick up my rainbow swirl barbells >.>
[21:10:23] <Gladiolus> I'm laughing that the reason is "at work" not "that's creepy"
[21:10:34] <wolfyshy> your body is beautiful and should be shared when you want to
[21:10:40] <wolfyshy> not when some creepy dude on the internet wants to -.-
[21:10:48] * wolfyshy smacks Gladiolus and woofs
[21:10:49] <Gladiolus> I was joking silly.
[21:10:53] * wolfyshy then sits next to RainbowHacks ^.^
[21:10:58] <RainbowHacks> wolfyshy, my body is kinda gross and slightly flabby, and I don't care about these things x3
[21:11:17] <Midnight_Tinker> RainbowHacks: its beautiful to someone
[21:11:19] <Gladiolus> Pff I doubt it, I saw that one pic and you looked pretty fine.
[21:11:26] <RainbowHacks> Midnight_Tinker, nope. 
[21:11:31] * RainbowHacks is perpetually single
[21:11:34] <RainbowHacks> foreveralonepone
[21:11:53] * HoneyDrops|Half is a apiarist (IC), obviously she'd know flowers.  (OOCly I am moderately familiar with flowers and other ornamental and sustenance plants)
[21:11:58] <Midnight_Tinker> that may be your attitude towards yourself though, confidence is the sexiest attribute someone can have. Believe you'll achieve something, and you often will
[21:12:23] <Lapsus> HoneyDrops|Half: not an apiarist ooc? :p
[21:12:40] <Lapsus> I want to keep bees but I also want to not get stung >.>
[21:12:41] * Gladiolus hugs HoneyDrops|Half :3
[21:12:43] <RainbowHacks> Midnight_Tinker, oh, I'm confident o.o
[21:12:46] <RainbowHacks> I'm awesome.
[21:13:04] * HoneyDrops|Half hugs Gladiolus and purrs softly.
[21:13:06] <RainbowHacks> and as soon as I start biking to work (which requires purchasing a bike) i'll drop the extra weight and be super sexy again
[21:13:12] <wolfyshy> :3
[21:13:19] * Gladiolus pets HoneyDrops|Half 
[21:13:20] <RainbowHacks> It doesn' change how perpetually single i am xD
[21:13:29] * HoneyDrops|Half mews.
[21:13:32] <Gladiolus> I feel this would be a good and also super-creepy time to mention I like larger mares.
[21:13:33] <Gladiolus> >.>
[21:13:35] <Midnight_Tinker> there ya go. If a creepy skinny guy like me can get engaged, you can get a date, I believe in you!
[21:13:46] <RainbowHacks> I don't have very many meatspace friends, and it's hard for me to meet people
[21:14:03] <RainbowHacks> I'm incredibly outgoing, but I'm also an introvert, one who prefers sitting at home in her hacker cave to going out to clubs
[21:14:13] <RainbowHacks> i think tomorrow will be my first night out in months
[21:14:13] <Moonlightning> The Enrichment Center reminds you, once again, that the Wolfy Companion Cube cannot speak.
[21:14:16] * RainbowHacks is going to a metal show
[21:14:27] <Moonlightning> In the event that the Wolfy Companion Cube /does/ speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.
[21:14:46] <RainbowHacks> Midnight_Tinker, thanks for the vote of confidence <3
[21:15:21] <Midnight_Tinker> RainbowHacks: no problem, I used to think the same thing. Only takes meeting the right person once to get, if not a lifetime of companionship, at least a few months
[21:15:44] <wolfyshy> yeah, and if you don't find the right person, there's always more!
[21:15:48] <wolfyshy> at least until the nuclear holocaust
[21:15:51] <wolfyshy> then there won't be any more
[21:15:55] <wolfyshy> :(
[21:15:58] <Gladiolus> pfff
[21:16:03] <Gladiolus> they'll all just have two heads
[21:16:06] <Midnight_Tinker> there will be a few, and those that are left will be THIRSTY
[21:16:07] <Moonlightning> Well, there will be if at least a male and a female survive
[21:16:14] <locodash11[server]> until everyone comes out of the vaults

[21:16:33] <Midnight_Tinker> theyll be like "man I havent seen unmutated tit in years, lemme git on that gurl
[21:16:36] <wolfyshy> can't you just put a male and female pair in each vault to help repopulate BEFORE they emerge?
[21:16:43] <init3> Naw, she just needs to go on a journey to meet the voice on the radio. 
[21:16:43] <Moonlightning> ^
[21:16:51] <RainbowHacks> Midnight_Tinker, well, the bigger issue is that on the rare occasion I DO get a date
[21:16:52] <Moonlightning> If this is part of Fallout's plot, I am disappoint :|
[21:17:00] <RainbowHacks> they usually don't want to see me again after
[21:17:05] * RainbowHacks is very big on disclosure
[21:17:20] <Moonlightning> Stupid society. :|
[21:17:20] <init3> Ahh
[21:17:24] <Midnight_Tinker> what do you disclose that's so strange?
[21:17:34] * Moonlightning got lucky.
[21:17:54] <RainbowHacks> er....what's under the hood, so to speak >.>
[21:18:01] <Midnight_Tinker> like, mine knows I ERP in pony chats but I didnt tell her first day, I waited til she was in love and stuck with me
[21:18:24] <Midnight_Tinker> RainbowHacks: that can mean a lot of things
[21:18:48] <RainbowHacks> .-.;;
[21:18:51] <locodash11[server]> 2 litre vtech
[21:19:00] <init3> lol
[21:19:21] <RainbowHacks> it meeeeans I'm a trap .w.;
[21:19:23] <init3> I'd end that date. V6 or better pls. 
[21:19:41] <Midnight_Tinker> ohhhhh yeah I can understand where that would cause problems
[21:19:49] <Midnight_Tinker> especially depending on where you live
[21:19:50] <Moonlightning> :?
[21:19:52] <locodash11[server]> aww
[21:20:19] <RainbowHacks> it does. a lot.
[21:20:34] * RainbowHacks is actually bisexual too, though tends to prefer women
[21:20:50] <RainbowHacks> but...guys, girls, they're both disgusted and don't talk to me again ._.
[21:20:52] <Midnight_Tinker> like I live in a fairly liberal area where it isn't a huge deal, but I grew up in an area where it would be nearly impossible
[21:20:54] <init3> Also, wow. You so pretty that's really hard to see. 
[21:21:07] <init3> Well, impossible really
[21:21:12] <RainbowHacks> o//o;
[21:21:38] * Moonlightning is confus.
[21:21:48] <Lapsus> I've had people like, back away from me in fear upon learning I liked dudes too, I can't imagine the silly reactions a trans person gets.
[21:22:27] <RainbowHacks> Lapsus, it's.....it's not fun.
[21:22:56] * Moonlightning offers RainbowHacks hugs? :(
[21:23:10] * RainbowHacks hugs Moonlightning 
[21:23:15] <Lapsus> On the other hand, I bet you have a bunch of really awful first date stories :v
[21:23:17] <RainbowHacks> did NOT expect to tell you poeple this >.<
[21:23:49] * RainbowHacks flops down
[21:24:13] <RainbowHacks> Lapsus, I actually don't, but only because I never go on dates anymore
[21:24:16] <Moonlightning> This net is possibly one of the best places to be open.
[21:24:38] <Moonlightning> Yay tolerance~
[21:24:52] * RainbowHacks has noticed
[21:24:53] <RainbowHacks> <3
[21:24:54] <Lapsus> heh, imagine having told that to 96 random people in real life instead of on irc. That would be an adventure >.>
[21:24:59] <init3> Also I know for a fact you aren't alone in that here. Not going to call anyone out though. 
[21:25:08] * RainbowHacks nods
[21:25:12] * wolfyshy hugs RainbowHacks
[21:25:20] <wolfyshy> you're you, that's what is important <3
[21:25:26] <RainbowHacks> Not your place to. If someone wants to out themselves to me, that's their decision *nod*
[21:25:32] * RainbowHacks hugs wolfyshy back <3
[21:25:33] <init3> Aye
[21:26:06] <RainbowHacks> Y'all are awesome.
[21:26:11] <RainbowHacks> Thank you n.n

[21:36:52] <Rylee> unfortunately society = shit
[21:37:17] <RainbowHacks> Rylee, I never said I was ashamed
[21:37:36] <Rylee> it was intended to be encouragement 
[21:38:08] <Gigawork> Hey, more trans people to know, cool1 <3
[21:38:18] <RainbowHacks> just that it's....hard sometimes. that's all.
[21:38:22] <Rylee> yes
[21:38:25] * RainbowHacks nods
[21:38:27] <Rylee> it is, indeed, hard
[21:38:39] <RainbowHacks> Am I to assume that you're trans as well? o.o
[21:38:45] <wolfyshy> society is slowly getting a bit better
[21:38:48] <Rylee> sure
[21:39:03] <wolfyshy> and I think in time, trans people will have more acceptance
[21:39:07] <Rylee> i'm not really closeted, but also not really out
[21:39:12] * RainbowHacks nods
[21:39:16] <RainbowHacks> I'm kind of the same way
[21:39:33] <RainbowHacks> I kinda transitioned between jobs, and don't mention it unless it's relevant to a conversation or something
[21:39:47] <Rylee> wolfyshy: that doesn't make the current state acceptable (it's not, and shit)
[21:40:00] <Rylee> i'm hoping to have time to get into more of an activist role when I move
[21:40:04] <Rylee> RainbowHacks: oh, wonderful
[21:40:23] <wolfyshy> you're moving?
[21:41:10] <Rylee> wolfyshy: yes, hopefully — I am interviewing with a company in the SFBA, which will hopefully be better than Dallas, TX
[21:41:33] <wolfyshy> oh, fun
[21:41:38] <Rylee> yes
[21:41:47] <wolfyshy> good luck :3

[21:51:32] <Rylee> wonderful
[21:51:42] <Rylee> i'm in no danger of the draft then!
[21:51:46] <Midnight_Tinker> being "borderline bipolar" in this environment is a discharge

[23:26:44] <Gigawork> Okay, question could someone maybe help me with this. Ran this command  go get github.com/rakyll/drive, saying the go path does not exist. I am trying to get the "drive" cli program to sync my google drive stuff
[23:26:58] <Gigawork> following these instructions  http://www.howtogeek.com/196635/an-official-google-drive-for-linux-is-here-sort-of-maybe-this-is-all-well-ever-get/

[23:39:07] <Rylee> lol.
[23:39:12] <Gigawork> ?
[23:39:16] <Rylee> Gigawork: do you have a $GOPATH?
[23:39:32] <Gigawork> does it need the $ symbol to work?
[23:40:26] <Rylee> err
[23:40:38] <Rylee> ` $ echo $GOPATH`
[23:41:14] <init3> $ means variable. 
[23:41:18] <Gigawork> returned a blank line
[23:42:49] <Rylee> okay
[23:43:02] <Rylee> do the things under this heading: https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH
[23:43:02] <PinkiePieBot> [ How to Write Go Code - The Go Programming Language ]
[23:43:03] <Gigawork> the project was merged to this guy  https://github.com/odeke-em/drive#installation and I am following what he says but nothing
[23:43:04] <PinkiePieBot> [ odeke-em/drive · GitHub ]
[23:43:28] <Rylee> and add the lines beginning with `export` to your bashrc or profile or zshrc or whatever you use
[23:44:15] <Gigawork> so wait, I need to mkdir and stuff first?
[23:47:35] <Rylee> yeah, `go get` requires you do have a go environment set up
[23:58:41] <Gigawork> well I did all of it, and ran the go get -u github/usr/drive command, it is doing something now
[23:59:14] <Rylee> should be cloning the code and building it
