[03:35:18] <Starthunder> Okay‚Ä¶how do?
[03:35:40] <Starthunder> My backup box has no FDE, so I'm trying to avoid putting personally-identifiable things on there
[03:36:08] <Starthunder> My initial plan was to tarball the dir, encrypt+sign it to myself, and back that up, but ^ breaks that
[03:36:35] <Starthunder> I guess I could just encrypt it symmetrically?
[03:36:59] <Starthunder> Does decrypting a symmetrically-encrypted message always imply verifying it?
[03:37:04] *** Joins: LegionRed (LegionRed@The.DragonHorse.DraconisEquus)
[03:39:44] <Phase> Starthunder, technically no
[03:40:17] <Phase> Starthunder, if you had some kind of checksum alongside the message then i'd trust it decrypted correctly
[03:40:47] <Starthunder> Phase: what, inside the encryption?
[03:40:51] <Phase> yes
[03:41:16] <Starthunder> ‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶then you couldn't trust the hash to be correct, could you? 6_9
[03:41:51] <Phase> Starthunder, ciphertext = message + hash(message)
[03:42:15] <Phase> plaintext, hash = decryppt(ciphertext); if hash(plaintext) != hash: error
[03:42:48] <Starthunder> But that's just checking it against‚Ä¶itself. If an attacker could craft ciphertext that decrypts fine, they could craft‚Äî
[03:42:51] <Starthunder> ‚Ä¶oh.
[03:42:58] <Phase> Starthunder, with symetric ciphers you can decrypt/encrypt any message with any key
[03:43:28] <Phase> you need some external assurance that the message is sane
[03:44:15] <Phase> Starthunder, and yes, an attacker would need to encrypt with your key to produce such ciphertext :P
[03:44:58] <Starthunder> Does it /have/ to be a hash of the thing? If I symmetrically encrypted a tarball, couldn't I run `tar -f` on the result of decrypting, and use a visual sanity check on `tar -f` as verification?
[03:45:17] <Phase> yes
[03:45:21] <Starthunder> Or even a validity check on the tarball?
[03:45:29] * Phase just thinks the hash is easier
[03:45:34] <Phase> and it works on any message
[03:45:45] <Starthunder> Well, how do I get `tar` to hash the tarball and prepend|append the hash? :p
[03:46:09] <Starthunder> If it decrypts to a valid tarball, though, whoever encrypted it must've had the key, yeah? 'd be unfeasable to get around that?
[03:46:43] <Starthunder> I could see someone getting lucky with valid `tar` /headers/, but the rest of it would just be garbage.
[03:46:54] <Phase> tar files > ball.tar; echo "$(shasum ball.tar):$(uuencode ball.tar)" | gzip | encrypt > encrypted_tar
[03:47:20] <Phase> then you decrypt, ungzip, verify the hash
[03:47:31] <Phase> Starthunder, the hash also gives you a garuentee the message hasn't been corrupted
[03:48:04] * Starthunder nodnods.
[03:48:19] <Starthunder> Okay. What about‚Ä¶filesystems? Apple's sparsebundle thing, in particular.
[03:48:46] <Phase> Starthunder, the way this is normally done is you encrypt a file with a random key, encrypt file key + file hash + other metadata with someones public key, a-la pgp
[03:48:47] <Starthunder> I've been using kind of the same valid-structure check‚Ä¶if the filesystem isn't completely unrecognizable, whoever created the encrypted blobs must've had the key.
[03:49:21] <Phase> you probably want public key signing instead of symetric encryption
[03:49:22] <Starthunder> Phase: I'm probably just gonna use a password, though, 'cos like I said, I don't want personally-identifiable stuff in it
[03:49:49] <Phase> then you have a public key you can validate files against, without exposing your private key, at least for the validation step
[03:49:58] <Phase> Starthunder, in the backup?
[03:50:19] <Starthunder> Right.
[03:50:24] <Phase> all they can really determine from that is 1: you have a backup, 2: it's about n bytes in size
[03:50:48] <Starthunder> And I'd rather not fumble around with random keys
[03:50:55] <Phase> purely symetric ciphers potentially expose other information, depending on the implementation
[03:50:59] * Phase would just use pgp
[03:51:06] <Phase> it's already set up to do all this
[03:51:29] *** GigaTown is now known as Gigabit
[03:51:43] <Starthunder> deriving a key from a password or wrapping a random key with a password and stashing it along with the tarball (but /automatically/) seems more desirable to me
[03:52:07] <Phase> Starthunder, and re: hashes, an attacker could damage your file in some critical place, and you would have no method of detecting it without a has
[03:52:08] <Starthunder> I mean‚Ä¶I was about to use `gpg --symmetric`, then I decided I'd better check that decryption implies verification, hence this thread. :P
[03:52:10] <Phase> hash'
[03:52:48] <Phase> Starthunder, --symmetric probably doesn't, i'm not terribly familiar with gpg
[03:52:52] <Starthunder> I'm not really concerning myself with damage, as long as it can't be used forge stuff or anything
[03:53:24] <Phase> validation implies integrity, you can't really have the former and not the latter

[03:57:45] <Phase> well without full disk encryption, the data is still on your drive
[03:58:02] <Phase> and, surprisingly, it's not as simple as hitting it with a hammer, or wiping a magnet over the platters
[03:58:06] <Starthunder> tarball, hash, store the hash as a file next to the tarball, tarball /that/, encrypt with password-derived key?
[04:00:06] <Colgate> `shred` is a good first place, if you want to be more certain, wipe the whole disk, if you want to be 99.999% certain, destroy the disk

[05:16:51] <JustAberrant> also, from wiki:
[05:16:53] <JustAberrant> 501(c)(12) ó Benevolent Life Insurance Associations, Mutual Ditch or Irrigation Companies, Mutual or Cooperative Telephone Companies, etc.
[05:16:57] <JustAberrant> that's an.. odd assortment
[05:17:08] <Starthunder> > insurance
[05:17:11] <Starthunder> > benevolent
[05:17:14] <Starthunder> HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[05:17:19] <Starthunder> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[05:17:20] <Starthunder> HAHAHAHAHA
[05:17:46] <JustAberrant> I wouldn't call insurance companies malevolent
[05:17:56] <Colgate> Starthunder: that's firefox being dumb
[05:18:00] <JustAberrant> I mean, they don't seek to cause additional evil
[05:18:08] <Colgate> because to trust a root cert, you need a local copy of it anyways
[05:18:17] <JustAberrant> they just profit from the bad that's already there
[05:18:22] <Starthunder> JustAberrant: postfix-style. Multiple daemons and client programs working together in true adherene to the Unix philosophy
[05:18:27] <JustAberrant> and don't go out of their way to do any favours
[05:18:54] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: never heard that refered to as postfix style.. but fair enough
[05:18:58] <JustAberrant> and no, I can't imagine so
[05:19:06] <JustAberrant> because most of the work of a web browser is rendering
[05:19:22] <JustAberrant> and animation/interactive content
[05:19:30] <JustAberrant> and having that seperate from the client would be silly ;p
[05:20:19] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: surf, luakit, uzbl are probably as close as you can get to that?
[05:20:43] <Starthunder> JustAberrant: for-profit entities are basically just self-improving AIs.
[05:20:44] <HoneyDrops> There is no "neat" way to split up a lot of what a browser does.

[22:20:49] <Colgate> did they fork Linux? :P
[22:21:06] <Colgate> maybe they could call it Minux! wait, that's already taken :P
[22:21:20] <nscoots> Minuette has her own kernel?
[22:21:45] <Colgate> kind of surprised they went with linux though over bsd, I thought bsd had a better networking stack
[22:22:13] <Colgate> that's just what I've heard, no idea on the truth of that statement :P

[22:56:48] <Starthunder> Do sales people generally know more in tech contexts than support people?
[22:57:01] <Compu> Colgate: no i actually requested tech support from the automated system, not sales
[22:57:40] <Colgate> Starthunder: they don't have to when they just read from a specs sheet!
[22:58:04] <Compu> but i asked questions that dont come on a specs sheet
[22:58:26] <Compu> like what about a web browser interface
[22:58:51] <Colgate> I mean the internal spec sheet, which probably has more detail than the one they posted
[22:59:10] <Colgate> and it has a web browser interface iirc
[22:59:24] <Compu> Colgate: it does?
[22:59:26] <Colgate> having a cloud only config would be idiotic
[22:59:29] <Starthunder> SSH interface > HTTP interface
[22:59:33] <Compu> they said it doesnt
[22:59:37] <Starthunder> SSH interface best interface
[22:59:45] <Compu> they said that it can only be accessed via the app for now
[22:59:48] <Starthunder> My netbox doesn't run a webserver.
[22:59:51] <Colgate> so... how do you configure it if you can't access the internet?
[22:59:56] <Colgate> you're just sol?
[22:59:59] <Compu> Colgate: the app
[23:00:05] <Colgate> what if you don't have the app?
[23:00:15] <Compu> get on mobile data and get the app
[23:00:23] <Colgate> no data plan
[23:00:23] <Starthunder> > mobile data
[23:00:28] <Starthunder> what if you don't h‚Äîyeah
[23:00:38] <Compu> and if u dont have internet what r u getting this router for?
[23:00:42] <JustAberrant> that seems a bit rediculous
[23:00:43] <Colgate> to route packets?
[23:00:50] <Colgate> you know, the thing routers do
[23:01:00] <Starthunder> Also to switch frames
[23:01:11] <Starthunder> And probably to manage a Wi-Fi network
[23:01:13] <Colgate> sure, I just want to copy some data over from my ddesktop to my tablet
[23:01:16] <JustAberrant> hehe, in fairness though, this us a consumer routet
[23:01:18] <Colgate> while my internet is down
[23:01:20] <Compu> Colgate: its made for internet access, it doesnt even have a real ethernet switch built in, just 1 ethernet port u can connect a switch to
[23:01:42] <Compu> yeah it is a consumer router
[23:01:45] <Colgate> /shrug, sounds like a product I want to avoid
[23:01:49] <Starthunder> Oooooh, I dunno about that
[23:01:50] <Soarin> why do I always get the devices that fucking fail
[23:01:57] <JustAberrant> still seems silly though.. definently avoiding
[23:02:03] <Starthunder> eth1 came in handy a lot setting up Silverspeed
[23:02:08] <Compu> Starthunder: it has 2 ethernet ports but the other is for the internet connection
[23:02:10] <Soarin> 5 port switch, 2 ports died at the same time
[23:02:10] <Starthunder> I fucked her the Wi-Fi so many times
[23:02:16] <Starthunder> Oh, okay.
[23:02:28] <Colgate> wait what?
[23:02:29] <Compu> it also has a USB 3.0 port
[23:02:33] <Starthunder> Soarin: the Regalia are after you :(
[23:02:42] <Colgate> "Starthunder | I fucked her the Wi-Fi so many times"
[23:02:49] <Starthunder> Soarin: next, windows will start shattering as you walk by :(
[23:02:49] <Compu> and a speaker thats apparently for easily connecting with the app
[23:02:50] <Colgate> o.O
[23:02:52] <Soarin> And I think a 3rd port is dying to
[23:02:56] <JustAberrant> also I actually like routerboard/routeros :(
[23:02:58] <Starthunder> fucked up *
[23:03:05] <Compu> which by the way the app works of bluetooth as well as wifi

[23:03:11] <Colgate> oh sweet, I always wanted to do tcp over sound
[23:03:13] <Colgate> that sounds awesome

[23:03:33] * Starthunder slaps Colgate with a large trout
[23:03:38] <Compu> Colgate: the router has built in bluetooth 4.0
[23:03:47] <Starthunder> Compu: speeeeec sheeeeet
[23:03:56] <Colgate> there is one posted online
[23:04:04] <Colgate> it is 300$ for the router iirc?
[23:04:09] <Compu> which supposedly can also be used for internet connection but i have no idea why someone would do that
[23:04:11] *** Quits: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-iqmf0q.priv.bahnhof.se) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:04:13] <Colgate> which means hardly any of the target audience will wanat to buy it
[23:04:27] <Starthunder> Colgate: for $400, I got a proper box and a Wi-Fi card
[23:04:39] <Starthunder> /and/ a 4TB disk
[23:04:56] <Colgate> Starthunder: the main selling point of this thing, imo, is the 11 antennas it has in it
[23:05:06] <JustAberrant> yeah I don't get that either.. for that money you can buy a proper router
[23:05:10] <Compu> the entire point of the router is to provide the best possible wifi experience using tons upon tons of antennas and another antenna for scanning the airwaves for interference so it can automatically adapt to it
[23:05:12] <Starthunder> Eleven antennae. Cool.
[23:05:23] <Starthunder> I'll just sit over here with my Linux netbox.
[23:05:33] <Colgate> however, it has some really bad design flaws
[23:05:37] <JustAberrant> half of them are probably just plastic :D
[23:05:46] <Colgate> such as its QoS
[23:05:53] <Compu> Colgate: it is the first rendition, theres bound to be flaws
[23:05:55] <Colgate> it prioritizes bulk data transfers like netflix
[23:06:00] <Colgate> which is a wtf moment
[23:06:09] <Colgate> that's the stuff you DON'T want to prioritize
[23:06:10] <Compu> it IS a consumer router
[23:06:24] <Compu> Colgate: u dont know the average consumer then
[23:06:26] <Colgate> you want to prioritize normal browsing which is much lower bandwidth
[23:06:53] <Colgate> you don't prioritize bulk data, otherwise everything suffers
[23:06:59] <Compu> also apparently the router can do port forwarding and such so thats good
[23:07:05] <Starthunder> > port forwarding
[23:07:16] <Starthunder> I can do that. It's called iptables.
[23:07:29] <Colgate> Starthunder: my bad, it is 200$ not 300$
[23:07:33] <Compu> Starthunder: just because u dont want it to doesnt mean IPv4 and NAT dont still exist everywhere
[23:07:42] <Starthunder> If you have a netbox and it can't do port forwarding, it's bad. :P
[23:07:54] <Starthunder> You need port forwarding to do NAT.

[23:07:59] <PinkiePieBot> [ OnHub ‚Äì Google ]
[23:08:07] <Compu> Starthunder: most consumers dont ever do manual port forwarding
[23:08:11] <Compu> thats why i asked
[23:08:16] <Colgate> Starthunder: check link for the official spec sheet
[23:08:23] <Starthunder> Compu: it's not uncommon. Think game servers.
[23:08:36] <Compu> game servers arent run by most consumers
[23:08:45] <Starthunder> But it's a consumer-level thing to do.
[23:08:46] <HoneyDrops> I have zero interest in Google's router-spy, but most consumer routers are almost criminally terrible, it's not hard to be better than that.
[23:08:47] <Compu> think the facebook browsers and netflix watchers of the world
[23:08:56] * Starthunder remembers an old netbox that had a list of games on the port-forwarding page‚Ä¶
[23:09:07] <Starthunder> ohai, HoneyDrops :3
[23:09:18] <Colgate> Starthunder: you wouldn't want it anyways, it doesn't support 802.1x

[23:09:26] <Compu> date*

[23:09:43] <Starthunder> Compu: not with a proper release cycle >.>
[23:09:56] <Colgate> Compu: like I said, it doesn't support 802.1x
[23:10:05] <Starthunder> Colgate: ‚Ä¶is the x there data or placeholder?
[23:10:10] <Colgate> that's a standard
[23:10:15] <HoneyDrops> A table of ports for games?  Not really hard to do, it would just be a table you could update off a server?
[23:10:27] <Colgate> Starthunder: radius uses 802.1x, if you were wondering
[23:10:36] <Starthunder> Colgate: right, but is it the x like the n in 802.11n?
[23:10:47] <Starthunder> Is that like 802/1/* or 802/1/x?
[23:10:48] <Compu> HoneyDrops: techs dont like theyre routers automatically updating things from servers last time i checked
[23:10:50] <Colgate> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.1x
[23:10:51] <PinkiePieBot> [ IEEE 802.1X - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[23:10:56] <Colgate> that's just the name!
[23:10:57] <HoneyDrops> For bonus points do a gameports.local for the user to add things manually and keep them save from clobbering.
[23:11:25] <Starthunder> > gameports.local
[23:11:29] <HoneyDrops> Compu: I never said automatic.  think apt-get update
[23:11:33] <Starthunder> You're thinking in filesystems‚Ä¶consumer netboxes don't work in filesystems.
[23:11:37] <Starthunder> They work in webpages.
[23:12:02] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: which is why they are all universally, absolute garbage.

[23:12:17] <Colgate> indeed, I'm glad I have my routeros box
[23:12:31] <Colgate> I wish it wasn't closed source... but besides that it is lovely
[23:12:32] <HoneyDrops> There is no way to clone settings between devices though a webpage.

[23:14:08] <Compu> they understand "i click on this link and it goes to this thing"
[23:14:08] <HoneyDrops> Well yes, ideally we'd have some sort of git/hg system so you can roll back setting to any point, or tag specific setups to reload whenever you want.
[23:14:21] <HoneyDrops> Compu: then they can learn.
[23:14:41] <Compu> HoneyDrops: people dont want to pay for something they have to learn, they hate learning
[23:15:10] <Compu> and since the point of making a product is to get people to buy it its gonna have to be something intuitive
[23:15:11] <HoneyDrops> I reject the notion that the average person /can't/ comprehend technology.    They don't /want/ to, but that will only become increasingly painful for them.
[23:15:29] <Compu> HoneyDrops: explain the iphone generation then
[23:15:31] <HoneyDrops> Coddling them is doing no favors.
[23:15:46] <Compu> the excuse everyone uses for getting an iphone is that its easier
[23:15:49] <Starthunder> Okay, okay, stop.
[23:15:51] <MistVeil> I agree with Honey. While making things easy to use is a huge positioning advantage
[23:16:01] <Compu> but meh

[23:17:54] <Compu> well not even that
[23:17:57] <Compu> its a profession
[23:18:01] <Compu> ur still a human tho
[23:18:08] <Compu> just a human with that profession

[23:19:29] <Compu> MistVeil: thats fictional for now, sorry
[23:19:41] <HoneyDrops> The problem is without understanding, you will never have a competent user.  Security /requires/ a comprehension of what is actually going on.  It's not limited to computers:  We have created (and for the sake of profit perpetuated and promoted) a situation where the vast majority don't understand the tools their lives are built around.  This is a very explosive mixture of ignorance and
[23:19:43] <HoneyDrops> power.  I don't blame them for not knowing: I blame all of us for not teaching them the importance of knowing.
[23:20:05] <Compu> we dont arent advanced enough in the fields of genetics or robotics to make changelings or any such beings
[23:20:06] <MistVeil> I prefer the approach "every human has the power to be a jerk, and also the power to not be"
[23:20:33] <Compu> HoneyDrops: a competent user is just someone who is incompetent elsewhere
[23:21:08] <Compu> MistVeil: ridiculous, every human IS a jerk and the ones that dont act like it r just surpressing their natural states
[23:22:49] <Compu> ded?
[23:22:50] <MistVeil> I like not being part of that trend, at least more than my 50% isn't! I think...
[23:22:52] <Starthunder> Happy to be suppressing my natural state, then.
[23:24:15] <Compu> anyways i will jump at the first chance i get to be a non human
[23:24:22] <Compu> be it robotics or genetics
[23:24:49] <Compu> or something else i cant even concieve at the moment
[23:24:52] <MistVeil> The latter, the first would make you a 'human' creation :p
[23:25:01] <MistVeil> So, still a jerk
[23:25:07] <MistVeil> Technically
[23:25:27] <Compu> bah semantics
[23:25:33] <MistVeil> Genetics work, but... I think you could call that evolution?
[23:25:40] <Compu> it would make me less human which is always a good thing
[23:25:55] <Starthunder> MistVeil: no don't do that
[23:26:12] <Starthunder> Evolution is the gradual process, over millions of years, guided by natural selection
[23:26:15] <Compu> obviously i can never be completely non human but the less human i am the better
[23:26:34] <Compu> Starthunder: artificial evolution
