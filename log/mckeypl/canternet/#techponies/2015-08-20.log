[00:56:48] <Moonlightning> Unrelatedly. I have this external disk here which connects via USB but also needs a power source
[00:57:20] <sleumas2000> Moonlightning not uncommon
[00:57:26] <Moonlightning> There's no power rating printed on it anywhere and I don't have any paper documentation for it.
[00:57:45] <Moonlightning> There's a model number, but I can't find it with Google or on the manufacturer's site.
[00:57:52] <JustAberrant> you could always meter the output from the power brick
[00:58:03] <Moonlightning> How do I figure out /which/ power brick it is, though?
[00:58:27] <JustAberrant> hah, well if you've lost track of that, you're basically screwed ;p
[00:58:41] * JustAberrant seriously labels most of his power bricks
[00:58:50] <Moonlightning> D: .
[00:59:11] <Moonlightning> Is there not some kind of tolerance for…
[00:59:21] <Moonlightning> Man, I don't even know much about electrical stuff.
[00:59:35] <JustAberrant> well, amperage doesn't matter... as long as your brick has at least the capacity needed it's fine
[00:59:40] <JustAberrant> voltage and polarity do though usually
[00:59:41] <Moonlightning> What kinda Bad Things™ will happen if I plug in the wrong one?
[00:59:51] <Moonlightning> …polarity?
[01:00:06] <JustAberrant> pluses and minuses
[01:00:19] <JustAberrant> best case it won't work, worst case it'll catch fire
[01:00:22] <Moonlightning> Oh. It's one of those circular connectors.
[01:00:25] <Moonlightning> ._.
[01:00:38] <JustAberrant> likely case, it'll burn something out/blow an internal fuse and kill it but not set your house on fire
[01:00:41] <Moonlightning> That's one of the very unlikely worstcases, right?
[01:00:47] <Moonlightning> Yeah :P
[01:01:11] <JustAberrant> the circle plugs (barrel plugs) usually have two conductors
[01:01:15] <JustAberrant> (sometimes more)
[01:01:27] <JustAberrant> and there's no real standard on polarity
[01:01:38] <HoneyDrops|Half> Would be easy to test though
[01:01:41] <Moonlightning> oooh, so I could get it backwards.
[01:01:53] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops|Half: if you have the adapter, yes ;p
[01:02:01] <HoneyDrops|Half> Just do a continuity check between the pin and the USB shield?
[01:02:08] <JustAberrant> oh
[01:02:12] <JustAberrant> for polarity.. yeah
[01:02:15] <HoneyDrops|Half> Then the outer sleeve of the dc port and the USB shield.
[01:02:15] <JustAberrant> assuming they are connected
[01:02:24] <JustAberrant> (which they probably are.. )
[01:02:32] <Moonlightning> That must be what the symbols that go - ---•)--- + mean
[01:02:36] <HoneyDrops|Half> Yes
[01:02:51] <HoneyDrops|Half> ground is the pin, +V is the sleeve
[01:03:04] <JustAberrant> hehe, if that's marked on the thing voltage should be as well
[01:03:12] <HoneyDrops|Half> ( in that diagram )
[01:03:13] <Moonlightning> You would think!
[01:03:30] <HoneyDrops|Half> I would guess 5V, try that and see if it works?
[01:03:32] <Moonlightning> …oh, no, that's not actually on the drive.
[01:03:40] <Moonlightning> I saw it somewhere else though
[01:03:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> No harm if you are too low, but right polarity.
[01:03:55] <JustAberrant> you really couldn't find anything googling the part number/etc?
[01:03:56] <Moonlightning> The drive just has the little thing with a long horizontal dash and three shorter dashes on top of it.
[01:04:02] <Moonlightning> Which is the DC symbol, right?
[01:04:10] <JustAberrant> yes
[01:04:11] <HoneyDrops|Half> Yeah, that just means DC power

[07:02:23] <Lapsus> AppleDash: You could get a makerfarm kit like me, it's well designed and easy to build
[07:02:45] <Lapsus> There's also folgertech, who are incredibly inexpensive, though I don't know what their docs are like
[07:03:05] <AppleDash> I'm not sure if I trust "incredibly inexpensive" :P
[07:04:36] <AppleDash> What kit did you get Lapsus?
[07:06:47] <Lapsus> I purchased http://www.makerfarm.com/index.php/3d-printer-kits/prusa-10-i3v-kit-v-slot-extrusion.html
[07:06:51] <PinkiePieBot> [ Prusa 10" i3v Kit (V-Slot Extrusion) - 3D Printer Kits ]
[07:07:07] <Lapsus> There's also an 8" and a 12" version for a little less, and a little more.
[07:07:43] <Lapsus> He's also apparently released a less expensive version that's made almost entirely from aluminum extrusion

[07:08:41] <AppleDash> Neat*
[07:10:25] <AppleDash> I kinda want a 3d printer now
[07:10:38] <AppleDash> I'm just flipping through the build guide, what is this, IKEA?
[07:10:47] <AppleDash> Gather the following parts 1 x Partially Assembled Printer 
[07:10:50] <AppleDash> brilliant
[07:11:25] <Moonlightning> Wot! >XD
[07:11:50] <Moonlightning> 3D Printer: Assembly instructions
[07:11:53] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[07:12:02] <Moonlightning> 1. Read instructions carefully before beginning
[07:12:18] <Moonlightning> 2. Acquire the following parts: 1* fully-assembled 3D printer
[07:12:30] <Moonlightning> 3. There is no step three you dumbass
[07:14:03] <AppleDash> lol
[07:14:06] <AppleDash> yes :P

[07:16:22] <Lapsus> lol
[07:17:08] <Lapsus> The instructions are actually pretty excellent for the makerfarm kits, it's all broken down into subassemblies, so if you've got a couple people around, you can parallelize the work
[07:19:12] <AppleDash> Neat
[07:19:15] * AppleDash invites Lapsus?
[07:19:29] <Lapsus> oh hell yeah, I'm in
[07:19:33] <Lapsus> I love building shit
[07:19:40] <AppleDash> :D
[07:20:15] <Lapsus> although I'd probably just watch you and tell you what to watch out for, considering how much more comfortable I am with the printer having built like 90% of it
[07:20:29] <Lapsus> lol
[07:21:06] <AppleDash> lol
[07:26:27] <Lapsus> also also we could do silly shit that's really useful, like printing upgrades and stuff
[07:26:33] <Lapsus> also spare parts
[07:31:37] <AppleDash> yeah, I find that silly :P
[07:32:49] <Lapsus> It sounds silly but it's super useful
[07:34:17] <Lapsus> also most of the time when I print an upgrade, after attaching it, there's an immedately noticeable increase in quality
[07:34:49] <Moonlightning> bootstrapping 3D printer? o3o
[07:35:08] <AppleDash> lol

[07:37:57] <Lapsus> technically most of the printer kits out there qualify as "repstraps", what with having almost nothing printed on them, but it's not like it's hard or impossible to improve on them anyways
[07:39:05] <Lapsus> All but one of the parts I've printed so far have yielded noticeable improvement, and the one that hasn't so far is well on its way as I tune for it

[16:21:56] <Starthunder> Wat.
[16:22:10] <Starthunder> No way.
[16:22:27] <Starthunder> You mean dotfiles?
[16:34:33] <Seoson> Yeah. If you use e.g. "cp -R * ../somedir" it will skip "dotfiles" in the root directory (not in the subs). I know this bug but keep forgetting it. There is a regexp workaround...
[16:34:45] <Starthunder> Oh, yeah.
[16:34:49] <Starthunder> That's not `cp`; that's your shell.
[16:35:19] <Starthunder> IIRC, dash, bash, and zsh all have an option to include dotfiles even when the glob pattern doesn't start with a dot.
[16:39:48] <Obaskyr> Anyone here do watercooling?
[16:40:18] <Starthunder> …okay, not dash, but it's `dotglob` in bash and zsh

[16:47:22] *** Joins: Crimson_Tail (ZRift@Pony-mfh7oq.md.comcast.net)
[16:47:38] <Seoson> Using bash anyway ^^ I guess instead of the regexp or messing with my bash profile I could also use a single dot instead the asterix wich should work as well. Doesn't help however if my brain decides not to remember it :D
[16:48:24] <Starthunder> Well, `.*` will match all files and directories beginning with a dot, but that also includes `..`, so
[16:49:27] <Seoson> no simply cp -R . ../somedir
[16:50:59] <Starthunder> That's not the same as `cp -R * ../somedir`
[16:51:03] <Starthunder> and not just because of the file selection
[16:51:07] <Starthunder> …wait…
[16:51:22] <Starthunder> Oh, no, it is, huh o.o
[16:51:28] <Starthunder> . -> ../somedir/.
[16:51:41] <Starthunder> Neat trick. I hadn't ever realized that. o.o
[16:53:25] <Obaskyr> That'll be no then
[16:54:06] <Seoson> Obaskyr: I had a water cooling setup a few years ago
[16:54:28] <Obaskyr> had?
[16:54:54] <Seoson> My current desktop no longer runs on water cooling.
[16:55:07] <Seoson> Simple air cooling now
[16:55:07] <Obaskyr> How come you switched?
[16:56:01] <Seoson> I needed to move my pc often, I switched a few parts and decided not to buy a new CPU block and go for an air cooler instead.
[16:56:45] <Seoson> In my current situation this is more reliable and convenient
[16:57:52] <Obaskyr> Fair enough, I'm running on air now as well, but I want to move to something a lttle more custom.
