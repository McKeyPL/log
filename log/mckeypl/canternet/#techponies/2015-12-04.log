[04:03:59] <Gladiolus> yeah actually how would i do a bouncer
[04:04:06] <Gladiolus> I legit have 0 idea but it seems like a good idea
[04:04:17] <mniip> Gladiolus, do you even know what a bouncer is?
[04:04:28] <Gladiolus> afaik it's an always-on irc connection that your client connects to
[04:04:36] <mniip> kinda
[04:04:38] <Gladiolus> a sorta middle man so when you disconnect it's invisible to the irc server itself
[04:04:57] <mniip> an irc proxy that pretends you're there when you're actually not
[04:05:17] <Gladiolus> yus'
[04:05:23] <mniip> so yeah, a znc needs to be hosted on a server with a public IP and a stable connection
[04:05:41] <mniip> if you have one of those you could put it there, otherwise maybe ask someone to host it for you
[04:06:13] <Gladiolus> The entire problem is that my connection is unstable lol. Oddly only when connecting securely
[04:06:21] <Gladiolus> IT only started when I started using TLS
[04:06:39] <mniip> keep in mind that the person hosting your bouncer theoretically can see all of your traffic
[04:06:56] <mniip> it gets harder if you use SSL on both ends but not impossible
[04:24:49] <JustAberrant> znc is life :)

[06:47:17] <init3> netstat to see if anything else is trying to use 25 Phase?
[06:47:33] <Phase> init3, nothing else was, it's complaining that it conflicts with itself
[06:47:40] <init3> lel
[06:47:54] <init3> Not sure what to tell you
[06:53:49] <Gigabit> Anyone good at explaining things? Want to make sure I understand exactly how credit cards work. It has been many years since it was taught in school, and I vowed to never get one but my bank said if I can it would be a good idea for me, so I can get my credit back on track. Anyways, say I have a card with a 500 limit. and 22% apr.  I buy a tv for 225. The APR tacks on the 225 correct? So then my balance would be roughly 270 the first month. Now.. if I pay 
[06:53:49] <Gigabit> 100 the first month.. the total goes down to 170, now does the intrest then go from the 170 amount or still the 225?
[06:55:07] <Colgate> you only pay the APR if you don't pay the credit card bill in full
[06:55:40] <ShivalWolf> that all depends on the type of card. ge money cards charge interest on the total nomatter what you have paid
[06:56:18] <Colgate> if you don't pay the bill in full(but more than the minimum), you get charged interest at whatever your APR is on the remaining balance, that 22% is yearly, so it would be some fraction ~22%/12 of the balance
[06:57:31] <Colgate> ShivalWolf: I've never seen a credit card(in the US) that charged the APR on every purchase, if they did, nobody would use that card because it would be a huge scam
[06:57:38] <Gigabit> but does the interest accrue on the total charged amount or the remaning balance?
[06:57:45] <Colgate> paying an every 20% on every purchase would be a joke
[06:57:50] <Colgate> extra*
[06:58:03] <Colgate> Gigabit: always the remaining balance
[06:58:35] <ShivalWolf>  GE money cards are really dodgy and often used by those places thst do like 24 months interest free on a couch but its still a credit czrd
[06:58:58] <Gigabit> Alright, so I did understand it right before. God damn my dad is getting senile..he was telling me on the original purchase amount
[06:59:06] <ShivalWolf> they are the definition of scam cards
[06:59:14] <ShivalWolf> people are tricked into getting them
[07:00:08] <Gigabit> well I was thinking of trying to get the visa amazon.com card, and just do a 500 limit.
[07:00:26] <ShivalWolf> visa are rather standard conditions.
[07:00:32] <ShivalWolf> so yeah it will be balance
[07:00:42] <ShivalWolf> check how often your charged interest
[07:00:47] <ShivalWolf> most are monthly
[07:00:56] <Colgate> it should be on the summary sheet thingy
[07:01:09] <Colgate> that lists all the terms, all credit cards have to have that by law
[07:01:14] <ShivalWolf> yep
[07:01:39] <tiwake> and nobody reads them
[07:01:39] <ShivalWolf> its like interest rate per year charged monthly
[07:01:46] <Colgate> I read them :V
[07:01:50] <tiwake> I do too
[07:01:54] <Colgate> they're important!
[07:01:55] <tiwake> thats why I don't have any
[07:02:11] <Colgate> I have credit cards, because they're better for me to use than debit
[07:02:12] <ShivalWolf> 500$ isnt exactly much credit
[07:02:30] <Colgate> 500$ will let you build credit if you were in a bad spot
[07:02:35] <Gigabit> I dont want more credit then that. 
[07:02:40] <ShivalWolf> just dont sucker in on grtting increazes
[07:02:59] <ShivalWolf> yeah they are right on thag credit cards are grest for building your credit history
[07:03:03] <Colgate> my current card gives me 1.5% back on every purchase, it is a pretty nice bonus for me
[07:03:06] <Gigabit> my credit score dropped horribly because fucking college loan was out of deferment the startt of this year
[07:03:25] <tiwake> a good credit score means nothing unless you buy a house/land, if you do then it means nothing after buying that
[07:03:43] <Gigabit> missed 4 payments without realizing it, and now it is sub 600..
[07:03:49] <Colgate> a good credit score lets you get the loan that lets you buy that house
[07:04:04] <ShivalWolf> better the score the more you czn borrow
[07:04:09] <tiwake> Gigabit: yeah, mine is not great because missed the first payment or two or something
[07:04:13] <Colgate> sure, your credit score will tank shortly after taking the loan, but that's expected
[07:04:19] <tiwake> Gigabit: for the college loan
[07:04:45] <ShivalWolf> i keep 2 credit cards. 1 for online use the other for rl
[07:04:48] <tiwake> Colgate: right, but if you never plan on buying a house, then a good credit score means nothing
[07:04:59] <ShivalWolf> so faraud on 1 doesnt screw the other
[07:05:04] <Gigabit> ya, they told me to either make payments to the college loan for a few months, or get a CC
[07:05:04] <Colgate> sure, if you never on taking a loan out in your life
[07:05:08] <Colgate> never plan*
[07:05:25] <Gigabit> and I rather do both honestly, toss 20 or so a month to the loan and then the cc
[07:05:30] <Colgate> credit cards are fine as long as you watch your spending and don't spend more just because you can
[07:05:35] <tiwake> I suppose the only other condition would be starting a business
[07:05:44] <Colgate> just do your normal daily expenses on it, and pay it off, and you will be fine
[07:06:06] <tiwake> Gigabit: right, I do too
[07:06:17] <Gigabit> Pay it off at the end of the month Colgate?
[07:06:24] <ShivalWolf> general rule of thumb ive found is dont get limits higher then what you can pay off before the interedt free period runs out
[07:06:24] <Colgate> pay it off at every billing period
[07:06:30] <tiwake> I also plan on saving up for it, pay like half of it with cash or possibly more
[07:06:57] <Colgate> billing period is usually monthly, but some credit cards try to trick you there too...
[07:07:31] <tiwake> Colgate: I'm getting a google nexus 5 cellphone tomorrow \o/
[07:07:41] <tiwake> going to try putting sailfishOS on it
[07:08:09] * Colgate looks at their credit card balance at the moment, cringes
[07:08:15] <Colgate> ~2000$ :(
[07:08:27] <Colgate> damn cons, ha
[07:08:31] <ShivalWolf> lol
[07:08:38] <tiwake> ...
[07:08:53] <tiwake> buy a car instead, with that kind of money
[07:08:56] <ShivalWolf> limit?
[07:09:15] <Colgate> nah, I paid for 2 hotel rooms for 4 nights each on the card :P
[07:09:17] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[07:09:29] <Colgate> everyone else paid me back, I just haven't paid the CC yet
[07:09:38] <ShivalWolf> i put my last car on my credit card
[07:09:48] <ShivalWolf> but it was a cheap car
[07:09:51] <Colgate> credit limit on that card is 5000$
[07:09:56] <Colgate> which is plenty
[07:09:59] <ShivalWolf> yeah
[07:10:24] <ShivalWolf> i have 25000 in credit
[07:11:07] <ShivalWolf> luckily i only owe like 400$ right now
[07:11:25] <Colgate> I could easily get more cards if I wanted, but I have no reason to have more cards
[07:11:48] <ShivalWolf> ive been meaning to drop the limits
[07:12:09] <Colgate> why is that?
[07:12:12] <ShivalWolf> but i need to go into the bank and fill in forms
[07:12:39] <ShivalWolf> because i dont need that much credit
[07:13:14] <Colgate> does it hurt you though?
[07:13:22] <Kinsley> I'm not sure how AUS handles that, but I know in the US, dropping your credit limit, even if you don't or never or will never use it is super bad for your credit history and score.
[07:14:25] <Colgate> tiwake: as for the N5, neat! does sailfishos have encryption yet? >.>
[07:14:49] <ShivalWolf> not really whixh is why i havent done it. but it would be nice if im ever hit with fraud again i dont risk as much sometimes fraud csn be tough to battle
[07:15:28] <Colgate> ah, in the US, credit card fraud is super in your favor
[07:15:36] <ShivalWolf> it is here to
[07:15:51] <ShivalWolf> but still the higher the amount it can be funky
[07:16:03] <ShivalWolf> 7000$ last time was a pain
[07:16:14] <Colgate> that's a lot :O
[07:16:17] <ShivalWolf> i did get it all back but id rsther not risk it
[07:16:18] <tiwake> Colgate: donno... evidently jolla fired, or 'temp-layed off' a bunch of software devs
[07:16:28] <Colgate> :(
[07:16:32] <tiwake> yeah
[07:16:37] <Colgate> wonder when those tablets are shipping
[07:16:43] <Colgate> >.>
[07:16:50] <ShivalWolf> took 4 months to get back
[07:17:43] <Colgate> supposedly december 2015, heh
[07:19:11] <ShivalWolf> lol so i raised a support ticket eith MSI on the freezing issue with my machine. 2 hours later i get a nee beta unreleased firmware thats 14 versions higher
[07:19:25] <ShivalWolf> guess they have been working on known bugs alot
[07:19:37] <tiwake> Colgate: they spent a lot of money getting the operating system where they wanted it, now that the operating system is ready, the pickup rate is a bit slower than they initially thought
[07:20:58] <tiwake> Colgate: intex I think is the name, that is going to start shipping all their cellphones with SailfishOS
[07:21:28] <Colgate> going to wait til I get my tablet before I do anything with sailfishos :P
[07:21:39] <Colgate> gives me something to play around with
[07:21:52] <tiwake> yeah
[07:22:00] <tiwake> though I needed a new cellphone
[07:23:10] <Colgate> know what annoys me?
[07:23:21] <Gigabit> hey do you think it would start looking good for me if I paid a little here and there monthly on my loan? I am on deferment, and have until 9/2016 before I have to start paying
[07:23:24] <Colgate> my scanner doesn't want to scan
[07:23:27] <tiwake> lawyers?
[07:23:29] <tiwake> oh
[07:23:31] <Colgate> why? because it is out of black ink
[07:23:34] <Colgate> >:(
[07:23:40] <tiwake> what
[07:23:51] <tiwake> Colgate: what does the CUPS server do?
[07:23:59] <tiwake> or does CUPS not let you print?
[07:24:20] <Colgate> Gigabit: I mean, lowering the amount of debt you have will improve your credit score, but not by a whole lot
[07:24:26] <tiwake> erm scan
[07:24:28] <tiwake> w/e
[07:24:30] <tiwake> I'm tired
[07:24:47] <Colgate> nah, I got it to scan, but I had to initiate the scan from my computer instead of from the printer
[07:24:55] <Colgate> which is how I usually do it
[07:25:02] <tiwake> sounds about right
[07:25:15] <tiwake> printer software is so dumb these days
[07:25:19] <Colgate> also, scanning in color at 1200 dpi crashes it
[07:25:29] <Gigabit> coming next year, they want 140 a month until 2025
[07:25:43] <Colgate> the scanner I mean, as in, physically crashes it and requires a power cycle to fix
[07:25:55] <tiwake> yeah
[07:25:58] <Gigabit> maybe I should wait to start paying that until I can get into an apartment
[07:26:12] <tiwake> by printer software, I mean the firmware or whatever it is that controls the printer
[07:26:47] <Colgate> it depends on the terms of the loan, but if you can pay that down now and pay more than just the minimum and start working away at the principle, it will greatly lower the amount you end up paying in total
[07:27:14] <Colgate> this really depends on the terms of the loan though, some won't let you do that, and if it is deferred until next year, paying now might make that deferment go away
[07:27:38] <tiwake> student loans will let you pay off early without penalty
[07:28:51] <Gigabit> nah the website for my loan tells me the last payment is march 2025
[07:29:48] <tiwake> shower time
[07:30:16] <Gigabit> ill probably just go the CC route, try to I mean. Will boost my credit better sooner anyways I think
[07:31:05] <Gigabit> Sorry for all this credit card talk. Its bad when I trust people online more then my father..
[07:32:19] <Colgate> eh, I wouldn't say that
[07:32:50] <Colgate> tbh, I trust people online more than my family on nearly everything, since online there are people who are experienced in literally everything
[07:32:58] <Colgate> much more than my family
[07:33:12] <Colgate> course, there's a lot of people spouting crap too!

[21:03:21] <Lapsus> Compu: Power off, stiff bristled brush, and the highest percentage isopropyl alcohol that you can get a hold of
[21:03:40] <Lapsus> 90 - 99%
[21:03:50] <Compu> DataByte: got it pre owned from gamestop
[21:04:01] <Compu> its not too bad but i still want it clean
[21:04:19] <Gladiolus> lick it
[21:04:21] <Gladiolus> LICK IT CLEAN

[21:05:09] <DataByte> i would reserve disassembly for a really bad controller.. say, it's so dirty that the buttons stick
[21:06:08] <DataByte> using standard (non-scented, if possible) cleaning fluids and a paper towel, maybe cotton swabs, would be fine
[21:06:33] <DataByte> isopropyl alcohol works great, but not everyone has ready access to that
[21:07:05] <DataByte> honestly, i just use a water-dampened paper towel
[21:07:31] <DataByte> vinegar, if it smells or if you're suspicious
[21:07:46] <Compu> DataByte: i got the screw out but now it still wont come apart
[21:08:06] <DataByte> manufactures love blind fasteners ;)
[21:08:48] <Compu> DataByte: ah, got it, just a few clips
[21:08:58] <DataByte> if you're careful, you can use a knife edge or a small flathead screwdriver to walk the edges to convince them loose
