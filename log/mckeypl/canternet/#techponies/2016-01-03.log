[18:35:43] <corkfuse> question, if I use a client certificate, do I still hold nicks with the nickserv password?
[18:45:00] <Divide|TechSupport> Er, you should, yes.
[18:45:09] <Divide|TechSupport> That's not related to client certificates in the slightest.
[18:46:05] <Divide|TechSupport> Also, I want to beat the crud out of anyone who thinks that giving a game console an IP address of 192.168.0.12 for port forwarding is a good idea.  No.  Bad, wrong.  You want to set the IP address out of range of DHCP reservation, you chunderheads.
