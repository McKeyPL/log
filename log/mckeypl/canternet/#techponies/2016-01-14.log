[02:08:21] <Moonlightning> > Simply stated, passcode-protected devices render lawful court orders meaningless
[02:08:23] <Moonlightning> um, no
[02:08:32] <Moonlightning> you can already lock people up and torture them until they give you passwords
[02:08:37] <Moonlightning> I don't see any reason to make it FUCKING EASIER
[02:09:00] <JustAberrant> can't do that without revealing the surveillance
[02:09:50] <JustAberrant> either way as to earlier: all that stuff will still exist, this isn't going to stop people from using encryption, just require weaker encryption
[02:10:11] <JustAberrant> worst case "someone got access trhough a back door" will just be another on the list of reasons you have to get a new credit card this month
[02:10:25] <JustAberrant> * through
[02:12:02] <Moonlightning> I hope HoneyDrops is accurate for once. I really, really hope everyone just stops selling in New York.
[02:12:20] <JustAberrant> haha, dream on ;p
[02:12:48] <Moonlightning> Colgate: that's a very good idea.
[02:12:58] <HoneyDrops> I would say the biggest problem with law enforcement/surveillance precisely is lack of transparency.
[02:13:03] <Moonlightning> I think I've actually thought about implementing a variation on it before
[02:13:15] <Moonlightning> If no authentication happens within X amount of time, bring the system down
[02:13:17] <Moonlightning> just bring it down
[02:13:56] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: sure, but usual balancing of goals.. like it or not, law enforcement does sometimes need to covertly monitor someone to do their jobs.. the system of warrants is _supposed_ to keep the balance between need and abuse 
[02:14:50] <JustAberrant> and while I agree more transparency is needed, it's entirely obvious why you can never have complete transparency 
[02:16:19] <HoneyDrops> It should only be secret just long enough to provide safety/effectiveness, but when even the means or techniques cannot be audited by the populace you have a serious issue.
[02:17:16] <JustAberrant> sure, but again, balance
[02:17:23] <HoneyDrops> I could probably be persuaded to allow something like stingray, if it's used was made public record a fixed time after each and every use.  The technical details of it's operation should be public record.
[02:17:26] <JustAberrant> those techniques become far less effective if they, you know, describe them
[02:17:53] <JustAberrant> the revelation of stingray for example probably has significantly decreased it's effectiveness
[02:18:10] <HoneyDrops> Our (meaning the US) law enforcement system was never intended to prioritize effectiveness.
[02:18:24] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: I need a good plausible-deniability alternate-volume thing. :(
[02:18:26] <JustAberrant> prioritize, no, but it is a component of the equation
[02:18:36] <HoneyDrops> We have whole constitutional amendments that are specifically crafted to limit it's potential effectiveness.
[02:18:42] <HoneyDrops> its*
[02:18:49] <Moonlightning> my biggest problem is that it would be painfully obvious that the volumes I give them are not actually the volumes that I use
[02:19:17] <JustAberrant> meh, if the police are ceasing your gear you're probably fucked regardless ;p
[02:19:33] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: jailtime is irreversible. Those who have lost significant portions of their lives for no good reason will never get that time back.
[02:19:47] <Moonlightning> We're not immortal…not yet…
[02:20:09] <Moonlightning> Colgate: !
[02:20:31] <HoneyDrops> Secret courts, and letters that forbid from even disclosing the requests is something that should be reserved for only the most extreme and imminent threats.  As soon as those threats are diffused, the curtain should be pulled back.
[02:21:31] <HoneyDrops> I you better have a very damn good reason, because the public should be able to pass judgement on if it was worth it.
[02:22:29] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning: technically yes, but you can at least discontinue it.  There is some potential for redress.  Dead is dead.
[02:23:56] <HoneyDrops> It is better to not make a mistake in the first place (or always err on the side of the defendant), but that isn't possible.
[02:24:43] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: no, worst case, your life is FUCKING RUINED by private stuff some scumball of an ““intelligence officer”” decided to blab.
[02:27:03] <HoneyDrops> Transparency and accountability are required for a correctly functioning government.  Secrecy is an extreme measure and should be reserved solely for imminent and direct threats to human life.  It should only remain a secret for the absolute minimum duration necessary.
[02:28:17] <Moonlightning> This.
[02:28:31] <Moonlightning> I feel like it's also kind of a slippery slope though.
[02:28:53] <mniip> interesting
[02:29:12] <mniip> only charybdis seems to understand =b
[02:29:16] <mniip> cmode that is
[02:29:25] <Moonlightning> /cmode isn't actually a thing
[02:29:31] <mniip> right

[10:18:38] <Moonlightning> /The/ railroad?
[10:18:41] <tiwake> yeah

[10:18:55] <tiwake> or at least the first parts of it
[10:18:56] <Moonlightning> :P
[10:19:05] <Moonlightning> nah, surely Manehattan has a subway system, right?
[10:19:09] <Moonlightning> …right?…
[10:19:23] <tiwake> as I'm sure it was added to as time moved on
[10:20:36] <tiwake> I cant really decide if it should have been built before luna's banishment or after
[10:21:13] <tiwake> before would infer a golden age, possibly about the time with celestia and luna rose to power
[10:21:29] <Moonlightning> ugh
[10:21:33] <Moonlightning> I hate the term /golden age/
[10:21:38] <Moonlightning> what, like the entire rest of the timeline is just shitty?
[10:21:40] <tiwake> after would imply that luna did not reign for very long
[10:21:47] <Moonlightning> “This bit is the ONLY good bit in <X>'s history!”
[10:21:51] <tiwake> well
[10:22:33] <tiwake> Moonlightning: for USA I would consider that the 1920's, and pretty much no other time in USA history
[10:22:48] <tiwake> but *shrug*

[10:25:05] <tiwake> whatever, forget I asked :P
[10:25:42] <tiwake> Moonlightning: to be fair, I did say "a", not "the"
[10:26:21] <Moonlightning> well, yeah, but unless you're gonna label every non-shitty era as a “golden age”…
[10:26:30] <tiwake> if its modeled after any other country thats been around for a while, there are always ups and downs
[10:27:30] <tiwake> Moonlightning: so what would you call the up parts?
[10:28:21] <Moonlightning> I dunno. Maybe the opposite of what you would call the down parts?

[10:28:58] <tiwake> ?

[21:33:07] <HoneyDrops> “Its exploitation requires two non-default options: a ProxyCommand, and either ForwardAgent (-A) or ForwardX11 (-X),”
[21:35:13] <Colgate> HoneyDrops: where did you see that at?
[21:35:26] <HoneyDrops> https://threatpost.com/openssh-patches-critical-flaw-that-could-leak-private-crypto-keys/115889/
[21:36:14] <Colgate> ah, didn't see that, only saw the openssh official post
[21:36:36] <HoneyDrops> Not sure it it's talking about the buffer overflow, but given the second vuln was "a buffer overflow in the default OpenSSH client configuration" it seems stating non-default options would contradict that
[21:36:41] <HoneyDrops> if it's*
[21:37:42] <HoneyDrops> In any case, this is only an issue of you are using keyauth with an untrusted or compromised server.  Did it state anywhere if it can leak all private keys, or just the one in use?
[21:38:07] <Colgate> it didn't say
[21:38:29] <Colgate> "...could be tricked by a malicious
[21:38:30] <Colgate>    server into leaking client memory to the server, including private
[21:38:31] <Colgate>    client user keys."
[21:38:46] <Colgate> so, whatever it loads into memory I guess
[21:39:06] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, looking at this now: https://www.qualys.com/2016/01/14/cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778/openssh-cve-2016-0777-cve-2016-0778.txt
[21:39:21] <Colgate> but verifying the host key prevents it
[21:39:32] <Colgate> unless the server binary is modified without the key changed, obviously

[21:40:54] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, plus it seems that it isn't silent from the clientside either?  You'd see that the session keeps dropping.
[21:41:14] <Colgate> HoneyDrops: based off your link, I think the buffer overflow isn't related to the private key leak/resume thing
[21:41:22] <HoneyDrops> Yeah
[21:41:30] <HoneyDrops> I'm getting that impression too.
