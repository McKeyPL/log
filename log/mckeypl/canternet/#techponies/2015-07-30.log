[00:14:29] <Gladiolus> he's not replying
[00:14:43] <Gigabit> Can you ask him if I can clean install from 7 due to not enough space to upgrade?
[00:15:07] <Gladiolus> You can install clean without a key and you would be in basically the same spot I am.
[00:15:29] <Gladiolus> I.E I have a legit 7 key, but I did not upgrade install from 7.

[01:55:59] <Gladiolus> a hahah
[01:56:00] <Colgate> I would be very surprised if they open sourced windows
[01:56:30] <Gladiolus> windows activations from the free upgrade are tied to the computer and the upgrade doesn't generate a new key
[01:56:41] <Gladiolus> this is important for several reasons
[01:56:56] <Gladiolus> 1: if you are reserved you can format and install with the generic key and it'll activate
[01:57:52] <Gladiolus> 2: I installed a few weeks before the 29th with the RTM build and was always confused as to if I was properly activated. This confirms that I must be, since both my pc (fresh install from disk) and my macbook (proper upgrade over 8.1) have the same key
[01:58:16] <Gladiolus> this also means, lol, you can probably use the same windows 7/8 keys to install unlimited upgrades

[03:13:52] <RainbowHacks> init_something, I've been wasting money since i got this job 5 months ago
[03:13:59] <RainbowHacks> i just bought a drum kit
[03:14:00] <RainbowHacks> and a bass
[03:14:03] <Phase> bad RainbowHacks
[03:14:06] <RainbowHacks> and put a down payment on my new amp
[03:14:07] <Phase> save your money
[03:14:09] <RainbowHacks> and bought this laptop
[03:14:17] <RainbowHacks> and am saving for BronyCAN
[03:14:26] <init_something> I don't even know why but due to a conversation on another channel I've promised I'd get a commission of Bolo tanks having an orgy in orbit. 
[03:14:27] <Phase> that's better
[03:14:39] <RainbowHacks> because why go to the poni con a few states awya when i can fly to the west coast and go to canada instead?
[03:14:52] <RainbowHacks> (why? because canadian friends, thats why x3 )
[03:16:11] <init_something> Honestly I just want a nice bottle of fine Bourbon and a new computer. New(er) BMW to come as well. 
[03:16:29] <init_something> My current bby is rusting :(
[03:16:34] <RainbowHacks> Oh and I just bought a new humidor and some cigars
[03:16:40] <RainbowHacks> and a graphics card finally
[03:16:44] <RainbowHacks> and ALL the steam games >.>
[03:16:51] <init_something> Haha.
[03:16:58] <init_something> Sell your soul to gaben.
[03:17:01] * RainbowHacks usually keeps cigars for her studio clients
[03:17:08] * RainbowHacks does audio engineering when not working.
[03:17:38] <init_something> Ahh neat. 
[03:17:53] * RainbowHacks doesn't know what free time is
[03:17:53] <RainbowHacks> x3
[03:18:05] <init_something> Cigar sounds gud though. 
[03:18:24] <init_something> New thing added to "waste money on" list. 
[03:18:33] <RainbowHacks> well if youre getting bourbon
[03:18:35] <RainbowHacks> you need some cigars
[03:18:40] <init_something> True
[03:19:02] <init_something> I have a friend who travels to Cuba from time to time too...
[03:19:09] <RainbowHacks> and the trade embargo has lifted
[03:19:11] <RainbowHacks> so
[03:19:11] <RainbowHacks> like
[03:19:14] <RainbowHacks> yes? :D
[03:19:23] <init_something> Oh wait, did it get lifted?
[03:19:28] <RainbowHacks> like a year ago
[03:19:34] <RainbowHacks> you can legally buy real cubans
[03:19:38] <init_something> I thought they were just talking about it. 
[03:19:40] <RainbowHacks> naw
[03:19:46] <init_something> And moving at the speed of government. 
[03:19:59] <init_something> Fuck, I need to figure out where I can get them then. 
[03:20:04] <RainbowHacks> but nicaraguan and dominican have too much of a lock on the international market at this point ;-;
[03:20:44] <init_something> I just moved from the middle of nowhere to pretty much just north of Detroit. I'm sure I can find that shit around. 
[03:21:03] <init_something> There is like everything here. 
[03:21:24] * RainbowHacks nods
[03:21:31] <RainbowHacks> i'm on the east coast, myself
[03:21:32] <RainbowHacks> jersey girl.
[03:21:43] <init_something> Ahh gotcha
[03:22:00] <init_something> We both live in places everyone likes to rip on then. 
[03:22:05] * RainbowHacks nods
[03:22:05] <init_something> Horray
[03:23:23] <init3> So what  be your favorite *nix then?

[03:23:36] <RainbowHacks> though I work in a mainly Linux shop
[03:23:59] <init3> Yeah, I'm more of a Linux person myself. I have used FreeBSD though. 
[03:24:06] <RainbowHacks> :3
[03:24:19] <RainbowHacks> I started on Linux
[03:24:20] <init3> pf >iptables undoubtedly. 
[03:24:30] <RainbowHacks> moved away from it a few years ago
[03:24:32] <RainbowHacks> oh hell yes
[03:24:41] <RainbowHacks> i dont even use the default firewall on freebsd. pf > everything
[03:24:59] <init3> pf isn't default on FreeBSD?
[03:25:03] <RainbowHacks> nope
[03:25:14] <RainbowHacks> i think ipfw is
[03:25:23] <init3> Is that a new thing or am I just misremembering?
[03:25:30] <RainbowHacks> misremembering
[03:25:39] <RainbowHacks> pf comes from OpenBSD, got ported to FreeBSD
[03:25:45] <RainbowHacks> ipfw comes from FreeBSD
[03:25:55] <RainbowHacks> i mean, technically no firewall is enabled after a fresh install...
[03:26:11] <init3> ooooohhh. I did use OpenBSD too for a bit until I discovered the OpenBSD community. 
[03:26:32] <RainbowHacks> heh
[03:26:46] <RainbowHacks> I'm a security freak. but those people?
[03:26:53] <init3> kek
[03:26:57] <RainbowHacks> I've got a tin foil hat, they've got a tin foil island.
[03:27:06] <init3> Right?
[03:27:13] <RainbowHacks> x3
[03:29:03] <init3> I like Arch for my personal workstations but am kinda undecided on the server front. REHL is nice for large homogeneous environments and Debian is just nice and stable as fuck imo.

[03:32:26] <RainbowHacks> I'm tired :<
[03:32:34] * JustAberrant rubs RainbowHacks 's eyes as well :(
[03:32:48] * Gladiolus rubs RainbowHacks' eyes, all the cool kids are.
[03:32:56] <RainbowHacks> OHGODWAT
[03:33:09] <RainbowHacks> You people are weird.
[03:33:13] <RainbowHacks> I like that.
[03:33:19] <Gladiolus> o3o

[03:33:42] <RainbowHacks> any of you weird awesome people on twatter?

[03:34:03] <init_something> I have a twitter account but I never tweet really. 
[03:34:26] * RainbowHacks spews random crap about infosec and cartoon horses once in a while
[03:34:34] <init_something> Though I'd highly recommend infosec Taylor Swift if you don't already follow. 
[03:34:54] <RainbowHacks> I did for a bit
[03:34:56] <RainbowHacks> It was funnyt
[03:35:00] <RainbowHacks> then it wasn't
[03:35:06] <init_something> It has it's moments. 
[03:35:14] <init_something> its
[03:36:01] <init_something> ok. i reallly need to fix my locale settings but all the Arch documentation points to a file that is no longer used. 
[03:36:21] <init_something> It has its charms but times like this piss me off.

[03:37:53] <init3> But can you see a new version of a program on slashdot and find it already in the repo less than an hour later typically?
[03:38:27] <RainbowHacks> ports tree
[03:38:27] <init3> Bleeding edge is best edgy.
[03:38:28] <RainbowHacks> aww yiss
[03:38:46] <RainbowHacks> Although occasionally porters fall behind...
[03:39:08] <init3> When I used FreeBSD ports seemed to take about a week on average. Not bad but for some things that's an eternity. 
[03:39:09] <RainbowHacks> Gobbby hasn't been updated in ages even though I helped the author fix it so it compiles on freebsd again -.-
[03:39:17] * RainbowHacks has half a mind to take over the port
[03:39:25] <RainbowHacks> but that would involve learning C (which i need to do anyway)
[03:39:34] * init3 shudders
[03:40:54] * Gladiolus hipsters it up by refusing to use anything other than AmigaOS
[03:40:57] <Gladiolus> i don't but lol
[03:41:11] <init3> You would
[03:41:19] <Gladiolus> pff no
[03:41:24] <Gladiolus> i hipster it up by using osx

[03:43:49] <Gladiolus> you play with fire

[03:44:02] <Gladiolus> the fire is creepy internetians

[03:45:11] <PinkiePieBot> [ Rainbow (@RainbowHacks) | Twitter ]
[03:45:31] <RainbowHacks> stolen wifi? splice the line and jack it from the source
[03:45:39] <RainbowHacks> not that i've ever done so >.>
[03:45:46] <init3> My neighbor may actually be using their internet. 
[03:46:04] <RainbowHacks> Splice,  not steal
[03:46:22] <init3> Well I've been meaning to crack the SSID "Get out" Secured with WEP because come on, that's just asking for it. 
[03:46:33] <init3> Maybe bond them
[03:46:34] <Gigabit> PC is at 13%..holy shit this is slow
[03:46:46] <RainbowHacks> init3, lol
[03:47:25] <init_something> Twitter just doesn't want to load for some reason. 
[03:47:33] <init_something> On either of my boxen
[03:48:42] * RainbowHacks derps
[03:49:39] <init_something> Yeah, my neighbor's ISP is apparently not resolving twitter right now. I guess I can't call comcast for them eh?
[03:49:53] <init_something> Err, I think I use 8.8.8.8 though. 
[03:50:00] <RainbowHacks> you could try!
[03:50:06] <RainbowHacks> i did that for my roommate once
[03:50:24] <RainbowHacks> problem was I didn't realize the account was in his mom's name
[03:50:51] <RainbowHacks> (i have no clue why. If we could get fios i'd shell out for it but we cant so if I have to deal with comcast, i'm not gonna actually pay to have to deal with it)
[03:50:58] <init_something> I'm actually using google's resolvers though it seems. 
[03:51:44] * RainbowHacks shrugs
[03:52:52] <init_something> apparently I can't resolve anything. 
[03:52:59] <init_something> huh
[03:53:21] <RainbowHacks> o.0
[03:53:30] <RainbowHacks> 4.2.2.2 doesn't work either?
[03:53:36] <init_something> Nope
[03:54:40] <RainbowHacks> no connectivity to them? or just can't resolve? o.0
[03:54:47] <init_something> Let's see. 
[03:55:41] <init_something> Looking like I can't ping them either. dafuq
[03:56:03] <RainbowHacks> can you ping ANYTHING? x3
[03:56:18] <init_something> Maybe the open 'linksys' AP is just a honeypot and my neighbor is fucking with me. 
[03:56:30] <init_something> Well apparently I have connectivity to canternet. 
[03:56:52] <init_something> But I guess I can't ping it. 
[03:57:09] <RainbowHacks> o.0
[03:57:22] <RainbowHacks> they might have forgotten to pay their bill
[03:57:25] <init3> The fuck is this. 
[03:57:31] <RainbowHacks> and existing connections aren't being terminated
[03:57:36] <RainbowHacks> but anything new is blocked
[03:57:37] <init3> Oh shit I hope not
[03:57:40] <RainbowHacks> (comcast does this)
[03:57:49] <init_something> it is comcast
[03:57:56] <RainbowHacks> heh
[03:58:06] <init_something> shiiii
[03:58:16] <RainbowHacks> this is why i have a hotspot
[03:58:26] <RainbowHacks> (also so i have net at work on my personal laptop without using worknet)
[03:58:52] <init_something> I mean, I have a tablet with 4G but I only have 2G of data a month. 
[03:59:00] <init_something> So basically useless. 
[04:00:20] <init_something> I really wonder if you're right about this being a block. 
[04:00:52] <init_something> I've never had internet break in this manner. 
[04:00:53] <RainbowHacks> MTR, see if you can get past the GW
[04:01:48] <init_something> Let's see
[04:01:55] <RainbowHacks> or try pinging comcast's website... 60.252.80.75
[04:02:41] <init_something> Oh my
[04:02:47] <RainbowHacks> o.o?
[04:02:58] <init_something> This network may just be a honeypot lol
[04:03:15] <init_something>  1  gateway (192.168.1.1)  9.304 ms  9.358 ms  9.530 ms
[04:03:24] <init_something>  2  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  9.624 ms  9.814 ms  10.033 ms
[04:03:28] <init_something> odd
[04:04:03] <init_something> I've been operating on the assumption all my communications in the clear were being logged already.
[04:04:26] <RainbowHacks> oh man
[04:04:27] <RainbowHacks> xe3
[04:04:28] <RainbowHacks> x3
[04:04:34] <init_something> But 10.0.0.1 is as far as I go. 
[04:04:51] <RainbowHacks> the 192 address is common for a comcast Gateway
[04:05:01] <RainbowHacks> their shitty allinone hardware
[04:05:20] <init_something> well it's a linksys ap
[04:05:21] <RainbowHacks> the 10.X is unusual
[04:05:28] <RainbowHacks> Yeah, that's weird.
[04:05:36] <RainbowHacks> have you verified that it's linksys? :p
[04:05:56] <init_something> Let's see. Can you look up the MAC prefix for me?
[04:06:48] <init_something> It's 00:1A:70:F5:06:28
[04:08:53] <RainbowHacks> 00:1A:70:**:**:** - Cisco-Li
[04:09:00] <RainbowHacks> yeah, it's linksys
[04:09:03] <init_something> Hmm
[04:09:30] <init_something> I wonder if I can arp that 10.
[04:10:19] *** Joins: Noone (Iceman@Darkhorse21)

[04:28:11] <RainbowHacks> Never, because soon the firewall will be supplied by SystemD-FirewallD
[04:28:17] * Googie throws ipchains at JustAberrant :P
[04:28:22] <RainbowHacks> shortly before it absorbs Linux into SystemD-KernelD
[04:28:34] <RainbowHacks> and then the GNU shit into SystemD-UserspaceD
[04:28:44] * JustAberrant nods :(
[04:28:53] <RainbowHacks> then it will be SystemD/SystemD
[04:28:57] * JustAberrant uses gentoo, the last bastion of hope and order
[04:29:04] <JustAberrant> which is a sad.. sad commentary on the state of linux :D
[04:29:08] <RainbowHacks> JustAberrant, not so! Jump ship, to sanity!

[04:29:25] <RainbowHacks> To Real Unix!
[04:29:34] * RainbowHacks gives JustAberrant a FreeBSD installer
[04:29:37] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:29:38] <init3> systemd isn't as pad as people make it out to be. 
[04:29:43] <init3> Y'all are crazy
[04:29:46] <JustAberrant> hehe, I've actually experimented with FreeBSD on a desktop.. 
[04:29:50] <JustAberrant> still not quite there yet..
[04:29:52] <RainbowHacks> ZFS is <3
[04:29:59] <RainbowHacks> JustAberrant, depends on what yoyu're trying to do
[04:30:03] <RainbowHacks> my laptop is FreeBSD
[04:30:04] <Googie> Yeah. Honestly most of the crap with systemd is in philosophy rather than implementation from what I've found.
[04:30:06] <JustAberrant> desktop-y stuff ;p
[04:30:08] <RainbowHacks> i built a solid desktop experience
[04:30:15] * RainbowHacks is running lxde on it
[04:30:21] <JustAberrant> definitely freebsd for servers if there isn't a compelling reason to require linux
[04:30:22] <RainbowHacks> :3
[04:30:22] <Googie> btrfs > zfs... when it is finally stable and mostly done :P
[04:30:30] <RainbowHacks> Googie, you're kidding right?
[04:30:53] <RainbowHacks> i mean btrfs is certainly better than the clusterfuck that is ext*
[04:31:06] <RainbowHacks> but nothing compares with ZFS (since ZFS is also a volume manager :p )
[04:31:27] <Googie> Like btrfs ? :P
[04:31:28] * JustAberrant finds ZFS's means of content expansion kinda silly :(
[04:31:55] <RainbowHacks> Googie, btrfs is a filesystem, not a volume manager.
[04:32:00] <RainbowHacks> ZFS is both
[04:32:04] <Googie> It is both.
[04:32:06] <RainbowHacks> it's why i use ZFS instead of HAMMER
[04:32:19] <JustAberrant> btrfs has subvolumes and all that
[04:32:20] <RainbowHacks> because HAMMER doesn't do volume management either, even if it has some features I wish ZFS had
[04:33:17] <Googie> btrfs can basically done everything that ZFS can do, except in many cases it isn't stable there yet :(
[04:33:47] <RainbowHacks> ZFS > all
[04:33:49] <Googie> (Or doesn't /actually/ exist, but is planned for in the design :V)
[04:34:38] <JustAberrant> I just dislike that you can't simply add a drive to a raidz depending on how you set things up
[04:35:15] <JustAberrant> you end up having to create an additional pool and join it in
[04:35:18] <Googie> Yeah, btrfs is a lot more flexible that way, though outside of its implementation RAID0/1, it's still wearing the unstable tag.
[04:35:49] <JustAberrant> I mean you can argue that adding a few drives here and there isn't a common use case
[04:35:52] <JustAberrant> but still :>
[04:36:09] * JustAberrant did it 3 times with his linux file server
[04:36:21] <JustAberrant> * linux/xfs
[04:36:26] * RainbowHacks needs to reinstall her server
[04:36:34] <RainbowHacks> I need to switch from UFS2 to ZFS
[04:36:37] <RainbowHacks> and thats going to suck
[04:36:38] <RainbowHacks> so
[04:36:39] <RainbowHacks> fucking
[04:36:40] <RainbowHacks> much
[04:36:55] <RainbowHacks> but I nee dto do it before I configure my mailserver
[04:37:03] <Googie> Honestly though, I think you need to read up on btrfs a little more, it really is quite comparable to ZFS, especially if you were thinking that it was just a simple file system.
[04:37:06] <JustAberrant> when I finally upgrade the thing, I'll most certainly put bsd and zfs on it.. but yeah.. that's one feature I'll miss
[04:37:29] <RainbowHacks> Googie, maybe.
[04:37:43] * RainbowHacks probably won
[04:37:50] <RainbowHacks> won't though, too much other stuff going on
[04:38:06] <Googie> ZFS's biggest problem though isn't technical :( Licensing...
[04:38:11] <RainbowHacks> like redoing my server...and trying to teach myself 3 different languagesm and learning to pick locks
[04:38:29] <RainbowHacks> oh, you're one of those GPL IS THE ONLY LICENSE people? o.o
[04:38:33] <Googie> No.
[04:38:38] <RainbowHacks> I was about to say.... :p
[04:38:43] <Googie> It's just that you can't ship it stock on Linux
[04:38:56] <Googie> There's a module for it, but legally the distro cannot integrate it IIRC
[04:38:58] * RainbowHacks doesn't really care, hasn't used Linux for like....3 years now
[04:39:21] <Googie> Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's not a hugely important issue.
[04:39:27] <RainbowHacks> GPL issues make me laugh, because they're self-inflicted
[04:39:42] <RainbowHacks> well, usually self-inflicted, like in this case
[04:39:59] <RainbowHacks> I mean, more permissive licensing is always better (BSD 2 clause k thnx)
[04:40:02] * JustAberrant on the permissive license bandwagon as well :(
[04:40:12] <RainbowHacks> and I'd LOVE to see ZFS moved to something far less restrictive
[04:40:24] <RainbowHacks> but yeah, this is a case of GPL'ed software shooting itself in the foot
[04:40:27] <JustAberrant> but with all things, you can't go back and do things over again.. who knows what woulda happened without the GPL
[04:40:29] <RainbowHacks> drinking the stallman koolaid
[04:40:51] <Googie> Yeah, I do support the GPL, I think that it has helped a lot with growing open source to what it is.
[04:41:06] <RainbowHacks> Oh, of course it has
[04:41:08] <Googie> Now we're starting to see a bunch of the pains of it though.
[04:41:10] <RainbowHacks> It's not an inherently bad thing
[04:41:19] <RainbowHacks> the things that bother me the most
[04:41:39] * JustAberrant suspects most of the problems GPL sought to prevent would never actually come to fruition, and would actually make open source more common by removing all the GPL paranoid any business has when thinking about it
[04:41:47] <JustAberrant> but there'd probably still be the occasional bad story
[04:41:58] <RainbowHacks> are A) that stallmanites think the GPL is a Free license when in fact its an Open Source license. Freedom isn't free if there are restrictions. The BSD licenses and similar are Free. and B ) the fact that it's causing so many issues these days with OSS
[04:42:12] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:42:23] <Googie> GPLv3 is a great example of that sadly JustAberrant :(
[04:42:30] <JustAberrant> Free as in conforming to a set of rules designed to protect the subset of freedom we've deemed most important ;p
[04:42:49] <Googie> That being said, I have no doubt that "embrace, expand, extinguish" would have worked a lot better without the GPL.
[04:43:01] <Googie> You can skip the embrace stage :V

[06:58:43] <Gladiolus> shouldn't matter
[06:59:43] <Gigabit> will find out soon, at 44%
[07:01:55] <Seoson> My cracked license seemed to work fine with the RTM upgrade. I've replaced it with a genuine key now.
[07:02:30] * RainbowHacks herps and derps
[07:02:31] <Gladiolus> it seems like msft is just accepting any attempts to activate at the moment
[07:02:43] <Gladiolus> seems smart, even a small percent of false-positives would hurt
[07:02:58] <Gladiolus> Better some pirates in, than some customers out.
[07:06:26] <Gigabit> crap forgot to say no to sending my browsing data
[07:06:42] * RainbowHacks is going to hold off pon upgrading for now >.>
[07:18:28] <Seoson> It still blows my mind that they released win10 with so many problems left. Maybe that's the reason behind their "there is no such thing like a gold or rtm version" communication.
[07:18:51] <Gladiolus> Problems?
[07:18:59] <Gladiolus> I've been on RTM for weeks and haven't found any.
[07:21:18] <Seoson> Store wasn't working correctly (Serverside fixed this morning), magniefer option follow text cursor is broken, settings are inconsistent, windows update keept replacing my video card drivers (seems to be fixed now)
[07:21:48] <Gigabit> so first problem
[07:21:53] <Gladiolus> So two of your things are fixed, one is a minor UI issue, and the other is a legit problem.
[07:22:03] <Gladiolus> So.. one major problem. Sounds like a pretty good OS release to me.
[07:22:04] <Seoson> Notification icon changes even if there are no new notifications
[07:22:09] <Gigabit> google drive, I cannot choose a drive other then my OS drive to set my sync folder
[07:22:32] <Seoson> There are countless other :P
[07:22:37] <Seoson> others*
[07:22:57] <Gladiolus> Yeah but like, they're fairly minor. "This isn't a perfect OS, but it's better than the last and certainly no worse"
[07:23:09] <tiwake> bleh freecad is annoying me a lot
[07:24:04] <Seoson> UAC Popups get ridiculous (disabled UAC on my systems): Steam wants to make changes to your harddrive - nope no programs write anything to my disk xD
[07:24:24] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[07:24:34] <Gladiolus> That's been true since Vista, but it got better IMO. That... has nothing to do with Windows?
[07:24:42] <Gladiolus> oh
[07:24:47] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> "windows updates would like to make changes to your operating system, allow or deny"
[07:24:48] <Gladiolus> oh it's the same problem
[07:24:57] <Gladiolus> PFff it doesn't do that you're bein' silly.
[07:25:12] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you can set the uac to so paranoid that it DOES do that
[07:25:16] <Gladiolus> UAC was stupid with vista but it got a buttload bettr.
[07:25:21] <Seoson> I still haven't figured out how to circumvent the protection of the windows system folders from within windows
[07:25:26] <Gladiolus> Ah yes, you can opt-in to paranoia mode.
[07:25:30] <Gladiolus> Therefore UAC is bad. :I
[07:26:05] <Gladiolus> I'm not sure why you would want to, but an elevated explorer should be able to do it
[07:26:15] <Gladiolus> just call Explorer from an elevated command prompt, I think.
[07:26:36] <Gladiolus> PRetty sure making system files hard to modify is a feature.
[07:26:41] <Seoson> Try making changes to the hostfile :D
[07:26:53] <Gladiolus> easy, make a copy in documents and paste it over.
[07:27:09] <Seoson> Also the steam UAC popup came for me one the second lowest setting - the lowest being disabled
[07:27:18] <Gladiolus> how often do you do that srsly like
[07:27:25] <Gladiolus> if you edit a hostfile every day, maybe consider running linxu
[07:28:25] <Gladiolus> That was probably because steam, for some reason, likes to force an install of directx when you run games the first time and stuff like that.
[07:29:01] <Gladiolus> Man windows has a buttload of problems but these are all trivial.
[07:30:52] <Seoson> I wanted to make changed to a file that controls the login screen background which failed. I guess for the hostfile that should work.
[07:31:30] <Seoson> What I'd useally do is transfers ownership of the file to the group administrators. Sadly windows denies the access
[07:31:32] <Gladiolus> Denying customization like that is a legit problem, but Windows 10 allows for login screen changes so... welp fixed.
[07:32:03] <Gladiolus> NTFS supports ownership, but that folder must be protected too.
[07:32:05] <Seoson> Windows allows for lock screen changes but not login screen changes.
[07:32:17] <Gladiolus> Oh, yeah. You're right, that's a legit point.
[07:32:30] <Gladiolus> Anyway just make a hosts file copy in documents, change that, and paste it over when you do. 
[07:33:50] <Seoson> It's just silly. If I want to work with root on linux it just let me do that ... Probably I will get around it by adding an accouint into the Trsuted Installer Group
[07:34:53] <Gladiolus> That's a fair point now, Windows doesn't provide for a way to elevate yourself to root and bypass UAC until you logoff or whatever.
[07:35:00] <Gladiolus> But UAC in most use cases is a good thing.
[07:35:10] <Gladiolus> lest Grandma download a file that changes hosts and welp you're on a botnet
[07:35:46] <Gladiolus> Most of the problems I see that people bring up with Windows I reply with "So you use Linux if you need that," nothing works for all use cases.
[07:36:14] <Seoson> For me it's not. I didn't have any infection in what? 5 years? I know what software I'm running and if not I still have a couple of VMs setup.
[07:36:29] <Gladiolus> You're not the standard windows user lol.
[07:36:47] <Seoson> hehe ^^
[07:37:06] <Gladiolus> At the end of the day, you really can't blame microsoft for catering to a standard user case and annoying you, it's just the way of things.
[07:37:20] <Gladiolus> I don't blame linux for being hard to use, it's not in my use case so w/e let live.
[07:38:30] <Seoson> I just tried minecraft win10 edition. Inapp purchases and a broken UI. Good work ms/mojang
[07:38:50] <Gladiolus> yeah it's a piece of shit, not surprised
[07:39:25] <Gladiolus> just trying to cash in on these upgrade installs by throwing cheap-ish broken minecraft at them, i dunno
[07:39:48] <Seoson> I wouldn't swtich anyway because spigotmc/bukkit is the only reason we still play mc, soo ....
[07:43:41] <Seoson> Why does the windows store show me things for the xbox I cannot run again?
[07:45:58] <Gladiolus> 'cause msft wants to sell xbones
[07:46:21] <Moonlightning> Microsoft is selling crossbones? O.o
[07:46:53] <Gigabit> shit forgot to back up mirc settings
[07:47:02] * Gladiolus ate them
[07:47:38] <Seoson> This is like holding a piece of candy in front of a fat guy. Thinking about it, it's a bad piece of candy so it's not too bad  - just annoying.
[07:49:33] <Moonlightning> Point: not all fat people have little self-control
[07:49:35] <Seoson> Ok it gets confusing: Some are labled "xbox" while others are labled "xbox live".
[07:50:37] <Seoson> Moonlightning: I'm a good amount away from the optimal weight as well - not offence intended.
[07:51:19] <Gigabit> back online on desktop x.x
[07:51:20] <Seoson> no*
[07:51:24] <Moonlightning> Just makin' a point.
[07:53:02] <Seoson> Ok so apps labeled "xbox live" can be downloaded on windows - this is just plain stupid.

[17:45:31] <Moonlightning> Now I have justification.
[17:45:38] <LightningCrash> Well, and the games along with it. 
[17:45:41] <Moonlightning> LightningCrash, change your Steam password to something strong but unique to Steam.
[17:45:52] <Moonlightning> That's a good idea anyway, in acse you ever wanna play at someone else's house or something.

[17:59:53] <Colgate> does that apply to windows 7?
[18:00:04] <Moonlightning> Presumably. It's in their general privacy policy.
[18:00:15] <Moonlightning> I've concluded from this that all future releases of Windows will be malicious, including any future updates to Win7.
[18:00:15] <Colgate> I didn't agree to this update of the ToS

[18:00:29] <Moonlightning> You agreed to the ToC that said they can change it at any time. :p

[18:46:58] <Gigabit> He is right, I seen the post about that
[18:47:07] <Dusk> You probably should
[18:47:10] <Moonlightning> This is a serious issue and it needs to be brought to the attention of Microsoft's entier userbase.
[18:47:30] <Dusk> Who 90% of already has all of their personal data out on the internet
[18:47:30] <Moonlightning> I will help by disseminating information to my friends and the channels I frequent. :V

[18:48:34] <Moonlightning> Don't you remember how everyone flipped the fuck out when Colgate read a log that actually WAS public?
[18:48:37] <Dusk> and all of my logs are public
[18:48:40] <Colgate> if I got my hand on their word file named "passwords.doc"
[18:48:48] <Moonlightning> Everyone FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT.
[18:48:53] <Moonlightning> Half the channel ditched Canternet.
[18:48:58] <AppleDash> I think one person flipped the fuck out.
[18:49:00] <Dusk> Yes because those weren't my logs.
[18:49:02] <Moonlightning> And the file in question was actually public!
[18:49:04] <Dusk> and one person freaked out
[18:49:08] <AppleDash> We ditched Canternet because ev eryone was friends with that person
[18:49:10] <Dusk> the file was 'public'
[18:49:12] <AppleDash> And followed thenm
[18:49:13] <Colgate> Dusk: more than one

[18:49:41] <AppleDash> OK
[18:49:43] <Moonlightning> EVERYTHING you store that Windows can access, they can.
[18:49:47] <Dusk> Moonlightning: You're making a point that doesn't matter to me
[18:49:48] <Colgate> I can name at least 4 people who had a major problem with it
[18:49:48] <Moonlightning> And you're saying no one is going to flip out.
[18:49:50] <AppleDash> If Bill Gates wants to fap to my vore RPs

[18:49:57] <Rylee> Dusk: woo hoo glad you don't care
[18:49:57] <Dusk> XD
[18:50:05] <Dusk> Rylee: \o/
[18:50:13] <Rylee> then why do you care so much about people who do not being able to express that this is a colossal fuck-up?
[18:50:26] <Dusk> I'm just trying to say it's not as overblown as you might think and that clause has actual purpose

[18:51:11] <Moonlightning> I'm just waving around a big red flag.
[18:51:23] * Dusk shrugs
[18:51:25] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[18:51:34] <Moonlightning> Because that's what you do when something very obviously bad happens. You wave a red flag.
[18:51:38] <Moonlightning> You warn people.
[18:51:45] <Dusk> Not much point in trying to make you understand that they probably have agreements with government authorities
[18:52:01] <Moonlightning> This is more than that.
[18:52:02] <Dusk> And that's the driving force behind them wanting to have this clause
[18:52:04] <Topkasa> I never said you were, but it was an easy impression to get
[18:52:23] <Dusk> Topkasa: Exactly
[18:52:24] <Moonlightning> They're not saying they will collect anything when requested by law enforcement.
[18:52:35] <Moonlightning> They're saying they will collect anything //at their own discretion//
[18:52:40] <Dusk> I'm not particularly saying that Microsoft isn't wrong for doing it
[18:52:42] <Colgate> Dusk: that makes me want it less
[18:52:42] <Dusk> however
[18:52:49] <Dusk> Then don't use it!
[18:52:54] <Moonlightning> I won't.
[18:52:57] <Dusk> Colgate: you use linux anyhow
[18:52:59] <Dusk> :T
[18:53:02] <Moonlightning> I'm warning others who may also not want to, because of this.
[18:53:06] <Colgate> Dusk: I use windows as well at work
[18:53:26] <Dusk> And?
[18:53:33] <Dusk> they're probably not gonna jump to 10
[18:53:40] <Colgate> hey, that makes me wonder
[18:53:47] <Colgate> is this hippa compliant?
[18:53:52] <Moonlightning> I hope it isn't!
[18:54:00] <Topkasa> I'd expect the Enterprise version can be made so
[18:54:00] <Colgate> do we need to get a hipaa agreement iwth MS to use w10?
[18:54:12] <Moonlightning> You mean, to use Windows at all.
[18:54:25] <Colgate> w7 doesn't share data :P
[18:54:26] <Moonlightning> General privacy policy -> applies to all Windows versions
[18:54:31] <Colgate> no it does not
[18:54:52] <Colgate> if you read the terms of w7 EULA like I just did 30 min ago, you would know this
[18:54:53] <Rylee> Dusk: so you're okay with that ... ?
[18:55:03] <Dusk> Rylee: I've already been compromised ^.^
[18:55:08] <Rylee> good for you
[18:55:13] <Colgate> it says that if there is a specific EULA for a service, that oen overrides the general
[18:55:20] <Colgate> w7 has a specific, the general doesn't apply
[18:55:23] <Rylee> so your view is "so everyone else should be too, since I just don't care!"
[18:55:26] <Dusk> Nope
[18:55:45] <Dusk> I'm just saying that he's running around screaming to the top of his lungs when calmly laying the things places is a better approach
[18:56:05] <Rylee> yeah because that's always worked before
[18:56:11] *** Unixkitty is now known as Awaykitty
[18:56:17] <Dusk> His current approach isn't doing any better
[18:56:34] <Dusk> Running around with his head cut off and panicking isn't helping at all
[18:56:46] <Dusk> Informing people and stuff is fine, because it's useful knowledge
[18:56:55] <Dusk> People really should read this shit sometime
[18:57:06] <Dusk> Instead of hitting "I agree" but there's the laziness factor
[18:57:23] <Moonlightning> I think riding a horse through the towns going “THE BRITISH ARE COMING, THE BRITISH ARE COMING” is a better approach than ““calmly laying the things places””
[18:57:33] <Dusk> Good for you!
[18:57:33] <Gigabit> Well I rather swap to linux full time and not be able to play all my games I like, (do so later on with a bigger SSD)
[18:57:49] <Dusk> I'm gonna sit over here and enjoy my Twin Titan Xs and DX12
[18:57:50] <Moonlightning> Dusk: also: companies should write an accurate TL;DR instead of hiding information from us in legalese. :V
[18:57:55] <Dusk> XD
[18:57:59] <Dusk> Yea I agree
[18:58:24] <Gigabit> [12:55] <~Gigabit> Okay now help me, which linux distro?
[18:58:24] <Gigabit> [12:55] <~Gigabit> I wanna learn linux but not fight everything
[18:58:24] <Gigabit> [12:56] <~Gigabit> It needs to be fast, but also easyish to navigate, and stuff

[18:59:13] <Dusk> I primarily use debian stuff and practically nothing else so I'm a bit biased towards that

[18:59:46] <Moonlightning> Utopic unfortunately /just/ lost support. :(
[19:00:00] <Dusk> Trusty Tahr is the current LTS
[19:00:18] <Moonlightning> Vivid Vervet is the latest (short-term-support) release
[19:00:30] <init3> Mint is Ubuntu based though. 
[19:00:32] <Gigabit> so 14.04.2 then eh?
[19:00:37] <Dusk> mhm
[19:00:41] <init3> I rather like mint personally. 
[19:01:02] <init3> Though Arch is my fav, it is not for beginners. 
[19:01:17] <init3> They even say that on their FAQ
[19:01:19] <Gigabit> fuck it, I'm going full tinfoil hat, bye bye windows for a while

[19:01:49] <init3> As much as I like linux
[19:02:15] <Gigabit> Well.. when I get a larger SSD I will dual boot just to mess around in winders
[19:02:34] <init3> If you are learning and you want to be able to break your computer and still have a working OS to fall back on. 
[19:02:46] <init3> I mean, if you have a second computer, go for it.

[19:17:57] <init3> I think anyone who is comfortable with tweaking and do-it-yourself type linux would like it. 
[19:18:24] <init3> And if you are comfortable with the fact that updates will break it.
[19:19:00] <init3> Very rarely, but it happens and it's powted about on the homepage and has for me always been a super quick fix. 
[19:21:21] <Gigaway> Well I can always make a backup of the OS in case something goes wrong
[19:21:50] <init3> I meant Arch specifically in responst to what Dusk said. 
[19:22:16] <init3> Arch is kind of considered a hard more distro. 
[19:22:20] <init3> *hard mode
[19:22:43] <Colgate> it is a good intermediate distro for learning
[19:22:58] <init3> I mean, it isn't slackware or that shit. 
[19:23:14] <init3> I just think for an absolute beginner it is a bit much. 
[19:23:22] <Colgate> probably
[19:23:35] <Topkasa> my first *nix experienc was arch...
[19:24:01] <Colgate> mine was ubuntu, 6.04? 6.10? one of those
[19:24:05] <init3> Would you recommend that route Topkasa? My first was mandrake. I may be dating myself a bit lol. 
[19:24:13] <Topkasa> installed it on an old pentium and set up an irc server on it for kicks
[19:24:20] <Topkasa> ah, I'm probably not the person to ask for *nix advice
[19:24:38] <init3> Well I mean for someone to learn it I mean. 
[19:25:00] <Topkasa> honestly, maybe debian?  I use that primarily and it's easy enough to either A) figure out on your own or B) get help for
[19:25:00] <Moonlightning> /) Topkasa

[19:25:07] *** Topkasa is now known as Sukasa
[19:25:09] <Moonlightning> I installed CrunchBang on an old box and set up an IRC server on it!
[19:25:22] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> bak for now, i'm taking a break
[19:25:39] <Moonlightning> DJ-C0L7[CSS]: you hear about the Microsoft privacy policy of this Saturday?
[19:25:41] <Sukasa> 96 MBytes of RAM
[19:25:52] <Sukasa> 200Mhz P1 with MMX
[19:26:02] <Sukasa> and meanwhile my laptop was an 800Mhz budget amd
[19:26:12] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> what'd microsoft do this time?
[19:26:15] <init3> Heh
[19:26:29] <Moonlightning> DJ-C0L7[CSS]: allowed themselves to pull literally any data off of any mounted filesystem
[19:26:31] <Sukasa> basically, took your bog-standard mobile phone privacy policy and stuck a windows logo on it
[19:26:42] * DJ-C0L7[CSS] facehooves
[19:26:45] <init3> I think my Mandrake install was on a P2 200mhx too. A Compaq iirc. 
[19:27:22] <init3> (I don't mean Mandriva by the by)
[19:27:45] <init3> Maybe 2002 I think? 2003?
[19:28:12] <Sukasa> and now most of my *nix experience just goes into setting up VMs at the makerspace, keeping pfSense alive, and managing a gitlab server and a minecraft sever
[19:28:15] * Sukasa shrugs
[19:29:14] <init3> Hey, the most useful *nix knowledge comes from maintaing something prod, no matter how small the user base. 
[19:29:25] <Sukasa> mm
[19:29:38] <Sukasa> for a while I even managed IRC integration...  using bash and netcat
[19:29:42] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i'm a bit impressed and slightly scared O_o the slack that was in my timing chain when i installed it
[19:29:46] <Sukasa> it was...  flaky at the best of times
[19:29:50] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> o_o there is no slack at all in the chain now
[19:30:18] <init3> I think my first "prod" linux thing was a CentOS server running UT2004 for my Computer Networking class. 
[19:30:20] <Moonlightning> Sukasa: you should talk to AppleDash
[19:30:33] <AppleDash> :D

[19:30:33] <Sukasa> tl;dr an IRC bridge on my windows machine fired strings at it, the bash script pulled the string, figured out which minecraft instance it was meant to go to
[19:30:37] <Sukasa> and then stuffed that into screen
[19:30:45] <init3> Nifty
[19:30:57] <Sukasa> and also did the reverse, pulled from the logs, spat it through the same netcat session, and the bridge would translate it to irc
[19:31:11] <init3> Super nifty
[19:31:17] <Sukasa> unfortunately it had a bad habit of just dropping the connection between netcat and the irc bridge :/
[19:31:35] <init3> Hmm
[19:31:55] <Sukasa> also did various backup scripts that would compress the server instances to .tar.gz files
[19:32:13] <Sukasa> er, .tar
[19:32:24] <Sukasa> and then a scheduled task on my desktop would pull those off, delta-compress them against the previous backups, and store them all to disk
[19:33:09] <init3> That's quite the project for babby's first *nix. 
[19:33:15] <Sukasa> that wasn't babby's first
[19:33:28] <Sukasa> managed to get a pretty tight compression ratio..  I'd have to check but I think I managed to bring a 2-3GB tarball down to 2-3mb
[19:33:33] <Sukasa> on average
[19:33:35] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> FFS google reccommendations for searches >.<
[19:33:56] <Sukasa> <3 xdelta3

[19:34:04] <Sukasa> and a coupl little .exe's to automate it all
[19:34:06] <init3> Oh, I got you and someone else confused I guess. Someone said their first linux was setting up minecraft. 
[19:34:11] <Sukasa> ah no
[19:34:13] <Sukasa> my first was IRC
[19:34:17] <init3> Right
[19:34:20] <Sukasa> set up the irc server on arch:P
[19:34:25] <init3> Yeah.

[19:34:47] <Sukasa> tl;dr 16 year old with no idea what he's doing managed to not explode eveyrthing
[19:34:50] <init3> I'm cramming to learn some perl before my interview this afternoon and on irc lol. 
[19:34:53] <Sukasa> mm
[19:35:19] <Sukasa> eventually that server died because of drama and got repurposed into a gitlab machine for the makerspace
[19:35:26] <Sukasa> I should maybe see if I can pull my old scripts off it
[19:35:56] <init3> I do like Perl. Is a pretty nice language so far. 
[19:36:07] <Sukasa> other hilarity: due to a screwup in one revision of a script, there were thousands of queued errors and crash reports from bash
[19:36:13] <init3> Plus cpan is lazy mode extreme. 
[19:36:22] <Sukasa> while installing gitlab, I installed postfix...  which started sending them to the makerspace' mailgun account
[19:36:32] <Sukasa> cue the better tech guy asking me what all these minecraft crash reports were about
[19:36:39] <init3> Hue
[19:36:50] <Sukasa> "oh, only a few years' worth of crash reports."
[19:37:00] <Sukasa> "shouldn't take too long to get through them all"
[19:37:27] <Sukasa> this being the same place I had to deal with a broadcast storm caused by a switch..  with only one cable plugged into it

[19:42:16] <Sukasa> also, Squid is Fun to set up
[19:42:41] <init3> It is.
[19:42:49] <init3> Ever set up SSLbump?
[19:42:49] <Sukasa> tried to set it up as a "content-cache" proxy so that we can get multiple port 80 webservers at the makerspace
[19:42:58] <Sukasa> and it turned into a PITA over a couple weeks
[19:43:21] <Sukasa> first I fucked up and forgot to uncomment the line that blocked HTTP CONNECT
[19:43:33] <Sukasa> and then because it was returning error pages instead of TCP resets
[19:43:36] <init3> I mean for a  general use lab it'd be bad but for adblocking at my house it was cool.
[19:43:45] <Sukasa> some chinese IP started hammering it with requests
[19:43:48] <init3> Since most shit is HTTPS now. 
[19:43:49] <Sukasa> which it was constantly denying
[19:43:56] <Sukasa> and filling our upstream
[19:44:06] <Sukasa> haven't heard of that
[19:44:09] <Sukasa> will have to look into it
[19:44:43] *** Joins: DarkFair (IceChat9@Pony-i760bk.stlsmo.sbcglobal.net)
[19:44:46] <init3> I mean you need to generate a cert chain and import your own CA into every client. 
[19:44:52] <init3> Which is good really. 
[19:45:01] <Sukasa> mm
[19:45:05] *** DarkFair is now known as Pony_22094
[19:45:13] <init3> But squid will generate a cert on the fly. 
[19:45:30] <init3> And effectively MiTM SSL. 
[19:45:47] <Sukasa> mm
[19:45:49] <Sukasa> might be useful though
[19:45:57] <init3> It can be. 
[19:45:58] <Sukasa> would be a good way to be able to handle https traffic through it
[19:46:16] <Sukasa> right now https traffic just gets blocked at the firewall
[19:46:21] <Sukasa> but having https to the git server would be nice
[19:46:25] <init3> My goal was adblocking and I found it too much of a pain though. 
[19:46:38] <init3> So I just did DNS blocks. 
[19:46:42] <Sukasa> hell, we probably just need to get a decent "CA" chain anyways
[19:46:51] <init3> Right
[19:46:51] <Sukasa> SSL errors with the router/etc already since it's self-signed
[19:47:21] <init3> Well you make a self-signed CA and you don't have to worry about cert errors on anything anymore. 
[19:47:29] <init3> If you import it to all workstations. 
[19:47:31] <Sukasa> mmhmm
[19:49:08] <Sukasa> and/or distribute it('s public component) to the other makers/IT people
[19:50:03] <init3> Right. I think doing it is a good lesson in trust chains too. 
[19:50:17] <Colgate> why not just make a super wildcard cert? make it valid for * *.* *.*.* *.*.*.* etc.
[19:50:55] <Colgate> and then import that, no need to generate certs all the time that way
[19:50:59] <init3> I think you /can/ do that but then you'd have the same encryption from internal client to server for everything. 
[19:51:20] <init3> Squid does it automatically so you get a new encryption for every site. 
[19:51:28] <Colgate> uh, what?
[19:51:42] <init3> I'm talking about SSLbump
[19:51:50] <init3> With squid. 
[19:51:55] <Colgate> I don't understand what you mean by "the same encryption"
[19:52:11] <init3> Well, the same keys. 
[19:52:23] <init3> I guess it isn't a huge deal, but it is bad practice. 
[19:52:25] <Colgate> sure? why is that an issue
[19:52:34] <init3> And I can see some browsers rejecting it. 
[19:52:45] <init3> As an invalid cert. 
[19:52:51] <Colgate> but it is valid
[19:53:02] <init3> Yes
[19:53:03] <Colgate> if a browser rejects it, that browser is wrong
[19:53:16] <init3> I suppose. 
[19:53:24] <Sukasa> forgive me for the question if it's dumb, but based on what little I know, woudln't it be more prudent to have a cert to be at most for *.makerspacedomain.org ?
[19:53:39] <init3> I'd say so. 
[19:53:57] <Colgate> Sukasa: no, because you also want to proxy https://google.com/ and that cert wouldn't match that
[19:53:57] <PinkiePieBot> [ Google ]
[19:54:03] <Sukasa> I wouldn't want to do that
[19:54:09] <Colgate> presumably you want to proxy everything
[19:54:15] <Sukasa> the Squid server is strictly for WAN-side requests hitting us on 443 and 80
[19:54:16] <init3> That's what the point of SSLbump though. 
[19:54:23] <Sukasa> and being redirected to internal webservers
[19:54:23] <init3> oooohhh
[19:54:31] <init3> It's a reverse proxy then.
[19:54:31] <Colgate> oh, other way around
[19:54:36] <init3> Then yeah. 
[19:54:43] <Colgate> I was thinking of an outgoing http proxy
[19:54:47] <init3> Me too
[19:55:08] <init3> I don't think SSLbump is needed for that. 
[19:55:24] <Sukasa> http://git.makerspacenanaimo.org/ and http://data.makerspacenanaimo.org/data.asmx/GetData are both separate servers that do different things
[19:55:33] <Sukasa> but they're both acessed on the same ip/port from the outside
[19:55:35] <init3> Because you can use the actual cert, you aren't trying to MiTM a legit SSL session. 
[19:55:44] <Sukasa> mm
[19:56:01] <init3> Which is what SSLBump does. 
[19:56:04] <Colgate> a wildcard or a cert with a bunch of SANs for each one, either will work
[19:57:01] <init3> If it's a reverse proxy though you might want to just buy a wildcard cert so it'd not give an error from the outside at all but I dunno. 
[19:57:09] <init3> Those usually aren't super cheap. 
[19:57:13] <Sukasa> mm
[19:57:25] <Sukasa> generally any https data from the outside would be coming from members anyways
[19:57:34] <init3> Actually, wait, isn't there a place you can get a free cert?
[19:57:45] <init3> I know there is, I can't remember the name of it. 
[19:58:06] <Colgate> you can get a cert that is trusted by most OS's default isntalls for free
[19:58:13] <Colgate> though it won't be a wildcard
[19:58:24] <Colgate> startssl and wosign come to mind
[19:58:36] <init3> startssl is what I was thinking of. 
[19:59:00] <Colgate> letsencrypt should be launching this fall
[19:59:16] <Sukasa> mm
[19:59:21] <init3> Same type of thing or something different?
[19:59:22] <Sukasa> startssl is $60USD for a wildcart cert
[19:59:45] <Colgate> you won't be getting a wildcard cert that is trusted by the majority for free
[19:59:50] <Colgate> not atm at least
[19:59:58] <Sukasa> yeah I don't think that'll ever happen
[19:59:58] <Colgate> letsencrypt might do that later
[19:59:59] <init3> I've seen them go for $200, so that's not bad but isn't cheap. 
[20:00:20] <Gigaway> Bah, just sleep around and you can Colgate. :p
[20:00:45] <init3> Don't look at the prices for EV wildcards. *shudder*
[20:00:47] <Sukasa> I'm still not convinced that spending the money is the right choice versus creating our own root CA and handing that cert out to members - the scope it'd apply to isn't really large enough to justify it, I don't think
[20:00:49] <Colgate> wosign lets you have like 100 SANs on your cert though
[20:01:08] <Colgate> so it almost might as well be a wildcard
[20:01:24] <init3> It really depends on how many CNs you are going to have. 
[20:01:30] <Colgate> 1?
[20:01:39] <Colgate> you can only have 1 CN :P
[20:01:57] <Colgate> also, most browsers don't even check CN anymore
[20:02:02] <init3> Maybe I'm thinking of somerthing else. 
[20:02:14] <init3> I dunno, server names I mean. 
[20:02:17] <Colgate> SAN
[20:02:27] <Colgate> SubjectALternativeName
[20:02:37] <Sukasa> mm
[20:02:40] <init3> When did that change?
[20:02:49] <Sukasa> well, even from within the space the URL/server name doesn't change, so..
[20:02:54] <Colgate> the SAN extension was added over a decade ago
[20:02:59] <Colgate> maybe longer
[20:03:20] <init3> I know it existed but I seem to remember using CNs on my web servers. 
[20:03:27] <Sukasa> 16-17 years ago going by the date on that page?

[20:03:59] <Colgate> when did browsers stop using CN to validate certs? dunno
[20:04:18] <Colgate> but I noticed that FF didn't like my cert when it had the domain name in the CN
[20:04:48] <init3> I don't feel like booting my server to look at how I have those certs setup. 
[20:05:11] <init3> But I beleve y'all. I just wonder why CN sticks out in my head. 
[20:06:50] <init3> This seems to say CN is the thing https://www.geocerts.com/ssl/understanding_authentication but it does look like it's probably old. 
[20:06:51] <PinkiePieBot> [ Understanding SSL Certificate Authentication ]
[20:09:57] <init3> I dunno, I think CN may still be the default thing that's used. YOu positive it isn't Colgate?   Look at: http://imgur.com/5TbqGlX
[20:09:58] <PinkiePieBot> [ snapshot4.png - Imgur ]
[20:10:47] <init3> SAN is in there too, but it's under the Public Key infor section and labled "not critical"
[20:11:01] <Colgate> check the cert, it also has SAN
[20:11:41] <Colgate> "Not critical" is just telling whatever is parsing the cert that if it doesn't understand that extension, it is fine and to continue to validate the cert anyways
[20:12:23] <Colgate> if it is Critical and the parser doesn't udnerstand it, the parser should throw an invalid cert error
[20:12:42] <init3> Wouldn't that mean CN is the primary field that's used?
[20:12:54] <Colgate> on older parsers, yes
[20:13:01] <Colgate> that's how it was before SAN came aaround
[20:13:06] <Colgate> but that's deprecated
[20:13:22] <Colgate> FF won't parse CN if a SAN is present
[20:13:36] <init3> Ahh. 
[20:13:54] <init3> Oh, I see why I'm thinking that. 
[20:14:01] <init3> Because CN is still used to make CSRs

[22:05:57] <wolfyshy> that is not how fstab works.... you want 0 and 2
[22:06:06] <wolfyshy> the first number is 0/1 for whether to use it as a dump disk for panics (no)
[22:06:19] <wolfyshy> and the second number is the ordering for fsck; external disks almost always are 2
[22:07:02] <wolfyshy> also you need to have 'defaults' for options
[22:07:19] <wolfyshy> UUID=guidhere-1234-5678-etcetcetc /home/data ntfs-3g defaults 0 2
[22:08:33] <Gigaway> okay so this is telling it the partition, the mount point, the file type and what else?
[22:08:47] <wolfyshy> 'defaults' is the mount options
[22:08:53] <wolfyshy> defaults is obviously just using the defaults
[22:09:05] <wolfyshy> you can do other stuff with the same syntax as -o
