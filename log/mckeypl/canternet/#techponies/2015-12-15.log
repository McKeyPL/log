[00:29:06] <init3> Who was I talking to in here about my boss saying he wanted to move our 70/30 linux/windows shop to 100% Windows?
[00:31:22] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> prepair for chaos
[00:31:31] <JustAberrant> hehe
[00:31:37] <init3> Well long story short I inadvertently got him to admit that makes no sense and to start playing with Linux at home. 
[00:31:47] <JustAberrant> even as someone who generally hates windows, may not be all bad ;p
[00:31:58] <JustAberrant> depends on what your business does
[00:32:21] <init3> Online software development and data aggregation. 
[00:32:49] <JustAberrant> so not a lot of office drones using word and outlook then?
[00:33:33] <JustAberrant> in which case it probably makes the most sense to stick with whatever platform works best with your toolstack ;p
[00:33:58] <init3> No, there are. Our workstations are all Windows. We have Windows domain controllers are whatnot. 
[00:34:03] <JustAberrant> if the bulk of your software is c++ and has been running on linux targets forever, then switching to windows is gonna be absolutely pain
[00:34:11] <init3> But our applications are Tomcat 
[00:34:13] <init3> java
[00:34:18] <JustAberrant> if it's java, it matters a lot less
[00:34:22] <init3> Right
[00:34:24] <Stik> tomcat runs very well under windows
[00:34:35] <JustAberrant> especially if it's an app server and you don't have a tonne of shell scripts/environment crap ;p
[00:35:12] <JustAberrant> hehe yeah, sorry, but going all windows might not be a terrible plan ;p
[00:35:28] <init3> I don't mind utilizing windows a bit more, but I think that it makes no sense to spend the time (and license) on a windows file server when samba can integrate into AD for example.  
[00:35:41] <init3> and already is
[00:35:51] <JustAberrant> well the question to ask is "why"
[00:36:05] <JustAberrant> and then fight it with metrics
[00:36:11] <JustAberrant> (or prove his point with them)
[00:36:27] <JustAberrant> I suspect he didn't wake up one day and go "lets spend money for the hell of it"
[00:36:35] <JustAberrant> there's probably something driving the initial desire
[00:36:47] <JustAberrant> some perceived savings or capability
[00:37:06] <init3> Well he just started a month ago. Let me put it this way: My boss is a MS partner himself, has a surfacebook and a fucking windows phone. 
[00:37:38] <init3> Fully admits to being a windows fanboy (I've never met one in the wild before)
[00:37:43] <JustAberrant> hehe, well that's good then, but at the same time "cause it's what the higher up is comfortable with" is often reason enough ;p
[00:38:17] <init3> Well I don't think he'd be able to convince /his/ bosses to spend the money on winderps. 
[00:38:50] <init3> Not without one of the systems engineers bringing a lot of hard data that I simply don't think exists. 
[00:38:59] <init3> I unno

[00:39:28] <JustAberrant> hehe, well, spending money to gain nothing is a hard sell, but it can be done
[00:39:37] <JustAberrant> see: anyone that's paid for IBM products
[00:39:52] <init3> Though they are probably making all our java devs move to .NET so obviously we'll be using Windows a lot more than currently. 
[00:40:14] <init3> But some things just /should/ be Linux. 
[00:41:18] <JustAberrant> it's becoming a harder sell, because much as I hate to admit it, windows does do enterprise better in a lot of ways
[00:41:21] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you can run .net in linux, there is a toolkit for that from M$
[00:41:28] <JustAberrant> in particular mass deployment
[00:41:54] <JustAberrant> to get to the same place with Linux takes a lot more effort, especially if your talking workstations and not servers

[00:42:10] <init3> Like we are pulling all our web/app servers from being directly accessable from the internet. We came up with the idea of having redundant nginx reverse proxy servers instead of running tomcat/apache on every container. 
[00:42:47] <JustAberrant> also I have to go make supper ;p
[00:43:00] <init3> We use MS AD for workstations
[00:43:04] <init3> Ok later. 
[00:43:07] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> afk looks like i'll be calling 2 tow trucks
[00:43:13] <init3> wat
[00:43:26] <init3> Did the first tow truck die?
[00:43:40] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> we have two people parked blocking a 3rd in

[00:44:28] <init3> Oh
[00:44:36] <init3> Tow the douchebags
[00:45:07] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> as i said, looks like i'll be calling two tow trucks here in a minute if they dont move their vehicles, i've already notified the foreman
[00:45:20] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'm giving them 5 minutes

[20:17:00] <Quindo> continually freezing in the command line, ect.
[20:17:36] <Colgate> is it a dedi or vps?
[20:17:52] <Quindo> It keeps on going into a ISE500 when we have not even deployed production code to it.  Dedi
[20:18:00] <Quindo> We pay another company for our servers.
[20:18:10] <Colgate> ISE500?
[20:18:26] <Quindo> Internal Server Error 500
[20:21:24] <johnsey> dedicated? load average?
[20:22:35] <Quindo> welp, can not check cause it is down again.  XP
[20:22:52] <Quindo> though it might be cause the tech took it down to do tests or something.
[20:29:31] <Quindo> evidently it is an issue with the raid controller, so they are replacing it.

[23:02:39] <Colgate> you know what would be really nice of steam?
[23:02:47] <Colgate> an easy way to backup your pivate key for 2fa
[23:03:09] <Colgate> how hard is *that* to get right?
[23:03:34] <Colgate> surprise valve! hardware dies! I want to back it up!
[23:03:43] <Colgate> or have multiple devices with the same auth key
[23:03:56] <Sour_Sweet> You get a recovery key
[23:04:17] <Colgate> still doesn't solve my last line
[23:04:18] <Sour_Sweet> I think even the Google Auth app doesn't support backups
[23:04:37] <Colgate> I have a tablet and a phone, I want both to be able to unlock it
[23:04:42] <Colgate> is that too much to ask?
[23:05:03] <Sour_Sweet> Can't you just login on both devices?
[23:05:20] <Sour_Sweet> (in the Steam Mobile App)
[23:05:47] <Sour_Sweet> Never checked that, but I expected it would display the 2FA on all devices for that account

[23:06:37] <Colgate> Sour_Sweet: no, it won't allow you, says another device is already linked
[23:07:02] <Sour_Sweet> That's dumb
[23:07:09] <Colgate> yup
[23:07:24] <Sour_Sweet> You could use e-mail auth I guess though
[23:07:36] <Colgate> that's not really 2fa
[23:09:07] <Colgate> google authenticator doesn't let you export either
[23:09:10] *** Kyoro is now known as Pocky
[23:09:11] <Colgate> wth, why the hell not?
[23:09:50] <Sour_Sweet> I'm pretty sure they let you remove the 2fa if you prove access to the e-mail that's connected with steam. Will take a day or two
[23:10:13] <Sour_Sweet> So 2FA as far as Steam goes only is another barrier
[23:12:21] <Colgate> I don't want to remove it?
[23:12:34] <Colgate> I just want multiple devices able to have the same unlock code
[23:13:26] <Colgate> I mean, I can do that anyways since I own my devices and have root(and I do do this), it is just stupid that it isn't easier
[23:13:30] <Sour_Sweet> No I meant in case somebody gets access to your password
[23:13:51] <Sour_Sweet> (which hopefully is not the same as the one on your mail account :P)
[23:13:58] <Colgate> honestly, I don't care about my steam account at all
[23:14:09] <Colgate> there is literally nothing someone can do to that that would hurt me
[23:14:26] <Sour_Sweet> VAC bans suck
[23:14:34] <Colgate> only if you play on public servers
[23:14:48] <Colgate> I only ever play on private servers with people I know
[23:15:55] <Sour_Sweet> Having your account VAC flagged would suck non the less. It removes trading for some games, it will hurt your reputation ...
[23:16:18] <Colgate> my reputation? with who? :P
[23:16:22] <Sour_Sweet> Some games will lock you out of multiplayer completely (e.g. CoD)
[23:16:48] <Colgate> CoD doesn't even allow you to host your own servers iirc
[23:17:17] <Sour_Sweet> It doesn't have servers, but still uses VAC
[23:17:33] <Sour_Sweet> Well the first part depends on the version though
[23:18:11] <Sour_Sweet> The later is true for any modern CoD (>4 or WaW)
[23:18:23] <Colgate> sounds like a game I don't want to support then
[23:18:37] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah it's pretty bad
[23:18:39] <Colgate> in fact, unless that was in the EULA, I would sue
[23:19:25] <Colgate> class action that shit, they broke their agreement
[23:19:52] <Sour_Sweet> Good luck
[23:20:36] <Colgate> pssh, they would probably ssettle
[23:20:56] <Colgate> they wouldn't want to go to court, would cost too much
[23:21:14] <Sour_Sweet> I don't know of any success attempt in the EU and it's not like they didn't try
[23:21:29] <Sour_Sweet> successful*
[23:22:12] <Sour_Sweet> The only thing they did achieve is steam refunds
[23:22:38] <Unixkitty> Who are you guys suing? I'm trying to read the conversation, but still not following
[23:23:08] <Sour_Sweet> Which was established by VALVe because local law would have forced them anyway and pro consumer ngos were preparing to sue them
[23:23:20] <Sour_Sweet> Unixkitty: VALVe / Steam
[23:23:43] <Unixkitty> What did they do?
[23:24:03] <Sour_Sweet> It's a theoretical discussion
[23:24:11] <Colgate> blocked access to a prgram's advertised features for reasons not mentioned in the EULA
[23:24:19] <Colgate> that you purchased the rights to use
[23:25:57] <Unixkitty> Aren't purchases in Steam "subscriptions"?
[23:26:12] <Colgate> still bound by the EULA
[23:27:05] <HoneyDrops> I still don't see how VAC flies, it's spyware as far as I'm concerned.
[23:27:21] <Unixkitty> Makes me wonder why I never read it properly
[23:28:04] <Colgate> when valve goes under, there's gonna be a lot of angry people XD
[23:28:05] <Sour_Sweet> More interesting imho is if they are legally allowed to VAC ban you in case of an obviously hijacked account
[23:28:41] <Sour_Sweet> I have doubts
[23:29:20] <HoneyDrops> I'm pretty sure they have a blanket "we can terminate this at any time for any reason" clause to cover that.
[23:29:50] <Sour_Sweet> Which is probably invalid under German/EU law
[23:31:34] <Sour_Sweet> I never had any of my accounts flagged. I actually support the zero tolerance policy, but that doesn't mean there are no edge cases
[23:32:17] <HoneyDrops> I don't see it as being Valve's place to police.
[23:32:50] <Colgate> each game company should do it themselves
[23:33:04] <Colgate> it is their game, valve is just a distributor
[23:33:18] <Sour_Sweet> Well they don't. It's a game devs choice to use VAC and how to handle bans after all
[23:34:06] <Unixkitty> I have my account flagged, but beyond some kids in multiplayer fps games pointing it out for their reasons, it doesn't really affect anything in any way
[23:34:17] <HoneyDrops> I wouldn't even say it's the game companies' place to police cheating -- it's the server admin.  Game companies should, however, design and code the game to mitigate potential cheats.
[23:34:40] <Unixkitty> Besides the game in question being locked that is of course
[23:35:10] <Gigabit> aparently I have a microsoft cert and did not know it
[23:35:23] <Colgate> HoneyDrops: each game could have a digitally signed key by the game company
[23:35:33] <Colgate> then just check the public key, bam
[23:35:34] <Unixkitty> And what if there are no "server admins" and multiplayer is p2p with dynamic hosts?
[23:35:36] <johnsey> Gigabit: quick, burn it before anybody notices!
[23:36:01] <Gigabit> x.x
[23:36:22] <HoneyDrops> Unixkitty: example?  In that case don't lets peers join you don't already trust.
[23:36:37] <Sour_Sweet> CoD
[23:36:45] <Unixkitty> ^
[23:37:08] <Sour_Sweet> GTA:O, but that doesn't use VAC
[23:37:28] <Sour_Sweet> p2p bullshit is more common than dedicated servers these days
[23:37:33] <HoneyDrops> The only way to be 100% sure you're not playing with cheaters is play singleplayer.  Barring that, play only with people you trust.  If you play with random peons, assume and accept cheating as a given.
[23:37:58] <Unixkitty> Or "trust in the system"
[23:41:22] <HoneyDrops> The problem with VAC is that Valve, nor game companies should be monitoring a system they do not own.
[23:43:44] <Unixkitty> You do realize that companies willingly sign agreements for Valve to do that, right?
[23:44:44] *** Quits: Melanosuchus (quassel@Pony-dm40vd.as13285.net) (Connection closed)
[23:47:55] <Colgate> ban by peer ID or something
[23:48:17] <Unixkitty> "peer ID"?
[23:48:38] <Colgate> an ID unique to each license of the game
