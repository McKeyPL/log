[20:59:44] <wolfyshy> isn't there
[20:59:47] <AppleDash> lol
[21:00:02] <wolfyshy> catalyst is the name of the script that gentoo uses to make their isos
[21:00:13] <wolfyshy> AppleDash: it doesn't.
[21:00:19] <wolfyshy> AppleDash: the BIOS does not support Windows
[21:00:23] <AppleDash> what
[21:00:28] <AppleDash> what
[21:00:34] <wolfyshy> I have like the only computer ever made that does not support Windows
[21:00:46] <wolfyshy> win7 won't install, win8 won't boot, win10 won't boot
[21:00:53] <wolfyshy> win8 and win10 triple fault in early boot
[21:01:00] <AppleDash> Windows XP it is, then
[21:01:08] <wolfyshy> lol I have a Haswell
[21:01:10] <AppleDash> Isn't there some janky-ass windows XP 64 bit edition?
[21:01:12] <wolfyshy> I don't think XP can even boot on it
[21:01:17] <wolfyshy> yes it's based on windows server 2003
[21:01:19] <AppleDash> lol
[21:01:21] <wolfyshy> but with the client experience pack
[21:01:53] <wolfyshy> if windows vista/7 won't detect any of its components, I don't think xp/2003 have a chance
[21:02:07] <AppleDash> Try Windows Server 08
[21:02:10] <AppleDash> If that fails, 2012
[21:02:19] <wolfyshy> I tried 2008 R2
[21:02:24] <AppleDash> :(
[21:02:38] <wolfyshy> I don't think anything is going to be different between the bootloaders of win8/10 and ws2012
[21:02:43] <Selina> I don't recommend the 64 bit XP as no one should
[21:03:09] <wolfyshy> Selina: I ran 64-bit XP back when it was the only 64-bit client OS Microsoft had, believe me I know it's awful :P
[21:03:21] <wolfyshy> oh that's who you are
[21:03:23] <wolfyshy> hi there o/
[21:04:19] <Selina> Hi wolfy
[21:04:35] <Selina> I also used 64bit XP when my high school still did
[21:04:37] <Selina> it was awful.
