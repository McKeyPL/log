[01:13:49] <JustAberrant> situation on linux is improving, but still not there
[01:14:58] <Webster> I installed Linux on my new desktop and the sound didn't work. It was like I went back in time a decade or two. May try again later.
[01:15:09] <Gigabit> Seoson: I used my 7 key to install a while ago
[01:15:24] <Webster> Which annoyed me more since Windows 10 has not been totally stable for me either.
[01:15:24] <Seoson> I had SteamOS on dualboot for some time and I do still have Ubuntu on my HDD. It's not like wouldn't want to use Linux for gaming, but as of now I couldn't switch completely

[09:27:07] <Finwe> Yes, Fine Manual.
[09:27:10] <Moonlightning> I need to do that anyway.
[09:27:17] <Dashie> for example, we use /usr/local/ for stuff installed from Ports
[09:27:25] <Dashie> it keeps the base system clean and free from clutter
[09:27:28] <Dashie> and prevents nasty conflicts.l
[09:29:08] <Dashie> it's a dirty trick, but if you wanted to quickly revert your system and remove everything you've installed, rm -rf /usr/local will do the job. I wouldnt reccomend it though x3

[09:43:30] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, I have a FreeBSD system, but don't touch it much.  On linux the convention is manually installed things (eg: you do a make --install) should go in /usr/local to keep it away from where the package manger installs things to.

[09:45:00] <HoneyDrops> (yeah, you can use practically "any" path, but by convention, what is considered "correct")
[09:47:22] <Dashie> HoneyDrops, since packages are just built from ports, you use /usr/local
[09:47:33] <Dashie> by non-manager stuff i didnt think you meant tarballs
[09:47:37] <Dashie> i thought you meant OS stuff :Lp

[09:47:46] <Dashie> re: tarballs, i think /usr/local

[09:50:30] <Moonlightning> If you're writing a link-local network, does the interface or the prefixlen come first?
[09:50:44] <HoneyDrops> Or just override whatever the package manager installs w/ something I built myself.

[20:41:14] <Deathpony> the I/O shield has these weird prong things on the inside
[20:41:37] <Gladiolus> mine has those too, the shield ended up bulging out of the case
[20:41:40] <Gladiolus> what a piece of shit
[20:41:51] <Deathpony> does it need them?
[20:52:13] <HoneyDrops> https://opensource.com/life/15/11/top-open-source-terminal-emulators  I'm shocked rxvt-unicode wasn't included.
[20:52:14] <PinkiePieBot> [ Top 7 terminal emulators for Linux | Opensource.com ]
[20:53:52] <Colgate> I just use gnome-terminal, because I use gnome, and it came preinstalled
[20:53:55] <HoneyDrops> Also gnome-terminal, guake, terminator, and tilda are all really just the same VTE widget in different wrappers.
[20:54:04] <Colgate> does everything I need, wihch is give me a terminal :P
[20:54:34] <HoneyDrops> I use xterm or rxvt-family.  As a terminal emulator shouldn't need a GUI toolkit.
[20:55:07] <HoneyDrops> rxvt daemon mode is a lovely thing too :D
[20:55:20] <Colgate> I have all the menus and stuff disabled, /shrug
[20:56:02] * HoneyDrops nods.
[20:57:48] <HoneyDrops> Still if you compare ram usage... eww VTE is terrible.  It's also slower, except when it cheats (if you dump a lot of output, it will not render it making it "faster", but actual redraw speed is worse)
[21:00:06] *** WuBzY is now known as WuBzY|gaming
[21:01:36] <Gladiolus> JUST USE A COMMODORE 64
[21:02:32] <WuBzY|gaming> too much power fow me Gladiolus
[21:02:41] <WuBzY|gaming> for*
[21:03:15] <Q0> ah delicious ZFS
[21:04:11] <WuBzY|gaming> how many here are using windows 10?
[21:05:05] <Gladiolus> i am, not at the moment but at home
[21:05:15] <Gladiolus> fall update added a lot of subtle but good things
[21:05:31] <WuBzY|gaming> I use it and I love the speed of it
[21:05:48] <Gladiolus> The update lightened the install footprint to 7 gigs.
[21:05:58] <Gladiolus> Like holy shit what, that's amazing compared to Win7 needing like... 20
[21:06:07] <WuBzY|gaming> ;D
[21:06:15] <Gladiolus> OSX is 15-30? ish
[21:06:24] <WuBzY|gaming> dunno
[21:06:43] <WuBzY|gaming> but I was usin 8.1 before
[21:06:47] <Gladiolus> 40 on this computer but it's a school computer running 10.9
[21:06:51] <Gladiolus> oh holy shit going from 8.1 to 10
[21:07:00] <Gladiolus> 10 is equal to 7 and faaaaaar superior to 8
[21:07:23] <Gladiolus> I used 8.1 and 7 a bit on separate computers so I could get legit 10 upgrades, and like.
[21:07:32] <Gladiolus> 7? Usable. 8? utterly and totally trash hell shit
[21:07:36] <WuBzY|gaming> But I had cracked windows 8.1 and now I have cracked windows 10 ;D
[21:07:49] <Gladiolus> I had used 10 beta before I 'went back' for the upgrade and it was an experience.
[21:08:22] <WuBzY|gaming> aint nobody got money for that :D
[21:08:38] <Gladiolus> the upgrade was free!
[21:09:33] <WuBzY|gaming> was but it didnt work on already cracked windows 8.1 so I had to instal 10 from usb drive
[21:11:27] <WuBzY|gaming> and im usin lubuntu on my jesus aged IMB machine :D
[21:13:05] <WuBzY|gaming> IBM to be exact :DD
[21:13:20] <Gladiolus> mmm thinkpads
[21:13:31] <WuBzY|gaming> no its desktop
[21:13:51] <Gladiolus> eww oem desktop
[21:14:01] <HoneyDrops> I have to wonder what the hell they are doing to make an OS install that large, yet lacking so much basic functionality or common applications.
[21:14:11] <WuBzY|gaming> got that pentium 4 and 1,5 gigs of ram and 40 gig hdd :D
[21:14:24] <Gladiolus> double eww pentium 4.
[21:14:36] <HoneyDrops> P4 was the best space heater
[21:14:38] <Gladiolus> which os do you mean mr. HoneyDrops 
[21:14:43] <WuBzY|gaming> old old old workhorse never gonna die
[21:14:57] <Gladiolus> P4 is shit historically. Too slow to do new stuff, lacking compatibility with really old stuff.
[21:15:00] <Gladiolus> Melt them all down.
[21:15:32] <HoneyDrops> Gladiolus: MS Windows, I cannot fathom how a base install would be multiple GB.
[21:15:38] <WuBzY|gaming> also got my hp dv6 laptop always overheating :D
[21:16:20] <Gladiolus> For windows it's 90% legacy stuff.
[21:16:28] <Gladiolus> Like old DLLs for old programs.
[21:16:47] <Gladiolus> You'll notice that XP was like, 2 gigs, and then Vista was 15, 7 was 20-30, and now Windows 10 has come back down to 7.
[21:17:16] <HoneyDrops> Ok, make sense, also shows why ABI compat is an idiotic idea.
[21:17:32] <Gladiolus> It does have an email app and a lot of stuff too, so it's fairly reasonable considering nobody gives a shit about optimizing past a certain point any more.
[21:17:59] <Gladiolus> Oh and Windows has a /lot/ of drivers, that too.
[21:19:49] *** WuBzY|gaming is now known as WuBzY
[21:20:18] <HoneyDrops> Sounds like a job for a package manager and a repository.
[21:20:58] <Gladiolus> but this OEM contract says we need "out of the box" support!
[21:21:37] <Gladiolus> i wish windows 10 ran on non-sse2 computers, I wanna see how well it runs on a p3

[21:57:34] <Moonlightning> bleh…mucking around with radvd and isc-dhcp-server trying to get certain addresses assigned to certain clients by MAC address, and all clients to get temporary addresses from a /65
[21:58:08] <Moonlightning> I got the temporary-address bit, but clients aren't getting the permanent addresses, and all of them are still keeping their SLAAC addresses
[21:58:25] <Moonlightning> which…no. Those have MAC addresses in them. It's okay for link-local, I guess, but not for the global scope.
