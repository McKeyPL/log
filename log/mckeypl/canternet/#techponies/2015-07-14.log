[03:41:35] <cyborg_ar> the gas in my house is not working properly
[03:41:46] <cyborg_ar> barely any comes out
[03:41:56] <cyborg_ar> my stove takes a really long time to boil a pot of water
[03:42:15] <cyborg_ar> and the heater doesnt heat up properly
[03:42:22] <cyborg_ar> i think the pressure is too low
[03:48:12] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> or the regulator is derped
[03:49:52] <cyborg_ar> lol pressure just came back
[03:50:01] <cyborg_ar> very fun while cooking
[03:50:06] <cyborg_ar> it was very sudden
[03:50:33] <cyborg_ar> i don't think the regulator would fail like that, it must have been a supply issue
[03:50:55] <cyborg_ar> though if i was staying in this house i'd replace it because i feel it's always too low overall
[03:51:07] <cyborg_ar> never measured it with a manometer though
[03:51:32] <cyborg_ar> should be 7 inches water
[04:09:18] <cyborg_ar> hmm
