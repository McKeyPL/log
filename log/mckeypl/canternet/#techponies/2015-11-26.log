[01:27:18] <ShivalWolf> does the escape key have a differnt key id over SSH then it does on a native terminal?
[01:27:50] <Gladiolus> I finally fixed the last niggling problem with my Pentium III retrostation today and I feel so damn good.
[01:27:56] <Gladiolus> i r compooter gennus
[01:29:41] <Sour_Sweet> ShivalWolf: It should not, but some SSH clients will not send the ESC key by default
[01:30:30] <Sour_Sweet> 27 should be correct useally
[01:30:39] <Sour_Sweet> (Just checked my terminal)
[01:30:52] <ShivalWolf> Sour_Sweet: thanks
[01:30:55] <ShivalWolf> 27 is what im using
[01:31:08] <ShivalWolf> Sour_Sweet: what did you use the check?
[01:31:39] <HoneyDrops> I would say any ssh client that doesn't sens esc properly is broken.
[01:31:58] <Sour_Sweet>  python -c "print ord(raw_input('char '))"    Not written by me
[01:32:09] <Sour_Sweet> I don't python :D
[01:32:47] <HoneyDrops> Press ^v then ESC and it should print ^[
[01:33:05] <ShivalWolf> well its certainly sending 27 over
[01:33:13] <ShivalWolf> i think it might be the code thats screwing up
[01:33:16] <ShivalWolf> damn curses
[01:34:02] <HoneyDrops> Oh, you're making a program with ncurses?
[01:34:29] <ShivalWolf> ahhh now im hitting the built in delay with the escape key

[01:47:52] <ShivalWolf> well yay for things working abit better now
[01:47:55] <ShivalWolf> dont know why
[01:48:08] <ShivalWolf> saying the key is 27 instead of using curses.ascii.ESC works
[01:48:15] <ShivalWolf> silly python and curses 
[01:48:38] * HoneyDrops only know curses & C.
[01:56:33] <Sour_Sweet> Just to annoy anypony: That's what the above would look like in PHP :P php -r "echo ord(fgets(STDIN));"
[01:57:37] * HoneyDrops hisses.
[01:58:13] <Sour_Sweet> (And this is actually written by me)
[02:00:08] <Moonlightning> python3 -c "import sys; print([ord(char) for char in sys.stdin.read()]);"  # Sour_Sweet
[02:00:37] <ShivalWolf> cmd line php is soo wrong
[02:02:32] <Sour_Sweet> Actually it's quite useful in some cases
[02:03:23] <Sour_Sweet> I have cronjobs running with PHP that pull their config from a PHP webapp
[02:03:40] <Sour_Sweet> So I don't need to change the config twice
[02:08:59] <ShivalWolf> in that case fine
[02:09:09] <ShivalWolf> but ive seen soem horrible full console applications written in php
[02:09:20] <ShivalWolf> ones that have no web componant
[02:09:48] * Sour_Sweet is not riding on php hate train.
[02:10:19] <Sour_Sweet> For me PHP is just like every other language. I'll use it when suitable
[02:12:13] <Sour_Sweet> When I'm looking at how the LE client works I'm more than angry - it's written in python. For me this is an example where python for example is not suitable. I'd have prefered it being written in GO
[02:13:19] <ShivalWolf> yeah there are apropraite uses. using a web lanaguage for console only is not one of those cases
[02:13:31] <ShivalWolf> GO is too new for alot of thigns that have just been running for ages
[02:13:34] <ShivalWolf> but its growing
[02:13:49] <ShivalWolf> needs more libaries to make it more useful and common place
[02:14:22] <Sour_Sweet> ^Just like any compiled language
[02:14:55] <ShivalWolf> just a reason that its pickup is not been that fast right now
[02:15:12] <ShivalWolf> libary exists in perl/python that you can use but not yet in go
[02:15:20] <ShivalWolf> why write it in go if you have to rewrite the libary to go with it
[02:15:31] <ShivalWolf> its sorta like the whole python2/3 situation
[02:15:41] <ShivalWolf> stick to python2 becuase python3 doesnt yet have the libaries ported
[02:15:42] <Sour_Sweet> I personally don't like python's syntax, which is the reason I never really learned it.
[02:15:57] <ShivalWolf> its got 1 benifit
[02:16:03] <ShivalWolf> teaches you to indent your code properly
[02:16:22] <Sour_Sweet> I do that anyway *g*
[02:16:35] <ShivalWolf> and by teaches i mean forces
[02:17:20] <ShivalWolf> i would like it if python had a loop or an if block definer
[02:17:23] <Sour_Sweet> Reminds that I should really look up what's the better practice now: tabs or 4 spaces.
[02:17:25] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[02:17:35] <ShivalWolf> i think thats still personal preference
[02:17:47] <Sour_Sweet> I still use tabs, but I've got a feeling that changed
[02:17:54] <ShivalWolf> i use tabs as well
[02:18:03] <ShivalWolf> python3 hates if you mix them though
[02:18:39] <ShivalWolf> TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
[02:19:03] <Sour_Sweet> That's stupid, so it's right there to complain, even though my standpoint is that any language should ignore whitespaces
[02:20:15] <ShivalWolf> i really should look at moving from tab to spaces though
[02:20:23] <ShivalWolf> if you copy/paste multiple lines in a terminal
[02:20:27] <ShivalWolf> it assumes spaces not tabs
[02:21:14] <ShivalWolf> atleast alot of text editors have a handler for tabs
[02:21:34] <Sour_Sweet> Some html spec recommended spaces as well
[02:21:43] <ShivalWolf> ewww
[02:21:56] <Sour_Sweet> But pressing tab feels more natural
[02:22:05] <Sour_Sweet> (and saves a few bits)
[02:22:31] <Sour_Sweet> (not that it would really matter due to deflate/gzib)
[02:23:18] <Sour_Sweet> https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml#Indentation
[02:25:11] <Sour_Sweet> Not that I would really follow it anyway since it recommends this https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.xml#Optional_Tags while I prefer XML valid HTML
[02:26:52] <ShivalWolf> Sour_Sweet: ive seen in most text editors you have the option for an automatic tab to spaces conversion
[02:26:57] <ShivalWolf> so you hit tab it auto does 4 spaces
[02:27:32] * Sour_Sweet will lookup if notepad++ supports that
[02:27:44] <Moonlightning> Wow, I can't believe that worked
[02:28:45] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet, ShivalWolf: PEP 0008 mandates spaces
[02:29:13] <Moonlightning> /but then I'd have to press the spacebar X times!/ isn't valid anymore
[02:29:27] <Moonlightning> Any modern editor worth its salt will let you configure tab to insert X spaces
[02:29:47] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah, but that's Python
[02:29:57] * Sour_Sweet doesn't care about Python
[02:30:04] <Moonlightning> Most should even let you treat spaces as tabs for editing (e.g. `vim`s softtabstop)
[02:30:12] <ShivalWolf> pythons picky
[02:30:21] <ShivalWolf> but indenting with tabs or spaces is still genericly done for anything
[02:30:30] <ShivalWolf> it really just depends what you want
[02:30:59] * ShivalWolf just switched everything over to 4 spaces
[02:31:04] <ShivalWolf> yay for the expand command
[02:31:15] <ShivalWolf> expand -4 input.py > output.py
[02:31:20] <Moonlightning> Anyway, Rust's type system <3
[02:31:41] <Moonlightning> Had a function to xor together bytestrings of the same length
[02:32:21] <Moonlightning> wanted to make it easy to xor one string against the same byte repeatedly (without writing that byte repeatedly into memory, because that's a waste of space and time)
[02:33:08] <Moonlightning> Take `IntoIterator`s instead of `&[u8]`s, on the condition that the iterator types returned are `ExactSizeIterator`s (for lengthchecking)
[02:33:11] <Moonlightning> And it works
[02:34:03] <Moonlightning> pub fn xor_bytes<L, R>(left: L, right: R) -> Option<Vec<u8>> where L: iter::IntoIterator<Item=u8>, R: iter::IntoIterator<Item=u8>, L::IntoIter: iter::ExactSizeIterator, R::IntoIter: iter::ExactSizeIterator
[02:34:08] <Moonlightning> It'sâ€¦long XD
[02:36:48] <Sour_Sweet> Notepad++ allows you to change that, so I guess I could use spaces instead
[02:37:13] <ShivalWolf> i do think its still personal prefrence
[02:37:42] <ShivalWolf> but if your working over ssh in a terminal text editor spaces is best
[02:37:58] <ShivalWolf> i should actually get back to coding
[02:38:01] <ShivalWolf> isntead of chatting
[02:38:03] <Sour_Sweet> I try to avoid that though
[02:38:34] <Sour_Sweet> SSH tends to lag sometimes at my current location
[02:38:55] <Sour_Sweet> Reuploading the files is easier for edits longer than a few lines
[02:49:12] <Sour_Sweet> I love C# and .Net/Mono. It's so sad to say that about something coming from MS :P

[03:32:29] <Sour_Sweet> Got mosh working. Annoying though that it will use cygwin's user directory, since I do have a .ssh folder on my windows profile
[03:34:41] <Googie> mosh just calls ssh for the initial connection, you can directly pass parameters with --ssh="ssh -something"

[04:21:02] <Gigaway> My monitor only goes 1080p, Vram usage, I have no clue
[04:21:28] <Gigaway> I was going to upgrade a little when I got college refund check. Right now I have a used 270 oc
[04:21:40] <Gigaway> and games like, DBZ Xenoverse, I notice stuttering

[04:24:20] <Kinsley> The stuttering issue is probably more of a.... symptom of a lackluster card than a hitting a VRAM ceiling.
[04:24:36] <tiwake> Gigaway: I would get an AMD video card
[04:24:52] <Kinsley> But if you're going to continue to game at 1080p, I'd say buy whatever card has the better deals going for it.
[04:25:09] <tiwake> if you ever plan on using linux, AMD is the better choice
[04:25:39] <tiwake> nvidia drivers for 900 series are balls
[04:25:39] <Kinsley> Even with its gimped memory setup, the 970 is basically king of 1080p and starts to get iffy at 1440p and 2160p (4k).

[04:36:37] <tiwake> depends on what you are doing
[04:37:14] <tiwake> if the 3D textures and stuff are compressed, then it will work with up to something like 125gigs of stuff

[14:24:46] <Sour_Sweet> Downside of mosh is I loose local terminal backlog, so I need to redirect any output longer than a few lines into a file.
[14:32:05] <Unixkitty> Well evidently they do, but apparently editing the standard config file does not seem to affect anything
[14:37:14] <Sour_Sweet> Looks like they run their own version of OpenSSH. I found a few hilarious articles mentioning restrictions :P
[14:38:39] <Sour_Sweet> You could compile an ARM version of OpenSSH, but that will probably require some effort to be compatible and you'll loose configuration options from the webpanel
