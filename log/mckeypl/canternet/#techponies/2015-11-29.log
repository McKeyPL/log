[07:40:40] <Phase> Moonlightning, very much so, all i really have is hearing on the radio that it was human error and there was some ongoing investigation
[07:40:57] <Moonlightning> I've heard that the investigation was concluded.
[07:41:06] <Phase> on the other hand, pretty cool to hear the us military admit that they fucked up

[07:41:24] <Moonlightning> I suppose.
[07:41:30] <Moonlightning> But REALLY, they need to handle this PROPERLY.
[07:43:13] <Gladiolus> I am fairly sure, with no actual substantiation, that they knew.
[07:43:29] <Gladiolus> They simply thought the taliban had taken the hospital over, and regardless of whether that's a war crime- bombed it to kill them.
[07:43:33] <Gladiolus> They were wrong ofc.
[07:44:51] <Moonlightning> It's still a war crime! -.-
[07:45:05] <Moonlightning> Crimes against humanity, holy shit.
[07:45:16] <Gladiolus> It is yes.
[07:45:23] <Gladiolus> I never said it wasn't, and I was mad as hell.
[07:45:32] <Phase> EVERYONE is
[07:45:44] * Moonlightning flies an American flag. Sets it to a slow burn. :V
[07:45:44] <Gladiolus> Nothing will happen though
[07:45:50] <Gladiolus> I'm a poli sci, I'm numb to this shit.
[07:45:55] <Gladiolus> My anger is on a perpetual slow-burn.
[07:46:17] <Gladiolus> Putin is shit, Obama is shit, and the worst part is everyone assumes the truth is in the middle. Not always.
[07:46:27] <Gladiolus> The truth here is that the USA committed a war crime, straight up. 
[07:46:31] <Moonlightning> ^
[07:46:42] <Gladiolus> Not the first nor the last.
[07:47:00] <Gladiolus> and then there's the weird "Well that means that the US is the worst and other people are relatively better"
[07:47:16] <Moonlightning> To be fair, the US is pretty darn bad. :V
[07:47:17] <Gladiolus> Nah, Russia been doing war crimes in Ukraine for years now, Assad is up to 140,000 dead civilians, etc.
[07:47:42] <Moonlightning> They're also pertty darn bad.
[07:48:02] <Gladiolus> People need to stop seeing the world as either a blob of grey or black and white- it's a series of seperate events and basically states are stumbling around drunk and sometimes getting into fist-fights.
[07:48:26] <Moonlightning> ““fistfights”” that kill thousands and thousands and thousands of people. >:V
[07:48:33] <Gladiolus> that would be the blodo yes
[07:48:47] <Gladiolus> also some of them have guns but have yet to use them
[07:48:57] <Gladiolus> except that one time USA shot Japan in the leg
[07:49:40] <Gladiolus> This thing with Turkey too is like, ugh, can't you see that Erdogan is shit /and/ Putin is shit?
[07:49:59] <Gladiolus> Russia is no victim, Putin knew this was going to happen and expertly made it into some sort of boo-hoo Russia.
[07:50:21] <Gladiolus> Erdogan is an egotistical shitload that is more than willing to kill people that disagree, he's no more than Assad light.
[07:50:42] <Moonlightning> THE WORLD IS FUCKED UP
[07:50:44] <Moonlightning> </tldr>
[07:50:59] <Gladiolus> We can make it better, and it's better than it was before.
[07:51:01] <Moonlightning> It's just, it's fucked up. It's all fucked up.
[07:51:12] <Moonlightning> The only countries that aren't utterly fucked up are like
[07:51:16] <Moonlightning> Denmark and Sweden and shit
[07:51:34] <Moonlightning> the Netherlands
[07:51:38] <Moonlightning> probably
[07:52:23] *** Joins: Asoka (Asoka@Pony-vp038q.net-htp.de)
[07:52:25] <Gladiolus> Yeah but even the 'fucked up' ones are far less fucked than oh, say, the 1970s when Vietnam was a thing.
[07:52:30] <Gladiolus> Or the 1980s when Afganistan was a thing.
[07:52:40] <Moonlightning> Afghanistan is STILL a thing.
[07:53:03] <Moonlightning> the current schedule was, like, all the troops out by 2016 or some shit, right?
[07:53:13] <Moonlightning> so that means jack all is going to change until like 2060
[07:53:23] <Gladiolus> It was more a thing then, the Soviet war was /far/ hotter than any of the NATO stuff.
[07:54:09] <Moonlightning> It's //slightly less/ utterly and completely/ fucked up than it was.
[07:54:15] <Moonlightning> It is still //utterly and completely// fucked up.
[07:54:22] <Gladiolus> The world is cooling in gneral, but the heat is becoming spread out. It's weird.
[07:54:34] <Moonlightning> I don't know if that's better.

[07:54:49] <Gladiolus> Afganistan was justified in my opinion, the problem is some idiot invaded Iraq and blew up the region making it retro-actively pointless.
[07:54:59] <Gladiolus> No matter how much we gained in Afganistan it was all erased by that.
[07:55:57] <Moonlightning> Saying anything was justified is a very, /very/ large red flag for me. Explain?
[07:57:05] <Gladiolus> It had security council backing, it was done by NATO proper, and was overthrowing an ill-established militia that had taken over in the 1990s. The situation was fluid and unstable, and the 'government' was unrecognized. NATO had a right to ask the UN to go in and stabilize it, and they did because the Taliban were seen to be harbouring the 9/11 dudes.
[07:57:54] <Gladiolus> Everyone else just sorta stood back and let them, the general opinion of the world was "Yeah alright those guys suck, go ahead."

[22:05:30] <Kinsley> I really, really want AMD to be competitive in the CPU and GPU space.
[22:05:56] <Kinsley> Partly because I'm a little nostalgic for my first desktop being powered by an AMD CPU back in like, 2006.
[22:06:37] <Kinsley> But mostly because that means it'll help get Intel and nVidia off their dead asses and actually innovate instead of incremental, by-the-numbers year-over-year improvements.
[22:09:14] <Gigaway> lets try this again.. no app this time x.x
