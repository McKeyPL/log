[11:27:28] <Moonlightning> Are non-absolute paths valid in HTTP? Like, can you `GET foo`?
[11:27:39] <Moonlightning> Because, if not, I could just toss in relative things as-is
[11:28:07] <Moonlightning> So you could symlink /var/www/foo to '302:bar' with the same effect
[11:31:37] <Phase> well anything starting with '302:' would be a redirect
[11:31:44] <Phase> an explicit redirect'
[11:32:56] <Moonlightning> …actually, I think there should be some other way to specify that
[11:33:24] <Moonlightning> Is a symlink to '302:/foo' referring to /foo on the filesystem, or /foo within the document root?
[11:36:21] * Phase would treat it the same as src="/foo"

[23:53:08] <Colgate> which makes me think a hdd issue, but doing a chkdsk with scanning for bad sectors finds nothing and smart info looks fine
