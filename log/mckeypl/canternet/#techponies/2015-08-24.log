[22:32:34] <Colgate> microsoft would have to be incredibly stupid to think that's how that works
[22:32:45] <Colgate> and I don't believe they are that stupid, I blame their marketing department
[22:33:23] <wolfyshy> For networks you choose to share access to, the password is sent over an encrypted connection and is stored in an encrypted file on a Microsoft server, and is then sent over an HTTPS connection to your contacts' PC or phone if they use Wi‑Fi Sense.
[22:33:33] <wolfyshy> nope, they really believe that

[22:36:17] <HoneyDrops|Half> Oh, I fully believe that it's encrypted as it is sent to the MS server, is encrypted on the MS server, and is encrypted as sent to the other system.  But I'm also damn sure that the other system has to decrypt it at some point to /use it/.  I also know that means it has the ciphertext and they key needed to access it, there is no way around this.  I similarly have little-to-no faith that MS
[22:36:18] <HoneyDrops|Half> has set it up such that they can never access the credentials, even if compelled to.
[22:37:09] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops|Half: wpa2 sends hashes, so it would not need to be decrypted, but that is... saying you can't see the passphrase itself is moot
[22:40:03] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[22:42:07] <HoneyDrops|Half> Really the entire model for wifi security is broken, the notion that you have a single key for everyone makes it impossible to do per-user access revocation.  The proper way is a wifi client should share a key, out of band, and the admin of the access point adds that public key to the approved clients list.  Now, a client can share their private key, but it makes it easy to revoke access to
[22:42:09] <HoneyDrops|Half> just that user and other users don't have to take any action and their access is not disrupted.  Unlike WPA2 where if someone leaks the key, you have to change it and then everyone has to do so as well... and you're one leak away from having to reset everything again :/
[22:42:56] *** gigatown is now known as Gigabit
[22:44:03] <Colgate> HoneyDrops|Half: uh, radius solves that problem, and some routers have local radius servers
[22:44:04] <HoneyDrops|Half> This has the other bonus of, if you want to share access with a friend, they could give you their public key (via a service very similar to MS's) and you could petition the admin to add their key for approval.  It's easy for the user who wants to connect, and the admin still has control over who has access.
