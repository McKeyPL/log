[02:49:07] <Cydie> I'm really sorry if I'm attending at this channel. I really don't belong at #techponies because I'm a person who can't achieve to be good at coding. No one in my house really don't know programming as I failed to learn to program. Yet I don't have a computer science degree, or very good at math, I still fail. I know some people here tend to talk smart to me but that doesn't mean I understand it.  I just sighed myself and ignore the chat for a few minut
[02:51:23] <Webster> You don't have to know programming to hang out here.
[02:51:36] <Webster> It's just a channel for people interested in technology to hang out.
[02:52:35] <Cydie> I'm sorry to reveal out my feelings
[02:56:03] <Cydie> I know programming is a goal for me to do,  but if you tried learning any language,  you really need to have a background of programming
[02:57:31] <JustAberrant> gotta start somewhere (really, like it's actually impossible to never have learned programming without a background in programming..
[02:58:22] <JustAberrant> well, unless your like Colgate anyway :(
[02:59:09] <Cydie> I really don't like the requirement of a college degree
[03:00:21] <Webster> You don't need a college degree.
[03:00:25] <JustAberrant> well, you can get a job without a degree, it's just way harder
[03:00:42] <JustAberrant> if it's at all an option, getting a degree is definitely worth it imo
[03:00:49] <Cydie> Nah
[03:01:11] <JustAberrant> imo self taught + degree is best
[03:01:22] <Cydie> Everyone believes you need a degree to learn programming but for me, not true
[03:01:34] <JustAberrant> no one believes that ;p
[03:01:55] <JustAberrant> most programmers I know (and myself) started programming long before college
[03:02:02] <Cydie> I know alot of people learned programming without a degree
[03:02:31] <Cydie> Of course they figured out by themselves
[03:02:32] <Phase> "the requirement of a college degree"?
[03:02:59] <JustAberrant> the degree just proves you are probably not a complete flake, can kinda work on your own, and were able to stick with something for awhile
[03:03:10] <Phase> ^
[03:03:10] <JustAberrant> and also that you have at least a baseline skillset
[03:03:18] <JustAberrant> no one actually learns to code in school
[03:03:29] <Phase> though given what i've seen of coding at uni
[03:03:30] <JustAberrant> well, I'm sure some kinda do.. but no one worth anything imo ;p
[03:03:39] <Phase> yeah, a degree alone is not indicative of skill
[03:03:41] <Cydie> I found it at the "Beginning Programming for Dummies" book
[03:04:10] <Cydie> Somewhat a useful book
[03:16:41] <Cydie> Do you have to skip python tutorials
[03:16:51] <Cydie> Like about command arguments etc
[03:17:19] <Cydie> What if you don't know about it? And you don't know what they're saying?
[03:20:25] <Cydie> Also, why not learning at tutorials point

[04:11:54] <Moonlightning> Cydie, you seem to have serious misconceptions about how learning works.
[04:12:31] <Moonlightning> Needing a college degree in order to learn something is a prerequisite paradox.
[04:13:56] <Cydie> But I'd learn it before college

[21:56:39] <Dew> i have 2 machines
[21:57:10] <Dew> i have installed atheme on another shell
[21:57:16] <Colgate> you need to put the IP in the address="" area and the port in the port="" area
[21:57:21] <Colgate> not combined
[21:57:21] <Dew> and inspircd installed in another shell.
[21:57:35] <Colgate> you don't install things to shells
[21:57:43] <Colgate> you install things to systems
[21:57:51] <Dew> yes but
[21:57:58] <Dew> i dont know why they are not conencting
[21:58:07] <Colgate> I just told you why
[21:58:26] <Dew> if i paste my conf files on paste bin can you fix them?
[21:58:28] <Colgate> you aren't entering a valid IP address in the address field
[21:58:37] <Colgate> if you pay me, sure
[21:58:50] <Colgate> 50$/hour, minimum 1 hour
[21:59:06] <Dew> if i have money then why should i come here for help? :)
[21:59:24] <Colgate> I am hellping, you aren't reading and/or don't understand basic networking
[21:59:36] <Colgate> in which case, you need to learn before trying to set this stuff up
[21:59:41] <Dew> please understand me.
[21:59:51] <Dew> i have 2 diffent shell machines
[21:59:55] <Dew>  i mean VPS
[22:00:03] <Colgate> I know
[22:00:07] <Dew> both have diffent ips
[22:00:12] <Colgate> and the IP address you entered is not a valid IP address
[22:00:23] <Colgate> 5.5.5.5:5125 is not an IP address
[22:00:57] <Colgate> 5.5.5.5 would be an IPv4 address, :5125 is the port
[22:01:17] <Dew> check the blocks
[22:01:32] <Colgate> also, I highly highly highly don't recommend doing a setup this way
[22:01:41] <Colgate> atheme when linke does not do tls
[22:02:31] <Colgate> sure, that part of the config looks fine
[22:02:35] <Dew> ok
[22:02:43] <Dew> let me show u conf file of atheme.conf
[22:02:55] <Colgate> well, actually it doesn't
[22:03:35] <Colgate> the ipaddr="address" should be teh remote address
[22:03:38] <Colgate> not yours

[22:09:06] <Dew> Colgate
[22:10:32] <Colgate> atheme's, the remote server's
[22:11:29] <Dew> that ip is atheme server ip
[22:11:33] <Dew> which i fixed
[22:13:56] <Colgate> Dew: then your bind address is wrong, you can't bind to an IP your box doesn't have
[22:16:12] <Dew> you don`t understand my word bro
[22:16:46] <Dew> i told you i have 2 diffrent VPS i create on shell from freebSD which i install inspircd on FreebSD shell
[22:16:52] <Colgate> I think I do understand
[22:16:57] <Dew> and atheme is installed on another VPS 
[22:17:02] <Colgate> since you copy+pasted me the config
[22:17:04] <Dew> both vps have 2 diffrent ips
[22:17:05] <Colgate> and it is wrong
[22:17:14] <Dew> you can fix it please
[22:17:19] <Colgate> 50$/hour
[22:17:41] <Dew> comon

[22:30:02] <Colgate> by putting the correct IP in there
[22:30:04] <Moonlightning> Dew: reading the scrollback, what Colgate has said looks correct to me.
[22:30:24] <Moonlightning> Also, he most certainly knows what he's talking about here, considering he runs this network. :P
[22:34:08] <Moonlightning> And yeah, link services to an IRCd running on the same box, over loopback. Don't run them on different machines. O.o
