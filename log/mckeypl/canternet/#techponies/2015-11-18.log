[03:02:07] <Sour_Sweet> Ah yes unsigned int. The bind doc I was reading just said 10 digit number
[03:02:24] <Moonlightning> Well, RFC 1035 says 32-bit unsigned integer. :P
[03:02:27] <Sour_Sweet> Which is incorrect
[03:02:37] <Moonlightning> DNS is a binary protocol >.>
[03:02:57] <Moonlightning> If you really wanted to have it entirely time-based, you could use YYYYMMDDHH, I guess, but then you can only update it once per hour
[03:02:59] <Sour_Sweet> (Was referecning to the doc I was reading)
[03:03:15] <Moonlightning> I'm just gonna stick with YYYYMMDDnn.
[03:03:25] <Moonlightning> If I update more than a hundred times in one day, I'll just increment the day anyway
[03:03:35] <Moonlightning> And then bump the serial the next day
[03:04:02] <Moonlightning> That's unlikely; updating the zone more than /several hundred/ times in one day is even less likely.
[03:04:21] <Sour_Sweet> Or one could just start at 0 and we have no problems at all :P
[03:06:05] <Sour_Sweet> Using a uint32 is not exactly reasoanble these days.
[03:06:44] <Gigabit> Wow my hspa download rate is terrible
[03:11:16] <Sour_Sweet> If I'd need to do frequent updates I'd probably just end up using my good old friend unix timestamps. They're safe for a reasonable time frame and easy to use.
[03:11:47] <Sour_Sweet> 100 updates per day at max doesn't sound reasonable to me.
[03:16:23] <Sour_Sweet> In any case even if you provide invalid serial numbers the damage is limited by your SOA's expire time.

[19:37:00] <HoneyDrops> wolfyshy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(web_engine)  Close enough to a browser, it's still abusing something designed to display documents. Either use a standard toolkit (tk,gtk,qt), or use Xlib directly, or best of all: curses.
[19:37:01] <PinkiePieBot> [ Blink (web engine) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[19:40:11] <HoneyDrops> Though, if they have any sanity, ripping off the UI section leaving the logic parts shouldn't be too hard.  You're however still stuck with TypeScript/JS :/

[19:56:21] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: TypeScript is okay-ish for what it is, though I don't really like any JS derivative
[19:56:47] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: xlib is terrible and curses is worse.  I want the entire TUI thing to die off already so we can get to things like qt5 that have native scaling for DPIs and accessibility
[19:56:52] <wolfyshy> gtk3 pukes hard on accessibility
[19:57:07] <wolfyshy> it can't do screen readers, it crashes if you try to use a dbus-compliant magnifier
[19:57:38] <HoneyDrops> ssh (or mosh) is still the best remote access option
[19:57:47] <wolfyshy> xpra is \o/
[20:01:51] <HoneyDrops> Xlib has native scaling :D
[20:02:30] <HoneyDrops> Xlib was built around vectors, it was /designed/ to support any resolution (ok, maybe not so much with fonts, but that is solved now).
[20:04:33] <HoneyDrops> And pure-xlib forwarding is actually quite nice.  However, every tookit it seems decided to not use it and just plasters bitmaps everywhere.  Which is why remote access sucks.  Every single remote GUI system will suck until we completely abandon trying to shove images over the network and focus on vector based UIs.
[20:08:03] <HoneyDrops> I would imagine for accessibility a CLI would be best, just a simple text stream to read.
[20:11:11] <HoneyDrops> For a VI user, you don't really need a "UI" in the typical sense.  You just want a single, well defined input (keyboard) and a single well defined output (stdout).  I play (and do some volunteer support) for a MUD and we have a fair number of VI users.  Accessibility for a lot of toolkits is sad, the GUI MUD clients pretty much are only usable because of special support for readers.

[20:27:31] <HoneyDrops> ssh is just so much more usable.  I don't even want to think what using VNC or remote desktop is like on a mobile.  ssh works just fine, and mosh even handles when connections are spotty.

[23:08:39] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: as someone who uses VNC over 3G pretty much every day now: it's not that bad, if you have a decent server (x11vnc does compression and server-side tweaks to make it very, very fast)
[23:11:26] <HoneyDrops> I really would rather not use VNC on a 800x480 screen >_<
[23:16:59] <wolfyshy> my phone is 1920x1080 and my laptop is 1280x720
[23:17:06] <wolfyshy> so it actually works decently
[23:17:22] <johnsey> hm now i've been putting off buying a new phone after my n900 died for almost 2 years and the alternatives don't seem much better
[23:17:33] <wolfyshy> but I prefer to use my tablet tethered to my phone since the screen is much more usable for such things
[23:17:39] * HoneyDrops is sticking with her n900 for as long as possible.
[23:17:54] <Moonlightning> Whoa
[23:17:55] * HoneyDrops has accepted she will probably have to build her next one herself.
[23:17:55] <Moonlightning> what the hell
[23:18:30] <Moonlightning> TorBrowser's Firefox process has been absolutely FLOODING my logs with this shit
[23:18:33] <HoneyDrops> From my perspective mobiles have only been getting worse.
[23:19:04] <wolfyshy> is the n900 even /usable/ any more?  256 MB RAM wasn't enough when it was launched, for what it did
[23:19:25] <AppleDash> Why does this always happen to me
[23:19:39] <wolfyshy> and maemo is an awful experience
[23:19:41] <HoneyDrops> It does everything I've wanted it to do, and more really.
[23:19:42] <AppleDash> I'm getting an error whose only occurance on Google is in the source code of the thing erroring
[23:19:54] <HoneyDrops> wolfyshy: maemo is 1000x better than iOS or Android
[23:19:58] <AppleDash> I'm doing stuff with Javassist and I'm suddenly getting "Could not allocate library name"
[23:20:01] <johnsey> i've kinda resigned myself to not doing much more than browsing the web and using irc and jabber on my phone ever since i had to use an android phone
[23:20:27] <HoneyDrops> I will sooner roll my own custom Linux-based OS than use Android or iOS.
[23:21:05] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: having used all of them, iOS is more polished, and Android is easier to customise.  maemo is just this odd outlier that has poor software and poorer customisability
[23:21:08] <johnsey> sailfish os? not perfect either but still better than android
[23:21:10] <wolfyshy> what does it offer you in your use case?
[23:21:16] <HoneyDrops> I don't really use mine for much more than calls, ssh (which covers 90% of what I want to do).
[23:21:34] <wolfyshy> vssh for iOS, juice for android
[23:22:21] <HoneyDrops> Maemo is debian, I have nearly full control.  I have custom bash scripts for automating tasks for my n900.
[23:22:50] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: you're not alone…that's happened to me a few times :P
[23:22:51] <wolfyshy> any reason you couldn't do it from busybox in andrroid?
[23:22:54] <HoneyDrops> I want a real, general-purpose OS, that uses normal libs.
[23:22:57] <wolfyshy> android*
[23:23:18] <HoneyDrops> I can just build any X program I want, and run the exact same version on my n900 or my laptop.
[23:23:33] <Moonlightning> …screen size though
[23:23:57] <wolfyshy> android has an X server, if you really want it, but I recommend something like xpra
[23:24:02] <wolfyshy> wayyyyy over running an X client on a phone
[23:24:30] <HoneyDrops> I have one android tablet, it was hell until I rooted it (which took way more effort than it every should) got ad blocking set up (ads are a pox on the world), and basically gutted it.
[23:25:27] <HoneyDrops> I can work with busybox, and do on some devices.  But I basically don't want anything from Android, I end up ripping out most of it and trying to build my own mostly-sane/normal Linux.

[23:27:32] <HoneyDrops> Ultimately, I want to be the one who decides how my device operates.  What does or does not run on any device I own is up to my /sole/ discretion.  Maemo comes a lot close to that OOB.  
[23:27:59] <HoneyDrops> I don't mine alternate libc, sane software should work with any libc.
[23:28:23] <wolfyshy> I agree with this highly
[23:28:37] <wolfyshy> it is stupid that most GNU software does not because it is tied to the GNU libc and will fail in ./configure
[23:28:48] <wolfyshy> on systems that use alternative libcs
[23:30:36] <HoneyDrops> Still, there is nothing I want from Android.  I want open, user-replacible kernels, bootloaders, firmware, etc.
[23:33:20] <johnsey> looking at the recent efforts to lock down firmwares of everything with a radio, i have a feeling the chances for that dream don't look good, sadly
[23:35:00] <johnsey> the upcoming blackberry looks neat, hardware-wise, but it'll be locked down like hell
