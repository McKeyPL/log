[01:34:16] <wolfyshy> HOWEVER, as I said, with --oneshot (or -1), you can manually install a package and have it not added to @world

[01:37:49] <Starthunder> Does --depclean /with/ a package arg remove no-longer-needed packages? It doesn't seem to have done so so far, but that could just be coincidence…
[01:38:05] <wolfyshy> no
[01:38:08] <wolfyshy> it doesn't

[01:38:50] <wolfyshy> watch out though, meta packages can be funny sometimes
[01:39:10] <wolfyshy> for instance, I just ran that right now, and since kde-meta is switching between kde4 and kde5 right now in testing... lol... it wants to remove pretty much the entire kde suite

[05:17:01] <JustAberrant> depends on what you use your server for I guess ;p
[05:17:12] <JustAberrant> I've got gentoo on my VPS, but I don't do anything important on there

[05:28:10] <Googie> Well... that depends on a few things.
[05:28:23] <Googie> A lot of VPSs will really really hate you for the compiling stage.
[05:28:36] <Googie> Also probably some issues if it's OpenVZ
[05:28:57] <Starthunder> Oh, I could do it without reimaging at all. o.o
[05:29:08] <Starthunder> Compiling stage? I don't remember a compiling stage…
[05:29:12] <Googie> That's the only way to do it.
[05:29:14] <Starthunder> well, except for the kernel
[05:29:18] <JustAberrant> if you have an appropriate kernel, you should be able to get it working.. but still
[05:29:19] <HoneyDrops> There are a few tricky bits, mostly at the boot loader and I think swapping over /bin & /sbin 
[05:30:51] <Googie> Starthunder: What VM platform is your VPS on ?
[05:32:21] <Googie> HoneyDrops: Depending on the type of VM, there isn't a bootloader.
[05:32:30] <Starthunder> Good question!
[05:33:15] <HoneyDrops> Still, there is a kernel image and I assume an initfs.  No reason those can't be swapped out on a live system.

[05:40:21] <Googie> Your root file system is also just a directory on some actual file system. (OpenVZ is basically chroot on steroids that's used in cheaper VPSs)
[05:41:13] <HoneyDrops> eww
[05:41:39] <Googie> I've got a few OpenVZ VPSs. They're "okay", but they need to be decently managed, and there's a huge potential for horrible overselling.
[05:42:21] <HoneyDrops> Still, you can certainly run portage in it, running a mostly-proper gentoo system should also be possible
[05:43:26] <Googie> I think you'd have to install Gentoo on your root file system while the existing OS is running.
[05:44:08] <Googie> I'm sure that's doable, but... probably not easy.
[05:46:07] <HoneyDrops> I can think of a few ways.

[06:20:00] <Lapsus> to the point where some of the ones that I've taken apart failed because the ink had congealed into a goopy tower that got tall enough to hit the heads and cause other problems

[16:56:39] <Crimson_Tail> For emergencies, that's fine
[16:56:48] <Crimson_Tail> But doing nothing but texting on it? sheesh
[16:57:05] <_desu_> I think the average time to get a smartphone is like 5th/6th grade here
[16:57:34] <_desu_> Hell, kids younger than that have tablets and use imessage / Google hangouts with their friends

[17:06:34] * RainbowHacks didnt have her first phone until 14, didn't have her OWN phone bought and paid for until 16, didn't get her first computer until 18 o.o

[17:48:56] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> sounds about right
[17:49:03] <tiwake> RainbowHacks: I was a lot younger to get my first computer, although it (they) were old... one of them had an 8088 processor for example :3
[17:49:17] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> did you see where the NSA wants to ban any kind of encryption
[17:49:34] <tiwake> DJ-C0L7[EIT]: no, where?
[17:49:43] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i read it someware but i dont remember the article
[17:50:05] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> it was something like they were trying to make it sound like if you use encrypted communications that you are in league with terrorists or some shit like that
[17:50:09] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i'll see if i can find it again
[17:53:37] <JustAberrant> heh, that's been a thing since forever :>
[17:55:41] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> not surprised
[17:57:32] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i think this is what i was thinking of

[17:57:34] <PinkiePieBot> [ FBI Director: Civilians should not be allowed to encrypt personal data | Rebrn.com ]
[17:57:53] <JustAberrant> the NSA has been trying to get people to knock out that encryption shit since the early 90s
[17:58:02] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[17:58:35] <JustAberrant> they hassled the PGP guy pretty early on.. not to mention the whole clipper chip thing
[17:58:59] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> my ubuntu install and debian install as well, both have encrypted home folders, and my nas (after i upgrade it) will be using encrypted mass storage
[18:00:58] <JustAberrant> most of my installs have used full disk encryption (usually dm-crypt with luks) .. but I generally just use the standard settings and am pretty lax otherwise, so it probably wouldn't stand up to a serious attempt
[18:01:56] <JustAberrant> hell, my nfs is basically wide open.. assuming my file server is still running, they can easily plug a laptop into my network, figure out which user I am (or just correctly assume uid 1000), and access most of my stuff anyway
[18:02:48] <JustAberrant> well, they'd have to use the ip of my desktop to get everything, but that's easy enough
[18:03:20] * JustAberrant shruggles
[18:03:34] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[18:05:22] <JustAberrant> I've always felt like encryption is never going to protect you from law enforcement
[18:05:51] <JustAberrant> it might protect others in some hypothetical organization, but if they're busting down your door, chances are they don't need whatever's on your computer to send you to jail

[18:13:06] <tiwake> a friend was asking me if, with his new computer build, he could dual boot windows 7 and windows 98
[18:13:21] * tiwake facehooves
[18:13:26] <wolfyshy> depends on the chipset
[18:13:32] <wolfyshy> if it has an LPC or LPC emulation, yes
[18:13:50] <wolfyshy> there are universal video drivers to get native res on modern geforces and radeons too
[18:13:54] <wolfyshy> win98 is the windows that won't die
[18:14:17] <tiwake> cause he wants to play old games with it
[18:15:40] <tiwake> I suppose thats fine if it never touches the internet
[18:16:20] <JustAberrant> could probably also just run 98 in a VM
[18:16:37] <JustAberrant> could probably run anything from the 98 era decently at this point
[18:16:58] <tiwake> or linux with crossover/wine
[18:16:59] <JustAberrant> I actually don't even know if 98 could be installed on a newer PC
[18:18:12] <JustAberrant> certainly you'd have a lot of trouble if you wanted network drivers (which is probably a good thing), sound (not so good), and the only workign video driver is probably going to be vesa ;p
[18:18:56] <JustAberrant> also I don't even know if windows update will server the various updates for 98 still
[18:19:02] * JustAberrant suddenly really curious about this whole thing
[18:19:16] * JustAberrant has a 98se CD kicking around somewhere.. but I'm not that keen
[18:19:27] <wolfyshy> the win98 windows update server has been turned off for a decade
[18:19:29] <tiwake> agreed
[18:19:38] <wolfyshy> there is a universal vesa driver that has general opengl acceleration
[18:19:39] <tiwake> screw it, too much effort just thinking about it
[18:19:52] <wolfyshy> there is a generic intel HDA driver for win98
[18:19:54] <wolfyshy> for sonud
[18:19:56] <wolfyshy> sound*
[18:20:24] <tiwake> use an old computer for the old games, or linux with wine
[18:20:30] <wolfyshy> and a surprising number of modern network cards have win98 drivers
[18:20:38] <wolfyshy> I brought up a core 2 quad with win98.
[18:21:34] <JustAberrant> 98se was the last version of windows I used before pretty much switching exclusively to linux.. I used it into when 2000 was popular.. I have vague memories of 98se getting harder and harder to install due to them making major changes to windows update
[18:22:03] <tiwake> package managers++
[18:22:05] <JustAberrant> like you'd have to do several updates to get windows update to a functioning state, then do several more..
[18:22:28] <JustAberrant> a lot of it was manual downloads because the version that came on the CD no longer worked properly, etc
[18:23:14] <JustAberrant> and I seem to remember something like the dlink driver installer wouldn't work out of the box because the default vid drivers were too shitty and it couldn't display the splash screen properly
[18:23:18] <JustAberrant> oh man...
[18:23:20] <JustAberrant> >windows problems
[18:23:20] <JustAberrant> :D
[18:23:45] * JustAberrant stumbles off on a nostalgia trip .. back in a bit guys.. I'll bring back some DLLs ;p
[18:24:14] <tiwake> anyway, he wants a $1000 computer build, give or take $200
[18:24:54] <Starthunder> wolfyshy: …how did that work? You set some CFLAGS, and it compiled AMD instructions into binaries targeted for x86?
[18:25:11] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: -march=native "misdetected" the intel cpu as an amd
[18:25:17] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: 4.7 erratum
[18:26:50] <Starthunder> ahh. Fixed in a later update?
[18:26:56] <Starthunder> DJ-C0L7[EIT]: teach me your secrets
[18:27:09] * Starthunder 's NAS is not encrypted, beacuse how do you even FDE on a server?
[18:27:34] <JustAberrant> same way you do on any other machine..
[18:28:18] <JustAberrant> un-encrypted boot partition with an initrd to prompt for password, mount the encrypted volume/setup lvm/etc, and continue on

[18:30:48] * JustAberrant raid6 with /boot partition and / partition, / partition is dmcrypt/luks with lvm on top of that then xfs
[18:31:11] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: yes
[18:31:36] <JustAberrant> also nice @ auto detect fail
[18:31:47] <Starthunder> JustAberrant: yes, but then it can't be rebooted unless you're there.
[18:31:48] * JustAberrant didn't trust -march=native for awhile.. but does now :(
[18:32:30] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: well, in my case I'm there (it's a home server), but you can throw something like dropbear in your initrd to allow remote unlocking
[18:33:00] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: it's been fine for me on dozens of desktops, laptops, embedded systems, servers... this was a fluke
[18:33:11] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: because I held back gcc updates on it because it always oom'd
[18:33:43] <wolfyshy> it also had to do with esxi
[18:34:04] <wolfyshy> so if you aren't running gentoo on esxi, even this buggy gcc is safe to use -march=native
[18:34:36] <JustAberrant> fair enough I suppose :)
[18:34:53] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: so basically you end up with a kind of minimal ssh server on initial boot that you can connect to, enter your key/password/whatever, and it'll continue to boot
[18:36:13] <JustAberrant> at least on gentoo that means rolling your own initramfs though.. as I don't think genkernel's will do any of that for you
[18:36:15] <JustAberrant> could be wrong though
[18:37:13] * JustAberrant also uses genkernel's initramfs now.. :(
