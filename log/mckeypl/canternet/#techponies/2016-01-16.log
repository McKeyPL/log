[02:40:14] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: it just feels like such a sloppy language, and has all the downsides of a language that will both let you "get away" with typos due to not requiring explicit declaration and catch other errors at runtime vs compile time due to duck typing
[02:41:07] <JustAberrant> the fact that (at least as far as I've seen) a huge chunk of python code out there is designed with minimal error handling (including popular libraries)
[02:41:35] <JustAberrant> it just feels like a language that's best for stuff where you run it, see you got the results you wanted, and go about your day
[02:41:43] <JustAberrant> I wouldn't trust it to run something on it's own over the long term
[02:43:17] <JustAberrant> all it takes is some check like...  if (is_presrved) instead of  if (is_preserved)  which python will happily run with to break something in the background that you may not notice (especially if it's not in the main code path)
[02:43:41] <wolfyshy> hope you don't have a reason to trust dropbox, washington post, d-link routers, or philips semiconductors
[02:43:52] <JustAberrant> and yes, in a perfect world you'd have full branch coverage testing to catch that kinda thing.. same argument PHP developers put forward (it doesn't matter, just don't make mistakes!)
[02:44:14] <wolfyshy> philips' entire semiconductor fab line runs on python industrial automation systems
[02:44:42] <JustAberrant> there are POS systems out there written in qbasic, doesn't mean it's a good idea
[02:44:46] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: there are plenty of static analysis tools that will catch typos like that
[02:44:51] <wolfyshy> pylint is a big major one
[02:45:32] <JustAberrant> but even assuming that's true.. even assuming you run your code through a battery of unit tests and static analyzers and such... it's still gonna be cheaper to catch that stuff at compile time

[02:46:08] <JustAberrant> vs requiring you to extensively test code to pick up something that would be trivial to catch early
[02:47:01] <JustAberrant> anyway, ignoring my beliefs on it's robustness, I just find it an irritating language
[02:47:54] <JustAberrant> I don't like the tab/indent thing, the way it does exceptions is icky, the _ONE_ case where pretty much every language says "ok fine, we'll automagic that for you"... concatting a number (or any primitive) to a string.. THAT's where python decides to be pissy
[02:48:00] <JustAberrant> like seriously, how did that one come about
[02:48:29] <JustAberrant> having to pass "self" around, I get why, but that's just painfully ugly

[03:18:34] <wolfyshy> I find Python beautiful because of how explicit everything is, it's better than C++ where instead of a reasonable error you get either a 10,000 line compiler error, or a simple "Segmentation fault " / "Runtime detected error!" that takes 10,000 hours to debug
[03:18:38] <wolfyshy> but that's just my opinion

[03:50:13] <JustAberrant> java is wuvily in that regard @ errors

[22:51:49] <Quindo> anyone know of a macro program that works on windows 10?
[22:52:30] <HoneyDrops> ÂµC connected to the PS/2 port, it's platform independent!
[22:57:20] <Quindo> No PS/2 port on this machine.
[22:58:03] <Sakura> I found the PERFECT way to get the domain name I want for free. Have anyone ever used my.ga for a free domain name & if I can renew my domain name after 12 months without any additional cost?
[22:58:38] *** WuBzY is now known as WuBzYIsSleeping
[22:59:38] * Sour_Sweet just pays less than 0.50â¬ per month for a domain and is done.
[23:00:08] <HoneyDrops> USB is harder, but can also hook up a ÂµC to it (but you need one with some sort of USB support)
[23:01:04] <Sour_Sweet> There are a number of free domain providers (e.g. dotTK). Compu uses another one I can't remember right now.
[23:01:12] <HoneyDrops> Also could run it in a VM and use xdotool.
[23:01:16] <Compu> freenom
[23:01:25] <Compu> u can get .ml domains free for a year
[23:01:36] <wolfyshy> nomorex.ml
[23:01:44] <Sour_Sweet> But for anything halfway serious just pay :P
[23:02:00] *** Valiant is now known as Gladiolus
[23:02:22] <Sour_Sweet> There are very cheap domains out there. I do have a couple of more expensive ones though
[23:02:34] <Sour_Sweet> (e.g. dotCC for my mails)
[23:02:34] <Sakura> Can I renew it without charge on Freenom past the first year?
[23:07:38] <Sakura> And is Freenom any good?
[23:24:15] <AppleDash> All of those free domain providers are controlled by the same entity, that is, those for .tk, .ml, and .cf
[23:24:39] <AppleDash> If you are running a site and it gets much traffic, they will park your domain and point it at an ad page with no notice
[23:25:16] <Sour_Sweet> Sounds like a good business model to me xD
[23:26:46] <Sakura> So, they would screw me over if it gets popular is what you're saying?
[23:27:38] <AppleDash> Possibly. It happened to me, it happened to many other people, but that was back in 2012
[23:27:55] <AppleDash> Also, sites with free domains are generally seen as less legitimate than those with non-free domains
[23:29:29] *** Quits: Dude (DudeWiD@ttitude) (Connection closed)
[23:30:39] <Sakura> Damn. Sorry that happened to you. Personally I wouldn't give a damn if it were a personal page but if I was to make a community-based social network site, then that's crap I don't want to happen to my registered users.
[23:32:09] <Quindo> ^
[23:33:24] <Sakura> My users would be screwed over and I'd get blamed for it most likely even though I'd be just as screwed as everyone else.
[23:36:06] <Sour_Sweet> Domains are not that expensive anymore anyway. Even a student should be able to afford one these days.
[23:36:59] <Sour_Sweet> My first domain had a very generic name, so I could use it's subdomains for all my stuff.
[23:37:41] <Sakura> That's true. I mean, you pay 0.50 Euro for your domain name.
[23:38:00] <Sour_Sweet> Less than that for .de domains actually
[23:38:07] <JustAberrant> also free domains tend to end up in a lot of blacklists / spam filters
[23:38:13] <JustAberrant> if you plan on doing email it's definitely a bad idea ;p
[23:38:22] * AppleDash whitelists JustAberrant :>
[23:38:32] <JustAberrant> :>
[23:39:27] <Sakura> How cheap are .ie domain names?
[23:39:38] <One-Trick> email is ridiculous, especially if the ip youre originating from has ever ever-ever-ever-ever been blasklisted in, like, ever
[23:41:31] <Sour_Sweet> My mail server works just fine. Only had a problem with Hotmail and got it resolved. I guess they banned the whole subnet
[23:41:49] <Sour_Sweet> They suck anyway >.>
[23:42:07] * HoneyDrops wishes self-hosting e-mail was the norm.
[23:42:22] <Sour_Sweet> (A bigger problem would be Outlook.com, but I dunno if there was a problem)
[23:42:38] <HoneyDrops> Same with personal pages.  All connections should be symmetrical.
[23:44:22] <Sour_Sweet> I don't know about self hosted e-mail for everyone. That would massively increase spam. Dial-up blacklists work very well.
[23:45:36] <Sour_Sweet> I guess that could be solved with smart relays, but that defeats the purpose of self hosted e-mail services
[23:46:28] <JustAberrant> yeah, it's really easy to fuck up a mail server, and there's a _reason_ home ISP blocks and temp domains get blacklisted
[23:46:56] *** Joins: Valiant (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there)
[23:48:37] <JustAberrant> and various philosophical issues aside, it really does make more sense to have a few big guys who mostly do it right, are usually reliable, and can handle DoS attacks and such than have everyone try to half ass it on their home computers and shitty internet connections

[23:49:42] <Sour_Sweet> Also spam senders are so freaking dumb. Some spam mails I get have a valid DKIM signature, but fail for the older DomainKeys which renders a big red banner on my mail interface. Also they'll probably never get headers right. It's really not that hard.

[23:55:47] <Sakura> So, what domain name provider & hosting service do you use, Sour_Sweet?
[23:57:09] <Sour_Sweet> Sakura: I have 3 domains on Namecheap which was also recommended by ponies around here
[23:58:28] <Sakura> And I see they provide VPS's.
[23:59:35] <Sour_Sweet> I don't know if they're any good. I have a physically dedicated server from a German provider ;-)
[23:59:48] <AppleDash> Web hosting sucks
[23:59:51] <AppleDash> Namecheap VPSes suck
