[10:24:06] <Anthro_ButterScotch> Shit..forgot the name of the one I used a littlw
[10:24:11] <init3> I'm considering Blackarch but I usually like to work off of personal recommendations. 
[10:24:15] <roflin> do you mean something like kali/blackarch?
[10:24:21] <init3> I had used kali
[10:24:29] <init3> Indeed
[10:24:59] <roflin> well I haven't used them much, but I like arch better than debian based systems nowadays. but since it's a live cd that's doesn't really matter i suppose.
[10:25:14] <init3> Yeah. 
[10:25:30] <init3> I mean, I am an arch user primararly so I was thinking blackarch. 
[10:25:55] <init3> Though my servers are all debian so I am profecient with debian as well. 
[10:26:34] <init3> BUt I was thinking, the great thing about arch is the rolling release, which essentally doesn't apply in the case of a livecd. 
[10:26:36] <roflin> well the upside of kali is that you can easily browse trough all the apps that are preinstalled. I don't know if blackarch has that.
[10:26:52] <init3> Hmm
[10:28:32] <Anthro_ButterScotch> Isn't there a live CD called BlackHat?
[10:28:34] <init3> You mean like this: http://blackarch.org/images/screenshots/openbox.png ? Or something else.

[10:31:06] <init3> Oh, no it isn't
[10:31:22] <init3> err. I take that back
[10:31:29] <init3> Backtrack is Kali now.
[10:33:09] <init3> Basically, I'm having trouble deciding between Kali and Blackarch. Maybe I'll just download them both and play with them on a VM. They are live CDs after all.
