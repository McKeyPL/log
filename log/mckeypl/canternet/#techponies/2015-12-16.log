While yes, cheating is stupid (as well as wrong), there are valid reasons you'd want to do that: eg: to re the client to create mods, to patch bugs, or to implement accessibility features for those with disabilities.

[01:41:26] <init3> Has anyone else noticed that when working IT in a small shop, you often get called on to do what would go to a maintenance department if you'd had one? Our PC tech is pretty much in charge of fixing the coffee maker and I spent my afternoon moving shit for a company potluck this afternoon. 
[01:42:26] <init3> I don't mind in the least bit but I think it is kind of intresting that in a few jobs I've worked, IT is just generally "the people who help when shit is borked" extending into tons of shit. 
[01:42:50] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> sounds like when i did tech support in a "front line" call center
[01:44:13] <init3> What do you mean?  You get stuck doing menial tasks?
[01:45:00] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> "i bought a computer in the store the other day, and now my coffee maker doesnt work, does my warranty cover that"
[01:45:17] <init3> Fucking hell
[01:45:29] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> or the crazy "cat lady" that called in complaining that the computer she purchased in the store was defective because her "cup holder" broke
[01:46:35] <init3> I have heard variations on that same story too many times to consider it purely myth. 
[01:46:44] <init3> Though nowadays that'

[03:03:38] <init3> I just wonder about what it says about an IT department for that to happen you know?

[03:06:38] <init3> Could be.

[08:46:19] <Moonlightning> If you're about to wipe the disk or whatever, THEN, yes, kill it and go ahead with your wipe
[08:46:38] <Cyan_Spark> My Time Machine backups are on there :v
[08:46:42] <Moonlightning> else…just chill! Let it run its FileSystem ChecK and do something else.
[08:46:45] <Cyan_Spark> I didn't intend to wipe it
[08:47:01] <Cyan_Spark> Does Power Nap allow fsck to continue?
[08:47:22] <Moonlightning> I don't know how Power Nap works with command-line stuff. I would advise against power state changes.
[08:47:31] <Moonlightning> i.e. any kind of sleeping or shutting down
[08:47:44] <Cyan_Spark> No I mean if I close the lid of my laptop while connected to AC will the process still run? :P
[08:48:01] <Moonlightning> That will almost certainly put it to sleep.
[08:48:13] <Moonlightning> Generally, processes are suspended when the machine is. :p
[08:48:22] <Moonlightning> As for Power Nap, I dunno. I'd advise against it.
[08:48:51] <Cyan_Spark> O.o
[08:48:58] <Compu> i need help with linux, im booting from a live usb and i keep getting this error in apt-get http://www.compu.ml/images/screenshot.png
[08:49:06] <Moonlightning> [23:47:22] < Moonlightning> I don't know how Power Nap works with command-line stuff. I would advise against power state changes.

[08:49:59] <Compu> Moonlightning: so what do i do?
[08:50:04] <Compu> its from the live usb
[08:50:09] <Moonlightning> …oh, never mind; I missed the last bit; it totally is apt-get-related.
[08:50:27] <Moonlightning> Uh…did you try `sudo apt-get update` first? May or may not fail similarly.
[08:51:02] <Cyan_Spark> Command line? I haven't executed anything from Terminal 
[08:51:03] <Moonlightning> IO error…is the USB disk you're booted from solid? Like, I know I have a couple that are flaky (you wiggle them accidentally and they disconnect)
[08:51:16] <Cyan_Spark> fsck just starting running... I dunno, when I ejected my disk?
[08:51:52] <Moonlightning> Cyan_Spark: more likely, when you plugged it in. And, fair enough, I guess, but I know `fsck` as a command-line thing.
[08:52:15] <Moonlightning> Besides, isn't Power Nap supposed to be power-saving?
[08:52:20] <Cyan_Spark> No...
[08:52:26] <Moonlightning> No?
[08:52:27] <Cyan_Spark> Enabling it uses more power while the lid is down x3
[08:52:44] <Moonlightning> well, yes, but definitely less power than keeping the machine running fully. :P
[08:52:49] <Moonlightning> A lot less.
[08:53:03] <Moonlightning> fscking is not conducive to not using a lot of power, as you can see from its CPU usage. ;p
[08:53:46] <Cyan_Spark> Okay so if I pull the lid down, Power Nap or not, the process will still be suspended...
[08:53:57] <Cyan_Spark> Ponyfeathers, I was gonna take a nap
[08:54:07] <Moonlightning> My expectations from you hypothetically putting it to sleep right now: Bestcase, fsck is suspended and then resumed when the machine wakes up later; worstcase, fsck dies a horrible and gruesome death in the middle of a write to the filesystem, fucking it up entirely.

[08:58:13] <Moonlightning> Cyan_Spark: Okay, so…there's this thing called `caffeinate`, and it will (supposedly—I've never tried it this way) let you keep the machine completely unsuspended with the lid closed, as /long/ as it stays on AC power. Now, Apple would almost certainly advise against that, /especially/ since it's going to be running hot what with that fsck and all…
[08:58:25] <Cyan_Spark> uh
[08:58:38] <Compu> Moonlightning: fsck is the linux equivalent of chkdsk basically

[09:00:02] <Moonlightning> Nuuuuuuuuu
[09:00:05] <Cyan_Spark> If it does, it means fsck is still reading, right?
[09:00:15] <Cyan_Spark> o.o

[10:48:33] <Moonlightning> The only /possible/ way for the system files to be bad in a //byte-for-byte copy// is for it to nto actually be a byte-for-byte copy.
[10:48:40] <Moonlightning> Which means there was an IO error.
[10:48:56] <Moonlightning> So either you /got/ an IO error during that `dd`, or one of the disks was bad.
[10:49:16] <Moonlightning> I mean, assuming the system files were good on the source disk.
[10:49:26] *** Joins: Cyan_Spark (Cyan_Spark@incidental.unicorn.Cyan_Spark)
[10:50:32] <Compu> Moonlightning: the source disk stopped booting before dd was run
[10:50:40] <Compu> so there probably was an error
[10:51:30] <Compu> anyways now i gotta wait for ubuntu to collect all my files on my old hdd and copy them to my portable hdd i got
[10:51:36] <Compu> 600+ GB of files
[10:51:41] <Moonlightning> …well, in that case…back up|snapshot, reinstall Windows?
[10:51:50] <Moonlightning> also, check your stuff
[10:51:55] <Moonlightning> in case more was corrupted
[10:52:20] <Compu> Moonlightning: im just copying everything
[10:54:34] <Compu> Moonlightning: ubuntu will tell me if theres an error reading something
[10:55:25] <Moonlightning> If it detects one.
[10:56:55] <Moonlightning> …what the hell?
[10:57:06] <Moonlightning> Okay, so on a completely unrelated note, apparently BSD tr is slow as BALLS
[10:57:27] <Moonlightning> I just piped a gig of /dev/zero through BSD tr, and then GNU tr on the same system, and then out to a file
[10:57:53] <Moonlightning> The former took 7m35s.
[10:58:01] <Moonlightning> The latter, 17s.

[12:02:22] <Compu> if thats the case im gonna reformat the portable hdd to ext4 before i copy everything
[12:03:09] <Compu> Moonlightning: by the way u can get windows drivers for ext4
[12:04:25] <Moonlightning> Well, I'm 100% done with Windows, so
