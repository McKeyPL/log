[03:07:52] <init3> But apache 1.3 was on a lts thing. Not sure if it stil is.
[03:08:03] <init3> hue
[03:08:47] <init3> I think that openssl is post heartbleed though. 
[03:09:14] <init3> Oh, no that's before HB was a thing. 
[03:10:13] <init3> Yeah, 1.3 was one of those things they did backports for
[03:10:57] <CompuDesktop> init3: i wonder who is still running this webpage
[03:11:03] <init3> But not any longer. 2.2 is  considered legacy. httpd does not update all that often besides security fixes as you might imagine. 
[03:11:23] <init3> I mean, I wonder if it hosts other things. 
[03:11:37] <init3> Well, let's see /where/ the server is. 
[03:12:22] <init3> HAHA i thought I recognized that netblock
[03:12:29] <init3> It's where I used to work.

[03:15:06] <init3> I mean, we were mostly a dedicated server provider. 
[03:15:19] <init3> So could be anything, but in this case. 
[03:15:44] <init3> I bet I could tell you where that server is within 15 feet. 
[03:16:22] <init3> [jason@jason-lt:~]$host 64.91.245.1
[03:16:24] <init3> 1.245.91.64.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer sharedspace.liquidweb.com.
[03:16:46] <init3> Just look at that hostname. That tells you something. 
[03:17:05] <init3> Because that company has well over 100 shared servers now.
[03:17:15] <init3> Well it did in 2010
[03:17:38] <CompuDesktop> init3: oh so theyre just hosting it for someone else?
[03:17:51] <init3> So this is probably one of their oldest shared servers. 
[03:18:23] <init3> If it was somone else's, it wouldn't have a X.liquidweb.com PTR
[03:19:19] <init3> I mean, it could be a different server, but that .1 is the closest IP with a PTR
[03:20:44] <init3> Upgrading clients from Apache 1.3 to 2.x would break a lot of shit (something like static HTML not so much) so we'd offer users a free upgrade. 
[03:21:06] <init3> And by that I mean migration to another server. 
[03:21:24] <CompuDesktop> mmmm
[03:21:29] <init3> But if they did not want or did not respond we just left them be. 
[03:22:06] <CompuDesktop> so some guy is paying for a server that just seems to run this super old website and is not being updated much?
[03:22:25] <init3> My bet is it is a shared server. 
[03:22:42] <init3> That yeah, probably never gets touched. 
[03:23:34] <CompuDesktop> i wonder why its still being run
[03:23:36] <init3> If I didn't lose my old phone I could make a few calls and get you specs on the server. 
[03:23:47] <init3> Because someone is still paying for it of course. 
[03:24:21] <HoneyDrops> I remember that site.  Ah, when web design was at its peak~
[03:24:47] <init3> If the hardware ever dies they'll move them to something newer but when I left we had Cent 5 (newest at the time) boxen running legacy apache for customers that need it. 
[03:25:15] <init3> Telling some people to update their code is just impossible.

[23:17:27] <tiwake> Init3-away: interesting... I'm curious if there is an open source thing for the computer that actually runs the car
[23:17:48] <Starthunder> …the buck?
[23:17:57] <Starthunder> weechat isn't resolving {irc,chat}.freenode.net
[23:18:00] <Starthunder> but `host` gets it just fine
[23:34:01] *** Joins: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-cg3.e4s.162.101.IP)
[23:35:21] <Starthunder> groan
[23:35:33] <Starthunder> Seems it can't do /any/ of the Freenode hostnames
[23:37:04] <wolfyshy> can it do it without TLS?
[23:37:17] <wolfyshy> I know weechat uses gnutls, and I know gnutls uses dane, and I know dane is broken right now
[23:37:22] <Starthunder> It's not /resolving./
[23:37:49] <Starthunder> dane is broken?
[23:38:09] <wolfyshy> on .net
[23:38:11] <wolfyshy> I think
[23:38:20] <wolfyshy> I thought I read about that yesterday or this morning
[23:38:34] <Starthunder> Well…it should resolve at least, yeah?
[23:38:52] <wolfyshy> if it's using DANE, it won't resolve, because DNSSEC for that domain is down
[23:39:03] <wolfyshy> that is handled the same as any other name resolution error
[23:39:11] <wolfyshy> hence: try without ssl
[23:39:27] <wolfyshy> maybe /server new so your sasl stuff won't be leaked
[23:39:34] <Starthunder> By reporting to the user /name not found/ and then /nodename nor servname provided, or not known/? :|
[23:39:51] <wolfyshy> name not found, yes
[23:40:01] <Starthunder> As opposed to, I dunno, /no DNSSEC record found/? >.>

[23:40:11] <wolfyshy> it doesn't distinguish those, as I said
[23:40:20] <wolfyshy> I don't know if freenode /does/ dane
[23:40:28] <wolfyshy> I'm just saying that is a possible cause
[23:40:33] <wolfyshy> and that's a way to rule it out
[23:41:38] <Starthunder> Well, `gnutls-cli irc.freenode.net -p 6697` works fine
[23:41:53] <wolfyshy> hmm
[23:41:57] <wolfyshy> interesting
[23:42:14] <Starthunder> Are you on Freenode?
[23:42:29] <Starthunder> It's been disconnecting me with /Excess flood/ a lot lately
[23:45:50] <wolfyshy> idle: 01 hours 31 minutes 02 seconds, signon at: Sun, 30 Aug 2015 13:58:10
[23:45:55] <wolfyshy> ^ me on freenode
[23:46:04] <Starthunder> Which server?
[23:46:12] <wolfyshy> leguin
[23:46:23] <Dusk> I'm on card still
[23:46:26] <Dusk> lol
[23:47:10] <Starthunder> Nope.
[23:47:12] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: there was a guy on #gentoo-kde.. oh god I hope it wasn't you, I don't think it was though, he was connecting from .de
[23:47:16] <Starthunder> What's going on here?
[23:47:23] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: he cycled with "Excess flood" every 2 minutes for TWELVE HOURS
[23:47:28] <Starthunder> No; I haven't been in #gentoo-kde
[23:47:40] <Starthunder> I did run overnight a couple times I think though… X.X
[23:47:47] <Starthunder> I'm gonna clear my autojoin and see if that helps
[23:47:56] <wolfyshy> it was like oh god guy please fix your crap
[23:48:09] <wolfyshy> over 3500 join/quits
[23:48:37] <Starthunder> ban to Freenode/##fix_your_connection ?
[23:50:33] <wolfyshy> I don't have op yet
[23:50:35] <wolfyshy> lol
[23:50:50] <Starthunder> Okay, I'm back on…for now.
[23:50:51] *** zz_CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob
[23:51:02] <Dusk> I'm connected now
[23:51:05] <Starthunder> …dear Luna. weechat sends one /join per channel?
[23:51:12] <wolfyshy> I didn't see the hotbar light up so I guess we don't share channels
[23:51:21] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: yes, because some servers don't support ,
[23:51:26] <Starthunder> ##fingerprints,##fingerprints-meta,#python,#swift-lang,#tox,#tox-dev,#btrfs right now
[23:51:30] <Dusk> wolfyshy: Nope I just connected back :p
[23:51:35] <Starthunder> …
[23:51:37] <Starthunder> You're kidding.
[23:51:40] <Starthunder> It's in the original RFC!!
[23:51:44] <Starthunder> How do you NOT SUPPORT THAT?
[23:51:48] <wolfyshy> Starthunder: :D
[23:51:55] <wolfyshy> idr which one it was
[23:52:21] <wolfyshy> oh I gave up on #python
[23:52:50] <wolfyshy> there was more trolling going on there than #defuckus
[23:53:09] <Starthunder> Is /excess flood/ also used for /sendq exceeded/?
[23:53:20] <wolfyshy> no, they are different
[23:53:34] <Starthunder> …then why'd I get disconnected that one time? I hadn't said anything in hours…
[23:53:45] <Starthunder> And it suddenly disconnected me, excess flood
[23:53:54] <wolfyshy> sendq exceeded means you have sent X bytes that the server has not yet processed, and it is kicking you
[23:54:10] <wolfyshy> excess flood means you have sent X lines in Y seconds, and the server admin has configured that to be a flood, and it is kicking you
[23:54:10] <Starthunder> …wait, I thought it was the other way around.
[23:54:30] <Starthunder> server's send queue, not client's
[23:55:02] <Starthunder> There are X bytes that the server hasn't yet sent, and it's killing you
[23:55:03] <wolfyshy> maybe it is
[23:55:11] <wolfyshy> I always got sendq and recvq confused
[23:55:15] <wolfyshy> I think you might be right, actually.
