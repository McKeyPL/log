[03:44:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> Developer Accused Of Unreadable Code Refuses To Comment
[03:45:09] <cyborg_ar> hahahhaa
[03:45:56] <JustAberrant> all the sigh
[03:46:05] <cyborg_ar> Datacenter 1 Uptime: 94.6% Datacenter 2 Uptime: 92.0% Cloud Sales Rep: "We have 186.6% Uptime."
[03:46:07] <cyborg_ar> HAHAHHA
[03:46:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> cyborg_ar: LOL
[03:46:40] <AppleDash> xD
[03:46:40] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:46:46] <JustAberrant> oh man, that's the new trend now..
[03:46:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats brilliantly stupid
[03:46:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> i love it
[03:46:50] <JustAberrant> "combined years of experience"
[03:46:55] <cyborg_ar> JustAberrant: Recruiter Confident Java Developer Can Learn The Script Part
[03:47:05] <AppleDash> lol
[03:48:12] <Phase> best one imo: "Appstatic (YC '14) is hiring a Senior Swift Engineer with at least 3 years experience."
[03:48:45] <JustAberrant> hah, that's an old one
[03:48:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> cyborg_ar: that just went to the cloud guys in my taem
[03:49:01] <JustAberrant> the answer is to say you have  "x years of swift AND SIMILAR technologies"
[03:49:06] <Phase> JustAberrant, recent enough to be relevant
[03:50:05] <cyborg_ar> "Programming is 1% inspiration, 99% trying to get your environment working."
[03:50:35] <cyborg_ar> as an emacs user it can vary from 10% to 134.2%
[03:56:09] <cyborg_ar> :)
[03:56:52] <cyborg_ar> JustAberrant: i always found that metric unbelievably retarded
[03:57:07] <cyborg_ar> it asumes 30 rookies measure the same as a guy with 30 years of experience
[03:57:08] <JustAberrant> combined experience.. yeah
[03:57:15] <JustAberrant> give me average experience.. 
[03:57:20] <cyborg_ar> yes that's better
[03:57:29] <JustAberrant> combined experience could mean you have a whole floor of interns or two really smart guys
[03:57:29] <cyborg_ar> because less experienced people count as negativ
[03:57:31] <cyborg_ar> e
[03:57:51] <cyborg_ar> which is usually the case because the productivity of the most experienced folks might drop lecturing the new guys
[03:58:03] <JustAberrant> hah
[03:58:17] <JustAberrant> I know it's horrible, but when I got two co-op students, it was a serious hit on productivity
[03:58:27] <cyborg_ar> yeah
[03:58:34] <JustAberrant> they wern't even that bad.. but they were only half way through their program, so yeah
[03:58:42] <cyborg_ar> actually a more precise metric is mean experience plus the standard deviation
[03:58:58] <cyborg_ar> if the standard deviation is huge then there's gonna be a bigger productivity drop
[03:59:26] <cyborg_ar> since people are not really in the same page
[03:59:39] <JustAberrant> the amount of time I spent hand holding, plus combined time lost by others answering questions, having a build fail, and extra rounds of code review (usually stuff here gets a round, maybe 2 if serious comments.. they had like 10+).. 
[03:59:41] <JustAberrant> it all adds up
[04:00:06] <cyborg_ar> though years of experience would have to be linearized before averaging 
[04:00:14] <JustAberrant> and the usual solution of putting them on some make work project is just shitty
[04:00:45] <cyborg_ar> since experience tends to follow a power law
[04:00:56] <JustAberrant> yeah
[04:01:07] <cyborg_ar> there's a turning point where more time doing the thing doesnt really add as much as the previous years
[04:01:29] <cyborg_ar> so you can linearize, average, and project again into the original distribution
[04:01:32] <cyborg_ar> lol
[04:01:48] <JustAberrant> though the depth of knowledge for some stuff we do does even it out somewhat
[04:02:02] <JustAberrant> theres some specific areas where one can basically make a career of being an SME
[04:02:38] <JustAberrant> and never really hit a point where you know everything you need and are only making slight improvement
[04:20:58] <cyborg_ar> sme?
[04:21:10] <JustAberrant> subject matter expert
[04:21:56] <JustAberrant> but yeah, at that point it's not about the programming, it's about some other knowledge
[04:22:01] <cyborg_ar> well in that case the metric wouldnt be experience but exposure/research
[04:22:09] <JustAberrant> and possibly being involved in some standards organization around it
[04:22:18] <cyborg_ar> and how recent the knowledge is
[04:22:57] <JustAberrant> when we show off, it's usually by listening things like that.. "was involved in the discussion of.."
[04:23:00] <cyborg_ar> say, an expert in computer networking with 10 years of work wouldnt be terribly useful today if those 10 years were 1981-1991
[04:23:18] <cyborg_ar> unless the project at hand needs that knowledge
[04:23:26] <cyborg_ar> say transitioning a legacy system
[04:23:34] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:24:09] <cyborg_ar> soon computer archeologist will be a serious role, if it isn't already
[04:24:26] <cyborg_ar> people that specialize on how old system worked, specially if they are still working
[04:24:33] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:24:56] <JustAberrant> I imagine someone in like a dim library, pouring over the ancient dot matrix scrolls
[04:25:09] <cyborg_ar> haha boxes and boxes of fan fold
[04:25:18] <cyborg_ar> and mountains of tape
[04:26:16] <cyborg_ar> "These are the remains of the ancient city of UNIVAC"
[04:26:21] <JustAberrant> "The ancients were very concerned about memory. They spent a great deal of time describing how they thought it should be moved about. "
[04:27:02] <JustAberrant> "Not willing to trust the computer to manage it's own information properly"
[04:27:16] <cyborg_ar> the ancients used this huge altar called UNISERVO to store and retrieve their data in what appear to be spools of metalic tape, where data was invisibly scribbled by magnetism
[04:27:46] <cyborg_ar> there are reports of much prayer and processions around the machines to ask the gods for mercy on their data
[04:28:29] <cyborg_ar> once the engine computed the results they needed, the output data was s
[04:28:44] <cyborg_ar> cribed with these noisy contraptions called line printers
[04:29:04] <cyborg_ar> and stored in machine readable form as a deck of thin, perforated, cellulose tablets
[04:29:59] <cyborg_ar> hehehe
[04:33:04] <JustAberrant> :>
[04:34:14] <cyborg_ar> very few examples survive to this day, since the Ancients did not seem to care about the future preservation of their data back then
[04:35:03] <cyborg_ar> still, we are trying to unravel the mystery of this thing once called "internet", there are many records that point to their existence, but there's no surviving evidence of it's content
[04:36:22] *** BlackCat is now known as Nelly
[04:37:02] <cyborg_ar> based on the disjoint and nonsensical evidence, the leading theory is that this internet thing was a collective hallucination caused by the ritual consumption of the primitive psychoactive substances available in that era
[04:37:29] <cyborg_ar> man that's what i would like to know from 1000 years in the future
[04:37:34] <cyborg_ar> how people are gonna look at us
[04:44:36] <tiwake> heh
[04:44:46] <tiwake> who cares

[06:41:38] <Lapsus> Yay printing >.>
[06:42:29] <Lapsus> I thought the automated bed leveling wasn't working, but apparently the bed is just close enough that I don't notice
[06:43:46] <Sukasa> one of the guys at the makerspace here had to deal with that
[06:44:00] <Sukasa> someone messed with repetier-host and disabled the automatic bed levelling at the start of each print..
[06:44:07] <Sukasa> ended up messing a couple prints up until we figured it out
[06:44:21] <Sombra> How many blue tooth channels does the average android smartphone have?
[06:44:39] <Sombra> In other words, how many bluetooth devices can you connect to at once?
[06:46:45] <Lapsus> google says something like 7 active and 248 in sleep mode, but it's not the most convincing answer
[06:47:36] <Lapsus> Sukasa: Well, I found out that it was working by sticking a finger into the endstop when it was leveling and making it air-print for a bit, so I didn't waste much filament
[06:48:04] <Lapsus> What kind of printer do you guys have there? I need to find a makerspace near here one of these days
