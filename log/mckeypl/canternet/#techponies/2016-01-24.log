[02:33:15] <Moonlightning> Sometimes, switching terminals away from one running X will just break everything
[02:33:28] <Moonlightning> The screen will be on, but completely black, and you can still /do/ stuff, even though you're blind

[02:36:26] <JustAberrant> :(
[02:36:31] * Renny actually knows next to nothing about computers
[02:36:56] <JustAberrant> anything in the X log?
[02:37:07] <JustAberrant> either way sounds like X and or drivers being shitty? ;p
[02:37:22] <JustAberrant> either tha or dpms issue
[02:37:30] <JustAberrant> actually try dpms force on next time it happens
[02:38:32] <Moonlightning> Mmm...
[02:38:42] <Moonlightning> There's some stuff about suspending and then resuming AIGLX clients for VT switch
[02:39:37] <Moonlightning> Oh, also, sometimes if I switch away from an X tty, it'll just /die/ when I switch back. There'll be a log on the screen, like immediately after you invoke `startx`, rather than the DE
[02:39:49] <JustAberrant> :(
[02:40:42] <Moonlightning> Dunno if that's relevant.
[02:40:53] <Moonlightning> I don't seem to have a `dpms`.
