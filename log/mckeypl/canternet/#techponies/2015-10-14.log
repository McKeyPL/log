[00:18:46] <Sour_Sweet> O.K. decision is made. My .de domains will be registered with my server hosting company. They are way cheaper than any other international company, not THE cheapest local company, but I know their service is O.K. . Everything else moves to namecheap.

I have tools already in place that can verify DNSSEC secured entries and together with TLSA that would have been an option. My current provider doesn't offer DNSSEC either, so I don't loose much.

[00:35:20] <Sour_Sweet> O_o They are more expensive than Hetzner (Not that under 5,-€ is much in any case).  Their feature list is impressive. I'll take a closer look. Thank you ;-)
[00:37:13] <johnsey> DNSSEC may require a manual inquiry, dunno if that changed yet, but they supported it semi-officially last time I checked
[00:37:14] <Sour_Sweet> johnsey: Oh. btw. Is it intentional that you have to have a nickname grouped with nickserv to be able to use !mail (e.g. being logged in as a different nick is not enough)? That hit me quite unexpected when I've used it last time.

[00:42:54] <Sour_Sweet> Btw. the cheapest source for .de domains I could find appears to be https://www.do.de/ . I don't like their payment policy for new customers, but I guess for long term bulk registration they're fine. With 1,99€/y they are incredibly cheap
[00:42:56] <PinkiePieBot> [ Domain Check & Webhosting für alle guenstig zu kaufen ]
[00:53:01] <johnsey> if it's a matter of a few EUR/year, i tend to favor a reliable, professional service over a cheap, shady one. less worries about them losing my data or allowing takeovers by fax or some crap. not to mention a bunch of extra features the slightly more expensive service may offer

[22:17:10] * Moonlightning frowns.
[22:17:20] <Moonlightning> I have a zsh that's taking up oddly large chunks of CPU time
[22:17:34] <Moonlightning> It's running in ttys013, which doesn't seem to exist.
[22:17:41] <Moonlightning> I can't find it, anyway…
[22:18:26] <Moonlightning> It's not any of the GUI terminals I have open
[22:18:32] <Moonlightning> It's not any of the terminals I have in tmux
[22:18:52] <Moonlightning> and yes, I checked the terminal that was attached to tmux
[22:19:04] <Moonlightning> It's the only thing running in that terminal.
[22:20:12] <Moonlightning> Started about a week ago.
[22:23:13] <Moonlightning> `w` doesn't say anything about ttys013
