[19:16:34] <init3> AppleDash: I think some versions of rsync pretend they 'copied' data that it skipped because it was the same. 
[19:16:38] <init3> I think
[19:18:09] <AppleDash> This isn't rsync
[19:18:10] <AppleDash> this is dd
[19:18:16] <init3> Oh
[19:18:26] <init3> dd is lying
[19:18:29] <init3> lol
[19:19:43] <Compu> ooh the first part of season 5 is on netflix!
[19:19:56] <init3> Why does Chromium have to be so damned fast and compatible? FF has so many issues playing media and being leggy for me but is like everything I want so I end up installing a bunch of chromium extentions to make it more like firefox
[19:20:20] <init3> Yar. It is how I "tested" my networking to my TV was working. 
[19:23:34] <johnsey> AppleDash: 689 MB in 30 seconds is still within the specifications of USB2.0
[19:23:59] <init3> Yeah but not 1.4GB/s
[19:24:13] <johnsey> that's just the speed of transfering it to the cache
[19:24:22] <init3> ohhhh
[19:24:27] <init3> Makes sense
[19:24:31] <johnsey> which is why the sync takes 30s
[19:24:37] <init3> RIght
[19:26:23] <johnsey> you can dd with conv=sync
[19:26:26] <init3> I need to compile a bunch of Chromium extensions and call it "I'm foxy" or some shit that makes it just like firefox. Stupid shit I miss, like "vriw background image"

[19:50:10] <init3> I do hate how Mozilla does their version numbering. Seems like this might qualify as a major release but you can't tell because to them /everything/ is a major release. 
[19:52:14] <init3> My biggest problem is I can't get FF to properly play youtube videos with HTML5 in anything but 360 or 720. I didn't mind before when I had 10Mbit internet but now that I have 100mbit I'd like to watch 1080.

[19:56:42] <HoneyDrops|Half> Anypony have advice on uMatrix vs RequestPolicy?  I'm considering migrating over to uMatrix, as I like the option to control requests by type, however requestpolicy allows fro filtering based on requester (eg: Domain A requests from B and C, and B also requests from C.  ReqPol lets me allow A to call C, but still block B)  Does anyone know if uMatrix can do this and I'm just missing it?
