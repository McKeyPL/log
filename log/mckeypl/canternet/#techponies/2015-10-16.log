[00:07:29] <wolfyshy> johnsey: and how many of those bugs are still openly exploitable on the majority of handsets?
[00:07:33] <wolfyshy> all code is buggy
[00:07:51] <wolfyshy> google's approach to security is "that's not my problem, bug samsung/htc"
[00:07:54] <johnsey> apple isn't really known for quick bug fixes
[00:07:59] <wolfyshy> their approach is "bug your carrier"
[00:08:04] <wolfyshy> carrier's approach is "buy a new phone"
[00:08:33] <wolfyshy> johnsey: all I know is all the 0days on iOS were fixed within 2-3 weeks when I had an iPhone (4)
[00:08:41] <HoneyDrops> I would love to see a phone system based upon some sort of keypair system.  You can only call someone if you have one of their public keys, users could make as many as they want so that they can trivially partition contacts.  (eg: have a business keypair for associates, a personal one, etc.)   If you wanted you could even one-off a keys to make it nigh impossible to pattern communications.
[00:08:46] <wolfyshy> johnsey: meanwhile, it took t-mobile 4 MONTHS to push an update for stagefright
[00:09:32] <johnsey> that's not google's fault though
[00:09:56] <wolfyshy> and because HTC ships a messenger app that can't have auto-MMS downloading disabled...

[00:11:04] <Moonlightning> too bad that ain't never gon happen, HoneyDrops ;-;
[00:12:42] <Sour_Sweet> Handset makers just need to stop customizing parts of the system that require them to update their code with every update and use some sort of APIs instead. You could just use vanilla updates then
[00:13:21] <Moonlightning> ^
[00:13:50] <Sour_Sweet> And they way their UIs work and Google's approach to constantly change everything with every update is at least to some degree Google's fault

[01:22:40] <Gigabit> I almost jizzed in my shorts today at work. Michigan education association data systems had a conference at work today and it was huge. VMware, Microsoft,Intel, sheti and a shit ton others were there.
[01:23:52] <Lapsus> tiwork: I expect that my printer can't get enough force to engrave like one of your machines, but i'm thinking of trying to build/attach a drag knife for cutting paper and vinyl. Any suggestions on how to go about it?

[01:24:35] <tiwork> Lapsus: uh
[01:24:52] <tiwork> Lapsus: what is a drag knife?
[01:24:52] <Lapsus> you know more about cnc in general than I do
[01:25:06] <tiwork> oh
[01:25:12] <tiwork> a "plotter"
[01:25:23] <Lapsus> you know the engraver that you were doing zippos on? like that but with a razor instead
[01:25:50] <Lapsus> the reduction in z height wouldn't be a problem because it'd only be cutting one sheet anyways
[01:25:50] <tiwork> have you looked at plotter design?
[01:26:19] <Lapsus> well, I have a 3d printer just to my left, so the x/y/z and toolchain is pretty much there
[01:26:44] <Lapsus> though I'd need to figure out a way to go from a vector to a cut instead of from a stl to gcode
[01:26:47] <tiwork> oh ok, so you just want to drop in a head attachment or something
[01:27:03] <Lapsus> yeah, I want to build a head with a drag knife
[01:27:25] <Lapsus> I'll probably also try it with a sharpie first just to be sure of the toolpath
[01:27:35] <tiwork> yeah
[01:27:43] <tiwork> should work
[01:28:00] <Lapsus> I'll eventually be reworking the whole carriage to use connectors instead of wiring everything straight in
[01:28:02] <tiwork> I mean, you can get most things to work, it just depends on how much effort you want to put in
[01:28:25] <tiwork> which also depends on the state of the object to begin with
[01:28:33] <Lapsus> well, I have a 3d printer and stuff, I just don't know how exactly to go about making anything new
[01:29:42] <tiwork> whenever somebody asks me "can you make this", my answer is almost always "yes", because I most likely can... it just depends on how much they want to pay me, then I decide if its worth it for the amount of effort to the amount of money I get for it
[01:30:01] <Lapsus> in theory I also would have a spare stepper driver if the hotend and extruder were removed for the conversion, so I could make a one with rotation control but that would be harder
[01:30:12] <tiwork> half the time, they end up doing something different because its way too much effort... lol
[01:32:42] <tiwork> as to how specifically? it really depends on how your 3D printer thing is set up

[01:37:15] <tiwork> as long as the blade point is not on center
[01:37:49] <Lapsus> the good thing with the printer is that the worst case z crash is that the nuts pull out of the bottom of their attachment points so I don't have to worry too much

[06:28:24] <tiwake> ruby
[06:28:36] <cyzon> I don't know what Ruby's regex engine is like
[06:29:04] <cyzon> you could do something like match 00(.*) and then extract the match
[06:29:22] <cyzon> or depending on whether the engine supports it, (?<=00).*

[06:31:28] <cyzon> => #<MatchData "123">
[06:31:48] <cyzon> and then you can call .to_s on the MatchData object to get the matched string
[06:32:07] <tiwake> will that work with 0123?
[06:32:16] <tiwake> or 0000123
[06:32:35] <cyzon> oh, that would break for 0000123
[06:33:12] <tiwake> enh, in this case I think the data will only have one or two leading 0's
[06:33:49] <cyzon> is the goal to strip off exactly 2 0s or remove all leading zeros

[16:18:30] <Sour_Sweet> Be reminded that today is a black friday for freedom of speech in Germany. A law has been passed that will not only allow storage of telecommunication metadata, but also make reports on data stolen/leaked by whistleblowers way more difficult and dangerous for the journalists involved.

[20:58:59] <Moonlightning> Why are domain names written with the less significant labels first, again?
[21:01:25] <DataByteBrony> to confuse common peons
[21:01:43] <DataByteBrony> because the programmers are always right ;)
[21:09:32] <Sour_Sweet> It kind of makes sense - just like dates
[21:10:11] <DataByteBrony> i prefer the mysql format of yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
[21:10:13] <DataByteBrony> xD
[21:10:21] <Moonlightning> That's just /the/ standard format, DataByteBrony
[21:10:38] <SilverEagle> yep I think in that format now
[21:10:39] <Moonlightning> it's close to the USI 8601 thing
[21:10:45] <SilverEagle> not many countries actually use it
[21:10:53] <SilverEagle> I think Japan does
[21:11:01] <SilverEagle> but it's the best <3
[21:11:07] <SilverEagle> fully sortable~
[21:11:12] <Moonlightning> Mmm.
[21:11:26] <Moonlightning> Always nice when you can just sort lexicographically.
[21:11:31] <DataByteBrony> my father still labels folders like "03-09-2014"
[21:11:50] <DataByteBrony> i don't remember if he puts the 0's in there
[21:12:04] <Moonlightning> And it's only fully sortable if you always use the same timezone and said timezone has no DST-like shenanigans
[21:12:18] <DataByteBrony> ugh, dst
[21:12:34] <DataByteBrony> i wish we could do away with that, tbh
[21:12:40] <Moonlightning> I know, right?
[21:12:58] <DataByteBrony> extra hour of daylight? what? just schedule the working hours right, and you have no issues!
[21:13:24] <DataByteBrony> that means there's more daylight in the morning in the summer! so what if you don't have to work for an hour after waking up?
[21:14:32] <DataByteBrony> plus, dst makes it so hard to reconcile timestamps
[21:14:58] <DataByteBrony> "it was at 5pm" well, my clock says 4 - did you set your clock correctly?
[21:16:33] <DataByteBrony> humans. we invent a wonderful series of mathematics and devices for making our lives easier.. and then define our lives solely around those things, making life more stressful
[21:22:03] <Moonlightning> Dammit
[21:22:08] <Moonlightning> why do you need a program to open this file
[21:22:13] <Moonlightning> it's an executable; just fork-exec it, dammit
