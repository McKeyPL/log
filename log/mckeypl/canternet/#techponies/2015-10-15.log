[03:02:50] <tiwake> Moonlightning: yeah, I've read that BTRFS is easier on the processor requirements

[03:03:27] <Moonlightning> :?
[03:07:21] <tiwake> Moonlightning: but yeah, I think BTRFS is ready if you use a newer kernel
[03:08:30] <Moonlightning> tiwake: yeah…I'm just a little wary about using it for a /backup volume/.
[03:08:34] <Googie> Depends on what you are trying to do. Some parts are better tested than others
[03:08:39] <tiwake> enh
[03:09:11] <tiwake> Googie: and yeah, should have said "certain parts" or maybe "the parts that most people would use"
[03:10:22] <tiwake> same thing could be said about ZFS too though
[03:10:24] <Moonlightning> Well, basically the only thing I'll be using is snapshots
[03:10:24] <tiwake> there are probably certain parts of ZFS that you don't want to use XD
[03:10:24] <tiwake> because of stability
[03:10:24] <Googie> Well, I consider the filesystem's RAID5/6 support something commonly used
[03:10:35] <tiwake> yeah
[03:10:50] <tiwake> RAID support in BTRFS has been around for a while
[03:11:13] <Googie> But 5/6 (technically not RAID, but same idea) is officially unstable

[05:38:26] <Moonlightning> Hai SilverEagle
[05:38:35] <SilverEagle> hey :)
[05:38:37] <SilverEagle> what's up?
[05:38:49] <Moonlightning> Not much. x3
[05:38:51] <Moonlightning> How're you?
[05:39:22] <SilverEagle> I'm alright
[05:39:30] <SilverEagle> beating myself up for procrastinating on stuff so much
[05:39:36] <SilverEagle> and now scrambling to get crap done
[05:39:45] <SilverEagle> out of a sheer fear that I'll get nothing done ever
[05:39:49] <Moonlightning> x.x
[05:41:23] <SilverEagle> you?
[05:41:25] <SilverEagle> =)
[05:45:31] <Moonlightning> Like I said, not much. Was playing Battleblock Theater.
[05:45:45] <Moonlightning> Currently trying to set up Steam on my secondary laptop
[05:46:03] <SilverEagle> heh no you asked me how I am
[05:46:07] <SilverEagle> so I was asking how you are
[05:46:20] <SilverEagle> but I see
[05:46:28] <SilverEagle> Steam's easy to set up though :3
[05:46:51] <Moonlightning> Slightly annoying on Linux though
[05:46:56] <Dusk> heya eggie
[05:47:01] <SilverEagle> duskie <3
[05:47:02] <Dusk> Moonlightning: how's that upload going?
[05:47:08] <Dusk> eggie~ <3
[05:47:42] <Moonlightning> Dusk: ~2.8/6.2 GiB
[05:47:50] <Dusk> \o/
[05:47:58] <Dusk> only a few days to go :p
[05:48:01] <SilverEagle> whatcha uploading lol
[05:48:05] <Moonlightning> There's going to be some more in the days to come
[05:48:14] <Dusk> he's uploading a backup to my home server
[05:48:17] <Moonlightning> because I'm right now rebuilding a ton of packages because Steam
[05:48:21] <Dusk> ah
[05:48:35] <Dusk> SilverEagle: 80KB/s
[05:48:41] <Dusk> it's fantastic
[05:48:53] <Moonlightning> More like 20 KiB/s, according to rsync
[05:49:07] <Dusk> ah
[05:49:09] <Moonlightning> I have no idea how I'm going to manage doing the backups from my primary laptop
[05:49:18] <Dusk> I suppose I am doing other stuff
[05:49:23] <Dusk> /shrug
[05:49:36] <Moonlightning> I guess I can just let the initial be inconsistent :P
[05:49:37] <SilverEagle> ohh like crashplan?
[05:49:41] <SilverEagle> offsite backups?
[05:49:53] <Moonlightning> No, not like crashplan. :P
[05:49:55] <SilverEagle> I've never used the "back up to a friend" feature
[05:50:30] <Dusk> it's an offsite backup because he's a friend and I happen to have a spare drive for him feature :p
[05:50:35] <Moonlightning> ^
[05:50:37] <SilverEagle> lol
[05:50:43] <SilverEagle> crashplan is free for that though
[05:50:47] <SilverEagle> but okay okay
[05:51:11] <Moonlightning> This is also free, and it doesn't involve installing software.
[05:53:40] <Colgate> what is crashplan?
[05:54:01] <Dusk> a backup program for facilitating offsite backups to online or other PCs
[05:54:05] <Colgate> I thought you meant it as having a crash plan, but this sounds like something else
[05:54:16] <SilverEagle> no Crashplan is a piece of software, highly recommended one actually
[05:54:35] <SilverEagle> that automates encrypted and compressed backups to local drives, other local remote computers, computers of friends, or to their paid backup service
[05:54:37] <Dusk> https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwiL2KuPysPIAhUEz4AKHVZ6DK4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.code42.com%2Fcrashplan%2F&usg=AFQjCNFyqPla84nM7Xmta8cfOmlgLkmQiA&sig2=86d69tGpQsLstTHeB9Hgwg
[05:54:41] <Dusk> oh ugh
[05:54:43] <SilverEagle> it's damn nifty and holy crap dusk
[05:54:48] <Dusk> sorry
[05:54:48] <SilverEagle> you googled that URL
[05:54:52] <Dusk> I did
[05:54:54] <SilverEagle> so hard
[05:54:55] <Dusk> and it like
[05:55:01] <Dusk> didn't give me any room to breathe :p
[05:55:16] <SilverEagle> (disclaimer: I don't work for Crashplan and they don't pay me, I pay them, it's just the shiznit)
[05:55:40] <Moonlightning> This is DIY offsite backups :P
[05:55:45] <Dusk> SilverEagle: I lost my 3TB with all of my stuff :(
[05:56:04] <SilverEagle> yeah I went hunting for a solid backup service that automated stuff after I lost a 4TB drive
[05:56:08] <SilverEagle> that was a painful loss
[05:56:09] <Colgate> 448bit encryption, uh, that's a bit odd
[05:56:13] <Dusk> The drive's controller is dead
[05:56:19] <Dusk> I need to see if I can find another
[05:56:25] <SilverEagle> Colgate 448 bits oughtta be enough for anyone~
[05:56:38] <Colgate> I'm still looking for a cipher
[05:56:44] <Colgate> :P
[05:57:29] <Colgate> 448 bits of what?
[05:58:08] <SilverEagle> Blowfish
[05:58:21] <Colgate> got a link to where it says that?
[05:58:33] <Colgate> also which version of blowfish?

[05:58:35] <PinkiePieBot> [ Security Now! Transcript of Episode #230 ]
[05:58:41] <Moonlightning> uh
[05:58:43] <SilverEagle> when they discuss Crashplan
[05:58:44] <Moonlightning> that's…not official.
[05:58:49] <Googie> That... that guy is uhhh...
[05:58:50] <Colgate> I want it from their site
[05:58:50] <SilverEagle> kid you not
[05:58:55] <SilverEagle> that's linked FROM THE CRASHPLAN SITE
[05:59:02] <SilverEagle> for people curious about more info about the cipher used
[05:59:05] <Moonlightning> Then why is the domain grc.com.? :V
[05:59:13] <SilverEagle> because that's how links work Moonlightning 
[05:59:15] <SilverEagle> links can go anywhere
[05:59:16] <Moonlightning> That's hella sketch.
[05:59:18] <SilverEagle> the web is a magical place.
[05:59:22] <Googie> The guy behind that podcast is basically a fraud as well.
[05:59:28] <SilverEagle> Leo Laporte?!
[05:59:28] <Moonlightning> O.o
[05:59:30] <Moonlightning> really?
[05:59:38] <SilverEagle> how the hell is Leo Laporte a fraud?

[06:00:12] <SilverEagle> I don't get the vibe that this guy is a fraud but okay >.>
[06:00:30] <Colgate> also, blowfish 1 has flaws
[06:01:07] <Colgate> and as far as I can tell, they don't mention twofish or threefish anywhere in there
[06:01:26] <SilverEagle> well all that info can go blowfish me because I don't encrypt my backups <3
[06:01:48] <SilverEagle> ain't nothin on there I'm hiding
[06:01:59] <Colgate> if I was backing up to a system I don't control, I would definitely encrypt
[06:02:12] <Moonlightning> Nothing in your backups that you would hide from the world?
[06:02:21] <Moonlightning> I have /lots/ of things in my backups I would hide from the world.
[06:02:25] <SilverEagle> heh
[06:02:26] <Moonlightning> What in my backups WOULDN'T I hide from the world?
[06:02:29] <SilverEagle> I mean
[06:02:31] <Moonlightning> Let's see…uhhhh…apps.
[06:02:40] <SilverEagle> all the stuff I would hide, I only back up via local redundancy
[06:02:42] <Moonlightning> You can have the publically-available bundles and binaries.
[06:02:55] <Moonlightning> You need offsite backups though XP
[06:03:03] <Moonlightning> what if your house burns down D:
[06:03:07] <SilverEagle> Google Drive
[06:03:09] <SilverEagle> :P
[06:03:17] <SilverEagle> security schmecurity
[06:03:18] <Moonlightning> yeah I wouldn't trust Google with this shit
[06:03:27] <Moonlightning> more like, privacy shmivacy
[06:03:30] <SilverEagle> if Google betrays me
[06:03:37] <SilverEagle> then my whole online life is gonna come crumbling down anyway
[06:03:41] <SilverEagle> so screw it, let's go out with a bang
[06:03:47] <Moonlightning> and that in itself is indicative of much larger problems
[06:04:14] <SilverEagle> all anyone's gonna find out is how cripplingly boring of a life I lead online for someone who's an IT person
[06:04:20] <Moonlightning> I spend much of my time on IRC, anyway, which is not exactly easy to seize control of
[06:04:31] <Moonlightning> speaking of. Colgate, can you disable password resets for my account?
[06:04:52] <SilverEagle> well that and my evil pony media empi--I mean pony media harmless site
[06:04:55] <Colgate> I don't think that's possible in atheme
[06:05:07] <Compu> bluh
[06:05:10] <Compu> spotify
[06:05:13] <Compu> y u do dis
[06:05:47] <Compu> i reset it 2 days ago and redownloaded all my playlists so they would go onto my sd card

[06:06:12] <Moonlightning> That is an insanely roundabout way to transfer data from one disk to another. -.-
[06:06:18] <Compu> but i rebooted it today and it started ignoring the sd card and started trying to download to internal storage again
[06:07:10] <Compu> now im trying a complete reinstall and i made sure to manually delete any trace of spotify from both my internal storage and my sd card
[06:07:38] * Moonlightning doesn't like using external storage as an extension of internal storage.
[06:07:54] <SilverEagle> Spotify is total crap when it comes to storing its music locally...the number of times it has "invalidated" my local storage and forced a full redownload is TOO MANY
[06:08:31] <Compu> Moonlightning: yes well i have a larger sd card than my internal storage
[06:09:02] <Compu> luckily i saved a list of my playlists i want downloaded into a text file in my dropboc
[06:09:07] <Compu> dropbox*
[06:10:15] <Compu> SilverEagle: i need it stored locally cuz otherwise i dont get my music when im not on wifi
[06:10:24] <SilverEagle> no no I understand that completely
[06:10:27] <SilverEagle> I do the same
[06:10:34] <SilverEagle> I'm saying Spotify is really bad at handling it properly

[06:11:49] <SilverEagle> yea me neither
[06:11:53] <SilverEagle> I'd be fine with GPM too
[06:11:59] <SilverEagle> I'm on android phones anyhow
[06:12:05] <SilverEagle> and that ties more cleanly with local files too
[06:12:09] <Compu> yes

[06:13:52] <SilverEagle> surprised there isn't a migrator
[06:14:02] <SilverEagle> I know gplay makes a migrator for your local itunes/whatever to GPM
[06:14:41] <Compu> yeah but itunes is a lot easier to get playlists out of
[06:14:51] <Googie> SilverEagle: He's a lot of talk, but his actual work is... well, he spent an awful lot of time overhyping it when it's pretty worthless in most cases or has severe issues.
[06:15:10] <Googie> Though admittedly most of that is fairly old now.
[06:15:52] <SilverEagle> hmm well ok then
[06:16:19] <Googie> Spent a lot of time peddling fud back in the early 2000s.
[06:16:24] <Compu> SilverEagle: spotify loves to encrypt everything they possibly can, the only way to access spotify playlists would be through the spotify api which im sure spotify wont let google use
[06:16:36] *** Joins: Bill_Beck (wsqlpvsnexk@Pony-cqdgqv.va.charter.com)
[06:16:40] <Moonlightning> > spotify loves to encrypt everything they possibly can
[06:16:42] <Moonlightning> This is a good thing.
[06:17:08] <Moonlightning> In fact, Apple recommends that apps encrypt all traffic that could /possibly/ contain user-generated data.
[06:17:40] *** Joins: Dusk (dusk@Pony-qppoca.dusky.horse)
[06:18:20] <SilverEagle> Spotify's not doing it for you
[06:18:28] <Compu> Moonlightning: yes but spotify also encrypts everything it downloads so u can only use it with the app
[06:18:30] <SilverEagle> they're doing it so you can't harvest your music, keep it locally and cancel their service
[06:18:46] <Moonlightning> Even if it couldn't, more legitimate encrypted traffic means it's less likely an attacker will be able to get anything private, and it destroys the argument that only criminals encrypt.
[06:18:48] <Compu> Moonlightning: anyways it seems to be using the sd card again, we'll see if it stays
[06:18:52] <Moonlightning> …oh, you mean DRM. :P
[06:19:08] <SilverEagle> even if there was some way for Spotify to allow exporting just the artists/track names off playlists, and Google then matching those against its own DB, that would be helpful
[06:19:51] <SilverEagle> so....upon research there's a way to do step 1 of this
[06:20:03] <Compu> SilverEagle: there is, the spotify API, but again i doubt spotify would let google use it because they dont want people switching over
[06:20:20] <Moonlightning> vendor lockin, yay

[06:20:26] <PinkiePieBot> [ watsonbox/exportify · GitHub ]
[06:20:32] <Compu> SilverEagle: im sure if there was a way to transfer playlists spotify would lose a ton of business because of their crappy service
[06:20:42] <SilverEagle> nah most people value their convenience
[06:20:49] <SilverEagle> and don't go looking this kind of stuff up

[06:22:30] <SilverEagle> FOUND A THING
[06:22:40] <SilverEagle> a python script to do exactly this
[06:22:50] <SilverEagle> port from spotify to goog music
[06:22:51] <Compu> SilverEagle: ok but how do u export to google play?
[06:23:08] <SilverEagle> lookie at my link
[06:23:15] <SilverEagle> it's both sides of the process
[06:23:20] <SilverEagle> *does it*
[06:24:10] <Compu> SilverEagle: i found one suggestion that says to have a delay for the spotify auto start because it takes a little while to mount the sd card on boot and spotify sometimes does its sd card check before the card is mounted
[06:25:33] <Compu> SilverEagle: that thing looks like a good way to get banned from both services
[06:26:04] <Googie> Also, hooking up to dn42.net seems like a cool side project to do at some point.
[06:26:14] <Moonlightning> dn42.net.?
[06:26:34] <SilverEagle> lol Compu I think that's overly paranoid
[06:26:37] <SilverEagle> it's a local script that runs
[06:26:45] <SilverEagle> plus if Spotify bans me for trying to leave
[06:26:48] <Googie> Moonlightning: Basically a "virtual internet" connected by tunnels over the real internet.
[06:26:49] <SilverEagle> I'm only leaving harder <3
[06:27:00] <Compu> SilverEagle: and if GPM bans u too?
[06:27:14] <SilverEagle> for trying to pay them money?
[06:27:16] <Googie> So you can learn BGP, and basically do anything you could do on the real internet, except without any of the formalities.
[06:27:20] *** Joins: DJ-C0L7[EIT] (IceChat77@DJ-C0L7.EIT.LLC)
[06:28:02] <SilverEagle> in both of these company's cases the best business practice would be to look the other way and let the transfer happen, because you're not undoing DRM itself
[06:28:05] <Googie> It operates its own private DNS root, Address allocation/whois.
[06:28:08] <SilverEagle> you're just exporting data and importing
[06:28:19] <SilverEagle> you're not breaking actual copyright law
[06:28:20] <Compu> SilverEagle: by the way my main Starred playlist contains 411 songs
[06:28:51] <Moonlightning> Googie: oooooooh. :D
[06:29:02] <Moonlightning> That does sound like a cool side project.
[06:29:07] <Moonlightning> I should do that sometime.
[06:29:29] <Moonlightning> Virtual Internet. How exactly's that work?
[06:29:32] <SilverEagle> I'ma do it and let you know if I get banned from literally everything
[06:29:55] <Moonlightning> Including Equestria Daily?
[06:30:29] <SilverEagle> ha ha
[06:30:31] <SilverEagle> hee hee
[06:30:35] <Compu> SilverEagle: u know u dont have to break copyright law for them to try and ban u? u wann talk about copyright law then look at all the false DMCAs that r rampant everywhere
[06:30:39] <Googie> Basically a bunch of Layer 2 or Layer 3 tunnels between participating hosts.
[06:30:57] <SilverEagle> Compu: I don't even right now
[06:31:01] <SilverEagle> I'm doing it, be paranoid if you want
[06:31:09] <SilverEagle> but you'll just be paranoid on a service you hate :P
[06:31:55] <Googie> It's in the 172.22.0.0/16 and 172.20.0.0/16 private address space, the actual internet you'd still use as per normal.
[06:32:35] <Compu> SilverEagle: they r apparently bringing chromecast support to spotify by the way, but the made a goof (apparently on purpose), they added the support to the app before the firmware update was properly released for the chromecast
[06:32:48] <Compu> so now they app sees the chromecast but wont connect to it
[06:33:18] <Moonlightning> Googie: wait what?
[06:33:37] <Moonlightning> How do you simulate the middle of the Internet using jsut two /16s ._.

[06:34:44] <Googie> It's not a replacement for the internet or any of that, it's a completely separate hobbyist network, using all the same technologies.
[06:35:05] <Googie> Except that peering is done over tunnels because you probably can't afford a direct fibre optic link to your nearest peer :P
[06:36:04] <Compu> SilverEagle: also i have an issue, i apparently cant unlink my twitter account from the spotify app so the app will only share to my personal account and not my pony account
[06:36:16] <SilverEagle> yea that's even dumber!
[06:36:19] <SilverEagle> man ditch that thin

[06:36:43] <Compu> apparently u can unlink on the desktop app
[06:37:08] <Compu> but the 32 bit version of the app for linux is no longer being updated, they decided to go 64 bit only for linux
[06:38:03] <Googie> To be fair, there's no real reason to use 32 bit desktop Linux these days.
[06:38:28] <Compu> Googie: there is if ur using it ON a 32 bit computer

[10:07:07] <Moonlightning> On a *nix system, running untrusted code in a dedicated account doesn't pose a security risk, right?
[10:07:29] <aji> it does
[10:07:52] <aji> things like /etc/passwd are readable by anybody
[10:08:20] * Moonlightning stares blankly.
[10:08:59] <aji> while it's safer for the code to be run with a dedicated account,
[10:09:10] <aji> there is still sensitive data they could access
[10:10:03] <aji> as a very simple example,
[10:10:09] <aji> the code could cause a DOS by filling up your disk with junk data
[10:10:49] <Phase> apparmor, selinux, or containers
[10:10:50] <aji> they can run commands like ps to see what other software you're running
[10:11:07] <aji> they can connect to things listening only on 127.0.0.1
[10:11:10] <aji> etc
[10:11:10] <Moonlightning> Y'know, I was looking into getting into selinux!
[10:11:20] <Phase> oh cool, proc entries have selinux labels
[10:11:22] <Moonlightning> Ooh, yeah, that one's bad
[10:11:33] <Phase> selinux can solve that too!
[10:11:48] <aji> idk about selinux, i haven't used it, it sounds like a good solution
[10:12:05] <Moonlightning> IIRC like three ponies in here told me not to use it though
[10:12:08] <aji> another solution is to segment the code off in its own machine entirely, VMs are pretty cheap
[10:12:09] <Phase> it's perfect for this sort of confinement
[10:12:11] <Phase> but
[10:12:17] <Phase> i wouldn't know how to do it
[10:12:26] <Phase> writing selinux policy is a dark art few have mastered
[10:12:35] <Moonlightning> ._.
[10:12:43] <aji> chroots are decent sandboxes too, but there's still some risks
[10:12:58] <Moonlightning> that doesn't solve the ps or the ::1 thing
[10:13:03] <aji> right
[10:13:19] <aji> it's better to assume that they're going to have complete control over the entire machine, and then plan for that case
[10:13:20] <Phase> Moonlightning, what distro are you running?
[10:13:24] <Moonlightning> Gentoo.
[10:13:58] <aji> this is, of course, if you're running absolutely untrusted code, like people entering code on a website to be run, or build bots, or PaaS like heroku
[10:14:19] <aji> if it's something like an install script, well, that's different
[10:14:35] <Moonlightning> It's something I can't fetch over TLS or get a signature for
[10:14:38] <Moonlightning> so, yes, untrusted
[10:14:40] <Phase> it depends on how worried you are about kernel exploits
[10:14:53] <Moonlightning> I'm rather unworried abotu kernel exploits.
[10:14:57] <Phase> but that affects pretty much everything really
[10:15:11] <aji> i've heard of a few hypervisor exploits too
[10:15:14] <aji> NOTHING IS SAFE
[10:15:25] <Phase> containers dont help you there, selinux does *something* by its nature of default denial but it depends on the exploit
[10:15:33] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: What is it?
[10:15:37] <Moonlightning> Steam.
[10:15:55] <AppleDash> ...
[10:15:58] <Moonlightning> I can't trust it! I have no assurance it hasn't been tampered with in transit!
[10:16:18] <AppleDash> Get it from your OS's package manager
[10:16:33] <Phase> the validate local files thing gets its signatures via https
[10:16:57] <Moonlightning> Phase: yes, but the thing I run at first isn't validated at all.
[10:17:00] <Moonlightning> It could be anything.
[10:17:06] <Moonlightning> It's /probably/ legit Steam, but it /could/ be anything.

[10:22:22] <AppleDash> please
[10:22:49] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: no; clearly I should assume everything is absolutely fine, download the thing not over TLS, do zero verification, and run it as root.
[10:22:59] <AppleDash> Seems fine to me
[10:23:46] <Moonlightning> In seriousness…you can repo.steampowered.com. over HTTPS? O.o
[10:24:24] <AppleDash> Yes
[10:24:45] <AppleDash> It has an invalid certificate that's valid for the same CDN steam uses for everything else
[10:25:29] <Moonlightning> really? I got a cert with generic-looking Akamai hostnames
[10:25:44] <Moonlightning> > a248.e.akamai.net, *.akamaihd.net, *.akamaihd-staging.net, *.akamaized.net, *.akamaized-staging.net
[10:25:47] <AppleDash> Yes
[10:25:50] <AppleDash> That's the same CDN.
[10:26:14] <aji> e621.e.akami.net
[10:26:21] <AppleDash> lol
[10:26:24] <Moonlightning> xD
[10:29:59] <Moonlightning> Okay, so besides things like filling up disks and finding out what usernames exist, and assuming I'm not running anything on localhost and assuming that's secure
[10:30:15] <Moonlightning> Is there any real harm untrusted code could do if executed under a dedicated account?
[10:30:30] <aji> well,
[10:30:33] <aji> PROBABLY not
[10:30:38] <Moonlightning> (filling up a disk isn't real harm here—annoying, sure, but I just have to reboot from something else and delete its shit)
[10:30:41] <Phase> define harmful
[10:30:42] <aji> but accounts aren't guaranteed to be isolated like that
[10:30:52] <Moonlightning> they what? o.O
[10:30:53] <Phase> and disk quota solves that
[10:30:56] <aji> so there's possibly something an attacker has thought of that we haven't
[10:30:56] <Moonlightning> yeah
[10:31:04] <Moonlightning> uh
[10:31:17] <aji> like,
[10:31:24] <aji> accounts weren't designed with that sort of isolation in mind
[10:31:37] <Phase> ps output for example, if you put a password on the command line
[10:31:41] <aji> they're good for that, but it's not what they're designed for,
[10:31:48] <aji> so you can't rely on it
[10:31:51] <Phase> /tmp, /run, /etc
[10:32:01] <Phase> anything with global read that probably shouldn't have global read
[10:32:09] <Moonlightning> yeah I don't put passwords on command lines
[10:32:52] <Phase> MLS is cool
[10:33:00] <Phase> can do some really powerful isolation with that
[10:33:22] <Moonlightning> MLS?
[10:33:31] <Phase> multi-level security
[10:33:40] <Phase> part of an selinux label
[10:33:49] <Moonlightning> :?
[10:35:02] <Phase> Moonlightning, https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Labels
[10:35:03] <PinkiePieBot> [ SELinux/Labels - Gentoo Wiki ]
[10:35:43] <Phase> Moonlightning, MLS boils down to 'No read up, no write down'
[10:35:58] <Phase> if your running at S5, you can't fead from S6, and can't Write to S4
[10:36:34] <Phase> intended for confidentiality, you could run all your programs and services at S1 and higher, then untrusted code as S0 
[10:37:22] <Phase> then not only could it not communicate with anything outside its context, those processes can't be made to write into its context
[10:41:07] <Moonlightning> wait, what?
[10:48:38] <JustAberrant> *cough* it's a wonder selinux isn't used more often *cough*
[10:48:55] <aji> selinux was made by the nsa, just a warning
[10:48:58] <Phase> multi-level security isn't used often
[10:49:05] <Phase> aji, its been public for a good 15 years now
[10:49:10] <aji> no but phase
[10:49:12] <aji> nsa
[10:49:19] <Phase> oh right
[10:49:58] <aji> anyway time for bed, goodnight!
[10:50:10] * aji wiggles fingers spookily "the nsa is watching your security contexts"
[10:50:14] <Phase> Moonlightning, if i say S5 is top secret, and S4 is secret, something running as top secret (and thus with access to top secret data) cannot write anywhere labeled as secret (S4)
[10:50:55] <Phase> a process can run as a range of levels, and be trusted to pass between levels
[10:51:32] <JustAberrant> seriously though.. always seemed silly to me, makes more sense to partition the data entirely than have levels *shrugs*
[10:51:39] <JustAberrant> but then I don't really know much about selinux
[10:51:42] <JustAberrant> just the very basics
[10:52:07] <JustAberrant> because one "top secret" process may not necessarily need access to the data from some other "top secret" process
[10:53:04] <Phase> its applied in addition to type enforcing, and multi-catagory security
[10:54:56] <JustAberrant> either way, we live in a world where it's easier and cheap enough to put things on physically separate boxes or at least separate vm instances
[10:56:08] <JustAberrant> anyway, I'm bed
[10:56:15] <Moonlightning> Ahaaaa.
[10:56:18] <Moonlightning> That makes sense.
[10:56:25] <Phase> night ja
[10:56:36] <Moonlightning> A top-secret process can't accidentally write into a just-plain-secret location
[10:56:47] <Phase> or lower, yeah
[10:56:59] <Phase> either accidentally or be instructed to in any way
[10:57:06] <Phase> assuming kernel correctness
[10:57:24] <Moonlightning> yeah, the fact that the NSA wrote it is kinda off-putting
[10:57:45] <Moonlightning> but…if they use it…they know that backdoors make things less secure…so they wouldn't be so stupid as to backdoor their own thing…would they? @.@
[10:57:49] <Phase> it's upstream linux code
[10:58:19] <Phase> one of several mainlined lsm modules
[10:58:23] <Moonlightning> oh, one reason not to use it is that so many things have no idea about it
[10:58:33] <Moonlightning> LSM?
[10:58:40] <Phase> tbh apparmor would be easier for a one off thing
[10:58:46] <Phase> Linux Security Module
[10:59:03] <Phase> people can't agree on how security should work, so linus said "make it a module", so they did

[20:49:27] <Sakura> Guys, 10-Gig Internet is a thing.

[20:51:01] <wolfyshy> 40gigE is a thing too
[20:54:02] <coppercore> 10Gig internet
[20:54:03] <coppercore> WAT
[20:54:36] <SilverEagle> friggin what
[20:54:42] <SilverEagle> I couldn't even do anything with that!
[20:54:53] <SilverEagle> I just got cat6a cables, so I guess the *cables* could
[20:55:42] <coppercore> 10GBase-T will work over normal 6a at around 50m or so i think
[20:55:58] <SilverEagle> well yes but
[20:56:02] * Moonlightning groans loudly.
[20:56:07] <SilverEagle> my modem, its router, my NIC
[20:56:10] <Colgate> I don't have a router with 10g ports :P
[20:56:15] <Moonlightning> I'm still sitting over here with 10M-tier!
[20:56:17] <wolfyshy> my modem is docsis3, so that's uh
[20:56:22] <wolfyshy> I think 400Mbit
[20:56:25] <Moonlightning> I'd be in heaven if I had 100M, both ways
[20:56:29] <wolfyshy> my entire network is gigE
[20:56:33] <SilverEagle> here we get 300 down, 20 up
[20:56:36] <Moonlightning> MiB, not SI Mb
[20:56:44] <wolfyshy> I only get 100 down.
[20:57:15] <Moonlightning> I get like 15 SI Mb down and 1 up
[20:57:16] <wolfyshy> when I move, I'll be getting 250 down
[20:57:42] <Sakura> Where are you moving?
[20:57:55] <wolfyshy> central US
[20:57:59] <Sakura> Ah
[20:59:33] <Sakura> What I would give to move back to Tennessee to get that sweet, sweet 10 gig. *squee*

[21:01:10] <Sakura> What?
[21:01:16] <Sakura> WHAT?!
[21:01:17] <Dusk> I don't see ads in mine :o
[21:01:46] <SilverEagle> oh no >.>
[21:02:32] <Dusk> Yea that isn't a thing in my install on my tablet, laptop or desktop
[21:02:53] <SilverEagle> well like the article says, apparently it's only in an early-adopter build
[21:02:59] <Dusk> I'm an insider :p
[21:03:23] <Dusk> on the fast track too so I should be on that build
[21:03:25] <Sakura> Hell no, Microsoft! You ain't putting ads in my mofo start menu! :@
[21:03:29] <Colgate> reminds me of ubuntu
[21:03:32] <Colgate> ;)
[21:03:36] <Dusk> lol
[21:03:45] <SilverEagle> shit tell me Ubuntu's not doing that too
[21:03:50] <Dusk> I defo haven't noticed that in ubuntu gnome
[21:03:50] <Moonlightning> well, you'll be happy to know that I'll be dumping Ubuntu
[21:03:53] <Moonlightning> at some point
[21:04:15] <Sakura> And I'm an insider as well but I only have the build on a VM.
[21:04:16] <Moonlightning> gonna have to borrow my neighbor's TV again or something
[21:04:27] <Dusk> Sakura: why? 
[21:04:29] <Colgate> Sakura: ubuntu has been doing it for years :P
[21:04:40] <Dusk> Colgate: in unity I assume
[21:04:41] <Colgate> gah
[21:04:44] <Colgate> SilverEagle:*
[21:04:49] <Colgate> the default WM, yeah
[21:04:51] <Dusk> Ah
[21:04:55] <Dusk> I've not used unity
[21:04:59] <Dusk> so it matters not
[21:05:01] <Colgate> the search pops up amazon.com results
[21:05:02] <SilverEagle> oh you mean "Suggested Apps", not actual in-menu ads
[21:05:11] <SilverEagle> bleh =/
[21:05:16] <Dusk> Anyone who uses unity should probably find a better wm

[21:05:51] <Sakura> Yes
[21:05:57] <Dusk> Yes and Ubuntu is a mite bit more convenient 
[21:06:05] <Sakura> Ubuntu=Debian with steroiw
[21:06:12] <Sakura> Steroids*
[21:06:19] <SilverEagle> I admit ads or otherwise I'd still use Ubuntu as a desktop env
[21:06:26] <SilverEagle> since it takes some of the "pain-in-the-ass-ness" out of Linux
[21:06:41] <Colgate> sure, I just wouldn't use unity as a WM
[21:06:49] <Dusk> It doesn't have ads if you install Gnome or another sane WM
[21:06:52] <Dusk> j/s
[21:06:53] <coppercore> ^
[21:06:59] <SilverEagle> whatever happened to that one gorgeous WM
[21:07:02] <SilverEagle> Enlightenment or something
[21:07:09] <SilverEagle> the one that was really pretty
[21:07:51] <Colgate> pretty is relative ;)
[21:07:51] <Dusk> https://www.enlightenment.org/
[21:07:52] <PinkiePieBot> [ Enlightenment Main ]
[21:07:57] <Dusk> SilverEagle: this?
[21:09:19] <SilverEagle> I suppose so
[21:09:29] <SilverEagle> that's not nearly as pretty as I remember
[21:09:33] <Dusk> I guess it's neat
[21:09:40] <Dusk> but I would still use gnome 3 over that
[21:09:54] <SilverEagle> there was one that had the same glassiness as ~2010 OSX
[21:09:58] <SilverEagle> and was quite pretty
[21:10:09] <Dusk> hm
[21:11:42] <SilverEagle> I think it actually was just a heavily customized Enlightenment
[21:11:51] <Dusk> Mmm
[21:12:08] <Dusk> you could probably get cinnamon to look that way if you wanted, or plasma
[21:12:30] <SilverEagle> YEP CINNAMON
[21:12:31] <SilverEagle> that's the one
[21:12:34] <Dusk> Ah
[21:12:47] <Dusk> Cinnamon is the one I fall back to if I can't get gnome working on my system
[21:12:54] <SilverEagle> http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/uploads/themes/QTSH-QTWB-BTFL.png
[21:13:02] <SilverEagle> I think that's darn pretty =)
[21:13:15] <Dusk> mhm
[21:13:19] <SilverEagle> just a subtle alpha-transparent thing, but with all the padding set right, something Linux seems to have insane amounts of difficulty with
[21:13:21] <Dusk> I looks nice :)
[21:13:34] <Dusk> I prefer the android theme for cinnamon
[21:13:37] <SilverEagle> lots of Linux UIs can't do padding to save their lives
[21:13:42] <Dusk> it's pretty neat
[21:16:21] <SilverEagle> I bet I could run Ubuntu on my TV
[21:16:24] <SilverEagle> and nobody would notice
[21:16:32] <Dusk> hah
[21:16:33] <SilverEagle> it would still do Plex and Chrome
[21:16:40] <Dusk> Plex <3
[21:16:44] <SilverEagle> my TV's attached computer I mean, an Intel NUC
[21:16:54] <SilverEagle> hell I could almost get away with ChromeOS
[21:17:10] <Dusk> What would stop chromos?
[21:17:24] <SilverEagle> Steam
[21:17:31] <Dusk> oh
[21:17:36] <SilverEagle> so if SteamOS and ChromeOS had a baby
[21:17:39] <SilverEagle> I'd use that on my TV

[23:51:16] <HoneyDrops> Also every cell phone is insecure because of the GSM module being closed.  What little research there is points to tons of bugs/vulns in the RTOS running on them.  We'll leave aside the fact that GSM is early-90's security model.
