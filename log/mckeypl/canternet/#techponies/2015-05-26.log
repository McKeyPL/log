[01:58:58] <GigabitPony> Seen a post saying that some financial advisor thinks AMD will be gone by 2020
[02:02:33] <JustAberrant> wouldn't surprise me really
[02:02:45] <JustAberrant> very least I think they are finished in the consumer processor market
[02:03:28] <JustAberrant> I'm hessitant to recommend them for low/mod range now.. intel is just kicking there ass everywhere
[02:03:34] <JustAberrant> * mid range
[02:04:33] <GigabitPony> Hopefully they won't go under, not a lot of options then and Intel could jack prices up more.
[02:05:35] <JustAberrant> yeah, there is that
[02:05:39] <JustAberrant> or stagnate
[02:05:47] <GigabitPony> Indeed. 
[02:06:53] <GigabitPony> Maybe Zen will be what they need to be somewhat competitive again. Least for the same die size type chips.

[02:30:25] <Kinsley> The thing is, even if AMD "goes under" and stops serving the consumer x86 market... you know what happens when Intel jacks prices up? Either the government (US, EU, who cares) steps in to regulate them OR, in the ultimate show of how economics works, some other player in the chip fab market steps in and undercuts Intel.
[02:30:38] <Kinsley> I also heard talk that Samsung might be open to buying AMD.

[03:38:37] <tiwake> the problem is IBM with their Power processor, and the MIPS processors... nobody wants to sell those to consumers
[03:39:14] <tiwake> as much as I would love to buy a modern Power7 or MIPS processor
[03:39:29] <tiwake> I only want one, not 3,000 complete systems
[03:40:11] <wolfyshy> http://store.imgtec.com/us/product/mips-creator-ci20/
[03:40:13] <PinkiePieBot> [ MIPSÂ® Creator CI20 | Imagination Store ]
[03:40:20] <wolfyshy> my SO has one of these
[03:40:31] <wolfyshy> we both tinker around with it :3
[03:40:55] <tiwake> that looks like an ARM development board
[03:41:11] <tiwake> not a number cruncher like a power7 processor or something
[03:41:52] <wolfyshy> it's a MIPS
[03:42:22] <tiwake> I could spend $3,000 and buy an AMD A1100 ARM processor right now
[03:43:19] <tiwake> wolfyshy: I want a badass MIPS, not a toy MIPS :P
[03:45:57] <wolfyshy> well it's somewhere inbetween
[03:46:02] <wolfyshy> we run gentoo on it, it compiles fine
[03:46:17] <wolfyshy> qt only took about 50 minutes to compile... takes 30 on my quad-core laptop so.. :P
[03:46:26] <tiwake> sigh
[03:46:28] <wolfyshy> but yeah it doesn't have a lot of peripheral components
[03:46:33] <wolfyshy> no PCI-e slots or such

[23:23:10] <tiwake> Dusk: a guy on our team is building a similar machine
[23:23:21] <tiwake> a flank load of GPUs for folding
[23:23:31] <Dusk> I suggest getting 4 295x2s
[23:23:42] <Dusk> 2mil PPD in a consumer sized case
[23:23:54] <Dusk> I'm only running 1.6mil PPD
[23:24:37] <Dusk> That's with 2 295x2s and 2 780tis when I feel like running them, right now I'm running a 780ti through an extention and shoved the other between the 295x2s
[23:26:01] <tiwake> AMD is coming out with their HBM R9 300 series videocards sometime this month or next month or something

[23:27:48] <Dusk> yea I know
[23:28:13] <Dusk> but they're still not gonna compete with the raw power to performance of the dual GPU card :p
[23:30:10] <tiwake> donno
[23:30:17] <tiwake> depends on the use-case I guess
[23:30:30] <tiwake> double the memory bandwidth

[23:48:07] <Topsie_Mobile> I think in the future with a proper job then I'd get dedicated F@H equipment. For now...I'll not run it, I used to but didn't get many points on my 7870 xt
