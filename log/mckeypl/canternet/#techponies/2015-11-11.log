[02:19:23] <Moonlightning> certificates per name?
[02:19:28] <Moonlightning> …I dunno.
[02:19:52] <Moonlightning> Let's see. A few days ago (maybe a week or two? Iunno), I requested a cert for www.blackl.net.
[02:19:56] <Seoson> That means per one top-level domain
[02:20:19] <Moonlightning> Today, I requested a cert for irc.blackl.net.+sugar-belle.blackl.net., and then later tried to get one for www.blackl.net.+sugar-belle.blackl.net., which failed
[02:20:25] <Moonlightning> So…does that count as three or two?
[02:20:45] <Seoson> so requesting a cert for "example.com, www.example.com" and one for "mail.example.com" counts a 2 certs for example.com
[02:20:45] <Moonlightning> …either way, I should be well under the limit, yeah?

[07:17:20] <JustAberrant> but if it's just "stuff that shouldn't be" but not really causing problems, filing complaints seems a bit extreme
[07:17:42] <JustAberrant> and what Moonlightning said, right after you got hired is probably not the best time anyway
[07:18:56] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: compile a list, at home. Keep it to yourself. Report after at least a month, preferably when there are newer hires than you (but not too close to /their/ hire dates, either, if possible), or once you've gotten a new job.
[07:19:23] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: she /said/ exposed wires…
[07:19:51] <JustAberrant> sure, but is anyone working anywhere near them, are they even live, etc
[07:20:12] <Gigabit> I know where I stocked the blankets is a fire hazard. They are covering and being forced into the fuse panels, one panel the cover is falling off. But I /have" to stock there.
[07:20:42] <Gigabit> We walk under the wires daily, and there is a rain gutter right over it, catching leaking water

[17:28:14] <RazorSharpFang> I need to learn C++. are there any books or resources you recommend for getting a solid grasp on the language from an academic perspective?
[17:28:40] <snoarin> I got spray on rubberized undercoating to spray my gas tank, says no less then 70f to spray it on, its only going to get 54 today, do I spray it on or no?
[17:28:47] <snoarin> The tank isnt installed yet
[17:29:09] <RazorSharpFang> The difference between those two posts is amazing.
[17:30:11] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: Bjarne is kinda the gold standard
[17:30:27] <RazorSharpFang> Bjarne? Never came across that before.
[17:30:31] <JustAberrant> if you really want to learn and understand the language
[17:30:49] <RazorSharpFang> Oh, maker of C++

[17:30:53] <PinkiePieBot> [ Robot Check ]
[17:31:03] <JustAberrant> lol @ PinkiePieBot :D
[17:31:43] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it's good and comprehensive.. if your looking to just learn enough to get by there's probably better choices
[17:32:18] <RazorSharpFang> Well, I have a unit in C++ next semester, and I've heard that C++ is an awfully complex language.
[17:32:29] <HoneyDrops> snoarin: I would not, the issue has to do with cure times.  Below 70F it might fail to cure, or take so long to cure it would fail to adhere properly to the tank.  Normally I would fudge it, but fuel tank falls on the "better safe than sorry" category.
[17:32:44] <JustAberrant> http://www.amazon.com/The-Programming-Language-4th-Edition/dp/0321563840/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1F8VWAT59NPSD1665V9F  <-- actually meant to link to this one
[17:33:13] <snoarin> Well I was going to spray it outside and bring it into the house to cure
[17:33:29] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: it can be.. it's old and lacks a lot of convenience of newer languages
[17:33:46] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: and (imo) a lot of the newer stuff they've added just doesn't fit onto the old frame very well
[17:33:53] <HoneyDrops> snoarin Oh, that would be fine.  ideally keep it inside to pre-warm it.  And give it some extra time in either case.
[17:34:15] * HoneyDrops prefers C.
[17:34:49] <snoarin> I only got the spray on kit because I rather protect it more
[17:34:56] <JustAberrant> c is way too tedious to do anything that's not very purpose specific imo, but to be honest I'm not overly fond of either of them any more
[17:35:04] * JustAberrant used to be a fairly big c++ fanboy.. but.. meh
[17:36:23] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Is there a language you feel that's more modern than C++ and doesn't suffer from the shortfalls of languages such as Python, or Java, etc... ?
[17:36:42] * JustAberrant a java fanboy.. it gets a lot of hate but it's insanely popular for a reason
[17:36:58] <RazorSharpFang> Why can I use operator overloading? ;-;
[17:37:02] <JustAberrant> c#, which I don't know or use, but gets a lot of praise for the same reason
[17:37:18] <RazorSharpFang> What is that reason, incidentally?
[17:38:02] <JustAberrant> it's got a generally standardized code style, and a very well established tool stack
[17:38:48] <JustAberrant> plus garbage collection vs managing your own memory (which for every c++ fanboy who can actually do that properly there are 10 that can't) 
[17:39:04] <RazorSharpFang> I do really appreciate how big the java library is.
[17:39:15] <RazorSharpFang> java.awt.Robot is a lovely class.
[17:39:31] <JustAberrant> it's not even the standard library , it's stuff like ivy, maven, hudson, spring, hibernate..
[17:39:40] <RazorSharpFang> javax?
[17:39:41] <JustAberrant> jboss..
[17:39:51] <JustAberrant> ah, talking third party libraries and tools
[17:39:55] <JustAberrant> * nah
[17:40:07] * HoneyDrops wishes Java would use makefiles.
[17:40:11] <JustAberrant> that's _really_ where java excels
[17:40:21] <RazorSharpFang> Oh, third party tools. I haven't used any of those. The unit's been using only standard java libraries.
[17:40:22] <JustAberrant> pff, makefiles suck
[17:40:24] <HoneyDrops> Drives me nuts when trying to patch MC mods.
[17:40:42] <RazorSharpFang> Can't you just make your own makefile? : /
[17:40:45] <HoneyDrops> They are simple, easy to read, and easy to write.
[17:40:49] <JustAberrant> the lack of a non-shitty build system for c/c++ is one of my big complaints

[17:41:40] <JustAberrant> makefiles work fine on small stuff, but without dependency resolution or sane conditional building you end up with these huge build systems that are a mixture of shell scripts
[17:41:42] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Also, what IDE do you recommend for C++? I've been trying to use Code::Blocks, but I'm also used to NetBeans.
[17:42:11] <JustAberrant> I've become partial to Qt creator
[17:42:22] <JustAberrant> generally when I do c++ these days it's with Qt
[17:42:24] <RazorSharpFang> First I've heard of that one.
[17:42:30] <JustAberrant> I used to use sun studio at work.. but wouldn't recommend that ;p

[17:47:15] <RazorSharpFang> My library's got a digital copy I can get for free.
[17:47:32] * JustAberrant thinks so ;p
[17:48:14] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: also, I pose this simple challenge to those who tell me makefiles don't suck
[17:48:18] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Also, for compilers, g++? Or something else?
[17:48:41] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: honestly early on, it doesn't really matter, truthfully later on it doesn't really matter ;p
[17:48:59] <JustAberrant> I use g++
[17:48:59] * RazorSharpFang uses the Borland C++ compiler
[17:49:03] <JustAberrant> hehe
[17:49:07] <JustAberrant> I learned on borland actually
[17:49:12] <JustAberrant> turbo c :D

[17:49:54] <JustAberrant> yeah, upgrade to something modern ;p
[17:50:13] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: so lets say I've got a pretty dan standard structure:
[17:50:13] <JustAberrant> ponies/src/pony_behaviours/some_behaviour.cpp
[17:50:13] <JustAberrant> ponies/src/main.cpp
[17:50:13] <RazorSharpFang> Sometimes I forget that I need a temporary variables.
[17:50:31] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: And I want:
[17:50:31] <JustAberrant> ponies/obj/pony_behaviours/some_behaviour.o
[17:50:31] <JustAberrant> ponies/obj/main.o
[17:50:31] <JustAberrant> ponies/bin/ponies
[17:50:41] <JustAberrant> without having to explicitly list every source directory and file
[17:51:21] <JustAberrant> the problem becomes reproducing the structure of src in obj
[17:51:23] <JustAberrant> make can't do it
[17:51:28] <HoneyDrops> Sounds like a job for find.
[17:51:36] <JustAberrant> the prescribed solution seems to either by redundant make files in every directory, or some scary pseudo-shell code in make itself to try and recreate the directory structure in obj/
[17:51:45] <JustAberrant> exactly.. which is shitty and stupid
[17:52:02] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: I build my Java programs with collections of shell scripts
[17:52:16] <HoneyDrops> No, it's knowing the scope of the tool, and knowing it's intended to be used with other tools.
[17:52:21] <RazorSharpFang> I build my java programs by pressing the build button.
[17:52:21] <JustAberrant> this is an insanely common use case, and make can't handle it without devolving into shitty non-portable hacks
[17:52:22] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: Also, make can do exactly what you're talking about

[18:02:45] <AppleDash> :D
[18:04:27] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: also that's a terrible excuse.. I'm all for purpose built tools, but that kind of thing would definitely seem within the purpose of make.. plus you may some day want to compile on windows 
[18:05:27] <RazorSharpFang> Better make your build tool in java.
[18:05:29] <JustAberrant> either way, that's just example one of about a billion of why make is terrible and why just about every project I've ever been involved with has a horrifying maze of shell scripts to build anything relating to c++
[18:05:44] <JustAberrant> make is fine for smaller stuff
[18:05:56] <RazorSharpFang> Why not "make" your own make system?
[18:05:59] <JustAberrant> but on a sizable project with external dependencies it becomes an absolute nightmare
[18:06:27] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: because by using established tools, you are benefiting from the collective time spent working on them
[18:06:51] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: developing something as powerful as maven would be insane for one company to do if that wasn't their main product
[18:06:57] <RazorSharpFang> Which makes make great, right?
[18:07:06] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: I generally think so
[18:07:06] <RazorSharpFang> XD 
[18:07:27] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: No, no I wouldn't.
[18:07:32] <RazorSharpFang> Or, to put it another way, if make wasn't used extensively, it wouldn't be half of the program it is.
[18:08:19] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: yeah yeah, idealism aside it's still stupid to have to make hacky calls to external programs for really basic stuff like that
[18:08:38] * RazorSharpFang looks up maven
[18:08:59] <JustAberrant> maven also benefits from it's vast repository
[18:09:00] * HoneyDrops shrugs.  I don't see the point in duplicating functionality when a general purpose tool is there.
[18:09:12] <RazorSharpFang> Apache Maven?
[18:09:15] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: aye
[18:09:15] <HoneyDrops> Just different viewpoints, which is fine.
[18:09:28] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: why even use make then, why not just use a shell script..
[18:09:39] <RazorSharpFang> Wikipedia: "This article may be too technical for most readers to understand." Me: "Yaaas"
[18:10:00] <JustAberrant> the whole benefit of declarative structure is lost when you have to do silly hacks like that
[18:10:06] <JustAberrant> may as well just have compile.sh
[18:10:39] <RazorSharpFang> what does sh stand for again? Shell... hack?
[18:10:54] <JustAberrant> I always assumed SHell.. but who knows ;p
[18:10:57] <HoneyDrops> shell
[18:11:04] <JustAberrant> maven's big trick is that it'll pull down dependencies for you
[18:11:06] <RazorSharpFang> That's not how acronyms work. >.>
[18:11:36] <HoneyDrops> sh is not an acronym?  It's an abbreviation.
[18:11:40] <JustAberrant> so if you want to use say, junit, or log4j, you add an entry in your buildfile and it'll automatically pull down the dependency at compile time (if it doesn't have ti cached locally) and built it into the project
[18:11:45] <HoneyDrops> Also /bin/sh
[18:12:05] <JustAberrant> you can also publish your own dependencies to your own repository and have dependencies against them
[18:12:09] <RazorSharpFang> Ooh, I've got 269 viewers.
[18:12:11] <JustAberrant> so if you have  SomeCOmpanyWideLibrary
[18:12:22] <JustAberrant> all your other projects can depend on SomeCompanyWideLibrary
[18:12:46] <JustAberrant> and when you compile them, depending on how you have rules set up, it can pull the latest version, latest from a specific stream, etc..
[18:12:47] <HoneyDrops> I view dep fetching beyond the scope of the build system, you have a package manager to handle fetching and installing things.
[18:13:21] <RazorSharpFang> Well, building is all about automation
[18:13:37] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: ...
[18:14:00] <JustAberrant> it's not _just_ about pulling down the libraries..
[18:14:07] <JustAberrant> it's about being able to conditionally use different sets of them
[18:14:08] *** snoarin is now known as Vega
[18:14:24] <JustAberrant> so you can build your release stream using the latest release stream versions
[18:14:47] <JustAberrant> and your debug stream using the debug stream.. and you can build for different target environments using a different set entirely
[18:15:00] <RazorSharpFang> Maven was written in java. Interesting.
[18:15:04] <JustAberrant> it will also pull in different configurations for you, etc..
[18:15:22] <HoneyDrops> I'm not saying maven and the like isn't handy, though why XML I will never grasp.
[18:15:34] <RazorSharpFang> JSON > XML
[18:15:44] <JustAberrant> gradle doesn't use xml.. but I prefer maven
[18:15:50] <HoneyDrops> Given the choice, yes, I would use JSON.
[18:15:51] *** Joins: Asoka_White (Asoka@Pony-ff485o.net-htp.de)
[18:16:00] <HoneyDrops> but XML is painful to write
[18:16:12] <JustAberrant> sure, but there's frontends that write it for you
[18:16:19] <RazorSharpFang> I agree. All those angle brackets, bleh
[18:16:41] * HoneyDrops uses vim and shell.
[18:16:47] <JustAberrant> either way, it's the existence of tools like maven and gradle and the lack of such tools for c++ is a big reason java is popular in business
[18:16:55] <RazorSharpFang> <xml> <level> <object x=5 y=3 class="player" /> </level> </xml>
[18:17:22] <RazorSharpFang> And I suppose that is good for Oracle.
[18:17:36] <JustAberrant> meh, I gave up on vim a long time ago.. it's nice, but takes too much effort to get it to do what a modern ide will do out of the box
[18:17:48] <JustAberrant> it's way easier to add vi like commands to eclipse than make vi do what eclipse does
[18:17:51] <RazorSharpFang> Well, Vim is in the console.

[18:18:28] <JustAberrant> vi is still my go to for config files or if I just need to quickly change something for a test.. but if I actually sit down to do real dev I usually use eclipse (java) or qt creator (c++)
[18:18:59] <HoneyDrops> I don't really have vim do much fancy for me.  I have a few scripts, but I basically just want an editor.
[18:19:16] <RazorSharpFang> I've gotten really used to netbeans. : /
[18:19:35] * JustAberrant never warmed up to netbeans, but it's kinda one of the big 3 for java
[18:19:45] <Eclipse> eclipse is terrible
[18:19:48] <Eclipse> just use intellij
[18:19:50] <RazorSharpFang> Do you know if it's C++ support is good?
[18:19:54] <Eclipse> since that actually has ideavim
[18:20:07] <RazorSharpFang> Eclipse: I never got the hang on intellij. I think I had configuration issues.
[18:20:21] * JustAberrant mostly uses eclipse because the company he currently works for uses it 
[18:20:34] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Just doing as you're told? XD
[18:20:42] <Eclipse> a side effect of this nick is that i know every single time that people talk about awful Java IDEs
[18:20:44] <JustAberrant> we have a lot of 3rd party tools that are integrated into it and some custom ones ;p
[18:21:09] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: hehe, I've never been a boat rocker.. they're paying me, I'll use what they want me to use ;p
[18:21:34] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: I push my preferences and sometimes win, but end of the day everyone can't do what they feel like, you have to pick a direction and go in it
[18:21:39] <RazorSharpFang> You know your workplace sucks when they see you smiling as "rocking the boat"
[18:21:53] <RazorSharpFang> "Take that smile off your face"
[18:21:56] <RazorSharpFang> PAH
[18:22:13] <JustAberrant> there was a guy once who absolutely refused to follow our coding convention
[18:22:23] <RazorSharpFang> Now that's just being silly.
[18:22:28] <JustAberrant> like.. I'm not a fan of parts of it, but I get the importance of everyone using the same thing
[18:22:34] <RazorSharpFang> Totally
[18:22:37] <JustAberrant> yeah, he eventually got fired for other reasons
[18:22:52] <RazorSharpFang> I prefer the one with the indentation, and the line breaks.
[18:22:54] <Eclipse> gofmt is a good idea and every language should have one 
[18:22:57] <Eclipse> just saying
[18:23:17] <JustAberrant> hehe
[18:23:25] <JustAberrant> we use checkstyle and sonar
[18:23:28] <JustAberrant> which arn't bad
[18:23:43] <RazorSharpFang> I don't like coding styles that don't permit tabs, white space and newlines.
[18:23:53] <RazorSharpFang> Those are awful.
[18:24:51] <JustAberrant> either way, lot of people come out of university and culture clash hard where I work
[18:24:56] <JustAberrant> it's interesting
[18:25:19] <RazorSharpFang> Myself, I use "The one true coding style", heard of that one?
[18:26:10] <JustAberrant> possibly
[18:26:25] <RazorSharpFang> It's like function foo { \n \*CODEGOESHERE*\ } instead of function foo\n {\*CODEGOESHERE*\}
[18:26:45] <RazorSharpFang> Or something.
[18:27:00] * JustAberrant is fine with either, though I tend to prefer the first one
[18:27:05] <JustAberrant> err, second one
[18:27:10] <JustAberrant> the important thing is consistency though
[18:27:11] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Example here: http://razorsharpfang.com/test.java
[18:27:37] <JustAberrant> doesn't really matter what you do as long as everyone working on the same code does the same
[18:28:00] <RazorSharpFang> Oh defs, but if it's not one I'm used to, it'll take me a while to get used to it.
[18:28:52] <RazorSharpFang> Lulz, the intendation is a tad messed up.
[18:29:16] <RazorSharpFang> Wonder why that happened.

[23:12:00] <Pocky> its amd as far as i know
[23:12:10] <Vega> All Wikipedia is saying, is it is gcn, and can do 4k
[23:12:18] <Vega> Ya I know that much :p
[23:12:21] <Lapsus> it's one designed by amd for the xbox :p
[23:12:37] <Vega> Not sure if my 270 oc can run need for speed as good as it looks right now
[23:12:43] <Lapsus> I'd be incredibly surprised if it could handle 4k ever
[23:12:55] <HoneyDrops> ^ You can't really compare general PC parts with specialty hardware.
[23:12:56] <Lapsus> it probably does it at like 30fps
[23:13:00] <Lapsus> if at all
[23:13:13] <Vega> I seen a cut scene. And I was almost fooled that the people were real. Never been that close before.
[23:13:27] <Vega> For me*
[23:13:31] <Lapsus> "In PC terms, the Xbox One has a GPU that’s similar to the entry-level Bonaire GPU in the older Radeon HD 7790"
[23:13:45] <Lapsus> also, cutscenes don't count
[23:13:51] <Lapsus> that's just playing a video :p
