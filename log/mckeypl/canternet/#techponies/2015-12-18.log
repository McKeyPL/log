[01:02:48] <Webster> mniip: Yeah, it's used. I use it at work.
[01:03:13] <Webster> I'd say use whatever language you're most comfortable with unless you know you're really going to need maximum performance out of it.
[01:03:40] <mniip> I am comfortable with C
[01:03:45] <mniip> however
[01:04:12] <mniip> it's also rather tedious to code something like this
[01:05:00] <Webster> Use C++ and wrap it in a class? Or be lazy and use Boost.
[01:05:40] <mniip> no fuck boost
[01:05:51] <mniip> C++ seems appealing but
[01:05:52] <mniip> ugh
[01:05:57] <Webster> Hah, I know how that is.
[01:06:29] <Webster> I've basically went from using mostly C to C++ at work, which started because someone else was using C++. The whole objects thing is quite nice. :P

[01:07:47] <johnsey> in the end, it's all just fancy wrappers around syscalls, so i'd use what you're most comfortable with

[19:46:13] <Caerdwyn> Going to pose a question to any network savvy people: Why, when you use your own domain name (that resolves to a computer in your home), can you not connect to said machine, but outside the LAN, you can?
[19:46:52] <Caerdwyn> i.e.: I use my domain on my phone to connect home for weechat when I am not on my wifi, but when I am, my domain still resolves to my IP address, but times out when I try to connect, making me change it to my computer's LAN IP/hostname
[19:49:06] <AppleDash> You don't have hairpin NAT correctly configured
[19:49:22] <Caerdwyn> It's dd-wrt, if that helps
[19:49:37] <AppleDash> That had hairpin working out of the box for me
[19:49:42] <Caerdwyn> In this case, it's just a bunch of ports all forwarded from my domain to my pc
[19:50:32] <AppleDash> Honestly, I would probably personally just use an internal hostname to access my internal services
[19:50:50] *** Pocketguns2 is now known as Pocky
[19:51:03] <Caerdwyn> I do, but what I don't get is why I can ping my domain name, it resolves to my IP address correctly, but I can't connect to anything using it
[19:51:15] <AppleDash> I told you why
[19:51:27] <AppleDash> Your router isn't configured to route those packets properly
[19:51:30] <Caerdwyn> AppleDash: is hairpin part of dd-wrt?
[19:51:45] <AppleDash> It's a part of anything that you can set firewall rules on
[19:52:07] <AppleDash> And there's a reason for it not to be working - connections like you describe would appear to be coming from your router's IP, not the actual originating LAN IP
[19:52:51] <Caerdwyn> Basically, I want my phone to connect to my machine with my domain name always, that way when I am not on wifi, I don't have to keep changing the connection settings each time I leave my house. It's a pain in the ass
[19:53:54] <AppleDash> Unfortunately nobody on Google seems to know how to make it work
[19:53:58] <Caerdwyn> Funny
[19:54:02] <Caerdwyn> I'm already digging through that

[20:00:40] <Caerdwyn> Telnet'd into the router, issued the command, and bam, it works.
[20:01:13] <Caerdwyn> According to dd-wrt forums, it's turned off on purpose for "security reasons". Go figure.

[20:14:50] <Caerdwyn> had to lookup how to drop iptables rules >_<

[20:17:13] <Caerdwyn> apparently iptables didn't like this
[20:24:37] <Caerdwyn> ok, so discovered, it wasnt iptables that did that

[20:58:45] <Moonlightning> Pretty sure there's quite a bit of back-and-forth using TCP before that prompt can happen
[21:00:24] <Moonlightning> From my cursory reading of that article, DNS rebinding is not at all mitigated by intentionally breaking hairpin routing
[21:01:00] <Moonlightning> Hosts behind NAT can still communicate with other hosts behind NAT, and with the attacker (who is presumably not behind NAT, or has appropriate DNAT routing configured)

[21:54:48] <Moonlightning> …I think some do, actually. For firmware updates. :/
[21:56:37] <Sour_Sweet> My router doesn't support TLS for internal configuration access iirc ^^ It does for external access though.
[21:58:54] <Sour_Sweet> Also that conversation gave me an awesome idea for new attack vectors. I need find my old crappy routers again.
[21:59:55] <Gladiolus> All in ones seem obsolete these days to me, Divide|TechSupport 
[22:00:02] <Gladiolus> You can just get a laptop. Same deal, less clunky.
[22:00:15] <Gladiolus> They originally existed because LCDs blew and CRTs aren’t exactly portable.
[22:00:53] <Gladiolus> AIOs are just a weird middle ground between a laptop and a desktop and destroy them all. Yet I still want a 5K iMac.
[22:01:25] <Gladiolus> It’s one of those “I want it, but I will not pay for it.” Mostly because of a lack of GPU oomph.
[22:01:36] <Gladiolus> I also want an apple watch and an ipad pro but won’t pay a cent for either.
[22:01:48] <AppleDash> Get a normal 5k monitor
[22:02:05] <Gladiolus> Do 5K monitors actually exist? 4K certainly does that I know.
[22:02:14] <AppleDash> They do
[22:02:19] <Gladiolus> Neat.
[22:02:25] <Gladiolus> Well when I have All The Money I will.
[22:02:25] <AppleDash> IIRC 8k has ben developed
[22:02:30] <AppleDash> been*
[22:02:41] <Gladiolus> Yeah but can HDMI even /do/ 8K right now?
[22:02:48] <Gladiolus> Or displayport or whatever.
[22:03:22] <AppleDash> Not at 60 FPS
[22:03:37] <Gladiolus> ww

[22:03:50] <Gladiolus> Also wikipedia states that HDMI2 can’t do more than 4k at all
[22:04:16] <Sour_Sweet> For 8k they use weird 2x HDMI / DisplayPort solutions
[22:04:25] <Gladiolus> Displayport can do 8k at 60.

[22:04:32] <Gladiolus> WEll, 57
[22:04:49] <Gladiolus> no wait I’m reading this wrong lol, yes it can do 8k at 60
[22:05:47] <Gladiolus> I like how my Macbooks thunderbolt ports double as minidisplayport. I can, and have, had 4 external monitors lol.
[22:05:56] <Sour_Sweet> Maybe it was just at a higher refresh rate, I dunno, but I've seen both 2x HDMI and DisplayPort setups on trade fairs
[22:06:20] <Gladiolus> You would neex 2x hdmi and maybe older displayport requires 2.
[22:06:50] <Sour_Sweet> On prototypes that is. I'm not sure about acutal of the line models.
[22:07:07] <Sour_Sweet> It's been some time 6_9
[22:07:15] <Gladiolus> Displayport is limited to 3 meters apparently, did not know that.
[22:07:29] <Colgate> DP is a pretty high freq signal
[22:07:35] <Colgate> makes sense

[22:43:58] <Unixkitty> Not sure if this is a dumb question, but is there any software for Windows that could follow a process/program and show what it's doing?
[22:44:10] <Unixkitty> Google doesn't seem to be very helpful for some reason
[22:45:36] <Sour_Sweet> Depends on what exactly you're looking for. There sure is one for almost any usecase
[22:45:48] <Sour_Sweet> Because on first glance that sounds like a debugger :D
[22:46:11] <Unixkitty> Not really, more of a way to see if a program does anything malicious
[22:47:03] <Moonlightning> GeekBrony: Cool!
[22:47:13] <Sour_Sweet> System explorer let's you see spawned processes and network connections (though not meant for your task)
[22:47:51] <Sour_Sweet> I can't remember the name of the tools that let's you monitor registry and file system access
[22:48:22] <Sour_Sweet> But in any case if the malware if halfway well written you won't be able to find much this way
[22:48:34] <Unixkitty> Of course not
[22:49:14] <Unixkitty> Registry and filesystem access log however would be helpful

[23:48:01] <Quindo> evidently they had a bug and campaigns could access each others data.
[23:48:41] <Moonlightning> And they blamed the Sanders campaign for it?
[23:48:41] <Quindo> Someone from the bernie camp evidently ran some queries,
[23:48:50] <Moonlightning> Ugh they're stupid
[23:48:54] <Moonlightning> What does this mean for Bernie?
[23:49:00] <Quindo> That person is claiming he was checking how much of their data was exposed.
[23:49:09] <Quindo> he has been fired from the bernie camp
[23:49:30] <Moonlightning> And the Bernie camp has been banned from the Democrats?

[23:50:24] <Colgate> "She added, "That is just like if you walked into someone's home when the door was unlocked and took things that don't belong to you in order to use them for your own benefit. That's inappropriate. Unacceptable.""
[23:50:27] <Colgate> this quote is wrong
[23:50:31] <Quindo> But evidently this is not the first time this has happened.
[23:50:51] <Colgate> it is more akin to walking into someone's home, making a copy of all their books, and then walking out
[23:50:56] <Moonlightning> ^
[23:51:10] <Quindo> No, its like if I opened my mailbox and there was a bunch of opened letters in them...
[23:51:25] <Moonlightning> No, that's a MitM, Quindo.
[23:51:32] <Moonlightning> This case (AFAIK) is of information being /served./

[23:51:42] <Colgate> they asked for info, and they got it :P

[23:51:50] <Quindo> so, if a "Select * from Mystuff" returned both mine and your stuff?
[23:52:05] <Quindo> that is really what it comes down to.
