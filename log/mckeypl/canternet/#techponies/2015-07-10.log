[03:10:15] <init3> I've never heard of that. 
[03:10:52] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i know the tsa was trying to get some bill passed that required it, never heard anything else about it though
[03:11:31] <init3> I mean, that'd effectively make a lot of corporate users unable to fly. 
[03:11:43] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> nod
[03:12:03] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> it would also go against PIPA/sox
[03:13:15] <Moonlightning> ^3 Not really.
[03:13:16] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> so chances are pretty good that it got shot down
[03:13:27] <Moonlightning> What you do is—and it's recommended that you do this anyway—
[03:13:51] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> ship your devices ahead of your trip?
[03:13:56] <Moonlightning> Bring a stock machine with you. Just the OS and maybe some basic stuff like certificate authority certs. No sensitive information.
[03:14:06] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> ah
[03:14:16] <Moonlightning> If the device is seized or leaves your sight in ““airport security”” discard it and cancel the trip.
[03:14:21] * DJ-C0L7[CSS] nods
[03:14:40] <Moonlightning> When you reach your destination, connect back to base over a VPN. Store all information back home; keep nothing on the device.
[03:14:53] <Moonlightning> Nuke any storage before going back through ““airport security””.
[03:15:05] <init3> So, since I switched to RADIUS my WAPs do wifi roaming a shit load better. The RADIUS server doesn't actually start handling the WPA handshake at all does it?
[03:15:44] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> radius just handles the auth
[03:15:46] <Moonlightning> If you /must/ (e.g. in cases of no connectivity), you can keep things on the device for short periods of time, but transfer them off as soon as possible.
[03:18:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> thats just good practice reguardless
[03:25:29] <init3> THat's what I thought. I wonder why it is so much better at roaming. 
[03:25:48] <init3> Myabe just because it is WPA2 /Enterprise/?
[03:26:12] <init3> I wonder if that is specifically designed to handle roaming whereas personal may not me.

[03:26:24] <init3> Hmm
[03:26:59] <init3> Can you think of any reason it'd be better? Maybe the router is just being less shitty all of a sudden. 
[03:27:12] <Colgate> wpa2-enterprise vs "personal(psk)" is just how auth and keys are generated
[03:28:18] <init3> That's what I thought. 
[03:29:13] <init3> I wasn't sure if there was other differences. Maybe it just happens to be that the router's implementation of WPA2 ent is better. 
[03:30:02] <init3> Because the roaming always worked great if the network was open and it got slightly worse as I upped security. 
[03:30:30] <init3> So WEP worked better than WPA which worked better than WPA2 but I'm not going to use WEP or WPA obviously.
