[02:55:40] <Gladiolus> oh, the other dos

[02:57:55] <Gigaway> my house connection was giving me 450KBs
[02:58:16] <Gigaway> there we go 696.6

[03:13:52] <Lapsus> Apparently my SSD total bytes written is 1.84TB

[03:15:10] <Gladiolus> also how do you find out? what's the tool
[03:19:50] <Lapsus> It's a samsung SSD, so I'm using samsung's tools. It can only read smart data from other drives
[03:20:08] <Lapsus> it only reads 3237 hours on
[03:20:44] <Lapsus> so like 4.4 months
[03:22:39] <Gladiolus> Well I can see if you've used it for stuff, 2TB of total use isn't all that much.
[03:23:06] <Lapsus> I guess.
[03:23:17] <Lapsus> I wish I could get that data for my other drives, lol
[03:23:28] <Lapsus> the oldest one is almost 5 years of hours on
[03:23:41] <Gladiolus> I don't think most HDDs would even track it.
[03:24:00] <Gladiolus> Since they operate differently and wouldn't really care.
[03:24:15] <Lapsus> SSDs in theory all track it because limited lifetime, but it's not like I can pull it from my other one
[03:24:33] <Gladiolus> Yeah exactly, also if the other drive is also an SSD, check it's manufactuer I guess.
[03:24:50] <Gladiolus> Mines at 4.40TB, in use since january.
[03:25:38] <Lapsus> I think the main issue is that my brain still thinks "oh a TB is huge"
[03:26:07] <Lapsus> when ssd lifetimes are in the 2+PB range
[03:27:04] <Gladiolus> From what I can tell my 120GB Samsung 840 averages 400TB writes.
[03:27:13] <Gladiolus> So lol ten more years.
[03:27:23] <Gladiolus> wait no that would only be 40
[03:27:28] <Gladiolus> or 80, below 100 anyway
[03:28:59] <Lapsus> I need to look up that ssd torture test again
[03:32:32] <Gladiolus> huh
[03:32:42] <Gladiolus> apparently something called rapid mode speeds up the drive greatly, time to give that a try

[04:17:22] <AppleDash> OK, so... My Windows 10 time keeps resetting

[04:17:34] <AppleDash> My time zone is set correctl
[04:17:35] <AppleDash> y
[04:17:42] <AppleDash> This happens on both of my machines that have Windows 10 on them
[04:17:44] <AppleDash> wat do?
[04:18:53] <Rylee> AppleDash: have you considered that you are actually 4 hours ahead of where you think you are
[04:19:12] <AppleDash> No.
[04:19:15] <AppleDash> I know what time it is
[04:19:20] <Rylee> are you sure
[04:19:21] <AppleDash> The time zone setting is the same under Linux
[04:19:24] <AppleDash> And the time is right
[04:20:20] <RainbowHacks> Are you really sure AppleDash ?
[04:20:36] <RainbowHacks> Also, Linux is known to cause issues with Windows's clock, the issue may be popping up again with 10
[04:20:42] <AppleDash> I am certain

[04:24:57] <RainbowHacks> NO SOUP? D:
[04:25:02] <JustAberrant> and when you try to explain soup to someone they look at you like you're completely insane

[18:19:57] <init3> I say f-s-tab but it seems to be like a 50/50 split among my friends
[18:20:07] <wolfyshy> f.s. tab
[18:20:14] <wolfyshy> because it's the file system table

[18:20:31] <init3> It's not stabbing anyone Lapsus!
[18:20:52] <Lapsus> I know it's supposed to be f-s-tab but f-stab is funnier

[18:52:00] <init3> Sometimes I feel like some distros are named the way they are just so you can tell who really knows them by how they pronounce them. 
[18:52:11] <init3> Suse is a good example of that. 
[18:52:36] <init3> It should not be pronounced the way it is to an English speaker. 
[18:52:55] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you mean like how some people say ubuntu you bun two
[18:52:57] <AppleDash> How is it supposed to be pronounced then?
[18:53:15] <Midnight_Tinker> I'm of the opinion that pronunciation is subjective, especially for things that aren't usually spoken, but instead typed
[18:53:57] <init3> Agreed for the most part.

[18:59:19] <Midnight_Tinker> gift -t, graphic, someone who makes the word has no say on how its pronounced especially when the linguistic precedent is so obviously in favor of one way
[19:02:09] <Moonlightning> Midnight_Tinker: the antecedent gets to decide on its own name and the pronounciation of the name. If the antecedent is not sapient, then its owner|creator|whatever gets to decide.
[19:02:40] <Moonlightning> AFAIK the creator of the Graphics Interchange Format pronounced it with a soft G, after the brand of peanut butter. I follow suit.
[19:03:35] *** Joins: Crimson_Tail (Bluepon@Pony-mgrg2c.s0tm.sdub.0151.2601.IP)
[19:03:59] <Moonlightning> My name is Moonlightning, and it's pronounced like the word /moon/ immediately pronounced by the word /lightning/, with no pause. If you're going to tell me I'm not or it's not, you can go fuck off. :V
[19:04:20] <Moonlightning> Besides, English is very inconsistent with pronounciations. See also: -ough
[19:04:39] <init3> But linguistically Moon Lightning makes sense. 
[19:04:47] <init3> It is clearly a compound word
[19:05:12] <Moonlightning> The /igh/ part doesn't. What do you mean, the G and H are silent? Why are they in the word, then? :P
[19:05:30] *** Parts: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net) ("Leaving")
[19:05:31] <Moonlightning> mow-lig-hh-t-nihng
[19:05:41] <Moonlightning> Linguistically, it should be pronounced like that.
[19:06:05] <init3> But it is a common english word. 
[19:06:18] <Midnight_Tinker> its from an old germanic base. In a more guttural language like German, it would be pronounced, mostly from the back of the throught
[19:06:31] <wolfyshy> throat*
[19:06:34] <wolfyshy> or was that a pun
[19:06:40] <Midnight_Tinker> sorry, I'm at work
[19:06:44] <Midnight_Tinker> not paying 200% attention
[19:06:50] <Moonlightning> Speaking of that.
[19:06:59] <init3> I think it was summed up best by someone in one of Snapai's streams. 
[19:07:02] <Moonlightning> trough, through, though, thought
[19:07:11] <Moonlightning> The /ough/ is all pronounced differently. Wut?
[19:07:40] <Midnight_Tinker> the problem with having thousands of distinct vocal sounds and only 26 letters, and so many loanwords from different languages
[19:07:49] <init3> "It's pronounced jiff" - inventor of .gif. "It's pronounced giff" - Inventor of the G.
[19:08:43] <init3> Besides, it stands for Graphics interchange format right?
[19:08:45] <Moonlightning> The inventor of the thing to which the acronym refers takes precedent.
[19:08:54] <Midnight_Tinker> example: language, pronounced lang-wige by most American English speakers, but spelled close to its Latin root: lingua
[19:09:05] <init3> "Graphics" is not pronounced with a J sound
[19:09:21] <Moonlightning> init3: you don't always pronounce acronyms as the letters of their words are pronounced.
[19:09:31] <init3> Fair enough.
[19:09:31] <Midnight_Tinker> Moonlightning: examples?
[19:09:52] <Moonlightning> SCUBA.
[19:10:00] <Moonlightning> Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus
[19:10:09] <Moonlightning> Clearly, it should be pronounced sc-uh-buh
[19:10:18] <Moonlightning> scuh-bah *
[19:10:21] <Moonlightning> not scoo-buh
[19:10:32] <Moonlightning> Because the U in Underwater is /uh/
[19:10:43] <init3> But
[19:10:44] <Moonlightning> And the A in Apparatus is /ahh/
[19:10:48] <Moonlightning> No buts!
[19:10:53] <Moonlightning> G for Graphic, so hard gif?
[19:11:00] <Moonlightning> scuh-bah.
[19:11:08] <Moonlightning> U for Underwater, A for apparatus.
[19:11:08] <init3> Fair enough,you win that one Trebeck.
[19:11:20] <Midnight_Tinker> SCUBA is a different case. Its pronunciation was altered in the vowels only for easier enunciation
[19:11:23] <Moonlightning> Now start pronouncing ALL your acronyms that way.
[19:11:36] <init3> However, I do think that  language is something that's fluid. 
[19:11:44] <init3> And that popular use is important. 
[19:11:46] <Midnight_Tinker> find me an acronym where a non-awkward consonant was changed for no other reason than personal preference
[19:12:13] <Midnight_Tinker> or even a word
[19:12:26] <Midnight_Tinker> I again, bring you back to "light"
[19:12:29] <Moonlightning> How about /through/?
[19:12:38] <Moonlightning> Pronouncing it /thruff/ wouldn't be awkward
[19:12:45] <Moonlightning> It'd just be different.
[19:13:01] <Moonlightning> Anyway, all this is moot to me, because creator of the thing… :P
[19:13:09] <init3> Considering that the creator of gif took something like 20 years to clear up the pronunciation I think makes the "The creator gets to decide" argument much weaker. 
[19:13:13] <Midnight_Tinker> ^
[19:13:25] <Midnight_Tinker> and through has linguistic history, its not an originally English word
[19:13:25] <init3> Because he didn't for so long. 
[19:13:35] <Moonlightning> Really?
[19:13:38] <Midnight_Tinker> so, per yourself, antecedent takes precedence
[19:13:54] <Moonlightning> Midnight_Tinker: unfortunately, the GIF is not a being we can talk to. :p
[19:14:10] <Moonlightning> We'll have to go by what its creator said.
[19:14:12] <Midnight_Tinker> no, but we can look at its precursors and its similar wording
[19:14:26] <Moonlightning> Sorry, I thought you just said that what the antecedent wants takes precedence?
[19:14:40] <Moonlightning> [10:13:38] < Midnight_Tinker> so, per yourself, antecedent takes precedence
[19:14:42] <Moonlightning> Quite sure yo udid.
[19:15:04] <Midnight_Tinker> and the antecedent of GIF is the words it represents
[19:15:11] <Midnight_Tinker> Graphic Interchange Format
[19:15:20] <Moonlightning> Nooo, the antecedent of /GIF/ is the format.
[19:15:26] <Moonlightning> Protip: look up the word /antecedent/
[19:15:37] <Midnight_Tinker> a thing or event that existed before or logically precedes another.
[19:15:47] <Midnight_Tinker> the thing that logically precedes a construction is its parts
[19:15:57] <Midnight_Tinker> a house, before it was a house, was stone, clay, wood, etc
[19:16:21] <Moonlightning> And an acronym, before it was an acronym, was…various words? That doesn't work quite as well.
[19:16:28] <Moonlightning> In any case, you're looking at the wrong definition.
[19:16:35] <Midnight_Tinker> brb
[19:16:46] <init3> I also think many things in english can only be pronounced/interpreted correctly with a few factors considered. 
[19:17:32] <init3> Look at this like a  science problem and the evidence it should be pronounced with a G sound seems to be more favorable linguistically. 
[19:17:47] <init3> Add cultural precedent to that 
[19:18:16] <init3> I get what you are saying, like your argument makes total sense. 
[19:18:29] <Moonlightning> But if you're considering cultural precedent…look at the brand name Jif.
[19:18:46] <Moonlightning> And the many people who've pronounced it.
[19:19:03] <Moonlightning> Because that's partly what the acronym is based on.

[19:19:22] <Midnight_Tinker> then by your logic both pronunciations are acceptable
[19:19:36] <init3> If I make a new thing I should be able to call it what I want, but I can't make something spelled one way and pronounced totally differently and expect everyone to respect my pronunciation if it makes no sense linguistically. 
[19:20:03] <Moonlightning> Cultural precedent, you say?

[19:21:52] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> or micaylah
[19:22:17] <Midnight_Tinker> all of these are linguistically acceptable
[19:22:25] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[19:22:31] <init3> I can see an issue with Jaymes because that leads to the possibility of Jay-mes

[19:22:48] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> nods*
[19:22:56] <init3> Someone with that spelling could desire either pronounciation. 
[19:22:56] <Moonlightning> It can be pretty hard to make a phonetic spelling for English. :p
[19:23:05] <Midnight_Tinker> a better example would probably be jaime, but that's non-English in origin
[19:23:19] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> true
[19:23:59] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> atleast its not something like mchale spelled as mikhayle (which i dont think is an english origin name either)
[19:24:27] <Moonlightning> Anyway, I concede that it's unreasonable for a creator to publish a pronounciation multiple decades after the relevant name and expect everyone to use it
[19:24:37] <Moonlightning> So I'll keep pronouncing it with a soft G, but accept either.
[19:24:48] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods

[19:32:53] <Midnight_Tinker> "Java: We're unintuitive and painful"
[19:32:58] <RazorSharpFang> What aspects of the language causes it to feel like that?
[19:33:38] <Midnight_Tinker> I've only got an auditing level knowledge of the language (syntax and such) so let me put it practically
[19:34:06] <Midnight_Tinker> Minecraft is written in Java, and has similar system requirements to Skyrim
[19:34:36] <RazorSharpFang> I've heard that that's Minecraft's issue, and shouldn't reflect on the language as a whole.
[19:34:58] <Midnight_Tinker> Partially, but its partially the language

[20:13:43] <init3> It isn't a terrible price for what I'm getting. $70usd (with modem rental) for 75/15 and basic cable. 
[20:13:43] <Midnight_Tinker> I got early access to the T-Mobile cellspot router so I got a free $300 router, its totally justified
[20:13:49] <Lapsus> closer to 11mbit up now that more people have it
[20:14:22] <Lapsus> I'd love to move to a lower tier plan, but they all have stupid-low data caps under this level
[20:14:32] <Lapsus> like, 200gb combined per month
[20:14:36] <init3> Well, /will/ be getting once they hook up my damn cable at thebox. 
[20:14:36] <init3> I'm half tempted to break into it.

[20:14:44] <Midnight_Tinker> was downloading WaW to play zombies with some friends on my old laptop, was wondering why I was only getting like 6MB/s down on Steam, I usually get 9 on my mac
[20:15:00] <Midnight_Tinker> realized with the old 5400 RPM drive in the laptop it couldnt write any faster lmao
[20:15:46] <init3> Heh
[20:16:00] <init3> How far we've come...
[20:16:05] <Lapsus> I'm almost up to 1TB/month on my data usage now D:
[20:16:21] <init3> tfw 38.8 used to make my happy. 
[20:16:42] <Midnight_Tinker> I used to have 25/10 at my old apartment, realized my phone got better speeds, and decided I was gonna pay for gud net when I moved
[20:16:43] <init3> And then I paid like $80 for a 56k modem and was sooooo impressed. 
[20:16:51] <Lapsus> netzero was my addiction back when that was a thing D:
[20:16:59] * RazorSharpFang is stuck with 3mbps down, 500kbps up
[20:17:04] <Lapsus> free dialup in exchange for 1/3 of the screen full of ads
[20:17:05] <Lapsus> lol
[20:17:08] <init3> When it was actually free?
[20:17:14] <init3> Haha
[20:17:23] <Midnight_Tinker> I had 3/1 back when I lived in West Virginia Razor
[20:17:24] <Lapsus> I was so mad when they went pay-only
[20:17:35] <init3> RSF, isn't that country wide fiber going to be a thing soon though in Aussieland?
[20:17:59] <init3> Cause I'm pretty jealous of that idea. 
[20:18:01] <Lapsus> after that I finally got the 5000/500kbit line I had until I switched to cable
[20:18:15] <RazorSharpFang> init3: For me, 2020.
[20:18:20] <init3> Well, I know it isn't country wide
[20:18:22] <init3> Damn
[20:18:36] <RazorSharpFang> Construction hasn't begun in my district yet.
[20:19:30] <init3> What city/metro area are you in? If you don't mind me asking.
[20:19:41] <RazorSharpFang> Perth - SouthOfRiver
[20:19:50] <RazorSharpFang> Western Australia
[20:19:54] <init3> Ahh ok

[20:22:20] <RazorSharpFang> init3: We've got both, I think; the ones in the Pacific are better quality though.
[20:22:25] <Lapsus> that would be $1099.50 overage last month if I was on that plan
[20:22:27] <Lapsus> goddamn
[20:22:30] <RazorSharpFang> init3: Most EUW pings are >700
[20:22:31] <init3> Because 'MURRICA?
[20:22:44] <init3> Lol, ignore that
[20:23:05] <RazorSharpFang> init3: Most USA pings are ~260ms
[20:24:03] <RazorSharpFang> I hate the current government thinks it's a good idea to not invest in technology.
[20:24:19] <init3> Gross
[20:24:27] <init3> THough the US is that way. 
[20:24:33] <Gladiolus> The US doesn't invest in /any/ infrastructure.
[20:24:41] <Gladiolus> The interstate is amazing but nobody wants to pay for upkeep lol
[20:25:01] <RazorSharpFang> But if you all use it, it needs to be paid for.
[20:25:10] <init3> "[14:24] <Gladiolus> The interstate is amazing" come to Michigan and say that. 
[20:25:44] <init3> This state defines "car culture" but we have probably the shittiest roads in the country. 
[20:26:37] <init3> People in MI refuse to pay  more taxes like at fucking all. 
[20:26:48] <Gladiolus> Thus proving my point that nobody pays for upkeep.
[20:26:53] <RazorSharpFang> But everyone needs to pay taxes.
[20:26:58] <Gladiolus> "The Interstate" =/= "The Shitty Broken Interstate"
[20:27:03] <RazorSharpFang> I have an annual income less than $2000. I pay takes.
[20:27:15] <Gladiolus> I mean the proper interstate, the essense of the interstate.
[20:27:16] <RazorSharpFang> I earn less than the tax free threshold and I still pay taxes.
[20:27:20] <init3> Like, gas prices are the lowest  they've been is years but a 10 cent gas tax to fix roads? Aw helllll no.
[20:27:56] <RazorSharpFang> init3: I don't understand why there's such a huge aversion to taxes.
[20:28:01] <init3> Reps were almost lynched for even suggesting it. 
[20:28:13] <Gladiolus> gop said they'll find the money
[20:28:15] <RazorSharpFang> Are people stupid?
[20:28:16] <init3> They are also almost lynched because the roads are shit. 
[20:28:18] <Gladiolus> when asked how they said uh >.>
[20:28:29] <init3> I know. 
[20:28:32] <Gladiolus> The insane aversion to taxes is killing the western world slowly.
[20:28:40] <Gladiolus> It's like a sort of governmental anti-vaccination cult
[20:28:46] <init3> Keep in mind Gladiolus that the states pay for most road repair. 
[20:29:00] <init3> Lol
[20:29:02] <init3> I like that
[20:30:27] <Gladiolus> There's an absurd notion that the citizens know what best to do with their money, and will be smarter/happier with it, than the government in /all/ cases.
[20:30:32] <Gladiolus> It's asinine and stupid but welp here we are.
[20:30:57] <Gladiolus> Forgetting how economies of scale work ugh.
[20:31:12] * Gladiolus hails an altar of John Maynard Keynes
[20:31:31] <RazorSharpFang> Is there anything we can do to tackle this issue?
[20:31:46] <init3> Well even more asinine is the pervading idea that we need to be prepared for the day all other NATO countries will randomly decide to rebel and attack the US. 
[20:32:08] <init3> So let's spend more than all of them combined. 
[20:32:20] <Gladiolus> You can vote for moderate or left wing parties, and make a stand that "Yes, I am willing to pay some amount of tax for the greater good."
[20:32:33] <init3> Hah
[20:32:46] <Gladiolus> We've gotten stuck in a spiral where candidates can only win by either promises no tax increases or tax breaks, and it has to end before it all collapses.
[20:32:53] <Gladiolus> also lol yeah init3 
[20:32:54] <init3> Even left-winger politicians are scared of mentioning raising taxes
[20:32:58] <Gladiolus> ye
[20:33:04] <Gladiolus> But if they get in all at once, they will.
[20:33:17] <Gladiolus> They just don't say anything about but if pressed they'll admit it, which is why most of them don't get in.
[20:33:34] <Gladiolus> Canada has a good shot in October to get a moderate-left party, we'll see.
[20:33:43] <init3> We've prettymuch made it impossible to be an honest politician and get elected. 
[20:34:04] <RazorSharpFang> Poop.
[20:34:16] <Gladiolus> Alberta elected one, their first week was great. 500 million dollar health-care boost, raised taxes on the rich, reversed a cut to education, and passed a law making corporate and union contributions to campaigns illegal.
[20:34:26] <init3> Clear about your intentions and make only reasonable promises? You just can't compete. 
[20:34:35] <Gladiolus> I was so happy when our NDP won it was like, "For the first time in my life, the party that I agree with won."
[20:34:39] <Gladiolus> yeah basically.
[20:34:45] <Gladiolus> IMO America deserves Trump.
[20:34:54] <RazorSharpFang> Trump will kill America.
[20:35:03] <RazorSharpFang> But it'll be the finishing blow.
[20:35:06] <Gladiolus> He /is/ America, ya'll deserve that shitiot running things- he is a creation of what America has become.

[20:36:21] <Gladiolus> Tough love. o3o
[20:36:26] <init3> That's just inhumane.
[20:36:35] <Colgate> you know, I wouldn't be opposed to Trump, but not because I think he would be a good president, quite the opposite really
[20:36:48] <Gladiolus> Sometimes you gotta burn it down and start over.
[20:36:50] <Colgate> he would be so bad, it would probably destroy the current republican party
[20:36:59] <Gladiolus> I really hope he gets the nom.
[20:37:03] <RazorSharpFang> Trouble is, if he messes up, it'll bring the US down as a whole.
[20:37:03] <init3> Shooting your kid  in the head isn't "tough love" Gladiolus. 
[20:37:04] <Gladiolus> I wanna see a Trump/Sanders race.
[20:37:11] <Gladiolus> I'm shooting him in the leg!
[20:37:16] <init3> No you aren't
[20:37:18] <Gladiolus> Because he's charging a bear with a knife!
[20:37:26] <Colgate> RazorSharpFang: I would take a terrible president for a chance to split into a 3 party system
[20:37:32] <Gladiolus> >if he messes up
[20:37:34] <Gladiolus> more like when
[20:37:34] <Colgate> cause this 2 party system sucks
[20:37:36] <Gladiolus> and that when is day 1
[20:37:38] <init3> That's an idea Colgate. 
[20:37:46] <init3> I don't know if that'd work though. 
[20:37:52] <Colgate> I don't know either
[20:37:53] <RazorSharpFang> Colgate: Yes it does; but I don't see how a terrible president is going to cause that. The foundation needs reworking.
[20:38:01] <Gladiolus> Our Liberal party had such a bad leader in 2012 that they collapsed and went from 2nd party to 3rd party tump.
[20:38:03] <Gladiolus> It was hilarious.
[20:38:16] <init3> Like that RSF ^
[20:38:28] <Gladiolus> He was such an arrogent old guard ass that Harper ran circles around him, the NDP came up from the buttom, and woop.
[20:38:52] <Colgate> RazorSharpFang: maybe, I can hope that it at least splits the tea partiers away from the rest of the republican party so they can shift to be mroe moderate
[20:38:56] <Gladiolus> Now we're in a straight 3 way for October, gonna be neat.
[20:39:07] <Gladiolus> Oh god could you imagine the tea party trying to mount an actual campaign.
[20:39:09] <init3> That's be cool Colgate. 
[20:39:14] <init3> Hahah
[20:39:29] <init3> >tea party >serious
[20:39:32] <init3> top kek
[20:39:39] <Gladiolus> Trump and all the money v Santorum and all the other money v Hilary and social justice.
[20:39:40] <Gladiolus> FIGHT
[20:39:56] <Gladiolus> Well, social justice and some other money.
[20:40:06] <init3> Hillary does not represent social justice. 
[20:40:19] <Gladiolus> No but it's a large part of why Sanders has problems.
[20:40:23] <RazorSharpFang> Wasn't hillary against various social justice things earlier?
[20:40:33] <Gladiolus> Old white guy v White Woman who is As Of Now Pro TGBT
[20:40:36] <init3> A few years ago. Before she was SoS
[20:40:53] <init3> As of now.
[20:40:59] <Gladiolus> I shrug at stuff like that, people change. As long as your opinion doesn't change /during/ the election cycle it's legit.
[20:41:07] <init3> iirc Sanders always was, even when she wasn't. 
[20:41:20] <Gladiolus> If you voted for the iraq war tho fuck you.
[20:41:39] <RazorSharpFang> What annoys me is a bunch of people saying "Vote 4 Hillary, she's a woman".
[20:41:49] <Gladiolus> Yeah like I siad, that SJW undercurrent
[20:41:53] <init3> True. I wasn't for LGBT rights at that time in my life when Hillary wasn't so I guess that's legitamate. 
[20:42:01] <Gladiolus> It's not the whole but it's something Sanders absolutely can't contend with.
[20:42:28] <Gladiolus> My parents weren't when Canada passed gay marriage in 2003, but now they are. Peeps change, you're only a flip-flop if you change after your campaign starts.
[20:42:38] <init3> I mean, maybe he can be trans-black like that NAACP chick. 
[20:42:41] <Gladiolus> lol
[20:43:07] <Gladiolus> Sanders changes name to Sandy, declares himself a herm.
[20:43:33] <Midnight_Tinker> as a conservative, I'm all for Sanders winning the primary
[20:43:54] <Midnight_Tinker> he'll force the issue to financial policy and so much of America is against his brand of fiscal politics that he'll lose
[20:44:11] <init3> Depends on who you guys get. 
[20:44:17] <init3> GL if it's Trump
[20:44:19] <Midnight_Tinker> I can only hope we get a fiscally driven candidate for sure
[20:44:19] <Gladiolus> Sanders v Trump, please god.
[20:44:25] <Gladiolus> only the extremes.
[20:44:29] <init3> Hilarirty ensues. 
[20:44:46] <Gladiolus> also what do you even mean fiscal policy, I fail to see what the gop is gonna do that's any better
[20:44:51] <init3> Sanders v Trump may make a third party thing happen. 
[20:44:53] <Gladiolus> "Yeah just uh, deregulate more things. Uh.

[20:45:07] <Gladiolus> "Sell the EPA to china."

[20:45:35] <Gladiolus> Keep it on a leash, and you can both be happy.
[20:45:37] <Gladiolus> Let it loose...
[20:45:54] <Midnight_Tinker> I'd rather have someone with passion actively screw me than be screwed by bureaucratic inaction
[20:45:55] <Gladiolus> Of course, tie the leash too tight and welp your dogs dead.

[20:47:52] <init3> Congress is way more important and they are fucked.

[20:48:46] <RazorSharpFang> The world is a mess.
[20:48:58] <Midnight_Tinker> yeah, I'm way too tired at the moment to argue my views and honestly I can feel the way I want all I want but I have little power
[20:48:58] <init3> Gerrymandering is really a bigger problem I think than most people realize too.
[20:49:01] <Gladiolus> It's messier than usual, but the world works in phases.
[20:49:34] <Gladiolus> ISIS will die eventually, and hopefully we can build a better middle east out of the rubble- as long as Assad is dead too.
[20:49:44] <init3> Gerrymandering is probably an even bigger deal imo than campaign finance. 
[20:49:48] <Gladiolus> The US will either collapse or fix itself, either way eventually something better will come of it.
[20:50:13] <Gladiolus>  That Iran dead got signed so it's not all bad news.
[20:50:24] <init3> And it's SO fucking easy to fix. 
[20:50:35] <Gladiolus> It is if the people in charge of it want to anyway
[20:50:50] <init3> Which is why it's still a thing.

[20:52:03] <init3> I'm tired of stealing internet. 
[20:52:06] <Gladiolus> lel
[20:52:48] <RazorSharpFang> One of the issues with the US is that companies can bribe congress.
[20:53:00] <RazorSharpFang> "We want this bill passed, here's money."
[20:53:10] <Gladiolus> lol I had no idea Keynes was at Versaille.
[20:53:11] <Gladiolus> "Keynes's experience at Versailles was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world."
[20:53:31] <Gladiolus> looool he predicted and tried to stop both hitler and the great depression but failed
[20:54:16] <Gladiolus> I love that man, I really really do. His economic policy of "Keep taxes loose and raise them during good times, and lower them during bad" is so obvious and yet we stopped doing it.
[20:54:59] <Gladiolus> Because welp, in the late 1970s we had some problems therefore the entire idea is bad so let's just get on that supply-side bandwagon and ride it over Cliff Reagan
[20:55:41] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not familiar with history.
[20:55:48] <RazorSharpFang> Not a clue what happened in the 1970s
[20:55:59] <Gladiolus> Well that ones a rather specific thing but the gas shortages led to economic downturn.
[20:56:11] <RazorSharpFang> All my history classes taught were the same thing over and over.
[20:56:16] <Gladiolus> Which was blamed on BUT TAXES SO HIGH and in the 80s taxes plummeted- and never came back up.
[20:57:24] <RazorSharpFang> Why wasn't taxes raised again?
[20:57:44] <Gladiolus> Go run for office and tell people, "Yes, I will raise taxes back to the level they were before."
[20:58:06] <Gladiolus> Part one of Kenyes idea: lower taxes at bad times, was super easy.
[20:58:12] <Gladiolus> Part two: raise them in good times, not so much.
[20:58:24] <RazorSharpFang> It doesn't have to be for the middle class or lower class.
[20:58:34] <Gladiolus> It's easy to forget how bad the bad times were during good times and decry any amount of taxation as bad
[20:58:45] <Gladiolus> but RazorSharpFang: THE JOB CREATORS!!!
[20:58:51] <Gladiolus> WHY DO YOU PUNISH SUCCESS?!
[20:59:05] <RazorSharpFang> The job creators can only create jobs when the people have spending money.
[20:59:16] <Gladiolus> you think the rich would realize that but apparently they don;t
[20:59:41] <RazorSharpFang> We have businesses going out of business because they can't sell products; at the same time, we have people who REALLY WANT that stuff, but can't afford it.
[20:59:43] <Gladiolus> Henry Ford did, that was why his cars were so cheap and his wages so hgih.
[20:59:53] <RazorSharpFang> So, we have the supply AND we have demand.
[20:59:59] <RazorSharpFang> There's just no money to go around!!
[21:00:00] <Gladiolus> You're rationalizing and preaching to the choir.
[21:00:12] <Gladiolus> It is how it is, and those are the excuses.
[21:00:27] <Gladiolus> You need to go convince the bible belt, not me.
[21:00:49] <RazorSharpFang> I know, I was just replying to that "bible belt logic"
[21:01:45] <Gladiolus> "If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing."
[21:01:50] <Gladiolus> I love you Keynes.
[21:01:56] <Gladiolus> WW2 must've broken his poor heart.
[21:02:56] <RazorSharpFang> What pains me the most, is I have to sit back and watch this mess.
[21:03:03] <RazorSharpFang> I feel powerless to do anything.
[21:03:45] <Gladiolus> Just make sure you vote, even if you do.
[21:04:00] <Gladiolus> Even if you just spoil the ballot, at least make the effort.
[21:04:20] <RazorSharpFang> Voting is 100% mandatory here.
[21:04:25] <RazorSharpFang> But I can't vote for the US.
[21:04:43] <RazorSharpFang> And with our economies so entwined, if the US fails, it'll be hell here.
[21:04:58] <Midnight_Tinker> isn't mandatory voting most of the reason Abbot got elected, because everyone just picked the first name
[21:05:12] <RazorSharpFang> I hope not, but... UGH.
[21:05:21] <RazorSharpFang> Just seeing his name makes me mad.
[21:05:32] <init3> It's mandatory? What are the penalties if you don't?
[21:05:46] <RazorSharpFang> I don't know.
[21:06:11] <Gladiolus> I doubt it, Midnight_Tinker- Abbot is terrible even in a historical aussie perspective.
[21:06:20] <Gladiolus> He's the single worst Western "leader" by far.
[21:06:36] <Midnight_Tinker> init3: pretty sure its just a fine
[21:06:41] <Gladiolus> In fact perhaps one of the worst elected heads of government in history.
[21:06:45] <Gladiolus> Yeah it's a fine, 200 bucks I think.
[21:06:49] <init3> DAMN
[21:07:19] <Gladiolus> You can probably appeal it, it's just a "If you don't do it, we'll inconvience you!!!11"
[21:07:24] <Gladiolus> works
[21:07:33] <init3> If there were mandatory voting here the republicans would't have a chance. 
[21:07:52] <Gladiolus> Ehh, it would be an entirely new system, who knows what might come of it.
[21:07:55] <init3> Voter turnout among liberals is way lower. 
[21:08:25] <Gladiolus> Could turn out that there's a shitload of rednecks not voting too, it's hard to tell with an inherent unknown like that.
[21:08:46] <Gladiolus> Like, /probably/ you're right, but not definitely.
[21:09:00] <RazorSharpFang> It's not impossible for him to be wrong.
[21:09:03] <init3> True
[21:10:03] <init3> Honestly though I think if it were mandatory simply for employers to structure hours on election day so people in hourly shit jobs /can/ vote it's make a huge jump for liberals.  
[21:10:18] <Gladiolus> kek we do that here
[21:10:26] <Gladiolus> You are mandated 3 hours off to vote if you work during election hours
[21:10:34] <init3> But that's different from manditory voting since it'd not affect Conservative voters nearly  as much. 
[21:10:43] <Gladiolus> and it's paid too
[21:10:56] <RazorSharpFang> init3: You mean employers can make you work during a voting day, and not give you time to vote?
[21:10:59] <init3> Yeah, i bet most people take it too because of that. 
[21:11:22] <init3> RazorSharpFang: Yes. Most employers don't allow you any extra time off on election day. 
[21:11:32] <init3> If they do, it is typically unpaid. 
[21:11:42] <Gladiolus> If I remember right the only exception is if your hours end or begin with 4 hours towards the start or end of polling. So there's no excuse really.
[21:11:47] <Gladiolus> It took me 15 minutes last time.
[21:11:49] <RazorSharpFang> This reeks of iffyness.
[21:11:55] <Gladiolus> welcome 2 america
[21:12:03] <Gladiolus> Make it hard to vote, so that most don't.
[21:12:08] <Gladiolus> Design the districts to support yourself.
[21:12:12] <init3> ^
[21:12:15] <Gladiolus> Ensure that it costs so much to runt hat most can't.
[21:12:24] <Gladiolus> Control the media, ensure they lock out 3rd parties. etc etc
[21:12:35] <init3> Crai everytim
[21:12:36] <RazorSharpFang> Do they intentionally make the system to screw the general populous over?
[21:12:43] <init3> Probably
[21:12:51] <Gladiolus> It's kinda funny that the GOP is having a debate with 10 people but only two parties get to debate afterwards
[21:12:53] <init3> Guess who authors the system?
[21:13:12] <Gladiolus> something something victors something something writing history something something gop
[21:13:24] <init3> I mean, the election is in November historically because it was after harvest time. 
[21:13:38] <init3> But before everything got so snow it is hard to travel
[21:13:50] <Gladiolus> American elections used to be a sort of fun community get together, before politics got nasty.
[21:13:51] <init3> So it /used/ to make sense. 
[21:14:08] <Gladiolus> Go to the poll, have fun with the other locals, enjoy life and see who wins.
[21:14:20] <Gladiolus> Then partisanship started and welp cant' do that anymore without a riot
[21:16:05] <init3> Yeah
[21:16:56] <init3> Hell, employers can refuse to give you time off on election day and /fire/ you if you get insistive. It is pretty fucked up now that I think about it RazorSharpFang. 
[21:17:21] <Gladiolus> lol literally denying you the vote
[21:17:27] <Gladiolus> which is against your constitution
[21:17:30] <Gladiolus> but who cares about that
[21:17:31] <RazorSharpFang> init3: Imagine if they did that selectively, based on what they thought your views on politics are.
[21:17:32] <init3> But in practice it is usually not that bad. Most people can vote if they really try. 
[21:18:01] <init3> Usually polls don't close until 8 or 9pm and usually open at 7. 
[21:18:46] <init3> So it isn't likley someone will work too long to be able to, but possible. But yes, it is suspected Wal-Mart does this. 
[21:18:53] <RazorSharpFang> Trouble is, I can't vote in America, because I'm not American.
[21:18:59] <RazorSharpFang> So I can't control a thing they do.
[21:19:21] <init3> Implying I can just because I have a vote. Toppest of the lel.
[21:19:23] <Gladiolus> Foreign-voting is both a good and absolutely terrible idea.
[21:19:43] <Gladiolus> On the one hand, imagine if the Iraqis had a say in 2003.
[21:19:51] <Gladiolus> Ont he other, China could just hand you over to themselves.
[21:20:09] <Gladiolus> It's best to just not bother lol.
[21:20:10] <init3> 99.9% say Sadaam is great though....
[21:20:28] <Gladiolus> Saddamn was such a dick but that was the worst way to deal with it ugh.
[21:20:41] <Gladiolus> True change to a state can only come from within, the smart thing is to wait for a crack and then open it.
[21:20:46] <Gladiolus> Not just apply brute force ugh.
[21:20:54] <Gladiolus> See: Libya.
[21:21:14] <Gladiolus> Which is admittedly in a bad state, but it would've been worse had we not intervened. Syria is the Bad Libya.
[21:22:46] <init3> Hehe. New slogan. 
[21:23:09] <init3> Libya: We aren't Syria 
[21:23:18] <Midnight_Tinker> Cleveland: We're not Detroit

[21:24:00] <Gladiolus> Tunisia is the best hope for something like that, it would be pretty okay were it not for the rampaging 800lb gorrilla in the region.
