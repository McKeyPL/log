[13:26:22] <Compu> apparently there r people out there who have a fear of people who brush their teeth
[13:28:33] <wolfyshy> w...what
[13:29:10] <locodash11[server]> there's probably someone out there that's scared of just about anything, so it's not surprising
[13:31:05] <Compu> wolfyshy: yes
[13:31:40] <Compu> locodash11[server]: now im imagining someone who shudders in fear every time they breath
[13:32:26] <Compu> eventually they start to hyperventilate from the fear and that makes things worse until they finally either get over the fear or go insane
[13:32:37] <Compu> or die from stress
[13:33:22] * JustAberrant has Compu slowed
[13:33:32] <Compu> JustAberrant: ???????
[13:34:07] <JustAberrant> also random silly issue of the day: installed a different insteon switch than I usually use, in a room with a single LED light...
[13:34:31] <Compu> k
[13:34:39] <Compu> i have osram lightify stuff
[13:34:45] <JustAberrant> the switch actually passes a tiny bit of current at all times, for incandescent lights it doesn't matter
[13:34:57] <JustAberrant> but it's actually enough to light this bulb a tiny bit :>
[13:35:01] <JustAberrant> (it's a dimmable led)
[13:35:10] <JustAberrant> so even when the switch is off there is a slight glow :D
[13:35:31] <Compu> my bulbs r smart themselves
[13:35:35] <JustAberrant> Compu: mm, I feel like we've talked about that before, but I have mixed feelings on them
[13:35:43] <Compu> mmm
[13:36:08] <Compu> i remember talking to someone who just didnt want anything "smart", including phones, but i dont think that was here
[13:36:29] <JustAberrant> biggest complaints I have with the smart bulbs is it gets fairly inefficient if you are talking about more than a few lights, and they require the actual light switch to be on all the time / don't provide a physical switch for others to use
[13:36:56] <JustAberrant> I could see value in a hybrid system, infact have considered it in my office/computer room
[13:37:18] <JustAberrant> i.e. have a "smart" bulb for the dynamic temperature stuff but have it connected to a smart switch for on/off
[13:37:26] <Compu> u can have wireless zigbee switches on a zigbee system like lightify that can be programmed to control a light over the zigbee network
[13:37:48] <JustAberrant> yeah, I can see that working
[13:38:11] <Compu> they exist but the problem is whenever i try to find them it only results in smart switches that r meant to control normal bulbs cuz search engines r dumb
[13:38:40] <JustAberrant> well, personally for the insteon stuff I just ignore their own control software
[13:38:45] <JustAberrant> I'd rather write my own management system
[13:39:02] <Compu> i like lightify because it uses zigbee and is designed to be compatible with other zigbee bulbs and stuff, not just osram lightify bulbs
[13:39:02] <JustAberrant> I imagine if I'd gone zigbee I'd do the same
[13:39:20] <Compu> also the osram lightify bulbs work on other zigbee systems like weemo
[13:39:58] * JustAberrant shruggles .. honestly as long as they have some way of controlling them it's easy enough to integrate everything
[13:40:17] <Compu> lightify doesnt really have an API yet but someone figured out how the app sends and recieves signals from the hub over the network and wrote a python module to do the same
[13:40:54] <Compu> im waiting for the osram lightify RGB A19 bulbs to come out in february
[13:41:20] * JustAberrant might buy one to mess around with, but I don't _really_ see a lot of practical use for that
[13:41:24] <JustAberrant> might be fun though
[13:41:39] <Compu> i've seen people do all kinds of stuff with the colors
[13:42:07] <JustAberrant> if you were into the home bar scene maybe .. I dunno
[13:42:23] <Compu> and if u use the python module thingy i mentioned u could program something to change the colors however u want, the module just takes in numbers for red green and blue to change the colors
[13:43:16] <JustAberrant> bleh, I'd probably skip the python module and write my own thing in something else, but yeah, if it's been done once would be trivial
[13:43:16] <Compu> the standard lightify hub supports up to 50 bulbs at once, the commercial version supports up to like 100
[13:44:09] <Compu> i have noticed some bugs with the python module, like it wont properly pull the status of my color temp adjustable bulb, it just gives nonsense for the status
[13:44:38] <Compu> like the on/off status is always given as "10" even tho its only supposed to be either 1 or 0
[13:45:11] <JustAberrant> sounds like typical python code ;p
[13:45:12] <Compu> the dimmable only bulb reports everything properly tho
[13:45:50] <Compu> but actually sending commands to the bulb works fine
[13:46:20] <Compu> also apparently the hub is what remembers the groupings and names and stuff of the bulbs

[22:51:08] <Moonlightning> Gods. I was hoping to have this over today.
[22:51:32] <Moonlightning> Is anypony good with Android? I have a Nexus 5 I'm trying to restore to factory state so that OTA updates work :/
[22:51:33] <Colgate> eh, can we settle with under?
[22:51:49] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: I've messed with my Nexus 5 a ton
[22:51:52] <AppleDash> What's the issue?
[22:52:08] <Colgate> unlock bootloader, reimage stock, relock bootloader? :P
[22:52:12] <Moonlightning> OTA updates don't work. They reboot into the updatey thing, run for a while, then go 'Error!'
[22:52:17] <Moonlightning> Colgate: That's exactly what I did.
[22:52:24] <AppleDash> That's what I'd suggest too
[22:52:37] <Moonlightning> I made sure to use a slightly out-of-date stock image, just so I could detect when the updates still failed. >.>
[22:53:13] <Colgate> say screw it and use custom built?
[22:53:45] <Moonlightning> That sounds like even more headache than what I've been dealing with.
[22:55:15] <Moonlightning> I've been trying to get away from custom everything, in the hopes that the problems would go away. :\
[22:55:57] <Colgate> cyanogenmod works fine for me!
[22:56:25] <Colgate> as long as you don't need android pay I guess :P
[22:57:37] <Moonlightning> I remember trying to install something like that, and not being able to get anything with some kind of authentication.
[23:02:05] <Sour_Sweet> CM works fine for me. Using it for several years.
[23:03:46] <Moonlightning> I can't attest to its functionality, because I've never been able to get to actually install it :P
[23:04:03] <AppleDash> It's fine
[23:04:17] <AppleDash> Don't install the newest one though
[23:04:21] <AppleDash> install the second newest one
[23:04:26] <Gladiolus> install MS DOS
[23:04:31] <AppleDash> otherwise you'll break everything to the point of having to format it
[23:04:37] <Gladiolus> PHONE.COM
[23:04:42] <AppleDash> Unless you're not planning on using google apps
[23:04:48] <AppleDash> in which case install the heck out of the newest one
[23:05:45] <Sour_Sweet> I don't know about Android Pay - there is no place I know of that would support it anyway. Some banking apps don't like rooted phones, but that's not a CM exclusive problem and their detection is crappy most of the time.
[23:06:57] <Sour_Sweet> I stay away from nightlies and use boring stable releases :-)
[23:09:21] <Moonlightning> I do actually use the Google apps
[23:09:33] <Sour_Sweet> Me2
[23:09:41] <Colgate> Sour_Sweet: android pay doesn't like rooted phones at all

[23:10:01] <Colgate> someone will probably break the drm on it
[23:10:05] <Colgate> eventually
[23:11:05] <Sour_Sweet> Android device encryption sadly still is a pain ...
[23:12:53] <Moonlightning> Really? I've found it really easy.
[23:13:14] <Moonlightning> It's just in Settings.
[23:13:33] <Sour_Sweet> Until you decide to upgrade/update
[23:14:12] *** Quits: Gladiolus (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:14:12] <Moonlightning> I've been able to update just fine with it?
[23:14:20] <Moonlightning> …actually, that's a lie. I haven't been able to update at /all./ :p
[23:14:29] *** Joins: Gladiolus (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there)
[23:14:52] <Moonlightning> But I'm assuming that's because of my previous playing with the system.
[23:15:00] <Moonlightning> Which I'm cutting out now.
[23:15:33] <Sour_Sweet> There is no easy way to remove the encryption and if you upgrade with your device encrypted to a new major version GApps regularly break resulting in a flood of app crashes and an useabke device
[23:16:58] <Sour_Sweet> You than need to flash a full stock image or RUU to remove the encrypted user partition and flash cm again to get it working
[23:18:00] <Sour_Sweet> Unusable*
[23:20:12] <Moonlightning> To be fair, undoing FDE is never easy (except…FileVault? >.> ); usually the recommended course is backup-format-restore
[23:20:18] <Moonlightning> where the backup is file-level
[23:20:31] <Moonlightning> And, what? Are you talking abotu cyanogenmod or stock? O.o
[23:20:47] <Sour_Sweet> CM
[23:21:41] <Colgate> Sour_Sweet: I've never had problems with the encryption except when I tried dual booting(which the method I was looking into didn't work with encryption)
[23:21:58] <Colgate> also
[23:22:11] <Colgate> I usually reimage gapps every time I update CM
[23:22:12] <Colgate> so
[23:22:20] <Moonlightning> Well, that's a dealbreaker for me
[23:22:26] <Sour_Sweet> I do as well
[23:22:35] <Moonlightning> I'll just go stock, thanks
[23:22:49] <Moonlightning> now, anypony have any idea what I've missed in my reset attempt?
[23:23:02] <Moonlightning> or, more generally, why I still can't update
[23:23:10] <Colgate> but you don't have root with stock :V
[23:23:20] <Moonlightning> I know. I don't care anymore.
[23:23:30] <Moonlightning> I just want shit to work, dammit
[23:23:40] <Moonlightning> I didn't actually use root much, anyway.
[23:24:18] <Sour_Sweet> But it resulted in Google Services crashing non the less. While flashing GApps it was complaining about being unable to access the data partition.
[23:24:38] <Sour_Sweet> Which probably caused the problem.
[23:26:24] <Sour_Sweet> That was when updating from 5.0.X to 5.1.X I believe.
[23:26:44] <Sour_Sweet> But don't quote me on that.

[23:28:58] *** Joins: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-859c69.bigpond.net.au)
[23:36:16] <Sour_Sweet> There should be an easy way to remove encryption from recovery/fastboot. I read the instructions on how to do it manually and decided that pulling a backup and reflashing twice was a lot easier ;-)
[23:36:53] <Moonlightning> [14:20:12] < Moonlightning> To be fair, undoing FDE is never easy (except…FileVault? >.> ); usually the recommended course is backup-format-restore
[23:36:53] <Moonlightning> [14:20:18] < Moonlightning> where the backup is file-level
[23:38:45] <Sour_Sweet> Also fuck RUUs requiring you to relock the boot loader (at least for HTC).
[23:39:52] *** Joins: DJ-C0L7[CSS] (IceChat77@DJ-C0L7.EIT.LLC)
[23:43:15] <Sour_Sweet> Also Moonlightning: Thing is you cannot even erase the partition from recovery (at least I couldn't find a way). That would also solve the issue without having to go to stock again.
[23:43:59] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: I'm pretty sure I saw an option to format or wipe /data in recovery mode
[23:44:41] <Sour_Sweet> Yep but it doesn't work with encrypted partitios
[23:44:51] <Moonlightning> oh, it doesn't?
[23:45:13] <Sour_Sweet> Ehh autocorrect partition s*
[23:46:49] <Sour_Sweet> There is a shady way from adb though.
[23:47:00] <Moonlightning> shady?
[23:48:04] <Sour_Sweet> Too much effort, doesn't always work with every device, some involve breaking the partition header.
[23:48:19] <Moonlightning> Oh.
[23:48:49] <Sour_Sweet> -> Flashing a RUU us less painfull.
[23:48:58] <Moonlightning> …RUU?
[23:48:58] <Sour_Sweet> Is*
[23:50:39] <Sour_Sweet> That's what HTC (and other manufacturers) calls their programs to do a complete reset. Requires a locked/relocked boot loader
[23:53:08] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[23:53:09] <Sour_Sweet> RUU apparently stands for ROM Update Utility. Also at least for HTC they only work on Windows.
[23:53:36] <Moonlightning> Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!
[23:53:38] <Moonlightning> holy shit.
[23:54:06] <Sour_Sweet> (Maybe wine works. I dunno)
[23:56:15] <Colgate> if it doesn't, try vodka
[23:59:24] <Sour_Sweet> Hehe my father asked me after x-mas if I could put some songs on his iPod (no drag and drop Music upload, only iTunes). Only had my Ubuntu notebook with me so I googled for solutions for Linux. First suggestion: Install Windows in a VM. NO
