[00:00:04] <Sour_Sweet> I was probably wrong with Comodo and the other is GoDaddy
[00:00:13] <Colgate> then it also caps your grade if you decide to support SSL3, which is entirely a TLS client issue, the client should reject SSL3 if it has better
[00:00:32] <Sour_Sweet> All those shady CAs >.>
[00:00:45] <Compu> hehe good pony https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2015/1/4/799029.png
[00:00:48] <Colgate> but SSL3 is still resistant to passive mitm, so it is better than nothing

[00:05:46] <PinkiePieBot> [ How to Weaponize your Cat to Hack Neighbours’ Wi-Fi Passwords ]
[00:06:51] <Colgate> Can I get a certificate for multiple domain names?
[00:06:52] <Colgate> Yes, the same certificate can apply to several different names using the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) mechanism. The Let's Encrypt client automatically requests certificates for multiple names when requested to do so. The resulting certificates will be accepted by browsers for any of the domain names listed in them.
[00:07:22] <Sour_Sweet> Yep pointed that out earlier today as well ^^
[00:07:23] <Colgate> I guess you could copy the cert somewhere for the other servers to download and use?
[00:07:37] <nscoots> go go war kitteh
[00:07:41] <Colgate> then again, cert pinning is useless with the 3 month thing
[00:07:58] <Sour_Sweet> But you don't need cert pinning if the cert is valid in theory
[00:08:03] <Lapsus> nscoots: I like the idea, but getting a collar on a cat is easier said than done :v
[00:08:07] <Colgate> wait what
[00:08:07] <Sour_Sweet> Even though it makes things more secure
[00:08:21] <Colgate> why is the lets encrypt client binding to port 443? o.O
[00:08:23] <nscoots> true lapsus
[00:08:36] <Colgate> Why does the Let’s Encrypt client require root privileges?
[00:08:37] <Colgate> The Let’s Encrypt client is essentially an operating system component. Generically, it requires root privileges to bind to port 44
[00:08:38] <Colgate> ...
[00:08:40] <Compu> Lapsus: not that difficult for my cat
[00:08:40] <Colgate> 443*
[00:08:41] <Sour_Sweet> There are alternatives I believe
[00:08:59] <nscoots> I'm partial to the notion of war pidgeons

[00:09:29] <Colgate> this FAQ sucks
[00:09:33] <Colgate> -.-
[00:09:39] <Sour_Sweet> I'd not want a root process to bind to port 443 *derp*

[00:13:07] <Sour_Sweet> That's where I got the alternative auth methods from. I guess one could look at the github for such things as well.
[00:13:49] <Colgate> yes, that is a lot of searching through boring stuff for important things

[09:28:04] <HoneyDrops> I mean, if the goal is to stop people from advertising, it takes more than blocking them.  You have to active destroy any and all potential benefit to it.  Remove the motive, and they stop doing it.  Obviously though that is a non-trivial problem, or I assume we'd have done so already and the ad industry would have ceased to be.

[09:44:20] <Moonlightning> Now I'm all curious.
[09:44:30] <Gladiolus> also bonus, I got a 1600x1200 CRT along with this stuff too so that’s nice
[09:44:35] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: it's a channel for old tech enthusiasts :p
[09:44:55] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning: I would maybe accept "ads" that are first party hosted, manually screened by the owner, and are static text-only.
[09:45:22] <wolfyshy> I mean art ads by necessity need to be at least still-frame image
[09:45:27] <Gladiolus> I have an old TV tuner in here so I can PS2 when I 90s pc too lel
[09:45:36] <HoneyDrops> If they want ad rotation, it should be done server-side only (absolutely no client-side scripts) and no tracking what-so-ever.
[09:45:38] <wolfyshy> Gladiolus: I use the TV tuner in my PII for the SNES
[09:45:39] <wolfyshy> :D
[09:45:47] <Gladiolus> BEOS supports it out of the box, interestingly.
[09:45:51] <Gladiolus> Useless for anything else.
[09:46:44] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-pm0kpp.internode.on.net)
[09:46:46] <HoneyDrops> I would accept a global count of how many times a specific ad has been shown, however nothing more specific.
[09:46:47] <Gladiolus> I installed it once and was like “Thank god Stebe killed this"
[09:47:11] * JustAberrant agrees @ locally served ads, but the problem was it's pretty hard for your average website owner to arrange with a company regarding advertisements
[09:47:12] <Gladiolus> wolfyshy, interested in the parts from a 1ghz dual MDD powermac g4?
[09:47:23] <JustAberrant> plus the whole issue of counting impressions
[09:47:43] <Gladiolus> As far as I know everything but the PSU works. Naturally I can’t confirm that.
[09:48:11] <JustAberrant> ad networks suck, but they did solve that problem

[09:53:17] <wolfyshy> lol okay
[09:53:20] <HoneyDrops> Shame that we ended up with http as the basis for the web, gopher was so much nicer.  I still think a sort of mountable ro system would have been better.
[09:53:42] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: I was going to run a gopher server for my retrotech community
[09:53:53] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: there are NO gopher daemons that run on modern linux or even COMPILE
[09:54:03] <wolfyshy> there is one python one, last modified in 2008, but it needs 2.4
[09:54:10] <wolfyshy> the oldest version in portage is 2.6 and it's masked..
[09:54:29] <HoneyDrops> :(
[09:54:51] <HoneyDrops> I still think it would be neat to be able to mount a website and be able to use normal tools on it.
[09:55:00] <wolfyshy> I had a legit reason too; a lot of us have win3.1 or classic mac os computers, and gopher: is easier on the browsers they come with
[09:55:08] <wolfyshy> that way I could offer "modern" browsers over gopher:
[09:55:29] <HoneyDrops> Add in a versioning system, so you can view a website exactly as it was at any point in time.  Would make it better for citations.
[09:56:06] <Phase> wolfyshy, must be one somewhere, gentoo served their site over gopher last april
[09:56:50] <wolfyshy> Phase: they used the python one
[09:56:53] <Phase> ah
[09:57:01] <wolfyshy> Phase: I'm sure someone emerged python2.4 in a chroot for the one off :P
[09:57:15] <Phase> why not go full retro? run old linux in a vm

[09:57:41] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: have you ever used ftp in firefox?
[09:57:52] <Moonlightning> Maybe once or twice, years in the past.
[09:57:58] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: it's like that, but it supports search and serving info/images in dir listings.
[09:58:09] <Moonlightning> oh, is it like what it does for file:?

[10:01:48] <Moonlightning> Don't you mean file:/// ?
[10:01:59] <HoneyDrops> Yeah
[10:02:00] <Moonlightning> …that's really silly.
[10:02:04] <Moonlightning> Why is there a host portion?
[10:02:08] <HoneyDrops> "Gopher is designed to function and to appear much like a mountable read-only global network file system" *swoons at the thought*
[10:02:10] <Moonlightning> It's only ever `//`…right?
[10:02:14] <Moonlightning> o3o
[10:02:27] <wolfyshy> now I wonder if I could do file://powermac/Users/wolfy/
[10:02:28] <Moonlightning> That would be amazing. ;-;
[10:02:43] <Moonlightning> wolfyshy: how would it request the thing?
[10:02:50] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: idunno, NFS maybe?
[10:03:00] <Moonlightning> no, that's nfs://powermac/Users/wolfy/
[10:03:27] <HoneyDrops> Imagine being able to use tools like find or grep on the web!  Back up whole sites with cp -r!  diff webpages! <3
[10:03:28] <Moonlightning> You need a /protocol/, but as soon as you have that, you have something else to put in the scheme portion.
[10:04:12] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: imagine if people actually wrote HTML, so that individual webpages (and their diffs, by extension) would be actually readable. :P
[10:04:19] <wolfyshy> oh wait
[10:04:26] <wolfyshy> I remember why it uses that now

[10:05:06] <Moonlightning> Wouldn't that just be file:///C/windows ?
[10:05:10] <wolfyshy> why that way?  dunno, ask Marc Andressen(sp)
[10:05:17] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning: unfortunately, I try not to look directly at it for my sanity and happiness.
[10:05:20] <wolfyshy> that's how NCSA Mosaic did it
[10:05:26] <Moonlightning> wat?
[10:05:28] <wolfyshy> and everyone kind of just copied that.
[10:05:31] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: yeah ;-;
[10:05:39] <wolfyshy> mosaic did file://C|/Windows
[10:05:46] <wolfyshy> and the other browsers copied it
[10:05:49] <Moonlightning> wolfyshy: what's NCSA Mosaic :P

[10:06:46] <Moonlightning> Okay, how about this.
[10:06:52] <Moonlightning> Make the host portion optional. :P
[10:06:55] <Moonlightning> …or, better idea
[10:06:58] <HoneyDrops> Basically it's who's to blame for the crappy model of web browsers we have today.
[10:07:04] <Moonlightning> file:C|/windows
[10:07:11] <Moonlightning> file:/home/blackl
[10:07:33] <wolfyshy> "crappy model"
[10:07:36] <Moonlightning> And keep the other stuff as backwards compatability
[10:07:37] <wolfyshy> you mean because it had forms?
[10:07:44] <Moonlightning> after all, /// is the same as /
[10:07:47] <wolfyshy> I mean, gopher had a form standard too, and it implemented it, it's just no other client did
[10:08:01] <wolfyshy> so it didn't see much server implementation
[10:11:21] <HoneyDrops> I still have mixed feelings about tabs, not that mosaic is to blame for that.  I wonder if there is a way to run ff in a "daemon" mode like urxvtd and let the window manager manage windows.
[10:12:14] <Moonlightning> Let which windows manager manage windows?
[10:12:35] <HoneyDrops> Whichever one you're running.
[10:13:28] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: you know you can disable tabs in ff and use windows instead right?
[10:13:30] <Moonlightning> …but…isn't that already the case…?
[10:13:36] <Moonlightning> ew.
[10:13:43] * Moonlightning is reminded of IE<9
[10:13:49] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: IE7 had tabs
[10:13:55] * Moonlightning is reminded of IE <7 *
[10:14:06] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: jwz (of netscape fame) used to hack Safari's binary on OS X to disable tabs entirely and remove the option from the menus
[10:14:07] <HoneyDrops> wolfyshy: how well does ff share memory then?
[10:14:09] <wolfyshy> because he hated tabs so much
[10:14:17] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: it doesn't?
[10:14:26] <Moonlightning> I launch Firefox, it allocates a quarter gig -.-
[10:14:31] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: tabs vs windows doesn't make a difference
[10:14:31] <Moonlightning> whatever it's doing, it's total shite.
[10:14:34] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: this isn't chrome

[10:14:56] <Moonlightning> Firefox doesn't /share/ memory
[10:14:58] <Moonlightning> it //hogs// it.
[10:15:02] <HoneyDrops> The point is tabs are the hack to deal with the absolutely-worthless window management of Win9x.
[10:15:18] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: tabs were conceived on solaris and first implemented on irix
[10:15:30] * Moonlightning finds tabs invaluable for browsing.
[10:15:40] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: and tabs didn't show up in gecko until Netscape 6.0, which was released when XP was already extant
[10:15:42] <Moonlightning> I can keep multiple bits of history open at once!
[10:15:44] <wolfyshy> or was it win2k
[10:15:50] <Moonlightning> Search for something, open results in tabs
[10:15:54] <Moonlightning> close tab if it's not what I wanted
[10:16:02] <HoneyDrops> I'll have to try disabling tabs, see how it runs.  I was expecting that would run each as it's own proc, sharing nothing.
[10:16:18] <HoneyDrops> Moonlightning: I have 73 tabs up now, I would rather have 73 windows.
[10:16:33] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: so…use super-n instead of super-t?
[10:16:43] * Moonlightning can't imagine having 73 browser windows @.@
[10:16:46] <Moonlightning> but whatever, mang
[10:16:49] <HoneyDrops> Then moving between them is the same as moving between any other windows.

[10:16:56] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: make up your mind :p
[10:17:06] <Moonlightning> You want windows, but you hate having to navigate between windows?
[10:17:54] <HoneyDrops> No, no. I don't see a need for firefox to handle window management in a special case when I have a tool who's entire purpose is to manage windows.
[10:18:19] <Moonlightning> Clearly, the need is there 'cos you've got 73 things to be managed. :P

[10:53:47] <HoneyDrops> The actual tab widget is fine, and in some cases very useful, but tabs should be handled by the window manager, not the application.

[11:02:26] <tiwake> HoneyDrops: oh, you are saying that, in the example of a web browser, that it should be a new window and the OS should deal with multi-instances of the program in a sane organized way
[11:02:30] <Gladiolus> IT was also the fact that I do enjoy computers, but I /really/ need to be able to just stop and cool off after a few hours.

[11:16:11] <JustAberrant> kidding aside, put it in a few garbage bags and smash it a few times with a hammer
[11:16:24] <JustAberrant> if anyone's keen enough to put it back together again, you've got bigger problems in your life
[11:16:29] <Moonlightning> I can't see that doing much to an optical disc.
[11:16:34] <Moonlightning> A spinning hard drive, definitely
[11:16:43] <tiwake> get a pocket knife and play tictactoe with a friend on it
[11:16:57] <JustAberrant> if it shatters it a few times it's gonna be really damn hard to get anything off it
[11:16:57] <Moonlightning> hmmmm…can you like split the layers apart?
[11:17:02] <Moonlightning> Or is that nontrivial?
[11:17:19] <JustAberrant> you can use powerful electric current to literally evaporate the data off it
[11:17:20] <tiwake> the stuff on a CD or DVD is just on one side
[11:17:21] <HoneyDrops> set can on pavement, put disk in, douse in lighter fluid (or kerosene, alcohol. brake fluid) and ignite and stand back.
[11:17:53] <JustAberrant> .. argue with cops for an hour.. make permanent enemy with neighbors.. etc
[11:17:57] <Moonlightning> ^
[11:17:58] <Moonlightning> @.@
[11:18:02] <HoneyDrops> oh, if you have a microwave you don't care about, just oput the disk in for a pretty light show
[11:18:18] <Moonlightning> I don't though :(

[20:49:10] <Soarin> I know where its at, I just cannot see the buttons due to it being super small size. and I forgot holding Alt(control what ever one) while left click and dragging the window, will make it so you can put part of the window off scree
