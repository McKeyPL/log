[13:07:38] <AppleDash> I blame Lapsus
[13:07:42] <AppleDash> It was working fine before he put it on
[13:07:45] <Moonlightning> we need like a USB-D
[13:07:47] <AppleDash> My headset, that is
[13:07:58] <Moonlightning> Like USB-C, except smaller
[13:08:28] <Sour_Sweet> USB Type C is already pretty small
[13:08:56] <Moonlightning> Not small enough for a smartphone
[13:09:27] <Sour_Sweet> That's why smartphones already use type C ... Oh wait
[13:09:48] <AppleDash> I think I'm going to take apart my headset
[13:09:56] <AppleDash> and solder on a nice, chunky USB-B connector
[13:10:04] <AppleDash> Let's see that break or lose connection pressure
[13:11:48] <Sour_Sweet> http://gizbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Nexus-USB-Type-C.jpg
[13:12:58] <Sour_Sweet> Actually I wouldn't buy a new Android phone without a type C connector (Thanks to the pain of micro USB)
[13:13:07] <AppleDash> Yeah
[13:13:13] <AppleDash> My headset is fucked and it is annoying me
[13:13:24] <AppleDash> like 10 different cables aren't working in it or working intermittently
[13:13:26] <Googie> Damn micro USB
[13:13:36] <Sour_Sweet> The only connector I know is worse is that flat USB 3 connector.
[13:13:52] <AppleDash> And it's great because it's constantly on low battery so every 30s I get a nice loud BEEPBEEPBEEP and every minute or so it shuts off for 5 seconds before the flaky connection charges it a tiny but again

[13:14:21] * Moonlightning blinks.
[13:14:23] <Moonlightning> Huh.
[13:14:32] <Moonlightning> For some reason I was thinking it was about the same size as A
[13:14:44] <Googie> AppleDash: Make sure you've got a cable that is capable of handling the full amperage
[13:15:02] <AppleDash> My cables definitely are
[13:15:15] <Googie> I've got a few microusb cables which refuse to charge above 400ma, when the same charger can do 1.5A with a better cable
[13:15:17] <AppleDash> A cable that I was just using to charge a tablet at like 1.5 amps is not working with the headset
[13:15:25] <Moonlightning> So, what, is it micro-B sized?
[13:15:26] <AppleDash> the cable that /came with the headset/ is not working
[13:15:43] <Googie> Moonlightning: Roughly, yeaj
[13:16:13] <Sour_Sweet> You gotta have those diamond sleeved platinum premium cables :D
[13:16:26] <AppleDash> I'm ready to snap this thing in half it is so infuriating
[13:16:29] <Moonlightning> diamond-sleeved doesn't sound very flexible
[13:16:30] <AppleDash> I just want to listen to music
[13:16:32] <Moonlightning> or breakable
[13:16:36] <Moonlightning> sorry, AppleDash
[13:16:47] <Sour_Sweet> Moonlightning: It was being sarcastic
[13:16:47] <Moonlightning> how 'bout carbon-nanotube-sleeved? :D
[13:17:08] <Moonlightning> Oh; I thought you were making a joke.
[13:18:42] <Sour_Sweet> There were some stupid "audiophile" grade cables that somehow managed to use the word diamond in their name
[13:18:45] <AppleDash> I think it's the shitey little connector they've got in there

[19:26:43] <RennyWork> Nooooo
[19:26:56] <RennyWork> It is a catastrophe D:
[19:27:49] <Moonlightning> @.@
[19:28:42] * RennyWork tells while running circles around Moonlightning
[19:28:45] <RennyWork> Tells*
[19:29:21] <RennyWork> Yells**
[19:29:36] <RennyWork> I wonder if it's possible to get typo poisoning.
[19:30:13] <Moonlightning> RennyWork: Windows has some pretty serious privacy concerns
[19:30:21] <Moonlightning> I'm sure you've heard all the allegations slung at Windows 10
[19:30:49] <Moonlightning> Personally, I'm now treating all versions of Windows as malware. Of course, that doesn't really work for everyone...
[19:31:14] <Moonlightning> I encourage you to do some research and become well-informed before going ahead and installing it.
[19:34:23] <RennyWork> Privacy?
[19:34:36] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[19:35:03] <Moonlightning> There're rumors of Windows 10 providing Microsoft with on-demand access to all mounted filesystems.
[19:35:30] <Moonlightning> Which basically would mean they could pull literally any file from your computer, or anything you plugged into your computer.
[19:35:40] <Moonlightning> Which is an obvious serious privacy and security concern.
[19:35:54] <Moonlightning> Hence: [10:30:49] < Moonlightning> Personally, I'm now treating all versions of Windows as malware. Of course, that doesn't really work for everyone...
[19:36:08] <RennyWork> What if my computer is not connected to interwebs?
[19:36:39] <Moonlightning> If you //airgap// a system, in general, network-based attacks stop being a concern
[19:37:06] <Moonlightning> I will personally refuse to use Windows, /period/ (why would you /intentionally/ install malware, even if the system /is/ airgapped?)
[19:37:28] <RennyWork> Airgap?
[19:40:11] <Moonlightning> An isolation from other systems. This means that you don't connect it to external networks; you don't exchange disks with external machines; you don't have //any form of contact//, except with other systems that are part of the same airgap, and except with manual intervention and //lots// of care.
[19:40:39] <Moonlightning> It's like "not connected to interwebs", only /more so./
[19:40:43] <RennyWork> Mmhmm.
[19:41:21] <Moonlightning> Oh, and physical security, of course.
[19:42:37] <RennyWork> I could put a padlock on the mouse ._.
[19:42:46] <RennyWork> That is how it works, right?
[19:42:47] <Moonlightning> To me, it evokes whitewalled complexes with permanent guards and keycard-based access, where everyone walks around with identification 'round their necks
[19:43:31] <RennyWork> And that evokes crazy spies with all sorts of gadgets disabling security posts and knocking peole out o3o
[19:43:32] <Moonlightning> Something you'd find in buildings owned by TLAs, CAs, and very careful businesses
[19:43:54] <Moonlightning> I wouldn't consider any system I had at home to be airgapped, even if it otherwise was
[19:44:10] <RennyWork> Why not??
[19:44:22] <Moonlightning> don't feel like I have the level of physical security for it :P
[19:44:35] <Moonlightning> My front door is very break-down-able. Also, glass windows.
[19:44:45] <RennyWork> Ah.
[19:44:58] <RennyWork> This casserole is super bland and I don't have salt.
[19:45:10] <Moonlightning> It could signal the outside world through ultrasonic frequencies or by shining a laser at a window! 9.9
[19:45:47] <Moonlightning> Anyway, yeah. Do research before going with Windows. Because, as far as I know (and care to find out for myself), Microsoft can see all your stuff if you use it. :P
[19:45:56] <RennyWork> .____.
[19:50:17] <RennyWork> Gladiolus Moonie is trying to convince me not to use Windows :U
[19:50:55] <Gladiolus> Use what you want.
[19:51:12] <Gladiolus> Windows is fine for a video james rig and as much as MSFT spies on you- so does everyone else.
[19:51:23] <Gladiolus> If you care about security than you’ll have to go all in.
[19:51:39] <Moonlightning> Yes, the open-source communities are WATCHING YOU!!!!11!11!11!1
[19:52:02] <Gladiolus> By everyone I mean like, facebook and tweeter and whatever else you might use.
[19:52:12] <Gladiolus> RMS is totally spying on me
[19:52:17] <Gladiolus> I had an android once
[19:52:40] <Moonlightning> Social networking relies primarily on people /voluntarily/ publishing things, though.
[19:53:25] <Gladiolus> Don’t read into me wrong, I’m not defending microsofts inane horrid decisions.
[19:53:29] <RennyWork> But advertising does not .-.
[19:53:32] <Gladiolus> It’s just par for the shitty course that we’ve set.

[19:54:49] <Gladiolus> I actually like Apple stuff but they’re too big lol
[19:54:58] * RennyWork looks at wolfyshy
[19:55:17] * Gladiolus noms wolfyshy
[19:55:29] <Gladiolus> How much are those G3s you said you had ~contacts~ for?
[19:55:41] <RennyWork> So peoples are trying to open-source their way out of the windowshole?
[19:55:59] <Gladiolus> They are but I don’t think Wine can do DX11 yet and DX12 nope lol.
[19:56:19] <Gladiolus> Windows is still the best bet for gaming, just go through your settings and turn as much spying off as you can.
[19:56:33] <RennyWork> Okays~
[19:57:27] <wolfyshy> well after 14 days uptime, Firefox was "only" using 1.6 GB RAM for 94 tabs
[19:57:38] <RennyWork> Wait, each version of DX is more complicated, or just different? 
[19:57:42] <wolfyshy> unfortunately, the UI was lagging hard because the garbage collector was firing every 10 seconds, and running for 5 of those
[19:58:11] <wolfyshy> RennyWork: sometimes both.  DX8 was DX7 + new stuff, DX9 changed a whole lot of things around, DX10 was like a complete rewrite, DX11 just added new stuff to 10, etc.
[19:58:19] <RennyWork> My first question is why 94 tabs
[19:58:37] <wolfyshy> ~the life of a gentoo developer~
[19:58:40] <Gladiolus> Both, RennyWork.
[19:58:46] <Gladiolus> oh ye
[19:58:50] <wolfyshy> some of them were upstream homepages/bug trackers
[19:58:53] <Gladiolus> DX12 is a fairly large rewrite.
[19:58:55] <wolfyshy> some were gentoo bugs
[19:58:59] <wolfyshy> some were work-related
[19:59:04] <wolfyshy> three were youtube videos
[19:59:16] <RennyWork> Ah. So do the peoples that make dx just work closely with the big developers, or do the big developers have to put in the effort to integrate that stuffs too?
[19:59:25] <wolfyshy> mostly the latter
[19:59:31] <mniip> oh shit
[19:59:34] <mniip> how do klines work D:
[19:59:43] * RennyWork moops at mniip
[19:59:49] <Gladiolus> DX12 was fairly integrated with developers
[19:59:57] <Gladiolus> They put in some effort this time.
[20:00:06] <Gladiolus> DX9 and stuff were just sorta dumped on people. “Support it."
[20:00:20] <RennyWork> Heh
[20:01:05] <mniip> RennyWork, bop?
[20:01:22] <RennyWork> Beep beep o3o
[20:01:41] * RennyWork makes all the noises his computer refuses to make
[20:02:06] <Gladiolus> fix it! o3o
[20:02:18] <Gladiolus> start it with just ram and processor
[20:02:28] <RennyWork> Yep
[20:02:31] <RennyWork> Wait
[20:02:38] <RennyWork> So disconnect drives?
[20:03:26] <RennyWork> I like my case. It has holes in just the right places so it only looks like cthulu reborn behind the panel.
[20:03:42] <Gladiolus> o3o
[20:03:45] <Gladiolus> disconnect all things
[20:03:54] <RennyWork> Even power? D:
[20:04:14] <RennyWork> All I have connected is mah drives. Well, and RAM.
[20:04:24] <Gladiolus> well power yes o3o
[20:04:26] <Gladiolus> but not drives
[20:04:39] <Gladiolus> just try and get a post, worry about booting later
[20:05:04] <RennyWork> What is included in a full post??
[20:05:13] <RennyWork> Does it include the beep?
[20:05:49] * RennyWork is sure his beep speaker is in the right place
[20:06:55] <Gladiolus> the beep is the post
[20:07:05] <Gladiolus> depending on what the beep is it might tell you the error, look it up
[20:07:17] <RennyWork> Okay.
[20:07:34] * Gladiolus beeps
[20:07:46] <RennyWork> Good beep?
[20:08:47] * RennyWork turns Gladiolus off regardless and plugs in an external boot drive with Windows 95
[20:09:18] <Gladiolus> Win95 off an external? I think that would only work with parallel or something.
[20:09:30] * RennyWork ponishrugs
[20:09:33] * Gladiolus SET BLASTER= A220 I5 D1 P330
[20:09:50] * RennyWork downloads more RAM

[20:11:27] <RennyWork> Wait wat
[20:11:33] <RennyWork> This is a thing?

[20:11:52] <Moonlightning> Must be a joke.
[20:11:57] <Moonlightning> April Foals!
[20:11:57] <Gladiolus> Old mac OS had really shit memory management
[20:12:08] <Gladiolus> Applications would reserve X amount and only use Y, leaving Z wasted.
[20:12:11] <Moonlightning> That, or like, something low-level that runs compression
[20:12:14] <RennyWork> They have a lot better everything management now o3o
[20:12:22] <Gladiolus> This program allows other things to use the Y that programs didn’t use when idle.
[20:12:43] <Gladiolus> To be fair Classic Mac was based on 70s tech.
[20:12:59] <Gladiolus> thank god for stebe and hail osx
[20:13:47] <RennyWork> The original iPhone looked like it was pretty beastly back in the day.
[20:16:47] <RennyWork> I think it has a touchscreen of sorts...
[20:17:04] <Moonlightning> You think? :P
[20:17:40] <Moonlightning> Anyway, yeah, modern OSes have good memory management
[20:17:48] <Moonlightning> And disks are fast enough for swap
[20:18:18] <RennyWork> https://alexbarrette.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/frog-design/
[20:18:50] <Moonlightning> Modern memory management also means overallocating: telling apps "sure, go ahead!" when they ask for chunks of memory, and not /actually/ giving it to them until they try to use it.
[20:19:13] <wolfyshy> Gladiolus: they only have 233 and 266 :(
[20:19:34] <Gladiolus> o
[20:19:40] <Gladiolus> well I oced the 300 to 400 lol
[20:19:44] <Gladiolus> runs stable!
[20:19:52] <Gladiolus> bought a 128 theater on ebay too
