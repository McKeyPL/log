[00:01:45] <Divide|TechSupport> Okay, now, I'd dearly like to know why customers think we need to support their networking issues on Kodi boxen.  If you're running a box which is predicated upon /illegal streaming/, why should we offer you assistance there?
[00:04:20] <Colgate> never heard of kodi boxen

[00:09:34] <Divide|TechSupport> Kodi is a streaming service which... well, let's just say it uses illegal sources.
[00:12:33] <Colgate> wait, kodi is what xbmc was renamed to
[00:12:41] <Colgate> that's totally legal, I use it o.O
[00:16:50] <HoneyDrops> ^ (though I don't use it)
[00:17:22] <AppleDash> Yeah... Nothing illegal about that
[00:24:41] <JustAberrant> yeah, kodi's fine.. 
[00:25:41] <JustAberrant> I mean sure some people certainly use it to via pirated stuff, but same can be said about anything..
[00:28:23] <JustAberrant> doesn't mean it's within the scope of what your company needs to support, but more non-geeks have difficulty differentiating where the lines are drawn.. and honestly I don't even think that's overly unreasonable
[00:28:57] <JustAberrant> sure it makes sense than an ISP isn't responsible for say, facebook, but to the average user facebook is just part of the internet.. which again.. isn't really that crazy of an assumption

[07:46:24] <Lapsus> ShivalWolf: yes
[07:46:50] <Lapsus> although I'd say on hours would be a better indicator if you think one is a refurb and the other is not
[07:47:11] <ShivalWolf> Lapsus: they are both identical runing time
[07:47:17] <AppleDash> Yes, I would expect such a thing
[07:47:27] <ShivalWolf> i dont think 1 is a refurb
[07:47:28] <AppleDash> source: I have 2 such arrays and they behave like that
[07:47:31] <ShivalWolf> i think one is falty
[07:47:31] <Lapsus> also, unrelated, http://i.imgur.com/JglXEvO.jpg
[07:47:32] <ShivalWolf> and not writing
[07:47:41] <AppleDash> One of my drives in my RAID has one more power on hours than the rest
[07:47:43] <AppleDash> and it annoys me to no end
[07:48:03] <AppleDash> I need to yank it out one day for an hour >.>
[07:48:13] <AppleDash> Lapsus: Pretty good
[07:48:15] <ShivalWolf> but yeah i think if they have always been in a mirror
[07:48:22] <ShivalWolf> then their writes should be close to identical
[07:48:24] <ShivalWolf> not 300gb off
[07:48:36] <AppleDash> Maybe one of them failed at one point
[07:48:39] <AppleDash> And was replaced
[07:48:44] <AppleDash> No, that doesn't explain the hours
[07:48:52] <ShivalWolf> AppleDash: the drives are 2 weeks old
[07:49:04] <ShivalWolf> i bought them together and install them into a brand new syste at the same time
[07:49:15] <AppleDash> You shouldn't buy RAID drives together
[07:49:41] <ShivalWolf> brand new machine didnt have much choice but to buy 2 new drives at the same time
[07:49:57] <ShivalWolf> but yeah it crashed with that drive on its own
[07:50:03] <ShivalWolf> so either that drive is falty or everything else is
[07:50:14] <ShivalWolf> if i crash again im going to put the good one in on its own
[07:50:16] <ShivalWolf> and see if i still crash
[07:51:06] * ShivalWolf just sits and waits for another crash
