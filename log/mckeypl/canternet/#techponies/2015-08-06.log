[04:46:35] <RazorSharpFang> I thought that was why the histogram looked awful.
[04:46:50] <Colgate> it is
[04:47:05] <Colgate> that's your displaying of the results being awful, not the calculation
[04:47:26] <RazorSharpFang> Oh, so I should use a lower max of the X-axis?
[04:48:14] <Colgate> or include some jumps or something
[04:49:19] <RazorSharpFang> I'd have to use actual software to make it instead of this online-histogram then.

[05:46:59] <init3> But actually it seems that the biggest probelm why everything is so odd may be that /var/log got turned into a file.

[05:49:53] <init3> Well the thing is I was considering doing a reinstall anyhow and I have all the configs backed up. 
[05:50:18] <init3> So I'm going to try a half-assed recovery and if it doesn't work just do an unscheduled reinstall is all.

[06:05:56] * Colgate shrugs, uses debian/centos for all their server stuff
[06:07:02] <HoneyDrops|Half> Debian is a decent choice, though I'm going to have to find something else for quick deployment.

[06:08:50] <JustAberrant> freebsd is really nice and simple and low maintenance if you don't need to do anything linux-y

[06:11:51] <JustAberrant> oh well, I should bed
[06:11:54] <init3> I mean file system wise I use xfs too and that's not going to change. This is just my OS drive here which contains absolutley nothing other than the OS.

[06:13:28] <frackster> LOL
[06:13:48] <init3> Ok debian it is lol

[16:57:02] <Caerdwyn> anybody in here have enough experience with windows 10 yet that can tell me how to not lose focus on a window when switching virtual desktops using its keyboard shortcuts?
[16:57:05] <Caerdwyn> /b 23
[16:57:07] <Caerdwyn> oops
[17:04:36] <init3> You around RainbowHacks?
[17:05:12] <RainbowHacks> not exactly
[17:05:16] <RainbowHacks> you need something specific
[17:06:11] <init3> Uhh, not reallly. THe OS HDD on my gateway/fileserver died last night and I'm trying to decide between reinstalling debian or going FreeBSD. 
[17:06:31] <Caerdwyn> basically, what happens is, I hit Ctrl+Win+left/right arrow, and it switched back and forth between desktops. but when I do that, the focus on the window drops and I have to repeatedly alt-tab or click in the window to allow me to type again
[17:06:34] <Caerdwyn> its kinda annoying >_<
[17:06:54] <init3> That's stupid
[17:07:03] <init3> Seems like that'd be a bug
[17:07:08] <Caerdwyn> that's what I'm thinking
[17:07:20] <init3> Perhaps one that MS has no plans to fix though
[17:07:35] <Caerdwyn> If I Win+D to bring up the task view/desktop switcher and manually click on what desktop I want, it doesnt do it
[17:07:46] <Caerdwyn> the windows in each desktop stay focused
[17:07:55] <Caerdwyn> its only if I use the keyboard shortcut to switch through them
[17:13:01] <Sukasa> so is anyone taking part in the ICFP coding challenge this weekend?
[17:18:14] <tiwake> what is that?
[17:21:19] <Sukasa> http://icfpcontest.org/ tl;dr they post the contest details tomorrow and teams have 2-3 days to get a solution together
[17:21:20] <PinkiePieBot> [ ICFP Programming Contest 2015 ]
[17:22:41] <tiwake> meh
[17:22:44] <Sukasa> The only hints we have to the nature of this years' contest are the name "Aleister" (Crowley?), and a few silly references to GCHQ and how everything's "top secret"
[17:22:58] <Sukasa> so me and a coupl friends from the makersapec figure we'll take part this year
[17:23:00] <tiwake> what was last years?
[17:27:11] <Sukasa> ah..  I think it was lambda man.  pac-man clone, but pac-man was controlled from a hardware lisp machine and the ghosts had custom 8-bit CPUs or such
[17:27:31] <Sukasa> you scored by having your pac-man survive as long as possible against 4 ghosts programmed by other teams
[17:29:04] <tiwake> sounds kinda boring
[17:29:29] <tiwake> (not that the programming I do is any less boring)
[17:29:34] <Sukasa> another earlier one was the universal machine
[17:29:45] <Sukasa> you're given "plates" that have basically opcode definitions on them
[17:29:55] <Sukasa> and have to write a virtual machine in order to boot this "recovered" binary blob
[17:30:28] <Sukasa> and then using that run the os inside it and complete various other challenges, and for each one you had to write a separate program to interact with your VM and the old binary
[17:30:30] <Sukasa> to solve puzzles
[17:30:36] <Sukasa> that one would've been fun to try
[17:33:56] <tiwake> I'd rather work on something useful

[22:30:10] <Flutterby> "we will have backwards compatibility, but not by default"
[22:30:13] <Flutterby> who comes up with this?
[22:30:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> My issues with systemd are simple and largely non-technical.   I feel it was adopted too fast, it's failure modes are still too unknown, it breaks compatibility with existing tools and standards, and it too tightly integrates what should always be a loosely integrated system.
[22:31:01] <DataByteBrony> its
[22:31:15] <DataByteBrony> ;P
[22:31:41] <HoneyDrops|Half> yes, I have a tendency to do that >_>
[22:31:52] <Googie> Basically that. Also the behavior of the developers does not inspire confidence, especially in bug reports like that
[22:32:34] <HoneyDrops|Half> systemd is great is you ignore basically everything that makes the unix model great.
[22:32:44] * Googie nods
[22:33:41] <Googie> I guess what I'm saying is I'm more annoyed with the state of coherent debate in general :V
[22:34:00] <Googie> Particularly among people who should know better
[22:34:20] <Googie> (Not just with systemd, but a lot of things)
[22:35:06] <HoneyDrops|Half> Combined with what feels like a rapid spread of its influence really rubs people the wrong way.  Change can be good, systemd does add some good changes (no one claims sysv is perfect), but it feels like we've been rushing headlong and not taking our time to find the good bits and winnow out the bad bits.
