[11:23:39] *** Joins: sleumas2000_ (uid91753@my.little.karaoke)
[11:23:57] <Googie> My dedi is in Seattle or Vegas (can't remember which)
[11:24:07] <Phase> awww
[11:24:25] <Googie> ShivalWolf has a couple here IIRC.
[11:24:43] * Phase wants one that doesn't have a ping primarily governed by the speed of light
[11:25:07] <Googie> I know that feeling.
[11:25:19] <Googie> Do you need a dedi, or are VPSs fine ?
[11:26:08] <Googie> (Also, bandwidth costs an arm and a leg)
[11:26:16] <Phase> i'd prefer a dedi for kvm
[11:26:27] <Phase> it's going to be my personal machine what has an internet connection
[11:27:01] <Googie> What kind of budget ?
[11:27:23] <Phase> no more than $150/month
[11:27:42] <Phase> the plans i've found start at $250
[11:27:45] <Googie> That should be reasonable then.
[11:27:56] <Googie> I've seen a few lower end ones cheaper. Let me check.
[11:28:47] <Phase> and even at 150 there's a place in the states offering 6 amd cores, 32GB ram, 2x3TB for $70
[11:29:18] <Phase> i could by two and a half of those for what it'd cost me to run something less capable than my laptop here :(
[11:29:19] <Googie> You sadly won't get anything close here :(
[11:30:18] <ShivalWolf> im hosted with servers australia
[11:30:18] <Googie> RansomIT seems to have some okayish ones, no comment on the company though, don't really know enough about them
[11:30:27] <Phase> Googie, what's the vps host?
[11:30:28] <ShivalWolf> and it costs me a little under 400$ a month
[11:30:31] <Phase> ouch
[11:30:54] <ShivalWolf> hosting in AU is fucked up for prices
[11:30:58] <ShivalWolf> so unless you NEED low latency
[11:31:00] <ShivalWolf> dont bother here
[11:31:05] <Googie> VPS hosts ? There's actually a few. AWS has a local DC here now.
[11:32:05] <Googie> Just tossing names for others. BinaryLane and Vultr
[11:32:20] <Googie> Again, no recommendations. I don't actually have any local VPSs, because yeah, price.
[11:33:36] <Phase> while i can understand bandwidth, what i really don't understand is why you get so much less hardware for the same price
[11:33:43] <Phase> is there some huge import tax i'm unaware of?
[11:33:55] <Googie> Colo is way more expensive here.
[11:34:02] <ShivalWolf> we dont have as many datacenters as the US has
[11:34:05] <ShivalWolf> they are a fraction of the size
[11:34:08] <Phase> or is everyone just buying dell's, a lot of them seem really fond of those hyperexpensive dell blades
[11:34:09] <Googie> ^
[11:34:09] <ShivalWolf> so they try and save sapce
[11:34:17] <ShivalWolf> also operating costs are far higher here due to power and airconditoning costs
[11:34:33] <Phase> hmm
[11:35:41] <Phase> guess i'll just have to deal with the latency :(
[11:36:01] <Googie> VPSes aren't too bad, depending on what you're using them for.
[11:36:42] <Phase> only thing that annoys me about vps's is the tend to have very small disks
[11:37:11] <Phase> plus the lack of kvm
[11:37:33] <Phase> unless they're enabling nested vmx these days
[11:37:58] <Googie> kvm isn't really an issue in the vast majority of cases. You can basically just spin up another VM.
[11:38:09] <Googie> Cost, but it'd be cheaper than a dedi here.
[11:38:17] <Phase> yeah
[11:39:15] <ShivalWolf> not much really needs the low latency to be hosted in AU with you
[11:39:24] <ShivalWolf> game servers dpeending what game can be picky
[11:39:29] <ShivalWolf> but i run a SIP gateway
[11:39:33] <ShivalWolf> and my box is also a proxy
[11:39:40] <ShivalWolf> so i kinda need the low latency
[11:39:53] <ShivalWolf> also its here becuase of geographical seperation of IRC servers
[11:39:55] <wolfyshy> KVM definitely matters when your machine crashes and it won't reboot and you need to recover it
[11:40:08] <wolfyshy> but there ARE providers that will let you in
[11:40:12] <ShivalWolf> network has soem in AU, DE, US
[11:40:18] <Phase> wolfyshy, as in the virtualization api, not remote access
[11:40:26] <wolfyshy> some using qemu-vnc (which also works in xen and kvm) and some using serial lines
[11:40:50] <Googie> I host game servers, but most of my friends are located elsewhere in the world, so I'm on the west coast of the states for hosting so that latency is basically passable for everyone.
[11:40:55] <wolfyshy> Phase: oh, don't use it, it has a lot of networking inefficencies even on virtio networking
[11:41:24] <wolfyshy> the throughput was 1/8th of what I got on xen on the same hardware running the same workload
[11:41:28] <Phase> i don't think that'll ever be a limit in australia
[11:41:32] <Googie> I've actually not met any VPS providers in a long time that don't have "out of band" access to Xen and KVM VMs.
[11:41:33] <wolfyshy> (postgres 9.1)
[11:42:06] <Googie> It's standard in SolusVM, which all the cheaper VPS providers use.
[11:42:16] <Phase> wolfyshy, bridged?
[11:42:36] <Googie> But yeah, even at 1/8th performance, doesn't matter in Aus :V

[11:43:20] <ShivalWolf> hell im lucky on the price i pay
[11:43:36] <wolfyshy> Phase, yes in both cases
[11:43:39] <Phase> that same price would get a 10mbit symetrical connection at work
[11:44:01] <Phase> wolfyshy, xen must be doing something cool then
[11:44:15] <Phase> afaik networking in kvm still jumps through qemu

[11:50:00] <ShivalWolf> they also dont want to risk compromise of a gigabit link
[11:50:49] <Googie> At least the cost of hosting here slowly seems to be going down.
[11:51:17] <Googie> The fact that budget providers are managing to provide decent hardware at < $100p/m and also now that AWS has moved in.
[11:52:32] <Googie> (Decent being a relative term :V)
[11:57:51] <Phase> i wouldn't be surprised if the cost was the cause of the cost
[11:58:34] <Phase> i mean why wouldn't you go buy the one in the states, it's oreders of magnitude less expensive

[20:48:52] <Quindo> Only if you are at all interested in content providers on youtube.  If you are not, who cares?

[20:51:34] *** Joins: Compu (compu@snuggly.filly)
[20:53:32] <Quindo> There needs to be a big campaign to stop using licensed music in vidya games...
[20:56:29] <HoneyDrops> Or just have "incidental music from a game that is being shown" fall under fair use.
[20:57:41] <Quindo> no...
[20:57:44] <Quindo> Not fair use.
[21:00:38] <Quindo> I think there needs to be a 'in context license' where if the music is being played in context then passes all rights to the owner of the host media owner (The video game company)
[21:01:08] <Quindo> That way if a company really wants to hide the ending to their game from youtube they can do that.
[21:01:27] <Quindo> but videos will not be juked just because of audio trolling
[21:03:37] <HoneyDrops> I would rather they use CC'd music, or the game company can write their own (though most games I play /do/).  I think a general blanket policy fixes the core problem, and does not rely in parties to not forget to implement the fix.
[21:05:15] <HoneyDrops> I don't feel a game company has any right to "hide" the ending of their game.  In any case, they have more than enough copyright claim to plenty of other assets should they feel some compelling need to abuse copyright.
[21:05:58] <Quindo> That is currently up in the air.
[21:06:22] <Quindo> But I do think that music and brands contained in the game need to be under some sort of 'Context License'
[21:07:19] <HoneyDrops> Pretty sure they own the graphics, some artist some where drew them and as part of their contract likely assigned them to the publisher, as that is sadly how it is general done.
[21:07:34] <HoneyDrops> generally*
[21:07:48] <Quindo> its more an issue with music then graphics.

[21:23:05] <HoneyDrops> They could still do that with my "fair use" solution.
[21:24:02] <HoneyDrops> Why would the game studio demand it?
[21:25:58] <HoneyDrops> You can't rely on a for-profit entity to do the right thing, so you either have to force them (via regulation or court orders) or remove them from the equation (eg: BG music in a video of gameplay is fair use and the rights holder to the soundtrack can't issue a takedown).

[21:44:42] <Gladiolus> I'm looking to buy a thing and want to get advice, o3o.
[21:45:03] <Obaskyr> What thing exactly?
[21:45:21] <Obaskyr> I know a thing or two about headphones...
[21:46:02] <Gladiolus> Well, looking for a good gaming headphones for 200ish
[21:46:58] <Obaskyr> $200?
[21:47:09] <Obaskyr> You can get a hell of a lot for that money.
[21:47:25] <Obaskyr> First up - do you have a good mic?
[21:53:05] <Obaskyr> If not, you want to buy an Antlion Modmic, or a cheapish studio condenser mic. For your cans you have a lot of options for around 100 bucks, but the most important consideration for gaming usage is that they're open backed.
[21:53:46] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[21:58:37] <Quindo> Buy em seperate
[21:58:42] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[22:01:14] <Kinsley> Gladiolus: for $200, yeah, look hard at something like the Sennheiser G4ME ONEs. Open backed, velour ear pads so they don't get super hot, and they're comfortable enough to wear all day.
[22:02:52] <Kinsley> Or consider the HD 558 or 598 + Modmic
[22:03:20] <Obaskyr> Those are good choices.
[22:03:36] <Gladiolus> Sorry uh. Yes I do have a good mic.
[22:03:49] <Obaskyr> If you bring down the headphone budget a smidge you can throw in a DAC/amp too.
[22:04:03] <Kinsley> DAC/amp is a good idea.
[22:04:10] <Gladiolus> I have a soundcard with an amp.
[22:04:12] <Obaskyr> the FiiO E10K is stellar for the price
[22:04:19] <Kinsley> I have a Creative E3 I'm looking to sell since I upgraded. Also a good choice.
[22:04:24] <Gladiolus> I think so anyway- it's hella loud.
[22:04:40] <Gladiolus> I was suggested these by a friend, but I'm always open to more suggestions: http://www.bestbuy.ca/Search/SearchResults.aspx?type=product&query=G633&page=1&sortBy=relevance&sortDir=desc

[22:04:44] <Gladiolus> also goddamn canadian dollar
[22:04:55] <HoneyDrops> At some point I should probably invest in something other than my 7$ ear buds, just seems hard to justify something that would get so little use.
[22:05:09] <Kinsley> Gladiolus: soundcards internal to the PC suffer from EM interference.
[22:05:20] <Gladiolus> I've never noticed any.
[22:05:35] <Gladiolus> I've tested for it as much as I'm able- cranking shit up to max.
[22:05:36] <Kinsley> I have, but if you're not experiencing it, good.
[22:06:07] <Quindo> Honestly, just buy cheap over ear headphones from a localstore that have no mic attached.
[22:06:12] <Kinsley> My recommendation, then, if you already have a good mic and DAC/amp from the soundcard, go with the HD 558/598
[22:06:12] <Gladiolus> Like after experiencing it in an old dos setup I got spergy and looked for it here, was never able to get it except in very extreme scenarios.
[22:06:17] <Obaskyr> HoneyDrops: grab a pair of HD668B headphones. they're like 30 quid in sales now, and they're literally the best cans you can get for under $100

[22:07:47] <Lapsus> all the buttons on the headset are also totally useless
[22:07:50] <Obaskyr> Gladiolus: is your soundcard part of your motherboard or an add-in card?
[22:07:58] <Gladiolus> Add on, Sound Blaster Z.

[22:18:43] <roflin> well it actually makes sense in some situation.
[22:19:33] * HoneyDrops hides under her pillows, she likes quiet.
[22:19:45] <roflin> typical setup is inner ears for actual game audio. overear headsets for communication, and noise canceling headphones over that to shut out the croud/enemy team.
[22:20:09] <roflin> but now with soundtight booths this is not very relevant anymore.
[22:20:25] <Quindo> the booths are not sound tight.
[22:20:32] <Quindo> Rather they have white noise generators in em
[22:20:38] <Quindo> + the noise canceling
[22:22:33] <Quindo> cause it is easier to mask load noises then completely cancel them

[22:25:07] <roflin> but the latter one, like I said never happens anymore with the soundproof booths.
[22:25:10] <Obaskyr> You try it out and tell me how it goes. No pro gamer uses IEMs because they have terrible positional audio.
[22:25:25] <Obaskyr> Everything sounds like it's happening in your ears.
[22:25:32] <Quindo> It depends on the type of game
[22:25:43] <Obaskyr> No.

[22:32:42] <Obaskyr> the game rules stipulate that they have to have the peltors so they cant hear the commentator, their sponsors say they HAVE to use their kit, so the poor sods in this case had to use earbuds under the peltors.
[22:32:59] <Obaskyr> which is really stupid.
[22:33:58] <Obaskyr> But to be fair I dont really give a toss because most competitive gamers and the esports scene in general are all wankers.
[22:33:58] <Quindo> it is dumb, but that is marketing for ya
[22:34:19] <Quindo> and if you are taking money to market a thing, you sometimes have to do dumb stuff.

[22:49:07] <Colgate> ahem
[22:49:10] <Colgate> it isn't marketing
[22:49:15] <Colgate> it is "product placement"
[22:49:19] <Colgate> :P
[22:49:57] * GigaWork places Colgate next to Colgate toothpaste, next to the miniature of Colgate on the shelf. X3
[22:50:09] <Quindo> Product Placement did not work out the way they thought it would during junk yard wars...
