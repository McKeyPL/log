[00:46:54] <Moonlightning> What was this bullshit?
[00:47:05] <Moonlightning> Content owners charging others to link to their content?
[00:47:14] <Moonlightning> That's stupid, anyway…the links are free advertising!
[00:59:08] <Seoson> I should seriously consider moving to another country. EU laws recently were worse than U.S. stuff. That's pretty impressive

[01:38:43] <Moonlightning> QoS is complicated. D:
[01:47:15] <Seoson> 2 more weeks until my certs start to expire ....
[01:47:53] <Seoson> Why is every CA a freaking b!tch? -.-
[01:48:10] <Moonlightning> You didn't apply for the LE beta?
[01:48:20] * Moonlightning checks for updates on that.
[01:49:41] <Moonlightning> Still in limited beta…no reply on my request for more hostnames.
[01:50:23] <Seoson> I did and I have access, but only for a fraction of my domains because fuck people that organize everything in subdomains
[01:50:51] <Seoson> Want your mail server on mail.domain.tld? NOPE!
[01:51:04] <Moonlightning> Didn't you submit another request?
[01:51:18] <Seoson> No because this policy is bullshit
[01:51:48] <Seoson> Forget one name and I'm screwed. I have MANY subdomains
[01:51:59] <Moonlightning> Use your zonefile for reference?
[01:52:11] <Moonlightning> …use a concatenation of your zonefiles for reference?
[01:52:24] <Seoson> I could but just fuck that policy 6_9
[01:53:08] <Seoson> That they did that is freaking unreasonable and stupid.
[01:54:07] <Moonlightning> <Moonlightning> I'm hoping and assuming that the stable isn't going to be run like that
[01:54:07] <Moonlightning> <Seoson> It's not
[01:54:31] <Seoson> Huh someone might issue a cert for randomesubdomain.mydomain.tld BUT WHO CARES IF THEY HAVE THE ROOT DOMAIN! It's not like they cannot steal cookies from there :P
[01:56:34] <Moonlightning> Hmm?
[01:56:35] <Seoson> Oh and domains not owned by me but hosted on my server use wildcarts.
[01:57:00] * Moonlightning shrugs. Won't be using wildcards.
[01:57:13] <Moonlightning> Change the list of hostnames, grab new certificates.
[01:57:14] <Seoson> Oh spelling ... Ups
[01:57:36] <Seoson> Also fuck the LE client
[01:58:01] <Seoson> I'm seriously considering reading into the ACME spec and just write one myself.
[01:58:15] <Moonlightning> Do it filly!
[01:58:32] * Seoson is way too lazy. Probably not going to happen.
[01:59:58] <Seoson> I like how the LE client just completely quits if there is one single minor error in GUI mode.
[02:00:26] <Seoson> Like it couldn't delete a file I already deleted manually
[02:01:21] <Seoson> Also I'd still need to figure out a why to restart all services once the certs are renwed
[02:01:36] <Seoson> Because I'm not going to do that myself every 60 days.
[02:02:50] <Moonlightning> Make a fake init job?
[02:02:55] <Seoson> This is probably going to end in me writing some junk code that checks the files checksum for changes running as root because it needs to. And I might do it in PHP just because I can
[02:02:57] <Moonlightning> And then make all the services depend on it.
[02:03:30] <Moonlightning> or, depending on your init system, you might be able to just make a new event or whatever
[02:03:39] <Moonlightning> certificates-renewed
[02:03:46] <Moonlightning> And have the services reload when that event happens
[02:03:55] <Seoson> systemd - everyponies favorite :D
[02:04:09] <Seoson> Reloading is not enough
[02:04:25] <Moonlightning> s/reload/do whatever's needed/
[02:04:25] <Seoson> Apache2 and Postfix cannot reload the certs
[02:04:45] <Seoson> Also I wouldn't want them to because drop root and things
[02:05:57] <Moonlightning> So you'll have to restart them completely every two months.
[02:06:10] <Seoson> And now I have 2 weeks to figure this out or switch back to StartSSL

[02:06:47] <Seoson> Moonlightning: I need only every 90 days but than there is no place for errors
[02:07:20] <Seoson> LE is essentially a nightmare to implement -.-
[02:07:34] * Moonlightning rolls his eyes.
[02:07:51] <Moonlightning> It's the same problem you'd have anyway with certificates! It's just more frequent now.
[02:08:04] <Seoson> And thatÄs the problem
[02:08:23] <Moonlightning> So you have to do it every two months now instead of every twelve.
[02:08:26] <Seoson> I don't mind doing this once a year - even if it is a pain

[02:09:36] <Seoson> Also now I need to automate it which is more likely to cause errors and security relevant bugs
[02:10:25] <Seoson> Last thing I want is a privilege escalation due to my dumb SSL management wrapper
[02:13:59] <Seoson> I'll look now into systemd's inotify
[02:14:55] <Moonlightning> inotify isn't systemd
[02:15:37] <Seoson> It was mentioned under systemd's unit system.
[02:16:20] <Seoson> systemd.path — Path unit configuration
[02:18:45] <Seoson> I haven't worked with those once. This is going to be interesting
[02:22:39] <Seoson> Looking at the unit file for openSSH, simple enough
[02:23:35] <Moonlightning> …wait a second. /var/www shouldn't be owned by www-data, should it.
[02:25:31] <Seoson> It is on my system
[02:26:40] <Moonlightning> But if a web process gets compromised, it could write stuff in there which might then be served|executed

[03:01:18] <Webster> Yeah?
[03:01:44] <Lapsus> I don't understand
[03:01:58] <Lapsus> is it just coincidental that it flanks that specific station then?
[03:02:12] <Webster> It's either part of that station or something taking up the whitespace next to it.
[03:02:48] <Lapsus> wait, rdbs is what allows some radios to show the song titles and stuff right?
[03:02:55] <Webster> Yeah.
[03:02:57] <Lapsus> so it would be station specific

[03:03:10] <Lapsus> but then why is that the only station on the whole band where I can actually see it?
[03:03:20] <Lapsus> almost all of them do it

[07:35:54] <HoneyDrops> Also Kazaa
[07:36:06] * Kinsley sticks it in her tape deck and rocks out to late 90's grunge
[07:36:44] <Sakura> Oh, trolling USENET was fun too. Way better than trolls today.
[07:36:46] * Dashie replaces Kinsley's grunge tape with an early Cattle Decapitation demo.
[07:36:49] <Kinsley> I rocke 256 Kbps because we were happening.
[07:36:56] <Moonlightning> …not that kinda tape
[07:37:35] <Kinsley> But I remember the 14.4 Kbps modem we had.
[07:38:00] <Kinsley> And I remember my new school trying to let 30 kids share a ISDN link to log onto Neopets.
[07:39:24] <Sakura> I remember when we had to wait for parents to get off the phone before we could Internet some more.
[07:39:39] <tiwake> lol neopets
[07:39:53] <tiwake> I should log into neopets
[07:40:12] <tiwake> but that requires effort
[07:40:32] <tiwake> battledome was an interesting thing they added, but did not put much effort into
[07:41:27] * Moonlightning trots around the channel, distributing gopher clients from a stack balanced across his wings.
[07:41:31] <Sakura> I don't miss dial-up one bit but using 3G & losing Internet because of each phone call on my smartphone brings back old wounds.
[07:41:33] <Kinsley> I literally haven't touched Neopets in 10 years.
[07:41:41] <Sakura> Me either.
[07:41:59] <Moonlightning> something something NeoRatticus Norvegius
[07:42:23] <Sakura> A friend turned me onto Neopets once.
[07:42:34] <Kinsley> I also remember buying a 4G smartphone weeks before 4G rolled out to my area and being super excited when they tested the towers a week early.
[07:42:48] <Sakura> My monkey's name was MonkeyBush.

[07:43:45] <Moonlightning> fuck I can't

[07:43:59] <Moonlightning> Neorattus Norvegicus *, herp derp
[07:44:04] <tiwake> like freespace2
[07:44:09] <Moonlightning> got my us and my cus mixed up
[07:44:18] <Sakura> Interestingly, I named my monkey after Dubya. :D
[07:44:20] <tiwake> only multi-player, and flank tons of more awesome
[07:44:22] <Kinsley> Nah, blew all my money on the Them's Fightin' Herds campaign.
[07:44:29] <Moonlightning> Heh.
[07:44:33] <Moonlightning> What did you get?
[07:44:36] * Moonlightning went for the $55 tier.
[07:44:49] *** Dusk is now known as Dawn
[07:44:49] <tiwake> Moonlightning: I put in something like $35 I think
[07:45:03] <Kinsley> Soundtrack tier at $40, but I got an extra copy for friend that I know likes Skullgirls.
[07:45:49] <Sakura> Ooh, anyone ever run a BBS server?
[07:45:51] <Moonlightning> Mmm, yeah, I almost went for that ^2
[07:45:56] <Moonlightning> Sakura: No. Fuck PHP.
[07:46:07] <tiwake> ^
[07:46:20] <Kinsley> ^^
[07:46:24] * Moonlightning flatly refuses to run anything involving PHP on his herd.
[07:46:28] <Kinsley> Python is where it's at.
[07:46:31] * Moonlightning is considering doing the same for Java, too.
[07:46:33] <Moonlightning> ^2
[07:46:35] <tiwake> or ruby
[07:46:43] <tiwake> but python has a lot more resources
[07:46:48] <Moonlightning> Ruby is cool. I never really got into it, but respect
[07:46:49] <Sakura> And not a modern BBS either, I mean one that you call into with your old computer.
[07:47:05] <Moonlightning> Sakura: oh, pre-PHP? Yeah, Iunno
[07:47:12] <tiwake> I havent done much with either... heh
[07:47:26] <Moonlightning> Gotta be better than the PHP ones, though *shrug*
[07:47:41] <tiwake> I'm putting $256 into infinity battlescape :-x
[07:48:02] <Kinsley> That's more than I've ever supported a crowdfunding campaign, ever.
[07:48:03] <tiwake> because procedurally generated planet bobblehead for in-game cockpit :-x
[07:48:14] <Sakura> I thought about setting one up in case I have to move to Alabama. That's why I wanted to start an IRC server in case I gotta deal with dial-up.
[07:48:27] <Kinsley> ... That's actually more than the sum total of ALL my crowdfunding.
[07:48:29] * Moonlightning spittakes.
[07:48:50] <tiwake> Kinsley: I tend to pick what I want to support, and go all in :-x

[07:50:30] * Moonlightning also has a tiny one-server network
[07:51:24] <Sakura> True. I can still use Canternet. But I wanna keep in touch with IRL friends without Facebook.
[07:51:49] <Sakura> You got a one-server IRC network?
[07:52:02] <Kinsley> tiwake: you clearly have more disposable income than I do.
[07:52:25] <Kinsley> $55 was already pushing it for TFH.
[07:53:19] <Kinsley> I loved Planetary Annihilation. Total Annihilation is still, 17 years of constant play on, years after adoring Supreme Commander, still my very favorite game.
[07:53:25] <Sakura> You using your home network to host or do you have another way to have it hosted, Moonlightning?
[07:53:27] <Kinsley> I pledged at $40.
[07:53:42] <Moonlightning> Cheap (but good) VPS, Sakura
[07:53:50] <Kinsley> I still have my original CD of TotalA!
[07:53:54] <Sakura> Ooh OK.
[07:54:06] <Kinsley> I'm not fucking kidding. That disc is 17 years old, and I still have it.
[07:54:21] <Kinsley> I did buy the Gog.com version to get the expansions, but sitll.
[07:54:57] <Kinsley> $40 is kinda my limit when it comes to crowdfunding.
[07:58:04] <Moonlightning> Sakura: it also runs a webserver that doesn't do much, either c:
[07:58:39] <Moonlightning> And two VPN servers (private), and one of the two DNS servers authoritative for my domain
[07:58:54] <Moonlightning> That's the only thing you'll get out of the DNS server, though. Everything else is private use only

[08:12:32] <Moonlightning> …actually, that isn't that much of a risk. I could just hash my private key and give you the hash to sign.
[08:15:03] <Kinsley> Booo.
[08:15:16] <Kinsley> It was a sex joke and you ruined it.
[08:15:26] <Moonlightning> I know. I'm sorry. I had to. :P
[08:15:56] <Sakura> I so need to look into finding the right VPS so I can start making my server public.
[08:16:05] <Kinsley> Chunkhost
[08:16:07] <Kinsley> Easy.
[08:16:08] <Moonlightning> ChunkHost.
[08:16:12] <Moonlightning> Use my referral link, not Kinsley's.
[08:16:20] <Kinsley> Moonlight isn't a channel mod

[08:16:31] <Sakura> Cost?
[08:16:35] <Kinsley> And I'm durnk and petty
[08:16:37] <Moonlightning> No, it's just that if you sign up using one of our links, we'll get money for it.
[08:16:41] <Kinsley> $5 for the cheapest tier.
[08:16:47] <Moonlightning> Sakura: but I'm also in bed with her! So…!
[08:16:51] <Moonlightning> THE CONSPIRACY DEEPENS
[08:16:52] <Sakura> A month?
[08:16:59] <Kinsley> Yeah, a month.
[08:17:05] <Sakura> Hmmm...
[08:17:09] <Moonlightning> there is more to this conflict of interest than you think!
[08:17:11] <Kinsley> But you can get a discount for paying for a full year in advance.
[08:17:43] <Kinsley> (paying for a year also doubles the RAM and bandwidth allocation)
[08:18:10] <Moonlightning> No, but in all serious. I've been with CH for like three and a half years now. They've got a /super/ open acceptable-use policy, they're cheap, and they just generally seem cool.
[08:18:47] <Kinsley> https://chunkhost.com/r/0xdeadbeef
[08:18:48] <Moonlightning> There is the occassional spot of downtime, but I don't find it too bad
[08:18:48] <PinkiePieBot> [ SSD VPS Server, Fast Cloud Server, VPS Server, Cloud Hosting From ChunkHost ]
[08:18:55] <Moonlightning> That's a referral link, by the way :p
[08:19:02] <Kinsley> And they prorate the downtime.
[08:19:03] <Sakura> And without a domain name, how would people connect?
[08:19:05] <Moonlightning> ^
[08:19:09] <Sakura> IP address?
[08:19:12] <Moonlightning> ^:Kinsley *
[08:19:14] <Moonlightning> yeah.
[08:19:20] <Moonlightning> I did that for literal years :p
[08:19:26] <Moonlightning> domains are also cheap, though.
[08:19:43] <Moonlightning> I got blackl.net. for like $12/year, including the thing that hides your name and address from the public database
[08:19:46] <Kinsley> They have their own domain hosting, so if you buy or already have a domain, you can point it at their servers.
[08:20:09] <Moonlightning> Or you can do what I do and do your own DNS. It's not /that/ hard. :3
[08:20:12] <Sakura> What about GoDaddy?
[08:20:14] <Moonlightning> I mean, if you already know how to configure shit
[08:20:17] <Moonlightning> EW NO DON'T USE GODADDY
[08:20:17] * Kinsley hisses
[08:20:23] <Kinsley> Namecheap
[08:20:46] <Moonlightning> I got mine from Namecheap. I'm still not sure if I'm going to jump over the DNSSEC thing.
[08:20:54] <Kinsley> Not only is it cheaper for a domain, they don't waste money supporting dumb ads or shit legislation like SOPA
[08:21:04] <Moonlightning> Namecheap's UI rather puts me off.
[08:21:20] <Kinsley> ... I only touch it like, once a year.
[08:21:41] <Kinsley> So UI is fine as long as I can pay the $10 for the domain and WHOIS mask.
[08:22:34] <Sakura> I need sleep now
[08:23:03] <Kinsley> No, stay up forever and buy lots of chucks on my referral link so I get tons of credit
[08:23:08] <Kinsley> I mean.
[08:23:20] <Kinsley> Carefully decide on a hosting option.
[08:23:28] <Kinsley> And go with what works best.
[08:23:46] <Kinsley> And the best is Chunkhost's highest tier

[08:25:02] <Kinsley> I thought of mine before MLP was a thing!

[08:26:31] <Kinsley> (will withhold that delightful sex you've been dying for)
[08:26:41] <Moonlightning> Delicious muffins!
[08:26:50] <Moonlightning> Also snow pies. Who doesn't love snow pies?
[08:27:13] <Kinsley> .... People who like cream pies?
[08:27:27] <Moonlightning> (don't play that game…we both know you're the one who needs it more)

[08:29:09] <Moonlightning> In seriousness, Sakura, sleep on it. Probably shop around, too.

[08:32:43] <Moonlightning> Okay, this is rather starting to bug me.
[08:33:07] <Moonlightning> A ton of ponies' nicks are in this one shade of blue-green, when they're supposed to be different colors
[08:36:33] <Kinsley> Blue green... like cyan blue green?
[08:40:01] <Moonlightning> https://www.blackl.net/like-this-bluegreen.png
[08:41:15] <Moonlightning> The shade that Camer_n_D, Cosm_c, D_ck, endoriaz_l, engineman_ac, Finnf_nn, F_nwe, and j_hnsey have.
[08:41:33] <Moonlightning> I'm sure that at least half of them are not supposed to have that nick color.
[08:41:55] <Moonlightning> D_shie had it, too, earlier, but it went away. Dunno why.
[08:42:14] * Moonlightning tried `/color reset`. No dice.
[08:43:13] <Kinsley> OK, that's not what I would call a blue-green.
[08:43:20] <Kinsley> Maybe a dusty blue.
[08:43:42] <Kinsley> Like, sleumas' hostmask join, that's blue-green.
[08:43:49] <Kinsley> Well, cyan.
[08:43:57] <Kinsley> But in that spectrum.
[08:51:08] <Moonlightning> That's not cyan…?
[08:51:47] *** Quits: Q0 (Q0@literallyshit.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[08:52:24] <Moonlightning> anyway, the point is that the color is wrong! D:
[08:53:11] <Moonlightning> Lots of ponies are getting that color that shouldn't. And there should be plenty of colors to go around, as you can see from the rest of the nicklist!
[08:54:37] *** Joins: Q0 (Q0@Pony-0m7faa.vtfe.qoe9.0601.2601.IP)
[09:09:19] <Kinsley> I'm pretty sure it's bug with how Weechat assigns colors to nicks. Probably based on some kind of hash or something.
[09:10:46] <Moonlightning> It is hash-based, but this instance has weeks of uptime and it only just cropped up a day or two ago.
[09:14:16] <Kinsley> Mmm,  I notice that nicks are always assigned the same color.
[09:14:30] <Kinsley> That is to say, it's not uptime-based for me.
[09:14:39] <Kinsley> You're always this copper-brown color.
[09:15:06] <Kinsley> (Pinkie is this bright magenta, which is perfect)
[09:15:36] <Eclipse> Moonlightning: how many colors do you have in your rotation
[09:15:54] <Eclipse> weechat.color.chat_nick_colors
[09:16:06] <Eclipse> if you don't have enough, yes it'll reuse
[09:16:14] <Eclipse> (also, lol @ D_ck)
[09:18:56] <Moonlightning> Eclipse: lots :P
[09:19:07] <Eclipse> less than 96, presumably 
[09:19:32] <Eclipse> even if it's more, statistically, that distribution can happen just fine 
[09:19:55] <Moonlightning> 213.
[09:20:07] <Eclipse> how many of those are actually visually distinct?
[09:20:31] <Eclipse> because `weechat --colors` has a lot of not very visually distinct colrors
[09:20:34] <Moonlightning> Plenty. Look at the nicklist.
[09:20:46] <Moonlightning> That's rather irrelevant, though.
[09:20:57] <Moonlightning> I KNOW the colorings of some of these nicks.
[09:21:18] <Moonlightning> Colg_te's is /wrong./ I can search the scrollback and find an instance of his nick with the right color.
[09:21:26] <Eclipse> hm!
[09:21:27] <Eclipse> well
[09:21:57] <Eclipse> did you recently /upgrade, or change irc.look.nick_color_hash ? :P
[09:22:02] <Eclipse> if not, good luck and have fun!

[12:46:51] <PinkiePieBot> [ wave.py · GitHub ]
[12:46:55] <AppleDash> Figure out why
[12:46:58] * Cyan_Spark trots in after AppleDash, levitating with him a bucket of popcorn
[12:47:41] <Moonlightning> you have a string `message`
[12:47:44] <Moonlightning> why can't you regex it
[12:49:41] *** Parts: Cyan_Spark (Cyan_Spark@incidental.unicorn.Cyan_Spark) ("Oh, who am I kidding, the only sort I know is a bubblesort... ")
[12:49:42] <AppleDash> because that doesn't work
[12:49:59] <AppleDash> if re.match("regex", message): say(what?)
[12:50:25] <Moonlightning> I dunno, map the shit
[12:50:44] <AppleDash> I'll just add the regex to the and clauses
[12:50:55] <Moonlightning> {r'\o': r'o/', r'\o/': r'\o/', r'o/': r'\o'}
[12:51:04] <Moonlightning> match the shit with a capture, look it up in that
[12:51:26] <AppleDash> Creating variables is generally bad
[12:51:57] <Moonlightning> You don't care about code quality. Go do it.
[12:52:07] <AppleDash> I do
[12:52:11] <AppleDash> you don't know my reasoning
[12:52:20] <AppleDash> every variable anywhere in derpy automatically becomes global
[12:52:26] <AppleDash> you have to be careful about what you name things
[12:54:14] <Moonlightning> seriously?
[12:54:18] <Moonlightning> whose fucking idea was that
[12:54:27] <Moonlightning> …never mind; it doesn't matter. You can just use it inline; you don't need to bind it to anything.
[12:54:33] <AppleDash> not mine
[12:54:41] <Seoson> Hi. Wait chuckhost is not exactly cheap :P
[12:54:49] <Moonlightning> {r'\o': r'o/', r'\o/': r'\o/', r'o/': r'\o'}[match_str]
[12:55:00] <Moonlightning> It's not? Isn't the lowest tier like $5/month?
[12:55:52] <Seoson> Yes for a VPS with low specs :P
[12:55:53] <AppleDash> Everyone knows that almost all VPS hosts are scams above the lowest tier
[12:56:06] *** Quits: Pocky (Pocketguns2@Digging.a.Hole) (Quit: Leaving)
[12:56:13] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: your regex doesn't work
[12:56:33] <Moonlightning> don't regex then
[12:56:39] <Moonlightning> split the fucking string on fucking whitespace
[12:56:43] <Moonlightning> then do the shit
[12:57:06] <Seoson> For the price of their highest tier you can get a real dedicated with 4 times the power. :P
[12:57:49] <Moonlightning> Really? From where?
[12:58:10] * Moonlightning only uses their lowest tier, so
[12:58:15] <AppleDash> there, fixed, Moonlightning
[12:58:21] <Seoson> Look as the usual suspects ... I pay a little more for mine at Hetzner
[12:58:50] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: #chad if you want to test, otherwise unquiet plox
[12:58:51] <Seoson> (Which is a German host. Only downside is handling in case of DDoS)
[13:02:10] <Seoson> Here is a better offer from a German provider for a VPS (the say root, but they mean VPS): https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=1109 Their human support is horrible, but products are fine apart from that

[13:08:10] <AppleDash> For the 36$ ChunkHost gives me an 8GB 2 core VPS for, I have a 32GB RAM 8 core server
[13:08:14] <AppleDash> Also with 4TB of storage
[13:13:55] <Seoson> I only have 2TiB (One due to RAID1), but I don't use that much anyway.
[13:16:18] <AppleDash> I'm not RAIDing because #yolo #swag
[13:19:16] <Seoson> I prefer not loosing my E-Mails :D
[13:19:38] <Moonlightning> You prefer tighting your emails?
[13:19:49] <Moonlightning> s/s.$/?/
[13:20:16] <Seoson> ?
[13:20:49] <Moonlightning> You prefer tighting your email?
[13:24:37] <Seoson> I don't even understand that question
[13:25:35] <Moonlightning> Well, you said you prefer not loosing it…
[13:28:53] <Seoson> Where did I put that silly backup script
[13:29:15] <Moonlightning> clearly, you should have stored it with your mail
[13:29:50] <Seoson> That would not make any sense, since it does not only backups my mails
[13:30:08] <Moonlightning> You can back up a thing that backs up thigns
[13:30:22] <Moonlightning> it doesn't create an infinite recursion thing
[13:32:11] <Seoson> I can't find it. I might just use rsync. Rewriting this is a pain and I cannot find the guy that got a copy from me
[13:35:10] <Seoson> Found it ;-)
[13:50:10] <AppleDash> holy fuck
[13:50:16] <AppleDash> I found a really weird thing
[13:50:26] <AppleDash> Not really WEIRD but I never new this
[13:50:56] <AppleDash> In Ruby, the [] operator works on an integer to get the bit at that position in the number, where some_int[0] is the rightmost bit of the number

[16:33:01] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> okay, audio is pretty simple actually, output power / #speakers, 40watts @4ohms /2 = 20 watts per speaker/channel, or 80@2ohms /2 = 40 per speaker/channel
[16:34:51] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> 4 speakers would be 25% of output power per speaker if the speakers are matched impedance, so 4x8 ohm speakers wired for 4ohms @40watts would be ~10watts per speaker driver

[22:34:22] <Moonlightning> …why should I send Strict-Transport-Security with max-age set to only half a year?

[22:36:57] <Moonlightning> Speaking of, what's the range on that?
[22:37:21] <Moonlightning> …wait, never mind, it's not relative.
[22:40:56] <roflin> well whenever there is something like a max age in security, it's about "what if you are comprimised and cannot revoke the key anymore", atleast it will revoke itself in maximum of 6 months.
[22:42:39] <Moonlightning> So…an attacker has the webserver's private key, and I can't revoke it.
[22:43:00] <Moonlightning> And that makes plaintext better than otherwise-good TLS with a compromised server key?
