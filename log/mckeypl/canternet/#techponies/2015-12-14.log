[03:19:46] <Starthunder> optimizing?
[03:20:06] <Phase> optimizing
[03:20:15] <JustAberrant> .. optimizing :)
[03:20:23] <AppleDash> optimizing :(
[03:20:25] <Phase> lazy way is to translate to c and let it do the work
[03:20:35] <Starthunder> best way to optimize
[03:20:46] <Starthunder> …how do you translate Brainfuck into C, though?
[03:20:58] <Starthunder> what with the infinite array of registers
[03:20:59] *** Quits: Xefir (xefir@Pony-v55nf6.rev.sfr.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[03:21:22] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: easy mode, just start with an absurdly large primitive array
[03:21:36] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: slightly less easy: linked list/vector/etc
[03:21:37] <Phase> + = *cell++ - = *cell-- [ = while(*cell) {, ] = }, . = *cell = getchar()
[03:21:57] <Phase> > = cell++, < = cell--
[03:21:58] <Phase> so on
[03:22:19] <JustAberrant> but yeah, bf can be pretty easily translated into c (or any other language)
[03:22:21] <Phase> Starthunder, litterally one for one
[03:22:26] <JustAberrant> the operators pretty much map one to one
[03:22:31] <JustAberrant> Phase: bleh ;p
[03:22:40] <Phase> and if you're real fancy you can even map source lines
[03:23:22] <Phase> though the only syntax error in brainfuck is an unmatched []
[03:23:27] <Starthunder> But how do you know how big to make `cell`? >.>
[03:23:40] <Phase> Starthunder, its size is undefined
[03:23:53] <Starthunder> Exactly.
[03:23:59] <Starthunder> But you can't have an array in C with undefined size.
[03:24:05] <Phase> however large you chose
[03:24:37] <Phase> 64bit machine, go ahead and mmap a few TB of memory
[03:24:37] <JustAberrant> you could easily implement an expanding one with a list/vector
[03:24:59] <Phase> JustAberrant, memory over committing means you can just let the OS do that :D
[03:25:49] <JustAberrant> but I imagine the "official" bf compiler just defines a size
[03:26:27] <JustAberrant> according to google, it was 30,000
[03:26:55] <Starthunder> Not 32768? :/
[03:27:02] <JustAberrant> evidently not :>
[03:27:06] <AppleDash> Can't you just malloc(getsystemraminbytes())
[03:27:24] <AppleDash> And then you're only limited by the system RAM
[03:27:24] <JustAberrant> hehe
[03:27:33] <JustAberrant> actually not really, because it would need to be contiguous
[03:27:46] <AppleDash> By the time you get to the end you'll have problems :P
[03:27:55] <Phase> malloc returns a contigious mapping
[03:28:18] <Starthunder> Evidently, you need to create an abstraction layer
[03:28:37] <Phase> virtual memory already handles all that
[03:28:41] <Starthunder> To keep the operators from triggering undefined behavior in C, though.

[03:41:14] <mniip> 4k pages is what you're after

[03:41:51] <Phase> YOU CAN'T ESCAPE THE UNSAFETY
[03:41:53] <HoneyDrops> In any event, there is no reason to allocate a massive chunk off the bat for a bf interpreter.
[03:42:05] <Phase> Starthunder, though seriously that's litterally the use case of unsafe {}
[03:43:19] <Phase> you can mmap as much memory as you want and madvise-out pages as they're zero'd

[08:31:33] <Sakura> Planning to do something very interesting & time consuming as long as it's protected somewhere under Twitch's rules. Did Twitch Installs Arch Linux fall anywhere under Creative or anything like that?
[08:36:31] <roflin> Sakura: i believe it was under programming
[08:36:58] <Sakura> Programming? Alright. Fair enough then.

[08:57:28] <AppleDash> They're just gonna delete system32
[08:59:11] <Sakura> I could just keep it where I am the only one doing the installation. It would take days to finish if I let kids do it on the chat.
[08:59:48] <AppleDash> TIAL took days
[09:00:35] <Sakura> Yes, that's what happens when you let kids on the chat help you install it.

[23:10:37] <Phase> isn't um
[23:10:44] <Phase> isn't it a freebsd kernel?
[23:10:58] <HoneyDrops> Yes
[23:11:55] <HoneyDrops> Apparently CTurt has also announced a kernel-based exploit to jailbreak PS4s.  Don't yet have a link to that.
[23:13:22] <Sour_Sweet> The IoT is a horrible idea. I already see websites being taken down by literal toasters.
[23:14:21] <Phase> HoneyDrops, i mean more along the lines of surely it's using the freebsd kernel abi?
[23:14:42] <HoneyDrops> The IoT is a bad idea because most people can barely operate a regular toaster, tv, refrigerator, lightbulb.
[23:14:56] <Sour_Sweet> God you can cause so much damage with a toasters. Some basic consumer models will start catching fire when you use them often enough directly in a row
[23:16:08] <Phase> oic, they've added syscalls
[23:17:04] <Phase> or not?
[23:17:48] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> for some reason i had a mental image of the toaster from fallout:NV Old World Blues DLC having this conversation

[23:18:25] <Phase> it's a problem that's rapidly getting worse
[23:19:18] <Phase> "I made changes to my network, how do I reconnect my scale, lightbulbs, microwave, fridge and thermostat"
[23:19:41] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> LMAO sad but true
[23:23:14] <Sour_Sweet> "Excuse me sir, do you mind restarting your refrigerator for me?" lol
[23:25:40] <Sour_Sweet> So when I really want to annoy someone: Don't DDoS their favorite IRC channel, DDoS their refrigerator instead. I'd be really pissed off when my beer is warm because the refrigerator decided to hang up.
[23:29:17] <DataByte> hahahahaha
[23:30:42] <DataByte> tech support call: fridge stopped working. i unplug it and plug it back in, it starts up, and then it stops working after 2 to 15 minutes
[23:31:58] <DataByte> solution: the toaster had a firmware glitch and was causing a broadcast storm, taking the fridge off of the network. once the fridge was offline, the thermostat couldn't tell the fridge it was no longer in vacation mode
[23:32:19] <DataByte> xD
[23:32:31] <DataByte> it'll happen, somehow xD
