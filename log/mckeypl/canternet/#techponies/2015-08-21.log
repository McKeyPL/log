[04:24:42] <Starthunder> Not so much for IPv6 though
[04:24:49] <Starthunder> …which is what you wanted to know about, anyway, wasn't it x.x
[04:25:04] <init3> Ipv6 a shit
[04:25:12] <init3> Yeah
[04:26:08] <init3> I got it to the point where my server would assign IPv6 addresses with the correct prefix but I couln't get traffic flowing
[04:26:25] <init3> And I kept fucking my v4 network up so I gave up for the time being. 
[04:26:42] <Starthunder> Was your server (which I'm assuming is being the router+switch) able to use the v6 Internet?
[04:26:50] <init3> Yep
[04:26:56] <Starthunder> Mine can (it can ping Google, at least), but I haven't sorted out the routing
[04:27:13] <init3> THat part wan't really that hard. 
[04:27:20] <Starthunder> ahh, it was for me
[04:27:40] <init3> My ISP has native V6 support so all I had to do was dhcpd -6 or something

[11:05:30] <Obaskyr> Any recommendations on a self-built NAS? How cheap a CPU can I run for 2 HDDs without bottlenecking stuff? Where will the main bottleneck be in this sort of setup, for storing music and films, maybe as a torrentbox as well?
[11:11:08] <Googie> RAID or JBOD ?
[11:11:29] <Googie> It's probably cheaper to buy a NAS than build one at the low end.
[11:12:31] <Obaskyr> But I want expandability and upgradability and all kinds of bilities.
[11:13:14] <Obaskyr> And honestly, I dont know my RAID's from my JBODs
[11:14:43] <Googie> I personally have a HP Microserver NL54 for my NAS, works fine for that sort of stuff, but the price on the Microservers is way up these days
[11:15:03] <Googie> Would you be using Linux or installing Windows ?
[11:16:36] <Obaskyr> I have no idea. I like linux for its CLI, which I have a basic understanding of, but honestly, paying 20 quid for 8.1 pro isnt an issue - what are the pros and cons for my application? 
[11:16:40] <Googie> And roughly what is your budget ?
[11:17:35] <Googie> Mostly just wondering if you were willing to learn/had a working knowledge of Linux. For a NAS Linux (or one of the BSDs) best.
[11:17:41] <Obaskyr> Well I want to start with just two HDDs to give you some idea. So sub-£200
[11:17:43] <Googie> *is probably best
[11:18:18] <Googie> Does that price include the HDDs ?\
[11:18:37] <Obaskyr> I'd also want to use it for periodic backups of my PC.
[11:18:39] <Obaskyr> yes.
[11:19:26] <Obaskyr> I've been thinking about a quad-core sempron on a £30 ITX board, would that cut the mustard?
[11:20:04] <Googie> That'd be fine, as long as the board has enough SATA connectors for expansion. You really don't need much CPU power.
[11:20:54] <Obaskyr> They tend to have two, which would be adequate, I could get a RAID card I suppose for future expansion
[11:21:21] <Obaskyr> Would I need to have the OS and programs on a seperate drive to my NAS drives?
[11:21:57] <Obaskyr> And would a USB3 thumbdrive cut that particular jar of mustard?
[11:22:08] <Googie> Depends on how you want to configure it. It's easier to keep them separate, but Linux doesn't really need a particularly large amount of space.
[11:22:14] <AppleDash> It should
[11:22:15] <Googie> Yeah, that'd be fine
[11:22:20] <Obaskyr> Sweet.
[11:22:41] <Googie> RAID cards are kinda going out of fashion as well. Software RAID works a lot better these days.
[11:22:56] <AppleDash> :(
[11:23:11] <Obaskyr> How else am I to get buttloads of SATA ports on a tiny mobo? :P
[11:23:48] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-l23b6v.internode.on.net)
[11:24:17] <Googie> ITX boards with 6+ SATA ports aren't that uncommon.
[11:25:27] <Obaskyr> Cheap ones are.
[11:26:49] <Obaskyr> But a good point nonetheless
[11:27:00] <AppleDash> RAID cards are exoensive too
[11:28:12] <Obaskyr> Aye, they are.
[11:31:11] <Obaskyr> How much memory would you reccomend?
[11:31:37] <Googie> 1-2GB
[11:32:08] <Googie> That'll be more than enough.
[11:32:40] <Obaskyr> hmmkay, I thought that at least 8 wuld be good for a home server
[11:33:36] <Googie> Stuff uses a lot less ram than you'd expect.
[11:34:57] <Obaskyr> I've found a nice board for 65 squids, a Gigabyte GA-J1900N-D3V, it has dual LAN and M-PCIe, the latter of which I could nstall an SSD into, given that that format kindda flopped and prices ave followed suit.
[11:35:49] <Obaskyr> I'm off now, thanks for all the help.
[11:35:56] <Googie> It's worth taking a look at cases too, there's a bunch of NAS oriented cases now which have nice front bays and the like
[11:35:58] <Googie> No problem.
[11:36:21] <Googie> (As an aside, my NAS VM, which handles torrenting and usenet as well is currently sitting at 800MB used)
[11:37:07] <Googie> (And that's only because a lot of the usenet stuff is a memory hog :V)

[19:00:16] <Stik> i#m trying to install a quake3 server on a linux machine, and i'm having some troubles, anyone fancy helping me?
[19:00:39] <Stik> i think a lot of problems are that it's 32bit and this is a 64bit machine
[19:01:07] <Stik> the installer/unpacker/whateveritis complains about 64bit
[19:01:21] <Stik> internet suggested running it via linux32, which does something i don't really understand
[19:01:22] <Colgate|Bronycan> OS?
[19:01:30] <Stik> but now the installed complains that it can't write to /usr/local/games
[19:01:32] <Stik> debian
[19:01:51] <Colgate|Bronycan> https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO
[19:01:53] <PinkiePieBot> [ Multiarch/HOWTO - Debian Wiki ]
[19:03:33] <Stik> this isn't a package, it's just a binary file
[19:04:09] <Stik> there was a quake3-server package, but as far as i could tell it was just a start-stop script and not an actual packaged app :)
[19:05:39] <Colgate|Bronycan> install the dependencies you need from multilib
[19:05:46] <Colgate|Bronycan> then run it
[19:06:19] <Stik> how do i figure out which dependencies i need?
[19:07:02] <Stik> also back up a step, do you think the "No write permission" error is a symptom of something else, and that'll fix this?
[19:07:24] <Colgate|Bronycan> no
[19:08:12] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:08:17] <Colgate|Bronycan> that's because it doesn't have write permission to /usr/local/games, which makes sense by default that requires root privs :P
[19:08:46] <Stik> i gave it permission to /usr/local/games/quake3
[19:08:54] <Stik> then i tried running it as root too, same thing
[19:08:58] <Stik> it can't even write to my own home dir
[19:09:20] <Stik> outside of the installer binary i can write to stuff fine 
[19:09:47] <Stik> maybe it is time to invest in a windows vm
[19:09:55] <Stik> i seem to run up against linux problems with everything i try to do
[19:10:06] <Stik> its only selling point is that the linux vms are cheap :)
[19:10:13] <Colgate|Bronycan> you are trying to run a proprietary program from like 15 years ago on a modern system
[19:10:17] <Stik> yeah
[19:10:18] <Colgate|Bronycan> I mean...
[19:10:28] <Stik> i have it running perfectly well on my win10 machine :P
[19:10:37] <Stik> just double-clicked it and it works
[19:10:45] <Colgate|Bronycan> linux isn't made to work well with proprietary things ;)
[19:10:51] <Stik> shame :(
[19:11:04] <Colgate|Bronycan> especially old, unmaintained software
[19:11:07] <Stik> nevermind, i shall just run it locally and do some port forwarding
[19:11:15] <Stik> thanks for trying
[19:11:19] <Colgate|Bronycan> I'm sure it works
[19:11:39] <Stik> yeah i guess someone could get it working, but it's not worth the hassle tbh
[19:11:46] <Colgate|Bronycan> do you have any documentation?

[19:12:17] <Stik> i was following that
[19:12:22] <Stik> but i think it's also very out of date
[19:12:35] <Stik> can't see any dates on it
[19:15:41] <Colgate|Bronycan> /shrug, can't see anything from that without looking at the run script
[19:16:13] <Stik> # This script was generated using Makeself 2.0.1
[19:16:32] <Stik> it's a 200-line script with a large block of binary data at the end
[19:16:51] <Stik> i guess it un-compresses a binary and runs that, and it's that binary that's failing to write to anything
[19:17:02] <Colgate|Bronycan> yes, but what's in the script :P
[19:17:25] <Stik> probably the same as any "package" generated using that tool i would imagine
[19:17:42] <Stik> i don't think the script does anything other than unpack the binary and run it
[19:19:28] <Stik> aha there's a --target option which unpacks it to a specific location
[19:19:37] <Stik> and it looks like the contents are the actual q3 files
[19:20:34] <Colgate|Bronycan> probably missing some 32-bit libraries, without documentation saying which ones, you will have to guess :P
[19:20:43] <Stik> ah right
[19:20:49] <Stik> this is a long shot
[19:21:04] <Colgate|Bronycan> there's probably some command you can use to find which lbiraries it is linked to
