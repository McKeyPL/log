[03:21:32] <Starthunder> hmm
[03:22:08] <Starthunder> If you have an array with repeated elements, how do you get each of the distinct permutations?
[03:25:52] <frackster> Starthunder: String[] unique = new HashSet<String>(Arrays.asList(array)).toArray(new String[0]);
[03:28:51] <Starthunder> Efficiently, I mean.
[03:29:05] <Starthunder> Because possibility counts rise quickly.
[03:29:07] <Starthunder> VERY quickly.
[03:29:36] <Starthunder> …
[03:29:43] <Starthunder> frackster, you didn't even READ my question, did you.
[03:29:59] <frackster> I did, that gets distinct array elemtns
[03:30:02] <frackster> elements
[03:30:22] <Starthunder> distinct PERMUTATIONS of the array, not a collection of the distinct ELEMENTS.
[03:30:35] <frackster> what do you mean by permutation?
[03:30:37] <Starthunder> Also, that assumes they're strings. I didn't say they were strings.
[03:30:47] <Starthunder> Orderings?
[03:30:50] <frackster> oh
[03:31:04] <frackster> that's harder :P
[03:31:09] <Starthunder> If you have an array [A, B], then there are two permutations: [A, B] and [B, A]
[03:31:12] <Starthunder> Yes, which is why I asked. :P
[03:31:20] <Starthunder> If you have an array [A, A, B, B]…
[03:32:13] <frackster> it sounds like a good task for a recursive function tho :>
[03:32:18] <Starthunder> Then there are six /distinct/ permutations.
[03:33:21] <frackster> I'm sure you can come up with the code if you think about the algorithm pragmatically
[03:33:52] <Starthunder> What algorithm?
[03:34:15] <frackster> an algorithm to print all permutations
[03:34:20] <frackster> from a given array
[03:34:26] <frackster> recursively
[03:34:37] <Starthunder> I don't want /all/ the permutations, though, just the /unique/ ones.
[03:35:25] <Starthunder> The number of possible permutations of an array is the factorial of the length of the array. And the arrays I'm dealing with are pretty damn big.

After i informed them that it would take me Several hours to download Java, they refered me to another site, which even had a popup saying i might have a problem with my connection. They had me to the test twice on that site, then tried to tell me to plug directly into the modem, 
[05:06:03] <Twilightlicious> and test again, Full well knowing that would disconnect the support chat. After i pointed that out, she told me she would have someone call me in 24 hours to check and see how that went.

[17:47:41] <Unixkitty> Um... me too I think
[17:48:06] <Unixkitty> Is that just Chromium or Google Chrome as well?

[21:59:13] <Twilightlicious> It seems the Emulator isn't included in a System update, but is instead packaged with every game, add 512MB to every download.
[22:00:17] <Twilightlicious> and dispite Nuts n Bolts being Backwards Compatible, it's telling me to go away :P
[22:04:57] <Twilightlicious> ohhh, maybe its not.
[22:17:41] <Twilightlicious> So
[22:18:20] <Twilightlicious> Was going to say something really stupid, but then i realized how stupid it was.
[22:21:42] <Twilightlicious> more like 580MB
[22:21:47] <Twilightlicious> added to every game
[22:22:38] <Twilightlicious> assuming 512MB 360 system image, 20~MB For Emulator, and the rest ??? 360 Boot image? who knows.
