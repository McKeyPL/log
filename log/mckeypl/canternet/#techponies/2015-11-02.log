[00:00:59] <RazorSharpFang> I'm having hardware problems.
[00:01:15] <RazorSharpFang> I ... can't remove the graphics card.
[00:01:40] <RazorSharpFang> I feel really stupid right now. It's just not coming out.
[00:01:51] <RazorSharpFang> I can't see any screws that I haven't unscrewed.
[00:02:07] <Seoson> There is useally one screw to hold it in it's slot
[00:02:26] <RazorSharpFang> I undid the screw at the back of the case, the one right next to the DVI/VGA/etc ports.
[00:02:32] <RazorSharpFang> But that's the only one I could see
[00:02:40] <Seoson> and a lever to pop it out
[00:02:45] <RazorSharpFang> There's this tiny black thing that I think is holding it in place.
[00:02:50] <RazorSharpFang> But I can't reach it.
[00:02:52] <Colgate> yeah, there's a lever by the port
[00:02:56] <RazorSharpFang> The heatsink is in the way.
[00:03:16] <RazorSharpFang> The heatsink of the graphics card, not the CPU.
[00:03:24] <RazorSharpFang> It's just really big.
[00:03:55] <Seoson> The lever is located on the not port facing end of the PCIe slot
[00:04:30] <Seoson> You can reach it from the backplate (not the side where the heatsink is)
[00:05:02] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, the heatsink sticks out really far that way.
[00:05:05] <RazorSharpFang> I can't reach it. ;-;
[00:05:34] <Seoson> Screw driver?
[00:05:56] <RazorSharpFang> Only ones I have are magnetized.
[00:06:04] <RazorSharpFang> Magnets + computer ....
[00:06:17] <Seoson> Shouldn't matter
[00:06:18] <RazorSharpFang> Capacitors and transistors are rather frail things.
[00:06:23] <Colgate> eh, should be fine
[00:06:32] <Seoson> I use them as well
[00:06:37] <Colgate> I use my magnetized ones all the time, never had issues
[00:06:56] <Seoson> You don't need rub them against transistors :P
[00:07:32] <Seoson> Just make sure everything is powered down and you're/have been grounded.
[00:08:30] <RazorSharpFang> I ground myself by touching the case, right?
[00:09:00] <Seoson> We have power outlets with an exposed ground in the EU
[00:09:53] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not sure how to press this level with the screwdriver. It's not responding.
[00:10:26] <RazorSharpFang> The left side is stuck (the one with the black lever) with the right side out completely (port-facing side)
[00:12:09] <Moonlightning> Okay, uh
[00:12:14] <RazorSharpFang> I'll upload a photo.
[00:12:16] <Moonlightning> What order should my CSS selectors be in >.>
[00:12:50] <Seoson> You have to identify what kind lever you have (MB model number or by looking at another PCI slot)
[00:13:02] <Seoson> You should be able to get it eventually ;-=

[00:18:31] <RazorSharpFang> Ugh, the GCard is so big.
[00:18:43] <RazorSharpFang> I don't even know what the lever is supposed to look like.
[00:19:14] <Seoson> http://www.abload.de/img/gigaslotwj21.jpg
[00:19:26] <Seoson> Is one possible design
[00:19:48] <HoneyDrops> Unless you have drivers made of rare earth magnets, I wouldn't worry about it.
[00:20:01] <Seoson> Here is another one http://www.computerbase.de/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=208002&d=1289245002

[00:24:35] <Seoson> (It's a horrible website :P)
[00:26:24] <RazorSharpFang> I can feel a piece of mishapen plastic, but the card's not coming loose no matter how I press it.
[00:26:35] <Seoson> http://www.tbfcomputing.com/ebaypicture/8.6.12ps100_1143.jpg
[00:26:40] <RazorSharpFang> (UI can't actually see it)
[00:27:03] <RazorSharpFang> How do I work that?
[00:27:40] <Seoson> See that plastic lever on the "down facing" side at the end of the port? I guess by pulling it
[00:28:56] <Seoson> You might need to push the card back in before it can be unlocked. (Port facing side maybe needs to be put out last)
[00:29:02] <RazorSharpFang> Ah
[00:29:10] <Seoson> Got it?
[00:30:04] <RazorSharpFang> ?! It feels like it's been cut to make room for the graphics card
[00:30:26] <RazorSharpFang> as in, it's sharp and I just cut myself
[00:32:38] <init7> Don't give your motherboard the taste for human blood!
[00:32:39] <RazorSharpFang> Still not coming out
[00:32:44] *** init7 is now known as init3
[00:34:11] <RazorSharpFang> I'm pretty sure the lever's been severed to make room for the GPU.
[00:34:18] <Seoson> There is a sharper image of a similar model. Maybe it a rotating design (meaning the handle goes towards the MB). I never had one of those and it's difficult to tell remotely
[00:34:38] <RazorSharpFang> This GPU is just stupidly big.
[00:34:52] <RazorSharpFang> Nvidia GeForce 8500 GT
[00:35:08] <RazorSharpFang> But it's got GigaByte written on it. : /
[00:35:22] <Seoson> You can apply some force. Only make sure not to "bend" against the PCI slot.
[00:35:50] <RazorSharpFang> I can't push any harder, though.
[00:36:02] <RazorSharpFang> My hands aren't callous, they're too mushy.
[00:36:15] <Seoson> GigaByte provides the cooler and (maybe) also the chip layout. The actual GPU is by nvidia
[00:36:51] <RazorSharpFang> Cooler, the cooler is just a giant slab of metal that's in the way.
[00:37:07] <RazorSharpFang> The GPU is literally covered by this bronze-looking metal slab.
[00:37:24] <RazorSharpFang> Which is totally in the way.
[00:38:47] <RazorSharpFang> I'm providing enough force to lift the case, but it's still not budging.
[00:40:05] <RazorSharpFang> I don't know what to do. ;-;
[00:41:14] <RazorSharpFang> Are you sure I'd need to press down (towards the motherboard) on that?
[00:44:27] <RazorSharpFang> IT'S OUT!

[00:47:30] * RazorSharpFang mops up blood
[00:48:33] <Seoson> Nice. And what did you need to do in the end?
[00:48:41] <Seoson> Pull/Push?
[00:49:24] <Seoson> From the looks of it I'd say push down (to the bottom of case)
[00:49:39] <RazorSharpFang> I think I had to do the opposte. Push up ... ?
[00:49:52] <RazorSharpFang> When it finally gave, I cut my hand again. >: /
[00:50:05] <RazorSharpFang> Man, computer science is brutal.
[00:51:24] <RazorSharpFang> So, if I've got linux (ubuntu) installed on there, will the Graphics card work out of the box, or will I need to resinstall?
[00:52:17] <RazorSharpFang> "System problem detected" - ah, Ubuntu.
[00:54:07] *** GigaWork is now known as Gigabit
[00:54:46] <RazorSharpFang> Looks like this is an NVidia GT215 or something.
[00:55:20] <RazorSharpFang> Is that better than the Nvidia GeForce 8500 GT?
[00:55:27] <Seoson> There are built in drivers for some nvidia cards. I dunno if your model is supported, but I'd guess it is.
[00:56:06] <Seoson> It's newer than the GT215. You'd need to look at benchmark numbers
[00:56:53] <Seoson> I know that there was some rebranding in the 200's or 300's, but I can't recall the exact details
[00:57:39] <RazorSharpFang> Well, the one I replaced  (Geforce 8500 GT) has VGA, DVI and 9-pin S-video, whereas the GT215 has VGA, DVI and HDMI. That probably says a bit, imo.

[00:59:20] <PinkiePieBot> [ PassMark - Video Card Performance Comparison ]
[00:59:23] <RazorSharpFang> I mean, HDMI is better than 9-pin S-video, right?
[01:00:23] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, yeah. The replacement one looks better.
[01:00:35] <RazorSharpFang> Now I wish I had a HDMI-capable monitor.
[01:00:45] * RazorSharpFang looks at his 1280x1024 ViewSonic monitor.
[01:00:54] <RazorSharpFang> If only.
[01:01:43] <Seoson> It's actually surprisingly much better than I thought, but keep in mind that it's not the exact same model you have and the scores are quite low non the less (by today's standard).
[01:02:12] <Seoson> If your monitor supports DVI than there are cheap adapters
[01:03:06] <Seoson> (since DVI can carry both digital and analog signals)
[01:04:17] <Seoson> (depending on the DVI standard of cause)
[01:08:52] <Seoson> Anyone familiar with bridging an additional IP to an LXC instance? My linux networking utils knowledge is fairly limited and my setup doesn't work at all :D
[01:09:27] <Moonlightning> LXC?
[01:09:45] <Seoson> Linux Container
[01:10:13] <Seoson> It's used in docker for example if you know that
[01:10:49] <Seoson> My problem however is before evening coming to that point. Restarting my network will put the server offline
[01:11:06] <Seoson> (on the host machine)
[01:15:28] <Phase4> they've replaced lxc with libcontainer in docker
[01:16:11] <Seoson> I wasn't aware :P I don't use docker myself.
[01:16:36] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, this is weird.
[01:16:48] <RazorSharpFang> I've got 2 monitors, but I can't move the cursor between them.
[01:17:50] <Seoson> On windows check the monitor placement
[01:17:57] <johnsey> Seoson: debian based? set up the bridge in /etc/network/interfaces, assign in container config as lxc.network.link
[01:19:06] <Seoson> johnsey: Indeed. But putting the changes in /etc/network/interfaces and restarting will cause my server to be unreachable and I'm looking for someone to take a look at the interfaces ;-)
[01:19:27] <RazorSharpFang> Seoson: This is Ubuntu. The monitors are right next to eachother. When the cursor is on the boundary, I can see it in both monitors.
[01:19:38] <RazorSharpFang> But I still cannot move it between them.
[01:20:31] <RazorSharpFang> I'm gonna restart and see if that helps.
[01:20:38] * RazorSharpFang is clearly a windows guy
[01:21:23] <johnsey> Seoson: i can take a quick look if you paste it somewhere, need to leave in a moment though

[03:48:32] <Gigabit> Um.. Okay, hi I'm drunk xD
[03:49:04] <Compu> i dont mind random people, my channel is a public channel and anyone is welcome to join as long as u read the rules and follow them
[03:50:56] <Moonlightning> ^ i.e. the definition of a public channel

[08:24:22] <Moonlightning> drive pooling? Is that like JBOD?
[08:24:30] <Googie> What implementation ?
[08:24:47] <Lapsus> I'm not as far as implementation yet, just looking into it
[08:25:36] <Lapsus> Moonlightning: close to jbod but each individual disk can also be independently used by another computer to get whatever portion of the array it has
[08:26:05] <Lapsus> works at the file level by just keeping at least 2 copies of everything in the array across however many disks
[08:26:07] <Moonlightning> Lapsus: wouldn't that mean it would have to be at the file level?
[08:26:18] <Moonlightning> Ahhh. So like what btrfs does.
[08:26:21] <Lapsus> so you can add or remove disks at will and they don't all need to be the same size

[08:29:16] <Moonlightning> yes, very bad idea :V
[08:30:12] <Lapsus> The ability to just drop in another drive and hit go and having it just work would be fucking amazing, basically
[08:30:19] * Googie wishes that btrfs was more stable.
[08:30:31] * Moonlightning uses btrfs for the root filesystem of his secondary laptop.
[08:30:35] <Googie> It can do that. Even the ability to remove drives without issues.
[08:30:37] <Lapsus> as opposed to having to rebuild an entire array, and needing a place to put ALL the data from it in the meantime
[08:30:45] * Moonlightning is also planning to switch the root filesystem of his backup|netbox to btrfs
[08:30:51] <Googie> But officially not fully stable for specific forms of RAID.
[08:33:04] <Lapsus> serious talk, btrfs sounds like it might be able to do what I want, but if something really fucks up I still really don't want to lose data
[08:33:29] <Lapsus> I lost like 3tb of photos and videos and movies and tv and I don't want it to happen again

[08:34:39] *** Quits: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21) (Quit: quit)
[08:34:44] <Lapsus> is btrfs stable enough to depend on like that?
[08:35:15] <Lapsus> if I'm running a raid6 equivalent array, will it survive two failures and the rebuild from that?
[08:35:46] <Lapsus> I also really would like the ability to grow/shrink arrays without having to reinitialize the fucker
[08:41:09] <Googie> It's... difficult to really say. In theory the answer is "Have a backup/RAID is not a backup"
[08:41:29] <Moonlightning> #SharingIsCaring
[08:42:20] <Lapsus> well, the primary store would be the raid/unraid on the nas, backup would be a local store of important stuff like the photos and videos, with a possible remote sync to the cloud
[08:43:25] <Lapsus> I know raid isn't a backup, but I want a fairly fault-tolerant setup for main use and storing backups of the irreplaceable shit like photos from trips
[08:44:01] <Lapsus> all the tv and movies are replaceable, but it would be nice to store them on a shared space etc
[08:44:43] <Lapsus> but if I'm building an array to store backups and centralize the 4-5 tb of media, I want it not to go poof without a fight
[08:45:21] <Moonlightning> name the box Twilight Sparkle
[08:45:44] <Lapsus> the advantage of a drive pool system being that in addition to the main drives being purchased for the array, we can throw in all few of the random 1 and 2tb drives that are laying around too

[08:46:17] <Googie> It's annoying in that there's not really a perfect solution.
[08:47:04] <Lapsus> well, I know that much, but an unraid like drive pooling seems to be a good flexible option, even if the whole array comes out at half size
[08:47:49] <Lapsus> it also means I don't need to invest in a raid controller that can handle raid60 or whatever
[08:48:08] <Colgate> raid 60? how many drives are you running?
[08:48:22] <Googie> No reason to use a hardware RAID controller these days anyway.
[08:48:39] <Lapsus> I want to expand a bunch and sometimes I luck out and get good enclosures
[08:48:50] <Colgate> I would say there are valid reasons for hardware raid
[08:48:53] <Lapsus> I had to sell off a 24 drive unit a while ago for instance
[08:51:48] <Googie> A lot rarer than it used to be though.
[08:52:07] <Googie> Honestly though, I spent a while looking at this a few months ago before building my array
[08:52:24] <Googie> My eventual conclusion was to use ZFS for now and wait for BTRFS to stabilize.
[08:53:18] * Googie finds it funny how many people have issues because the drives are fine, but the $600 RAID card died, and all the data is in a proprietary format :V
[08:53:41] <Colgate> that's a big downside of hardware raid

[16:48:26] <Stik> dunno why you'd want to specify that

[16:49:01] <Stik> it's not a hint either, it's telling it waht to do, if it's not there it fails outright
[16:49:07] <Stik> maybe that's the intention?
