[07:39:23] <Gigawork> I think I found it but it wont boot
[07:39:43] <init3> balls
[07:39:57] <Moonlightning> So you can do multiple address families for one interface, yeah?
[07:40:14] <Gigawork> if I had another lga 775 board I would swap it out but I dont
[07:40:16] <init3> You mean v4 and v6?
[07:40:22] <init3> If so, yes
[07:40:45] <Gigawork> man I rigged this up and everything too :(

[07:42:03] *** Joins: Nick (nobody@Pony-rgmjhl.res.rr.com)
[07:42:21] <Gigawork> yep, nothing works
[07:42:53] <init3> Wait. 775? This isn't out of an optiplex 280 is it?
[07:43:07] <init3> Or were those 478s..
[07:43:19] <init3> Yeah, 775 is too new
[07:43:43] <Moonlightning> https://gist.github.com/BlacklightShining/23114aea09159e92591a  # This looks wrong.
[07:43:43] <PinkiePieBot> [ --etc--network--interfaces · GitHub ]
[07:44:25] <Moonlightning> # Very wrong.
[07:45:01] <init3> Umm, I'm not positive but I think you just assign the addresses to br0. not br0 and br0:0. Those are two different logical interfaces I think. 
[07:45:26] <Moonlightning> Yeah, but I need that for multiple v4 addresses in different subnets, right?
[07:46:05] <Moonlightning> br0 will get the public address from DHCP; br0:0 will have a static site-local address
[07:46:13] <init3> I see
[07:46:20] <Moonlightning> That's how it works, right?
[07:46:55] <init3> DHCP and static on the same interface seems odd to me but I think that sounds reasonable. Let me ponder it for a moment. 
[07:48:49] <HoneyDrops|Half> https://fccid.io/pdf.php?id=2589270  mmmm
[07:50:16] <Moonlightning> It definitely seems odd
[07:50:17] <Gigawork> Another question.. is anyone a notary?
[07:50:20] <init3> Wait, you might need to ensure the DHCP transaction has completed first...
[07:50:28] <Moonlightning> Why? o.o
[07:50:51] <HoneyDrops|Half> Notary public?
[07:50:58] <Gigawork> wait, nevermind. What I need won't work unless I mail ya the document x.x
[07:51:06] <init3> Let me see, but I'm not sure if the DHCP server might send an ARP

[07:51:35] <Gigawork> Need to get to the college and fill out a form in front of them or have it nortarized. 
[07:51:57] <init3> Never mind
[07:52:21] <Moonlightning> Isn't ARP just layer-two? 6_9
[07:52:39] <init3> Well what do you end up with if you let networking start with that ifconfig and connectivity wise?
[07:52:52] <init3> Yeah, but so is your weird bridging. 
[07:53:50] * init3 is a very "fuck it and try" type pone

[07:55:08] <init3> Is set up a screen session

[08:10:27] <Moonlightning> Not that that would've done a whole lot, either.
[08:10:32] <init3> But that's probably an NSA honeypot
[08:10:53] <init3> Well you can give them the password to the outer volume
[08:11:09] <init3> There is supposedly no way to know if there is actually a hidden volume there. 
[08:11:38] <init3> Because TC fills the whole volume with noise.
[08:11:59] <Moonlightning> I should really look into that
[08:12:13] <init3> But TC is a dead project now iirc
[08:12:34] <Moonlightning> then again…my mane laptop is OS X :(
[08:13:31] <init3> Truecrypt was availible for mac too
[08:13:44] <init3> We aren't talking FDE though with what I was talking about

[08:14:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> That was thoughtful of them... most (all?) of the test pads are labeled :D
[08:16:26] <init3> Yeah. TC isn't considered secure anymore anyway. 
[08:16:30] <init3> Not sure why
[08:17:59] <HoneyDrops|Half> The circumstances of the project ending look very close to a canary.
[08:18:27] <init3> I've heard that
[08:20:12] <init3> Apparently its been fully audited/
[08:20:28] <init3> But I guess the licence forbids forkig
[08:23:31] * HoneyDrops|Half feels secure enough with dm-crypt anyway.
[08:25:14] <Moonlightning> I feel like maintaining the fake stuff would be such a chore though
[08:25:24] <Moonlightning> And there would be absolutely no sign of the more advanced things
[08:25:30] <Moonlightning> which is basically public knowledge
[08:25:44] <Moonlightning> I mean, everyone knows I'm not an average user. That wouldn't work at all.
[08:26:04] <init3> You mean the hidden volume thing?
[08:26:07] <Moonlightning> yeah.
[08:27:32] <init3> Well personally I'd put private information on the outer volume, but super secret stuff on the inner. You need to make anyone think they are getting something at least a little juicy if the torture or subpeona thing is what worries you. 
[08:28:06] <init3> I don't know what you encrypt speciffically nor do I need to. Not sure if that makes any sense with your setup.
[08:28:33] <init3> Like,honestly I stored porn on my outer volume
[08:28:40] <init3> Seems private
[08:28:57] <init3> But really isn't anything I really care if people have access to.
[08:29:30] <init3> An average user isn't going to use something like TC at all
[08:30:42] <Moonlightning> I mean, I wouldn't want them to get anything. :I
[08:31:31] <Moonlightning> Grrrrr
[08:31:48] <Moonlightning> `dhclient`s ponypage gives -n as a sort of dryrun option
[08:31:59] <Moonlightning> But when I use it, dhclient gives me a usage message :I
[08:33:08] <init3> I mean, I'm just saying if you were really worried about torture or subpeona you'd be forced to give up /something/. Might as well not be the whole thing. 
[08:33:25] <Moonlightning> Yeah
[08:35:16] <init3> I'm not all that paranoid about my files to be honest. I don't use encryption like at all save for hardware FDE on my laptop, because it leaves my apartment and a tiny TC volume holding my tax documents. 
[08:36:11] * Moonlightning laughs.
[08:36:12] <init3> I know someone determined enough can break the simple encryption the laptop's BIOS provides but I don't really care.

[08:39:02] <init3> Well I don't know
[08:39:35] <init3> But I think if I was using a tunnel it'd be a lot different  but maybe it's the same.
[08:40:50] <init3> I might try but I've been sorta cramming books for random interviews outside of my expertise. I can figure how to do anything on a server with google. I just gotta BS the interview

[09:30:10] <Moonlightning> …`ip tunnel` accepts 'any' for the address? O.o
[09:31:03] <ShivalWolf> for local
[09:31:05] <ShivalWolf> yeah i think it does
[09:31:16] <ShivalWolf> but its best to fix it
[09:31:36] <ShivalWolf> thign is if you do it on a router or system your using as a router then you can bind it to say eth0 and it will auto nat out
[09:32:04] <Moonlightning> Best to fix it? As in…actually pass the address in?
[09:32:09] *** Quits: Gladiolus (SRQ@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:32:27] <Moonlightning> But…it seems like `any` is exactly what I want. It would pull the v4 address from the relevant interface, yeah?
[09:33:06] <Moonlightning> Also: why `sit`?
[09:34:50] <ShivalWolf> sit is the name of the ipv6 to 4 interface
[09:35:17] <ShivalWolf> SIT stands for Simple Internet Transition. Its main purpose is to interconnect isolated IPv6 networks, located in global IPv4 Internet. SIT works like IPIP. It can work with FreeBSD and cisco IOS. Kernel module is 'ipv6'. Once loaded, ipv6 module can't be unloaded. You can get your own IPv6 prefix and a SIT tunnel from a tunnel broker. The following example demonstrates configuration of SIT tunnel w
[09:35:23] <ShivalWolf> ith three IPv6 routes.
[09:35:57] <Moonlightning> That doesn't sound like it fits in with 6to4 though 6_9
[09:36:19] <ShivalWolf> it fits exactly in 6 to 4
[09:40:21] <Moonlightning> Doesn't 6to4 just tunnel v6 packets to 192.88.99.1?
[09:41:10] *** CyberJacob is now known as zz_CyberJacob
[09:41:25] *** Joins: Gladiolus (SRQ@the.truth.is.out.there)
[09:41:43] <ShivalWolf> 6to4 is a tunnel between you and a dual stack system that has v6 and v4 public addresses
[09:42:04] <ShivalWolf> so he for example provides a v4 termination point and has v6 
[09:42:12] <Moonlightning> I'm not using a tunnel broker, though.

[09:42:21] <RainbowBlitz> Well then..
[09:42:24] <ShivalWolf> you ahve to if you want 6to4
[09:43:01] <Moonlightning> Apparently not. I've never registered with a tunnel broker and I had v6 when my network was under an Apple box
[09:43:36] <Moonlightning> I'm pretty sure it just used 6to4|6rd. According to my ISP's website, that's all that's available, anyway.
[09:43:38] <ShivalWolf> in that case you want a ipv6 nat
[09:43:50] <Moonlightning> I'm pretty sure I don't want NAT :I
[09:44:07] <ShivalWolf> 6to4 requires a tunnel broker of some form
[09:44:13] <ShivalWolf> someone has to be your 4v endpoint
[09:44:38] <Moonlightning> I thought that was what 192.88.99.1 was for.
[09:46:50] <Moonlightning> Are there…not 192.88.99.1 relay servers run for the general public? Is that not a thing?
[09:47:21] <ShivalWolf> thats the anycast address for 6to4 from memory your provider has to support it
[09:47:37] <Moonlightning> My provider does support it.
[09:47:44] <ShivalWolf> but that would also require you to have allocated ipv6 space
[09:47:51] <Moonlightning> No it doesn't?
[09:48:10] <Moonlightning> I have a global v4 address. Just stick that after the 2002: and you're golden
[09:48:30] <ShivalWolf> hmmm not from my undersatnding
[09:48:37] <ShivalWolf> but if you think so
[09:48:40] <Moonlightning> No, that's what 2002::/16 is for
[09:48:50] <ShivalWolf> i didnt htink that was globably routable
[09:48:53] <Moonlightning> And I had a /48 under 2002::/16 before

[09:50:08] <ShivalWolf> it coudl be
[09:51:09] <ShivalWolf> you coudl set it up in your interfaces file once
[09:51:16] <ShivalWolf> and then use IP to check what type of interfact it is
[09:51:48] <Moonlightning> Mmm, I guess I could, yeah.

[12:12:36] <LegionRed> Well... the last update of 39 did... the July vers 39 version has broken buttons and some UI issues. 
[12:17:47] <Seoson> 39 worked fine for me until this morning when 40 poped up. Even after the update finished the browser was still broken. (Windows 10 here)

[19:57:04] <Colgate> how can you make powershell NOT cut off data that is too long to be displayed on a single line?
[19:58:31] <Colgate> if the line is >80 characters it just cuts off, which is... not very ideal
[19:58:41] <Colgate> er, 120 chars
[20:07:10] <Moonlightning> Seoson: you're aware of the privacy issues in Windows 10, yes?
[20:08:07] <Colgate> alright, apparently I have to pipe it to Out-String
[20:09:21] <Seoson> Indeed. I've set opt out flags both via the UI and gpedit and blocked a few things via the routing table of my router. There is not much left they can get ^^
[20:09:49] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Pony-osmcfg.co.comcast.net)
[20:10:36] <Moonlightning> I'd recommend using default-deny for Windows 10, in case they use adresses not under any of their domains, or a not-well-known domain or something
[20:15:09] <Seoson> It's connecting to the akamai CDN for example which I cannot block for obvious reasons. However appears to be static content only.
[20:18:31] <HoneyDrops|Half> Wow, so I ended up with this (effectively) free Android tablet... holy crap the ads.
[20:19:34] <Colgate> adblocker!
[20:20:15] <Seoson> In that case I'd probably install an alternative ROM ^^
[20:20:31] <Seoson> or root it and remove the bloatware
[20:21:08] <HoneyDrops|Half> Working on that, this is one of those <100$ rockchip tablets.
[20:21:30] <Moonlightning> There's gotta be a better way to get the v4 address of an interface than invoking `ip` or `ifconfig` and parsing output :I
[20:22:52] <HoneyDrops|Half> You maybe can pull it right from /proc or /sys?  Still sed/awk are standard tools, it's the unix way.
[20:23:21] <Seoson> Or look in the source code of ifconfig.
[20:24:04] <Moonlightning> `hostname -I` seems better. I guess I could use that…
[20:24:11] <Moonlightning> /proc/net doesn't seem to have it
[20:24:32] * Moonlightning pokes around in /sys
[20:25:19] <Moonlightning> Don't see anything related in here.
[20:26:27] <Moonlightning> There's a /proc/net/if_inet6, which seems to be EXACTLY what I want…except it's v6 only :I
[20:27:12] <Moonlightning> Guess I'll just use the first global v4 address from `hostname --all-ip-addresses`
[20:30:33] <Moonlightning> I need a bit-concatentation operator >.>
[20:32:29] <Moonlightning> 0x2002 +| IPv4Address('192.0.2.31') +| [0x00] * 10
[20:32:52] <Moonlightning> …yeah, that's also unwieldy

[21:46:11] <Moonlightning> what'm I missing? x.x
[21:47:41] <Colgate> probably a )
[21:48:44] <Moonlightning> But all my parentheses match.
[21:51:14] <Moonlightning> …wait
[21:51:31] <Moonlightning> Should that parenthesis after the heredoc be /before/ it instead?
[21:51:42] <Moonlightning> if network=$(python3 - <<EOF)  # like this?
[21:52:44] <Moonlightning> nope…if I do that, I get /end of file unexpected (expecting "then")/

[23:35:09] <RainbowHacks> that was my shift here last shift
[23:35:12] <RainbowHacks> except 1600 - 0300

[23:38:07] <RainbowHacks> o.o;;
[23:38:09] <HoneyDrops|Half> Seoson: not sure, I did determine it is using uboot.  I've not been able to find a datasheet on the chipset so I haven't yet located UART pins.
