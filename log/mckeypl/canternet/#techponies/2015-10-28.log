[01:10:09] <Seoson> HoneyDrops: Show me a good alternative. Blockchain domains suck and the blockchain itself is a bad idea. .onion domains are based on a key that might be broken or compromised and is useless than (not to mention how ugly they are).
[01:10:28] *** Joins: sleumas2000_ (uid91753@my.little.karaoke)
[01:13:01] <Seoson> At least domain root zones are somewhat distributed. The level above that, the ICANN, is the greater problem IMHO
[01:13:21] <HoneyDrops> Just do like we do now, but have multiple domain systems.  The user decides what service to use, and thus how domains resolve.
[01:13:55] <HoneyDrops> apony.com will just resolve differently, depending on what DNS service you decide to use.
[01:14:08] <Seoson> That sounds like a nightmare
[01:14:21] <Seoson> For both security and useability
[01:14:38] <HoneyDrops> domain names should just be an alias for an IP
[01:15:15] <HoneyDrops> The entire point to for human readability, aside from that there is no need for them.
[01:16:22] <Seoson> If all companies have IPs like 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 like Google does than sure you don't need DNS :P
[01:16:56] <Seoson> I even use hostnames for my local network. I never use IPs if I can avoid it somehow
[01:17:14] <HoneyDrops> QR code the IP, share that?  Having a human manually type in a URI is something to avoid, as much as possible.
[01:17:48] <HoneyDrops> Users can set their own aliases (which is basically what doing hostnames on a lan does)
[01:18:18] <Seoson> That doesn't sound like anything I'd prefer over what we use now
[01:18:42] <Seoson> Managing a remote destination hostname list would be a pain
[01:18:58] <Seoson> Having them managed by a company would effectively mean DNS again
[01:20:59] <Seoson> The system we have now isn't nice, but it works quite well at least. With DNSSEC it finally gets somewhat secure.

[06:53:20] <Fallfeathers> My Raspberry Pi 2 B arrived yesterday. I've already installed OpenELEC on an mSD and booted from it. Went out to bought a wireless adapter to use with it but apparently OpenELEC only supports a small range of adapters and since the OS is read-only, you can't install new drivers. I'm dumb.

[16:56:10] <Seoson> Yep. I pretty sure you could do the same with chached images.
[16:57:27] <Colgate> probably, not much you can do about it short of either 1. not using js, or 2. making the browser always claim a picture is loaded when it isn't
[16:59:48] <Seoson> I wrote a PoC a few years ago that looked at the computed stylesheets of links (pseudo class :visited) to determine if a user had visited an URL. That was by far more dangerous.

[17:06:00] <Seoson> Timing attacks remain an interesting vector non the less. With fiber getting more common I expect a few flaws poping up in auth modules failing to use slow equal.
[17:10:40] <Colgate> a slow equal?
[17:12:05] <Seoson> As in compare each character of an authentication key even if one of the frist characters is already different to prevent timing attacks
[17:13:02] <Seoson> It has been shown that it works in theory even over regular cables, but that would require an awful lot of attempts
[17:14:23] <Seoson> Also I don't think it has been reproduced outside of lab like scenarios yet, but I would need to look that up.
[17:14:48] <Colgate> you mean compare each letter in a hash, even if the first one was not equal?
[17:15:45] <Seoson> Yes. Not necessarily a hash though. Any non hashed string (API keys) would do it as well.
[17:16:03] <Seoson> Since hashs have a limited use when salted correctly
[17:16:26] <Colgate> true, since in this case, you wouldn't know the salt

[17:21:16] <Seoson> (Not to mention the problem of generating hashes with a predictable value. Those kind of timing attacks are useless for any reasonable secure hash^^)
[17:22:34] <Seoson> hashs* reasonably*
[17:23:08] <Colgate> it wouldn't be for that, it would be used for determining which hash they used on the backend based on length
[17:23:33] <Colgate> and if you had a complete hash, you could attempt to crack it I guess
[17:24:27] <Seoson> Yeah but you cannot get the whole hash unless the user provides the hash himself.
[17:25:43] <Colgate> if you could compare it letter by letter, it would take (number of valid hash chars)^(length of hash) attempts to recover it
[17:25:53] <Colgate> /2
[17:26:49] <Seoson> An attack on an API could look like  if(aaaa == cccc) took 1s  if(caaa == cccc) took 2s, if(ccaa == cccc) took 3s ...
[17:27:00] <Colgate> I'm thinking of services that send hashes, not ones that send passwords, btw
[17:27:28] <Colgate> like lastpass
[17:27:42] <Seoson> Yeah. That's what I've meant by "unless the user provides the hash himself."
[17:28:41] <Seoson> In which case the hash works more a less like a classic password, except for knowing the real value
[17:29:24] <Seoson> Also in such a case you wouldn't need to worry about the salt unless it's a shared secret
[17:30:26] <Seoson> Since the user needs the salt to calculate the hash in the frist place and it must be therefor obtained through some sort of API or static schema
[17:33:19] <Colgate> yeah
[17:33:33] <RazorSharpFang> Is there another security hole in web browser? Is IE affected?

[17:39:41] <RazorSharpFang> eh?
[17:40:38] <Colgate> it is a timing attack against how long it takes to load pages from domains via js
[17:40:50] <Colgate> with https, it will take longer
[17:41:02] <RazorSharpFang> Is that an issue?
[17:41:09] <Seoson> Not really
[17:41:19] <Colgate> it could reveal what sites you have visited
[17:41:30] <RazorSharpFang> Eh? How?
[17:41:41] <Seoson> Website might guess that you visited bankofamaerica.com due to loading times.
[17:41:55] <Colgate> by timing how long it takes to load the image file
[17:42:06] <RazorSharpFang> Why would loading times vary from first visit to second visit?
[17:42:20] <Seoson> Due to the way HSTS works
[17:42:25] <Colgate> because using tls adds an extra round of handhsakes
[17:42:31] <Colgate> and that takes longer
[17:43:27] <Seoson> HSTS will force your browser to make a secure connection. If you didn't visit that site before your browser will use a plain connection
[17:44:23] <RazorSharpFang> How can they use loading times to guess whether you've been there before? My loading times vary seemingly randomly due to the (terrible) quality of my connection.
[17:44:23] <Seoson> Don't worry about it. I'm quite certain the same is possible with cached images for years
[17:44:52] <Seoson> They can measure it the moment you visit the site.

[17:46:48] <RazorSharpFang> Seoson: I can get pings over one second, so....
[17:47:16] <Seoson> As long as the connection remain more or less the same for one second it doesn't matter
[17:47:34] <Seoson> The deltas in time are the important factor, not the actual loading time
[17:47:54] <RazorSharpFang> I suppose that'll depend on what other people in my region are doing.
