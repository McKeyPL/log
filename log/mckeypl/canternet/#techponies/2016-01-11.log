[04:37:56] * Dashie squeaks at Moonlightning

[04:38:45] <Dashie> o.o;
[04:42:08] <Moonlightning> :3
[04:43:02] * HoneyDrops flops.  48 mods updated… now comes checking all of the config changes
[04:43:21] * HoneyDrops blames Moonlightning.
[04:44:00] * Moonlightning still isn't under revision control!
[04:44:41] <HoneyDrops> git add ponies/Moonlightning; git commit -m 'Added Moonlightning'
[04:45:19] * Moonlightning isn't text…probably wouldn't go very well with RCS anyway.
[04:46:41] * JustAberrant has a team comprised of the worlds best researchers, metaphysicists, and accountants build an alternate universe identical to our own except the only version control software ever invented was mercurial and the idea of using anything else is lunacy.. then has HoneyDrops and Moonlightning send there
[04:47:18] <Moonlightning> But how quickly will it diverge?
[04:47:21] <Moonlightning> Remember the butterfly effect.
[04:47:36] <Moonlightning> …actually, by the present point, it already /will/ have diverged.
[04:48:22] <Moonlightning> There'll be some project somewhere that benefited from git in a tiny way or something, leading to a programmer going home a bit earlier and in a better mood…
[04:48:48] <HoneyDrops> I like hg too
[04:48:51] <Kinsley> And now that programmer goes home late and angry and kicks puppies
[04:49:04] <Kinsley> This just in, HoneyDrops supports puppy kicking
[04:49:15] <Moonlightning> Hurting one of the puppies, who becomes just a little bit more timid
[04:49:17] <HoneyDrops> :I
[04:49:21] <JustAberrant> that figures @ liking mercurial
[04:50:09] <JustAberrant> you can say mercurial has it's strong points in the same way you can say not _every_ aspect of being stabbed in the neck with a pairing knife is unpleasant, just the majority of it
[04:50:41] * Moonlightning stabs JustAberrant and then HoneyDrops with a pairing knife.
[04:50:54] <HoneyDrops> I prefer git, and generally use it more often.
[04:51:44] * JustAberrant dislikes git, for a great many reasons, but force myself to use it because it's becoming a thing :(
[04:52:03] <Moonlightning> You mean it wasn't already a thing?
[04:52:15] * Dashie hums
[04:52:18] <JustAberrant> well, a thing one aught to know
[04:52:21] <Dashie> HoneyDrops, where in the world are you?
[04:52:28] <Dashie> cuz there was a double rainbow near me today
[04:52:33] <Dashie> o:
[04:52:41] * HoneyDrops is in NJ
[04:52:44] <Dashie> O_O
[04:52:49] * Dashie squeaks loudly at HoneyDrops 
[04:52:56] * HoneyDrops squeaks at Dashie.
[04:53:00] * Dashie waves from Fillydelphia!
[04:53:16] * HoneyDrops is about an hour from there.
[04:53:19] <Dashie> o:
[04:53:23] * Dashie flails!
[04:54:13] <HoneyDrops> I've not had good experiences with svn or cvs.
[04:54:43] * Dashie pokes HoneyDrops in the face. With a stick! A STICK OF FRIENDSHIP.
[04:54:51] * HoneyDrops mews.
[04:55:10] <Dashie> :3
[04:55:11] * JustAberrant wuvs svn
[04:55:26] <JustAberrant> and I do get that a big part of it is because I've had a lot of experience with it
[04:55:41] <HoneyDrops> I first used hg, then git.
[04:55:58] <JustAberrant> but I still think de-centralization isn't a silver bullet and sometimes having a centralized thing makes a lot of sense
[04:56:22] <JustAberrant> I mean, you can enforce a workflow through policy with git, but svn is geared towards more business-y coding
[04:56:40] <JustAberrant> I also feel like git encourages silo coding 
[04:56:41] <HoneyDrops> I prefer decentralization, this sentiment applies to almost everything.
[04:56:54] <Moonlightning> Revision control sounds like one place where centralization is really legit.
[04:57:37] * Dashie personally thinks git is a massive clusterfuck, but her perspective is organizational, what with being a sysadmin but not a programmer.
[04:57:47] <Moonlightning> o.o
[04:57:49] <JustAberrant> Dashie: as a programmer I agree entirely
[04:57:57] <Dashie> Rather fond of SVN, personally.
[04:58:03] <Moonlightning> well, I'm not deep into git to know all that much about it
[04:58:12] <JustAberrant> SVN is _much_ easier to understand imo, even experienced git users tend to have a series of recipies they use without really knowing what's going on in the guts
[04:58:39] <HoneyDrops> I stick to mostly basic git, but trying to learn more of the advanced functionality.
[04:58:49] * Dashie is certainly aiming to fix her lack of programming knowledge. Not because she wants to be a programmer, but because it's a useful skill and also being able to audit code before you compile it is importan tin infosec
[04:58:53] <Moonlightning> https://xkcd.com/1597/
[04:58:54] <PinkiePieBot> [ xkcd: Git ]
[04:58:56] <JustAberrant> with SVN I feel like if something doesn't work I intuitively know what it was trying to do and why it fails, with git I google for whatever arcane magic will fix it (which again, probably comes down to experience, but this doesn't seem to be uncommon)
[04:59:00] <Googie> For FOSS, git makes a lot of sense because of the easy branching/merging workflow compared to SVN.
[04:59:06] <HoneyDrops> ^
[04:59:19] <JustAberrant> indeed, I get where git makes sense
[04:59:26] <Moonlightning> you can't branch easily in svn? Ewwwww.
[04:59:57] <JustAberrant> you can, and imo the way branching works in svn is better within an organization
[05:00:16] <JustAberrant> because everyone's branches are all in the same place and all accessible, and people tend to check in frequently
[05:00:37] <JustAberrant> vs git where people can clone and work on their own for awhile then just push/pull/whatever it at the end
[05:00:54] <JustAberrant> which again can be enforced through policy, but with svn by nature of how it works it's automatic and intuitive
[05:00:59] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, the good thing about git is anyone can take a repo and run with it wherever they want to go and nothing shows up elsewhere.
[05:01:08] <Moonlightning> Does svn do the whole stateful-checkout thing?
[05:01:30] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: right, which is great for FOSS< but terrible in a business environment
[05:02:35] <JustAberrant> the whole centralization also makes integration with process management tools easier
[05:02:55] <JustAberrant> you can tie a task to a branch, a bunch of branches to a package, etc.. 
[05:03:09] <JustAberrant> having it all in one location makes a lot of that stuff easier
[05:03:25] <Moonlightning> Doesn't github kinda do that with its milestones?
[05:03:44] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|Sleepies
[05:03:45] * Dashie has to agree with JustAberrant here
[05:04:43] <JustAberrant> also doesn't apply to everyone, but in our case our development process is audited, and svn provides part of the objective evidence
[05:07:32] <Googie> github is funny. In a lot of ways it makes git a lot more centralized.
[05:07:56] <Googie> Especially when you consider how the Linux Kernel uses git, the project that it was designed for.
[05:08:30] *** Gigaway is now known as Vega
[05:09:27] * HoneyDrops wants to replace websites with a decentralized p2p networks with a revision system.  Imagine being able to view any/all websites as they were at any point in time!  Imagine them being perpetually hosted!
[05:09:28] <Phase> well the point was to move that centralization out of the tools
[05:11:28] <HoneyDrops> I have mixed feelings regarding github
[05:11:40] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: which is great except that a lot of websites don't present static information but provide a service, and most publishers have entirely no reason to want that
[05:13:34] <Phase> Googie, vs the svn model where you can't even work locally without commit access
[05:13:48] <Phase> not with svn anyway
[05:14:24] <Googie> Wasn't really comparing to SVN there, but just to how git was originally used.
[05:16:22] * Phase immediately assumed svn since it's the thing git is generally compared against in the dist vs cent thing
[05:16:24] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant: complete records of products sold w/ details and pricing would be handy, though yes, old versions would not be useful for actually making a purchase.  Still it can be useful to know a site was selling X at Y price 19 months ago.
[05:16:43] <Phase> old versions would be since you can see if their sale is really a sale
[05:18:01] <HoneyDrops> The old revision would not be useful for /actually placing an order/.  The information better informs the buyer though, yes, so it indirectly helps.
[05:18:37] <JustAberrant> sure, but what's the benefit to the seller?
[05:20:16] <HoneyDrops> Why does there need to be?  If the basic infrastructure provided this functionality, they don't have to choose or do anything.
[05:21:13] <Phase> JustAberrant, re svn: i'm still on the side of those should be policy, not a limitation of the tools turned feature. if you really need centralized storage you can use post-commit hooks or a split working cocpy and network share
[05:21:14] <HoneyDrops> I mean, I guess someone else could just scrape their site and provide a historical record, but it could be baked in to the basic mechanics of websites.
[05:22:06] <HoneyDrops> In fact, I recall that does happen, I know newegg's prices are tracked by 3rd parties and they will provide historical data of prices.
[05:23:42] <JustAberrant> presumably content providers would have to cooperate in some way to make it work, given how dynamic everything is
[05:23:48] <HoneyDrops> How does svn allow someone to pull a copy of the project aside to let them take it wherever?  I suppose you can just copy the entire repo at a given point in time, but I could see wanting to keep a personal fork and still be able to pull in changes.
[05:24:22] <Phase> it pulls a snapshot of the branch you're checking out, keeps that as a 'prestine' copy
[05:24:33] <Phase> your working copy is compared against that
[05:24:34] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: it doesn't, which again I regoanize is a big pro of git in the foss community, in a work environment that's really not a thing one does
[05:24:42] <JustAberrant> * recognize
[05:24:46] <Phase> you don't fetch any history with a svn co
[05:25:06] * HoneyDrops scrunchiemuzzles.
[05:25:16] <Googie> Phase: The Linux kernel uses git via emailing patches, rather than a semi-centralized repo, and merge requests.
[05:25:41] <Phase> there's svnsync and svnrdump for mirroring but you can't commit and then push back afaik
[05:25:57] <Phase> could be implemented, just can't imagine that it is
[05:25:57] <Googie> That's what I was more comparing git with github to.
[05:26:09] <HoneyDrops> How do two people work on something at once?
[05:26:19] <Phase> branches
[05:26:26] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: they each have a branch
[05:26:33] <HoneyDrops> How do you merge things back together?
[05:26:42] <JustAberrant> you merge them and commit them ;p
[05:26:50] <JustAberrant> the history is there, but it's stored on the server
[05:26:54] <Phase> animal sacrifice and the tears of many children
[05:27:07] * Phase has heard horror stories of svn merges, but has never actually tried one
[05:27:19] <JustAberrant> hehe, I've never had much problem with svn merging
[05:27:27] <HoneyDrops> Why not have the history locally, I mean aside from the cost of transferring/storing it?
[05:27:46] <Phase> svn repositories are kinda heafty
[05:28:07] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: uh, because of that? plus why not have it centralized?
[05:28:34] <Phase> you'll generally have one repository containing your entire codebase, from every project, and binary data and so on
[05:29:01] <Phase> individual projects exist as branches, it's all kinda weird and i don't understand the low level stuff as well as i do with git
[05:29:01] <HoneyDrops> Can you branch from arbitrary points in the history?  Say, 'I want to start from the project as it was 3 weeks ago.'
[05:29:09] <Phase> yeah
[05:29:09] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: yes
[05:29:13] <HoneyDrops> Ok
[05:29:26] <Phase> it's at the file level
[05:29:28] <HoneyDrops> but you can just clone and roll forward/back as you like.
[05:29:32] <HoneyDrops> can't*
[05:29:33] <Phase> you can branch any directory from anywhere in history
[05:29:58] <HoneyDrops> It just seems very limiting to me.
[05:30:00] <Moonlightning> You can't roll back and forth?
[05:30:16] <Phase> HoneyDrops, not offlien
[05:30:16] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: it is.. as said before, centralized vs decentralized have their pros and cons.. svn is centralized with the requisite pros and cons of such, git is decentralized with the requisit pros and cons
[05:30:17] <HoneyDrops> (which was my take on a very limited experience with it)
[05:30:18] <Phase> offline'
[05:30:32] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: svn has limitations due to those cons, git has limitations due to its cons
[05:30:37] <Phase> though you could probably hook up svnsync to do it
[05:31:19] <Phase> JustAberrant, can you have separate checkout and commit location in svn?
[05:31:48] <JustAberrant> why would you.. ;p
[05:31:55] <JustAberrant> I'm honestly not even sure
[05:32:12] <Phase> to rig up svnsync for a local copy of history
[05:32:13] <JustAberrant> I mean you can probably make svn do it anyway, but it likes it's ancestry information
[05:32:29] <mniip> fef
[05:32:35] <JustAberrant> you can tell svn that the repo location has moved.. which would be hacky
[05:32:49] <mniip> I sent a patch to nenolod (git format-patch)
[05:32:56] <mniip> he re-committed it as himself
[05:33:07] <mniip> :D :(
[05:33:45] <Moonlightning> seriously?
[05:34:09] <Moonlightning> Maybe you should've published the hash in the bitcoin blockchain first
[05:34:37] <mniip> I pastebinned the patch in a channel
[05:35:00] <mniip> slightly smaller than this one
[05:35:09] <Moonlightning> Logs are trivially forgeable though
[05:35:40] <mniip> oh I'm not calling him out on code stealing
[05:35:48] <mniip> he did credit me in the commit message
[05:36:09] <mniip> and I generally don't mind

[11:03:51] <Dashie> Phase, welcome to unix circa 1980's \o/
[11:03:55] <JustAberrant> hehe
[11:04:08] <JustAberrant> would be interesting to have some kind of auto-dependency discovery system
[11:04:13] <Phase> and people think that open sourcing everything magically solves software distribution
[11:04:26] <Phase> JustAberrant, fedora does, kinda, for binaries
[11:04:30] <Dashie> Phase, you think that's a pain in the ass?
[11:04:30] <Phase> you can depend on the so name
[11:04:44] <Dashie> Try trying to pull a Linux distro together from scratch
[11:04:49] <JustAberrant> (you know, kinda like java has *cough*) but then build systems vary so much it would be really hard to do it except maybe at the binary level based on shared libs
[11:04:54] <Phase> Dashie, oh god i know
[11:04:59] <Dashie> hunting down the tarballs for all the GNU Utils and shit...ugh
[11:05:02] <Phase> i looked into it and just thought
[11:05:05] <Phase> no
[11:05:14] <Dashie> meanwhile I totally thought yes
[11:05:17] <Phase> i want to use my computer at some point
[11:05:19] <Dashie> http://purlinux.org
[11:05:19] <Dashie> x3
[11:05:20] <JustAberrant> hehe, everyone should do the LFS thing once, but yeah, not a practical way to do thingds
[11:05:21] <PinkiePieBot> [ RainbowHackz/Pur-Linux · GitHub ]
[11:05:24] <Phase> xD
[11:05:25] <JustAberrant> * things
[11:05:37] <Dashie> Phase, oh, I don't ever intend to use this as my main OS. I'm a FreeBSD user.
[11:05:57] <JustAberrant> but yeah, flexibility of linux is a strength and a curse :>
[11:05:57] <Dashie> but it's been an interesting hobby thus far and I have every intention of maintaining it as long as there's a userbase for it
[11:06:06] <Phase> freebsd seems to have a better handle on this, but it's also basically one distribution
[11:06:15] <JustAberrant> Phase: pff
[11:06:30] * Dusk waves at Dashie
[11:06:44] <JustAberrant> Phase: my biggest complaint with bsd is how much of a pain in the ass it is to get something working that's not explicitly targetted at BSD
[11:06:54] <JustAberrant> which isn't BSDs fault, but still
[11:07:07] <Dashie> Phase, FreeBSD isn't a distribution at all. it's a single complete OS :3
[11:07:29] <Dashie> JustAberrant, yeah, that does get annoying. I've been working with Pale Moon to get the browser ported properly
[11:07:41] <Phase> Dashie, that's what i mean, if there was only one linux distribution it'd behave kinda similar
[11:08:08] <Dashie> I dunno. I mean, Linux is basically someone taking pieces from different pouzzles and supergluing them together
[11:08:12] <Phase> didn't firefox have a freebsd port?
[11:08:17] <Dashie> whereas FreeBSD has always been developed as a singular OS
[11:08:18] <Dashie> yeah
[11:08:32] <Dashie> but Pale Moon has diverged enough that the tweaks in the Ports tree dont work
[11:08:56] <Dashie> so, that's one of my goals.
[11:09:17] <Phase> Dashie, i do like that about freebsd, release model alone makes it meaningfully different from linux
[11:09:43] <Phase> as opposed to the debian and debian accessories model
[11:09:56] * Dashie nods
[11:10:33] <Phase> jails look nice too
[11:10:43] * JustAberrant spent some time trying to get opendds (which is generally a clusterfuck) working on bsd
[11:10:52] * JustAberrant stopped before he resorted to heroin
[11:11:08] <Phase> worst case you can use the linux compat module
[11:11:16] <Dashie> jails are definitely nice :3
[11:11:28] <Dashie> I love how everyone is fapping furiously to containers these days
[11:11:30] <Dashie> and its like
[11:11:35] <Phase> Dashie, and pkg is aware of them too!
[11:11:36] <Dashie> "we did this shit back inj 1999 bruh"
[11:11:40] <Dashie> yus c:
[11:11:41] <Phase> did it WELL even
[11:11:43] <Dashie> pkgng was a godsend~
[11:11:48] <Dashie> yup.
[11:11:53] <Dashie> Docker came out in...2013?
[11:11:58] <Dashie> HOW many vulns?
[11:12:04] <Dashie> LXC STILL isn't secure
[11:12:08] <Dashie> OpenVZ is out of date
[11:12:09] <Phase> openvz was out before that
[11:12:13] <Dashie> jails are like sup bruh
[11:12:16] <Phase> and yeah, not really maintained
[11:12:19] <Dashie> even Solaris Zones
[11:12:22] <Dashie> SUP BRUH
[11:12:23] <Dashie> x3
[11:12:44] <Phase> user namespace in theory solves the security issues with docker, or you could maybe confine it with selinux
[11:12:50] <Phase> not that those things are actually DONE
[11:12:54] <Phase> but they COULD BE done
[11:13:02] <Phase> in theory
[11:13:13] * Dashie nods
[11:13:46] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[11:14:27] <Phase> Dashie, in the trivial case root within a container can elevate unprivilaged users outside the container if they share a mount namespace, and in dockers case they almost always do
[11:14:38] * Dashie nods
[11:14:40] <Dashie> I'm aware.
[11:14:41] <Phase> share a mount rather, not a namespace
[11:14:48] * Phase assumes jail took care of that
[11:14:51] <Dashie> That's a vuln in all containerization methods
[11:14:57] <Dashie> unfortunately, not really
[11:15:00] <Phase> dang
[11:15:05] <Dashie> it's very possible, but extremely unlikely
[11:15:14] <Dashie> due to how FreeBSD handles permissions, and how jail works
[11:15:19] <Dashie> and with ZFS, much easier to avoid
[11:15:31] <Phase> you guys were really ontop of this zfs thing

[12:37:43] <Dashie> (my lyra plushie fell off my work conmputer monitor onto my thinkpad as I was typing x3 )
[12:38:29] <Googie> ZFS is great, but really inflexible :( Fine for large storage arrays, but not as great for enthusiasts that just want to be able to add storage at any time, and still get decent performance and redundancy.
[12:38:59] <Dashie> Eh, I'd argue that it meets that need too, but it really doesnt matter. everyone can run what they want, whee \o/
[12:41:24] <Googie> I wish :( My unless I'm misunderstanding how ZFS works largely, my only real option to expand the existing storage pool requires adding a whole new vdev, which means at least two drives for redundancy, as opposed to just adding any random mismatched drive that BTRFS is capable of.
[12:42:16] <Googie> The ability to add/remove drives essentially on the fly without having fixed vdevs is nice.
[12:43:49] <Googie> Even stuff like, btrfs allows easily switching from RAID5 to RAID1 (well, the btrfs equivalent) on the fly.
[12:44:04] <Googie> I just wouldn't trust it with that yet :V

[17:58:32] * HoneyDrops uses a tmpfs for /tmp (and symlink a bunch of stuff to that)
[18:07:38] <Moonlightning> Okay yeah, but /var/tmp and a bunch of other little things all around the filesystem
[18:08:13] <Moonlightning> Caches and such
[18:10:28] <HoneyDrops> I have several of those symlink to directories in /tmp (which are created at boot, just after /tmp is mounted)
[18:12:54] <Moonlightning> Mmm, but then you need to have them created at boot. :P
[18:15:11] <HoneyDrops> That's why we have sh scripts?
[18:16:06] <Moonlightning> Sure, you could make another init script, but that wouldn't be as clean.
[18:17:24] <HoneyDrops> As opposed to what?  I dunno how to mount a tmpfs with an arbitrary directory structure.
[18:19:17] <Moonlightning> Just symlinking to a non-volatile volume.
[18:19:32] <Moonlightning> Also, what? They're just filesystems.
[18:19:56] <HoneyDrops> tmpfs is entirely in RAM
[18:20:44] <Moonlightning> Except when it's swap. :P
[18:20:57] * HoneyDrops doesn't use swap on most systems.
[18:21:21] <Moonlightning> I've actually gotten away without swap so far!
[18:21:37] <Moonlightning> Even playing games without it!
[18:21:49] <Moonlightning> Who woulda thought?
[18:22:12] <HoneyDrops> Still, swap partitions would still not be part of the fs, unless you're using a swap file.  Not even sure how that is handled actually…
[18:22:13] <Moonlightning> My swap partition is currently formatted as ext4 and used for Minecraft
[18:23:03] <Moonlightning> The point is, at the top, it's just a filesystem. With…an arbitrary directory structure. :P
[18:24:52] <HoneyDrops> Yes, but aside from a script, I have no idea how you'd create the directory structure.
[18:26:25] <Moonlightning> By hoof!
[18:27:12] <HoneyDrops> I wrote the script by hoof, that is enough. :p

[22:30:25] <Phase> "They are not mutex?"???
[22:30:41] <HoneyDrops> I could sooner figure out how to build a program from source than figure out what platform a random executable is for and design/code a compatibility layer.
[22:31:19] <HoneyDrops> Mutually exclusive - an interest in MechE doesn't preclude a interest or knowledge in computers.
[22:31:46] <Phase> no but sometime people want to use their computers
[22:33:19] <HoneyDrops> And knowing how it works will better able them to use them?  Same as knowing how (at least in a general sense) a car works will mean one can better use one.  If you do not know the underlying system, you cannot accurately predict the system's behavior nor have a basis for determining its limits.
[22:33:21] <Phase> and sometimes they really don't get computers, but still want to browse the web or play a game
[22:33:48] <Phase> HoneyDrops, which is a nice idea but people don't seem to work that way
[22:34:00] *** Joins: WuBzY (androirc@Pony-fpcn3v.bb.dnainternet.fi)
[22:34:15] <Phase> i work that way and it actually causes problems, particularly in math classes where things are taught in random orders
[22:36:47] * Phase is just really salty over having to spend so much time getting things to work nice where it really should take no effort
[22:37:52] <HoneyDrops> I had to look up what you were even trying to install, and it has a mess of deps.  Though that is unavoidable, given what it does.
[22:38:15] <Phase> not to mention qt packages are named by a monkey on fedora
[22:38:41] * HoneyDrops has no fondness for Fedora or Qt.
[22:39:19] * Phase is liking fedora
[22:39:46] <HoneyDrops> The complexity is still there, but it's hidden away.  The cost of that is more pain when you stray from the path.
[22:40:24] <Phase> yes and no, the one thing nothing but gentoo does is let you easily patch packages
[22:40:56] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, control over the build is very useful.
[22:41:46] <HoneyDrops> Also lets you excise parts you don't need.  *grumbles about Java needed ****ing cups*
[22:42:51] <HoneyDrops> But if the user doesn't understand the inner working they will never be able to accurately tell if a limit is a legitimate technical one or artificially imposed.

[23:36:51] <Phase> access to'
[23:40:42] <Phase> antivirus stops someone emailing you an old virus
[23:40:55] <Phase> doesn't stop someone breaking out of your browser
[23:41:02] <Phase> although they claim it does
[23:41:51] <Compu> chrome sandboxes everything
[23:42:06] <Phase> on windows that's pretty meaningless
[23:42:29] <Phase> they can't block access to gdi for very stupid reasons, and that's where an immense number of kernel exploits are

[23:47:49] <Compu> Phase: linux! :D
[23:47:59] <Phase> Compu, still account-level
[23:48:13] <Phase> isolation exists between uid's, not within a uid
[23:48:23] <Phase> so my irc client has full access to my browsers password store
[23:48:34] * HoneyDrops has multiple users :D
[23:49:02] <Compu> still linux is better
[23:49:43] <Compu> and yeah if they didnt have that then u would have to have a multiple copies of ur music and documents if u use more than one application for those
[23:50:03] <HoneyDrops> Like WINE, generically us wineuser (and I have a script suwine).  When I did run Skype, it was skypeuser.  MC I run as mcuser.  IRC runs on another system.
[23:50:10] <Compu> people have actually suggested that windows adopts iphone security models where each app can only access its own files
[23:50:26] <Compu> so if u want to email a word document u have to open word and click the share button

[23:50:38] <Phase> Compu, it kinda has that, i forget what its called

[23:51:11] <Compu> its a dumb idea imo
[23:51:17] <Phase> it's done wrong
[23:51:36] <HoneyDrops> Well first, Word documents are a security nightmare.  Second, being able to limit what an application can access is a useful tool, provided the user sets the limits.
[23:51:37] <Phase> something closer to androids model is what i want
[23:51:58] <JustAberrant> androids model suffers the huge problem of all or nothing imo
[23:52:01] *** init3-sleep is now known as init3
[23:52:03] <Phase> where individual applications request a set of capabilities, file access being one of them
[23:52:08] <JustAberrant> you can't say "run this app anyway without these permissions"
[23:52:24] <Phase> JustAberrant, iirc cyanogen adds controls for that
[23:52:34] <Phase> but yes the stock distro doesn't
[23:52:52] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: well, you can now
[23:52:57] <Moonlightning> But that's as of Marshmallow.
[23:53:23] <Compu> HoneyDrops: no people r suggesting that each app can only access files it creates, user gets no control, like an iphone
[23:53:36] <JustAberrant> but yeah, the linux permission system (at least the parts of it most actually use) is kinda shit compared to where everything else has gone
[23:53:41] <Compu> makes antivirus impossible
[23:54:15] <Moonlightning> That breaks the Unix philosophy.
[23:54:15] <Compu> the antivirus wouldnt be able to scan anything but its own files
[23:54:22] <JustAberrant> ACLs are certainly possible on linux, but it's such a clusterfuck
[23:54:22] <Compu> all the AV companies would die
[23:54:28] <Moonlightning> And renders command-line things useless
[23:54:29] <Phase> what a shame
[23:54:33] <Moonlightning> except maybe editors
[23:54:44] <Phase> but no you would allow user shells greater access
[23:54:48] <Compu> Moonlightning: no people r suggesting windows does this
[23:55:08] <Compu> by people i mean a guy i saw in a youtube video
[23:55:11] <Phase> it's not like you can only do security one way for everything on a system
[23:55:12] <Moonlightning> Compu: let's forget about cmd.exe for a moment and pretend Windows is POSIX-compliant and comes with a sane set of coreutils
[23:55:33] <Compu> ?
[23:55:35] <Moonlightning> Phase: great, so my shell can access my files! What about `head`, `tail`, `grep`…?
[23:55:58] <Phase> they would inherit from the shell
[23:56:01] <Compu> what about opening a video file i downloaded with chrome?
[23:56:09] <Moonlightning> Phase: as would a GUI app I launched from the shell? :P
[23:56:13] <Compu> cant do that! vlc cant access chrome's files!
[23:56:19] <Moonlightning> Compu: perfect example
[23:56:25] <Compu> the file must be shared to vlc
[23:56:28] <Sour_Sweet> Nope
[23:56:38] <Phase> Moonlightning, it would be on exec() of a confined app, and the details of confinement part of its executable
[23:56:44] <Compu> so every time u wanna play that video u must open chrome and go to downloads and share the file again
[23:56:50] <Phase> which i don't think you can do right now in linux
[23:57:04] <Phase> there's an appcontainer spec but honestly sounds like crap
[23:57:19] <Phase> the shell would have to set up the container, so bash wouldn't
[23:57:29] <Phase> and thus you have the inheritence problem
[23:58:16] <Phase> Moonlightning, at the *VERY* least i'd like things like payment processing moved outside my browsers context
[23:58:24] <Phase> even without any other confining
[23:58:42] <Moonlightning> eh, I guess you could fork(), lower your own permissions, then exec()
[23:58:45] <Phase> UAC on windows works nice, why can't we have that on linux, and why not for things like authorizing payments
[23:58:57] <Compu> we kinda do
[23:59:01] <Moonlightning> Phase: hmm…doesn't iOS kinda do that with Apple Pay on websites?
[23:59:15] <Compu> anything require sudo in a GUI thing pops up a password dialog
[23:59:17] <Phase> Moonlightning, you can't set up namespaces from an unprivilaged process
[23:59:24] <Moonlightning> :?
[23:59:32] <Phase> Compu, yes, lets extend that to payment processing
[23:59:33] <JustAberrant> see: why apache starts as root
[23:59:43] <Moonlightning> You lost me. Anyway, I'm applying minimal-effort at this point
[23:59:49] <Moonlightning> THIS IS STUPID *goes away*
