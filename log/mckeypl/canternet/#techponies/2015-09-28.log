[00:07:35] <mniip> no but I can make a terrible attempt!
[00:07:54] <Moonlightning> An X.509 certificate's fingerprint covers the entire certificate, right? Subject, issuer, timestamps, and all?
[00:09:24] <mniip> Rylee, that was a good one

[00:12:52] <Moonlightning> Rylee: Dat signature doe
[00:13:00] <Colgate> oh, derp, I read that question wrong
[00:13:03] <Colgate> you mean the x509 thing
[00:13:07] <Colgate> that's just the public key

[00:13:57] <Colgate> that's probably the former

[00:29:11] <Moonlightning> AnthroChat's certificates are all timestamped from either 2005 or 2010
[00:29:20] <Moonlightning> and expired in 2010, or will expire in 2022
[00:29:51] <Moonlightning> They're also all signed with MD5 (except for snowleopard, which is SHA1)
[00:30:04] <Moonlightning> which…doesn't change much because self-signed, but still
[00:30:36] <Moonlightning> These people need Let's Encrypt :P
[00:30:43] <Colgate> really doesn't matter what you self-sign with
[00:30:56] <Moonlightning> But, I mean, come on.
[00:31:12] <Colgate> you either trust the cert because you have a copy of the hash of the cert, or you don't
[00:31:13] <mniip> self-signed != insecure
[00:31:26] <Moonlightning> I know, mniip, and I'm all for the decentralized model
[00:32:32] <mniip> interesting
[00:33:37] <ShivalWolf> ahh the differnce between security and trust
[00:33:51] <ShivalWolf> which is why certificates are a monopoly buisness modle
[00:34:05] * mniip randomly checks the keybase graph between him and Moonlightning
[00:34:23] <ShivalWolf> one day i will play around with keybase
[00:34:56] <Moonlightning> What, visual graph?
[00:35:03] <mniip> I tried to make a visual graph
[00:35:07] <mniip> the data is too big
[00:35:34] <mniip> one day I accidentally a botnet that crawls through keybase and records all tracking relations

[00:37:07] <mniip> http://i.imgur.com/PQ0zboh.png
[00:37:26] <mniip> anyway, I have a tool like
[00:37:40] <mniip> $ ./check blackl mniip
[00:37:40] <mniip> blackl -> ariscop -> chris -> a2 -> jt -> ialexryan -> dwbond -> triclops200 -> mniip
[00:37:53] <Moonlightning> o3o
[00:37:56] <Moonlightning> Is that actually a thing? o3o
[00:38:16] <mniip> I have 2 major questions
[00:38:27] <mniip> why does it come through chris
[00:38:41] <mniip> how did it happen that chris and triclops200 are related
[00:38:43] <Moonlightning> I don't know any of these ponies, except for ariscop XD
[00:38:58] <mniip> well chris is one of the creators of keybase
[00:39:05] <Moonlightning> o.o
[00:39:13] <Moonlightning> …also, what? I didn't sign any of these keys O.o
[00:39:21] <mniip> you only signed ariscop's
[00:39:26] <Moonlightning> I haven't published /any/ signatures o.O
[00:39:27] <mniip> and ariscop tracks chris
[00:39:34] <mniip> and chris tracks a2
[00:39:35] <mniip> etc
[00:39:54] <Colgate> what is this keybase? :P
[00:39:57] <mniip> you've published 2 singatures
[00:39:58] <Moonlightning> I tracked ariscop, but I didn't sign…
[00:40:16] * Phase appears
[00:40:20] <mniip> Colgate, a social network without posts, only followers
[00:40:21] <Colgate> oh, nm, I remember this thing
[00:40:32] <Phase> the pgp thing
[00:40:45] <Phase> that doesn't have a keyserver and thus is unusable for email
[00:40:59] <mniip> er?
[00:41:43] <Colgate> I didn't find it useful because I don't use social media stuff
[00:41:46] <Moonlightning> Er, what?
[00:42:00] <Moonlightning> Why are you doing anything with keys that you don't have permanent copies of?
[00:42:15] <Moonlightning> If you /need/ a keyserver to be able to encrypt to people you know, you're doing ti wrong
[00:42:38] <Colgate> a keyserver to query on first send
[00:42:45] <Phase> well the keybase tool doesn't have any way to pull keys into your local store
[00:42:46] <Moonlightning> …oh! I have a domain now! o3o
[00:42:59] <Moonlightning> Colgate: yes, and after that, save the key
[00:43:13] <Phase> it's the getting the key into clients bit that's trouble
[00:43:20] <Phase> of course you'd save it
[00:44:30] <mniip> so uh
[00:44:35] <mniip> anyone into algorithms
[00:45:01] <mniip> I need an efficient digraph transitivity reduction algorithm
[00:45:18] <mniip> preferably as low as the nowadays matrix multiplication complexity is

[01:01:12] * Moonlightning frowns.
[01:01:16] <Moonlightning> But I set the TTL on that to one week!
[01:01:48] <Moonlightning> 21599 is…six minutes, minus one second. :|
[01:02:05] <Moonlightning> Er, six hours
[01:02:08] <Moonlightning> Still
[01:02:25] <Phase> and when did you last update it?
[01:03:09] <Moonlightning> Just now.

[08:47:53] <Moonlightning> Well, first of all, AES is vulnerable to some kind of timing attack involving its tables, making it so that an attacker with a stolen encrypted blob can easily derive the key

[14:03:05] <Stik> it's a snippet from a much larger file, and those two are the only references to the three characters "dub" in the entire thing
[14:03:46] *** Starburn is now known as CardboardBox
[14:03:52] <Stik> so pretty certain line3 is where the error happens
[14:03:57] <Phase> minified code
[14:03:58] <Phase> why
[14:04:05] <Stik> error in production
[14:05:01] <Phase> do you know where in the snippet it fails?
[14:05:34] <Phase> and production only? this doesn't happen on the unminified code?
[14:06:35] <Stik> sadly not
[14:06:43] <Stik> it only happens for some people, and only some of the time too
[14:06:59] <Phase> wRe[a = ++xRe] = dub; this just looks really odd
[14:07:07] <Stik> i think it's stack tracing
[14:07:21] <Stik> every function does the same at the start and end
[14:07:36] <Stik> wRe i guess is the stack
[14:07:58] <Phase> so it's going through some kind of compiler
[14:08:07] <Stik> yeah it's compiled from java into javascript
[14:08:34] <Phase> ah
[14:08:42] <Stik> that's the only reference to that function by name ("dub") in the entire generated code, as far as i have been able to find
[14:08:55] <Stik> so i think it's almost certain to be line 3 in that snippet that's causing the issue
[14:09:23] <Stik> unfortunately there's no js stacktrace, since something else seems to swallow the exception and isn't logging the details anywhere
[14:09:48] <Stik> i just don't see how "dub" can be undefined at that point, since it's inside itself
[14:10:17] <Stik> so far the sample of people is only 4, but 2 of them have been able to repeat the error (intermittantly), 2 haven't
[14:10:44] <Phase> _ = {}
[14:10:45] <Phase> _.he = function dub() {
[14:10:45] <Phase>     var a = dub;
[14:10:45] <Phase> };
[14:10:46] <Stik> the 2 that haven't are on 64 bit chrome, the two that have are on 32bit
[14:11:12] <Phase> that errors in node.js
[14:11:16] <Stik> oh really?
[14:11:21] <Stik> i shall have a poke
[14:11:29] <Stik> the same pattern is literally on every other function tho
[14:11:30] <Stik> and they all work
[14:11:44] <Phase> if i call dub directly...
[14:11:49] <Phase> _.he() works
[14:12:20] <Phase> Stik, this a thing for work?

[14:34:32] <Phase> Stik, "Note that NFEs[Named Function Expressions] have frequently been a source of bugs for JavaScript implementations. IE8 and earlier, for instance, handle NFEs completely incorrectly, creating two different functions at two different times." http://stackoverflow.com/a/22173438/2272842
[14:38:20] <Stik> good find
[14:39:11] <Stik> suspect this compiler is aware of that tho (i hope), it creates lots of different versions of the javascript, one for each web browser it considers different enough to warrant it
[14:39:21] <Phase> if at all possiblem, its best if the compiler doesn't depend on NFE's
[14:39:31] <Stik> so there's a version specifically for IE7 and IE8 that's meant to work around its shortcomings
[14:39:45] <Phase> odd design
[14:39:49] <Stik> it's quite neat
[14:39:57] <Phase> open source thing or private tool?
[14:39:58] <Stik> means the code isn't full of conditionals for different browsers
[14:40:07] <Stik> open source, it's one of google's projects, GWT
[14:40:15] <Stik> is quite old now
[14:40:38] <Stik> also, theoretically, if one browser has specific optimisations it can make them just for that one permutation
[14:41:22] <Stik> there's a little bootstrap js file that works out which main file to load, then that main file is cached forever, so should be immediate to run the second time
[14:41:49] <Stik> if the code changes the bootstrap js requests a new file to replace the cached one
[14:41:52] <Phase> Ahhhhh
[14:42:04] <Phase> do you know which file is being loaded by 32bit chrome?
[14:42:37] <Stik> should be able to find out with some digging
[14:42:57] <Phase> i'd check if that's the same as 64bit chrome
[14:43:35] <Phase> internal thing or public? if its public i'd recommend getting some testing service so you don't need to reproduce every env locally
[14:44:16] <Phase> yeah, GWT Java to JavaScript compiler
[14:44:22] * Phase will have to look into this at some point
[14:44:29] <Stik> it's pretty good
[14:44:30] <Stik> when it works!
[14:45:03] <Stik> looks like 64 and 32 bit versions are considered the same
[14:45:17] <Stik> writing in java is a lot more pleasant than javascript (at least i think so)

[23:41:48] <CrassyPaddles> anybody here good at mechanics?
[23:43:27] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> what do ya' need?
[23:43:53] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] is mechanic
[23:43:54] <CrassyPaddles> okay, friction force is the product of the normal force and some coefficient of friction, right?
[23:44:03] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:44:16] <CrassyPaddles> f=uN basically
[23:44:24] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> generally weight and gravity for your coefficient
[23:44:37] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:45:14] <CrassyPaddles> For an object that undergoes no vertical movement, calling that the y axis, the normal force on that object does not change throughout the process
[23:45:30] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:45:37] <CrassyPaddles> so say I'm an athlete that's split stepping to the side
[23:46:12] <CrassyPaddles> I've noticed that when I do so on a slippery surface with my whole flat of my foot, I slip
[23:46:39] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:46:43] <CrassyPaddles> not as much frictional force pushing me sideways, calling that the x axis
[23:47:10] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you're losing tractive force?
[23:47:17] <CrassyPaddles> BUT when I point my foot so that my weight rests on the balls of my feet, my foot doesn't slip, and I can push a lot harder laterally without slippage.
[23:47:27] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:47:46] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> adjusting your angle to compensate by putting more surface area forward creating a larger contact patch
[23:47:48] <CrassyPaddles> I think I've just answered my question
[23:47:59] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:48:23] <CrassyPaddles> DJ-C0L7[EIT], wait no. I would have less surface area in contact with the floor
[23:48:45] <CrassyPaddles> by pointing my feet and shifting my weight forward, the heel and back of my foot lifts OFF the ground
[23:48:55] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:49:08] <CrassyPaddles> whereas a flat foot, ALL of the bottom of my feet rests on the ground
[23:49:27] <CrassyPaddles> In both cases, my weight and thus the normal force remains the same
[23:49:36] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> but in doing so you are flattening your foor in the direction of travel, so you are shifting from a long skinny contact patch, to a stubby wide patch
[23:49:42] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> foot*
[23:49:53] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> true
[23:50:03] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> F=MA right
[23:50:13] <CrassyPaddles> DJ-C0L7[EIT], If you're saying that both cases, the area in contact are equal, I disagree
[23:50:30] <CrassyPaddles> With a pointed foot, the area is much smaller than with a flat foot.
[23:50:39] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:50:57] <CrassyPaddles> a third or a quarter of the area of that when the foot is in full contact.
[23:51:11] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] nods
[23:52:13] <CrassyPaddles> the normal force remains the same, but the pressure on my foot doesn't. It's much greater with a pointed foot.
[23:54:03] <CrassyPaddles> Since with a pointed foot, I generate so much more lateral frictional force, I thought that frictional force didn't have to do with the normal force on the object, but its normal pressure. I see now that's not necessary to explain my observations.
[23:54:23] <CrassyPaddles> f=uN
[23:54:56] <CrassyPaddles> so for two objects with the same normal force on them, one can experience much greater friction if the u term is much greater.
[23:56:02] <CrassyPaddles> and it seems like u varies based on how much surface area is in contact
