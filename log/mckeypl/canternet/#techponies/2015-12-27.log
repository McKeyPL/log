[04:13:31] <Compu> woo i got some smartbulbs with my birthday money (and a hub for them of course)
[04:14:23] <JustAberrant> strange thing to buy, but cool enough I guess ;p
[04:14:37] <Compu> its OSRAM lightify brand
[04:15:38] * JustAberrant prefers to make the switch smart vice the bulb.. but to each their own
[04:15:47] <Compu> ~$50 for a bulb and the hub and ~$25 for another bulb (the one i got separately can change color temperature)
[04:15:50] *** Joins: Red_M (potato@Pony-4pa04c.red-m.net)
[04:16:02] <Compu> wanted to get a full RGB bulb but lowes didnt have any
[04:16:37] <Compu> JustAberrant: switch cant change the color temp of the bulb, or the color in the case of RGB bulbs
[04:16:47] <JustAberrant> true enough I suppose
[04:17:18] <JustAberrant> though I can't say I've ever had a desire to do that either ;p
[04:17:30] <Compu> also apparently these bulbs r zigbee compatible

[04:17:57] <JustAberrant> zigbee is home automation stuff, less used now but still around
[04:18:09] <JustAberrant> and I have not ;p

[05:39:06] <Snoarin> So why can't you have 2 network connections going at once without having lag between one going down and the other connection picking up?
[05:39:49] <Moonlightning> What do you mean?
[05:40:07] <Moonlightning> One machine, connected to two different networks (as opposed to the same network) on two different interfaces?

[05:41:49] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-johrv1.internode.on.net)
[05:41:49] <Moonlightning> Well…assume they're bridged, the machine just has to actually notice when one link goes down.
[05:42:13] <Moonlightning> I'd expect there to be only an imperceptible delay if the one that goes down is wired >.>
[05:42:27] <Moonlightning> That seems to be logged instantly on my systems

[05:43:12] <JustAberrant> depends on your setup
[05:43:21] <JustAberrant> if you're talking a proper bonded connection, then yeah, should be really quick
[05:43:38] <JustAberrant> although if it's not a complete failure it might not be
[05:43:51] <JustAberrant> if you're talking different paths, it can be a bit slower
[05:44:08] <Moonlightning> Yeah; if they're not actually ethernet-bridged, then you're gonna have to wait for each of your layer-four connections to notice ;P
[05:44:45] <Snoarin> Alright
[05:45:04] <Moonlightning> Which could be a //very// long time if they're not trying to send anything, not expecting to receive anything, and have no keepalive
[05:46:46] <Moonlightning> But yeah…I hear that if you have like a laptop and you want to be able to seamlessly plug it in to a local netbox to get faster everything, and unplug it to get mobility, then you should look into ethernet bridging
[05:46:49] <Snoarin> I also noticed at work with 26 machines, the network gets slow a lot.
[05:46:59] <Moonlightning> > work
[05:47:00] <Moonlightning> > 26 clients
[05:47:07] <Moonlightning> yeah there should be /no problem/ with that

[05:47:42] <Googie> Strongly depends on how the network is setup though

[05:49:15] <Snoarin> Its more then 26 clients, but I help manage 28* up front
[05:49:46] <Snoarin> Every day I work we have to reboot 5~ systems at least once
[05:50:07] <Snoarin> That's 20 minutes downtime each system. They all run windows, and linux
[05:50:22] <JustAberrant> if it's an old system it might be using a hub rather than a switch
[05:50:59] <Snoarin> Nah they are switched.  Haven't seen the server yet, but I know its a dell
[05:51:13] <Snoarin> I remote into it almost daily as well

[05:58:55] <JustAberrant> I was being sarcastic ;p
[05:59:10] <Compu> nya
[05:59:22] <Compu> but seriously this is pretty sweet
[05:59:24] <JustAberrant> I have an insteon setup, my basic use case is "off", "kinda dim" and "on" ;p
[05:59:39] <Compu> oh and connects with NEST as well
[06:00:11] <Compu> JustAberrant: it has scenes u can create for presets like that
[06:00:21] <Moonlightning> > scene
[06:00:47] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: I agree, I hate that terminology, insteon uses it as well ;p
[06:01:00] <Moonlightning> I can't imagine myself wanting /scenes/ so much as /keep stuff this way, and vary the lights between off, very very dim, about halfish, and on at my command/
[06:01:50] * JustAberrant hasn't integrated everything yet, but I plan on skipping their control software and writing my own, their's is very.. uh.. fluffy ;p
[06:03:16] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: well, the term is stupid but the idea makes sense, nice to be able to turn off every light in the house at night, or turn on a group of them (like "kitchen lights"), etc
[06:05:11] <JustAberrant> either way, the smart bulb thing is neat I guess, and a good option if you want automation but don't/can't replace wall switches, but I'd rather do it at the switch any day ;p
[06:06:09] <JustAberrant> would get expensive in my place, where my kitchen has like.. I'm guessing 13 or so light bulbs :>
[06:06:16] <JustAberrant> much cheaper to replace 3 switches
[06:07:12] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: right, because with current dumb systems, you have to turn /all/ the lights on or off, as a group. You can't toggle them individually. :P
[06:07:47] <JustAberrant> ehe
[06:08:14] <JustAberrant> I can _maybe_ see some appeal in the color temperature thing, though I've never really found myself thinking "hmm, I wish this room had a warmer color temperature right now"
[06:08:21] <Kinsley> We replaced nearly all of the pot lights in the house with LEDs. Local utility paid like, $3 each to subsidize them.
[06:08:21] <JustAberrant> that's kinda something you pick once and forget about
[06:08:50] <Kinsley> Which made it $7 a 120W dimmable replacement.
[06:09:04] <HoneyDrops> Compu: but is the dimming linear or logarithmic?  Does it adjust to compensate for the the energy difference based on frequency (color) or does it compensate for differential human retina frequency response!?  
[06:10:05] * JustAberrant is gradually replacing bulbs with LED equivalents as the incandescents burn out
[06:10:19] <Kinsley> Pffft. We didn't even wait.
[06:10:35] <Kinsley> Costco is a magical place.
[06:10:42] <Kinsley> Pick up a fuckin' case of bulbs.
[06:10:45] <JustAberrant> hehe, my house has a lot of lights
[06:10:52] <JustAberrant> seriously, some electrician took them for a ride
[06:11:10] <Kinsley> How so?
[06:11:16] <JustAberrant> like.. "yeah, you'll need at _least_ 4 fixtures in this room.. and some pot lights.. I mean, can't have any shadows.. what if a tall person walks in!
[06:11:25] <JustAberrant> also the ETS system is _insane_
[06:11:27] <JustAberrant> like..
[06:11:47] <JustAberrant> one ETS heater.. in the living room
[06:12:16] <Compu> HoneyDrops: i dunno, look it up, its called OSRAM Lightify
[06:12:28] <JustAberrant> and to control it.. a 16 pole comfort system control panel, PLA transceiver, external temperature sensor, internal temperature system, zone override panel...
[06:13:03] <JustAberrant> all for the basic sole purpose of telling the heater to charge from 11pm to 7am 
[06:13:50] <Compu> JustAberrant: its a rather new smart system so theyre still working on the API but once it's done u might be able to do all that urself
[06:14:27] <JustAberrant> no idea what they paid for all that crap, but there's no way they needed anything near that complex
[06:15:11] <Moonlightning> Color temperature?
[06:15:22] <Compu> Moonlightning: cool vs warm vs pure white
[06:15:24] <Moonlightning> You mean like how Flux changes a screen's color temperature at night?
[06:15:35] <Compu> yes but for ur light bulb
[06:15:43] <Moonlightning> Wouldn't you want that for pretty much the same reason?
[06:15:50] <Compu> i dunno
[06:15:55] <AppleDash> I like cool colors everywhre
[06:15:58] <AppleDash> everywhere*

[06:16:04] <Compu> i wanted an RGBW light but lowes didnt have any in stock
[06:16:04] <AppleDash> So I buy cool white flourescents
[06:16:17] <JustAberrant> for the same reason that home automation never really caught on

[06:17:44] <JustAberrant> that.. seems like it would get old quickly ;p
[06:17:57] <JustAberrant> but yeah, if you're just wanting one of these for one room is kinda makes sense
[06:18:00] <Kinsley> When the CFL in my table lamp goes, I might replace it with a color changing bulb.
[06:18:21] <Compu> yes and that is the beauty of a smart RGBW bulb, dont like the color? change it
[06:18:54] <JustAberrant> I think being in non-white or red light for any length of time would mess with you
[06:19:14] <JustAberrant> hell I've been in rooms with red lighting for extended periods of time and it starts to bug you after awhile
[06:19:15] <Compu> Kinsley: smart bulbs need a base, u only need 1 base for up to......i think the lightify base will do 60 bulbs?
[06:19:34] <Compu> they have an industrial version too that does 1,000+ bulbs
[06:19:52] <Kinsley> That just seems excessive.
[06:19:54] <JustAberrant> it seems silly for more than a few bulbs

[06:21:16] <Compu> JustAberrant: well theres also dimming and color temp
[06:21:17] <JustAberrant> yeah I really can't think of a non-club/bar use case for a non-white light ;p
[06:21:42] <JustAberrant> Compu: well, dimming is handled by traditional "smart" switches
[06:22:02] <JustAberrant> Compu: the color temp thing I equate to the color thing, in that there's like no real use case for that ;p
[06:22:02] <Compu> also i love the fact that these bulbs dont just flick on and off when u use the app, the dim down to off and dim up to on
[06:22:29] <Compu> JustAberrant: change it to cool to make ppl focus, warm for relaxing
[06:22:56] <Compu> warm for lunch break, cool for work time?
[06:23:04] <JustAberrant> I.. don't see it ;p
[06:23:11] <Compu> the app lets u set up automation schedules to change it all automatically
[06:24:06] <Compu> also this bulb is pretty bright at 100%
[06:24:21] <Compu> specifications say it does 800 lumens with 10 watts

[06:27:28] <JustAberrant> aside from a few useful things (like having bedroom lights slowly brighten in the morning before the alarm goes off), you _really_ have to stretch to come up with use cases
[06:27:36] <JustAberrant> and they are usually very minimal gain
[06:31:02] <JustAberrant> I can see the smart bulb thing actually making sense for a bedroom
[06:31:05] <JustAberrant> I will admit that
[06:31:17] <JustAberrant> because that's all most people are really going to want or need
[06:31:31] <JustAberrant> everything else is just geek toys :>
[06:34:36] *** Pony_59117 is now known as locodashie11
[06:34:41] <JustAberrant> also with the smart bulb approach, I'm assuming the traditional light switch has to be left on all the time
[06:35:08] <JustAberrant> which kinda presents two problems, one you can't use the switch to control the light (I don't think I'd want to pull my smart phone out every time I walked into a room)
[06:35:48] <JustAberrant> and two, other people can't easily control the light
[06:36:49] <AppleDash> Staple a tablet to the wall next to your light switch with the app open on it
[06:36:50] <AppleDash> lol

[06:42:59] <JustAberrant> might be possible to hack a sony ereader or similar into one
[06:43:10] <JustAberrant> I know they run android underneath
[06:43:24] <Moonlightning> This is why we need AI
[06:43:29] <Moonlightning> just get rid of the switches
[06:43:38] <Moonlightning> be like “Turn on the pod bay lights, Hal”
[06:43:47] <AppleDash> JustAberrant, that'd be a fun experiment
[06:43:56] <AppleDash> I think they have (very crappy) web browsers
[06:44:01] <AppleDash> If you /designed/ an "app" for that
[06:44:04] <AppleDash> You could make it work
[06:44:17] <JustAberrant> mm, that would work too I guess
[06:44:41] <HoneyDrops> Home automation suffers from UI problems, or only partial solutions.  Like a coffee maker that orders beans from the farm you like, grinds them on schedule, brews, and deposits used grounds in your compost heap would be awesome, but just something that does grind-brew on a timer is doing the easy part.
[06:45:14] <HoneyDrops> But yes, AI is really the way to go.
[06:46:18] <JustAberrant> right, and we are a long way off from controlling things beyond the device level
[06:46:27] <JustAberrant> which which nifty, doesn't give you much
[06:46:37] <JustAberrant> and doesn't really benefit from centralization
[06:46:53] <JustAberrant> you can automate the coffee pot, the lights, and the thermostat, but then what
[06:47:27] <JustAberrant> and the coffee pot is kinda a stand alone thing, and smart thermostats have been around forever and again, no real need to centralize control of them with say, the lights
[06:47:28] <HoneyDrops> The problem with IoT now is that each brand does it's own thing.  There is no standard interface, plus the fact that your things really should only ever be under your control.  The entire economic model driving the tech is wrong.
[06:48:02] <JustAberrant> meh, realistically enough people don't care for the control thing to be an issue
[06:48:14] <JustAberrant> the problem imo is that it doesn't do anything really useful 
[06:48:18] <HoneyDrops> And that will bite them in the ass eventually

[06:49:35] <HoneyDrops> I think more it's people take it for granted.  Generally one's things do listen to them, at least for a loose def of "listen" eg: my hammer never refuses to drive a nail based on some arbitrary rules set by someone.
[06:50:11] <JustAberrant> people will get used to the idea I imagine
[06:50:12] <HoneyDrops> So the idea that any thing I own would ever /not/ do something for any reason other than it isn't physically capable is a new experience.
[06:50:15] <JustAberrant> same as with DRM
[06:50:17] <HoneyDrops> And they are wrong
[06:50:33] <JustAberrant> doesn't matter ;p
[06:50:58] <HoneyDrops> Well again, will bite them in the ass eventually.
[06:50:59] <JustAberrant> you can petulantly cross your arms and not have any of it, but i'll still happen ;p
[06:51:41] <JustAberrant> maybe, though I don't think that's as certain
[06:51:56] <JustAberrant> will be like facebook, you'll hear the occasional story of it biting someone in the ass
[06:51:59] <HoneyDrops> Well I'm willing to wait for the entire mass to just implode on itself.  I'll be over here with devices and software that I am in control of. 
[06:52:24] <JustAberrant> but it won't be a significantly frequent enough occurrence to really matter, people will keep using it and generally be unharmed
[06:53:00] <HoneyDrops> Well less scrupulous individuals could certainly expedite/exacerbate things.
[06:53:29] <JustAberrant> people always over-estimate the _actual_ impact to the common person of this stuff
[06:53:35] <JustAberrant> look at CC breaches
[06:53:49] <JustAberrant> we freak out, but to the average person, even when they are compromised, it's at most annoying
[06:54:00] <JustAberrant> and for the most part, their lives arn't negatively impacted
[06:54:08] <JustAberrant> the bank sends them a new card, they go about their life
[06:54:22] <HoneyDrops> Well that is largely because CC are so insanely profitable, they companies can eat the loss.
[06:54:40] <JustAberrant> with IoT, just like everything else, it'll start out insanely insecure
[06:54:57] <JustAberrant> because you have companies who used to build things that never had to worry about the internet suddenly connecting their stuff to a network
[06:55:17] <JustAberrant> and yes, connecting them to the internet in the first place is stupid, but it's still happening
[06:55:28] <HoneyDrops> It's fine (in /most/) cases to start out insecure, but the fact is decades in, we're still using the same broken, insecure crap :I
[06:55:39] <HoneyDrops> and that is /not/ ok.
[06:55:45] <JustAberrant> but they'll learn, and it'll improve to semi-reasonable levels
[06:55:52] <HoneyDrops> Look at cell phone networks?  they are insanely insecure
[06:56:06] <JustAberrant> sure, but again, look at the impact to the average person
[06:56:17] <HoneyDrops> things like stingray should never have been technically feasible.
[06:56:17] <JustAberrant> that's what drives change, not what "aught to be"
[06:56:40] <JustAberrant> if the average person doesn't care about stingray, it's not going anywhere, and they mostly don't
[06:56:59] <JustAberrant> and it's not even an unreasonable stance to take, which is kinda the problem
[06:57:46] <JustAberrant> even as a geek who opposes things like stingray in principle, in practice I don't care, so it's reasonable that non-geeks also won't care
[07:02:49] <JustAberrant> and since we've devolved into a talk about privacy, I'm going to bed ;p

[07:22:04] <Moonlightning> I can't the flow control anymore
[07:22:21] <Moonlightning> …oh, I guess I should be refactoring
[07:22:29] <Moonlightning> well, if I decide to pick it up again, I'll start by doing that
[07:29:25] <Colgate> HoneyDrops: problem with your coffee maker example, I would never want something that has access to payment info like that, surprise charges to my CC bill? no thanks
[07:31:22] <HoneyDrops> Colgate: well at least interlock it to notify you/set up and order and you place it.  However, solution would be to have a single purpose "coffee grounds" accounts for it to use, and you just transfer funds occasionally (and to the other single purpose accounts).
[07:31:52] <HoneyDrops> If you're 30$'s get eaten, you can look into it, but hopefully no single account would break you.
[07:31:55] <Phase> Googie, http://goo.gl/WQBAXc
[07:32:00] <Colgate> a notification is fine, it can go into a list of other things that are out, and would be even better if you could tap the purchase button(ideally with prices there too)
[07:32:17] <HoneyDrops> On the plus side it also screws with trying to profile your purchases.
[07:32:22] <Googie> Hahaha, yeah... that magazine cover.
[07:32:37] <HoneyDrops> as all the data would be "this account buys a lot of coffee"
[07:33:13] <Colgate> run it through tor without accounts
[07:33:14] <Googie> I'm thinking that it's looking like the Rift will finally be open for preorders some time during CES, or shortly afterwards.
[07:33:19] <Colgate> someone buys coffeee
[07:33:21] <Colgate> /shrug
[07:33:30] * Phase has the devkits
[07:33:37] <Colgate> I mean, if you do the actual purchase, it doesn't need to be through tor
[07:33:43] <Googie> Yeah, I remember helped you get the DK2 up and running.
[07:33:45] <Colgate> since you are giving an address, decloaking you anyways :P
[07:33:46] <Phase> devkit 2 works, they just need the resolution up
[07:33:54] * Googie has a DK2 hooked up on his desk as well :P
[07:33:56] <Phase> Googie, oh yeah, forgot about that
[07:35:18] <Googie> My big things at the moment are largely just comfort and performance. Personally I think the DK2's resolution is high enough... /just/ (and I'm very happy that it's been improved further)
[07:35:36] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: that sounds like a very bitcoin system
[07:35:41] <Phase> imo it's way too low
[07:35:46] <Phase> and greater fov would be really nice
[07:35:51] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: Traditional bank systems have recurring things, yes?
[07:36:02] <Moonlightning> You can just authorize it to pull $30 every month
[07:36:12] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|Sleepies
[07:36:29] <Googie> I agree kinda, but I think the Rift could still succeed even with the existing resolution of the DK2. I'm glad that they did up it though.
[07:36:42] * Moonlightning cloaks Colgate with a dark blue cloak.
[07:37:28] <Googie> I've spent quite a few hours playing Elite Dangerous in the DK2 though. Resolution is a pain, but with good design can be worked around to not be /too/ bad. Comfort is what hampers me from playing though. >1 hour is fairly hard to do.
[07:38:05] <Phase> wish i could justify the cost of E:D
[07:39:41] <Phase> most of the vr i've done was in MC on the minetrek servers
[07:39:55] <Phase> Googie, go on the minetrek servers with the vr mod

[09:46:08] <Sombra> Big underground ravines and canyons.

[14:35:12] <Shutter> Eh, half joking. Haven't used it a lot as a user, nor looked much at the source code, but from what I have seen it seems a bit messy. Might be an error of perception on my part.
[14:36:04] <mniip> well, you are half right
[14:36:16] <mniip> but it sucks much fewer balls than other gui clients

[14:40:54] <mniip> well

[19:26:47] <Moonlightning> mniip_: but does it have cert support so you don't /have/ to passwords?
[19:26:56] <mniip_> yes

[19:32:12] <Moonlightning> Hmm
[19:32:22] <Moonlightning> Are browser-trusted client certs a thing?
[19:32:49] <Moonlightning> I mean, I could get one for moonlightning.blackl.net., of course
[19:37:37] <johnsey> so, anybody using a cable modem to access the internet?

[19:41:02] <johnsey> the talk focuses specifically on a german ISP, but since the DOCSIS standard is part of the problem, it might affect others, too
[19:41:16] * Moonlightning groans loudly.
[19:42:05] <Moonlightning> Why do we have to deal with this shit? I just want to be able to communicate freely over this amazing network.

[19:44:31] <Divide|TechSupport> What's this about DOCSIS 2?  I'm going to check that now.
[19:45:55] <Divide|TechSupport> Er, 3.0.
[19:46:07] <Divide|TechSupport> Oh, this is going to be bad.  I know that we use DOCSIS in our devices, and I also know that we do not do it /well./
[19:49:17] <johnsey> basically, the modems are connected to an adminstration network, which happened to be open for modems to talk to each other
[19:50:06] <johnsey> and even more, you could download configuration files for other customers and use that info to get root access on their modems
[19:51:09] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> lol
[19:51:13] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> good to know
[19:51:23] <johnsey> the ISP in question "solved" this with a firewall and replaced telnet (haha) with ssh but it remains open if mac spoofing could still be abused to get around this
[19:51:28] <Moonlightning> And that configuration is mandated by law in some countries??
[19:51:39] <johnsey> it's part of the DOCSIS standard
[19:52:00] <Moonlightning> …MAC-based SSH authentication, really?

[20:00:56] <HoneyDrops> Problem is like old Ma Bell, before you had to lease any telephony equipment and they pissed and moaned about modems, which is why there were audio coupler modems (which phone companies still hated).
[20:01:38] <Sour_Sweet> Everything mail is a pain. Postfix decided it doesn't need sign mails coming from sendmail. Looking for a solution will take me hours ...
[20:03:47] <HoneyDrops> The problem is too often security is an afterthought.  Worse still, when security becomes a priority, it rarely is looking out for the user/customer's interests first.
[20:05:43] <Moonlightning> This
[20:07:36] <Divide> This is unfortunately very true.
[20:07:41] <HoneyDrops> Sadly, given current systems of motivation, there is little to no impetus for companies to consider the interests of users first.  Security is added for no other reason than to cover the companies ass or minimize the inconvenience/loss to them, really any benefit to the user is just a side effect.
[20:08:42] <HoneyDrops> As lets be serious, companies would fuck over their customers as hard as they can if it benefits them and they think they can get away with it.
[20:09:38] <johnsey> it has a lot to do with deadline driven development
[20:10:02] <johnsey> management wants this feature done by yesterday, who cares if it's secure?
[20:10:05] <HoneyDrops> Well yes, the classic "fast, cheap, and good: pick any 2"  good is never picked

[20:26:06] <Moonlightning> Minecraft always lags?
[20:26:34] <Moonlightning> I dunno, it seems nice and responsive to me, so least after like half a minute in the world
[20:26:48] <Moonlightning> at least *
[20:26:58] <Sour_Sweet> Depends on you world

[20:29:23] <Ola> :D
[20:30:47] <HoneyDrops> Once you add mods, it /will/ lag.
[20:31:54] * JustAberrant nods
[20:32:46] <HoneyDrops> The lag of a flooded quarry pit is something you won't forget.
[20:33:48] <JustAberrant> bleh, all this MC talk makes me want to play again :(
[20:34:31] <Sour_Sweet> DON'T! It's a trap.
[20:34:37] <JustAberrant> and opis (tool that lets you identify what's lagging) is a godsend :>
[20:35:33] <JustAberrant> Sour_Sweet: hehe, I know, but only thing stopping me from wasting the rest of my vacation is I don't have a server to play on atm ;p
[20:35:33] <HoneyDrops> opis is nice

[20:36:57] * JustAberrant nods
[20:37:26] <Moonlightning> Oh, well
[20:37:34] <Moonlightning> I guess I won't add mods, then :P
[20:37:50] <Moonlightning> I don't exactly have powerful machines, after all
[20:38:11] <JustAberrant> mods brought back the magic of minecraft for me once I burned out on vanilla
[20:38:29] <Moonlightning> One's headless, one's cheap, and one's from 2009
[20:38:33] <Moonlightning> so
[20:38:48] <JustAberrant> like I played with no mods for a long time, got bored, then someone convinced me to try playing on their tekkit server, and then yeah.. ;p
[20:41:03] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: You have my server :P
[20:41:12] <JustAberrant> I thought that was down? ;p
[20:41:30] <AppleDash> It's only down because nobody was playing on it
[20:41:35] <AppleDash> If you want to play on it it can be up!
[20:41:40] <Moonlightning> That's not how servers work
[20:41:47] <AppleDash> Yes it is.
[20:41:52] <AppleDash> Nobody was playing it, so I shut down the VM
[20:41:54] <AppleDash> Very simple
[20:41:59] <JustAberrant> hehe, well, playing alone is kinda boring ;p
[20:42:18] <Moonlightning> Yes, but it requires you to manually restart it if somepony wants to play
[20:42:31] <Moonlightning> Rather than them just being able to connect
[20:42:42] <AppleDash> Yes, but it lets me not be sitting there using 31GB of RAM on a machine with 32
[20:42:50] <AppleDash> Useful when you sometimes want to do other things
[20:42:52] <Moonlightning> Unless you have an inetd-style thing
[20:43:27] <JustAberrant> but yeah I can relate, tis why I turned mine off, was one guy who occasionally played on it, and was basically using all the ram and all the cpu all the time :>
[20:43:41] <JustAberrant> and eventually it was totally wrecking my box like once a week :D
[20:44:43] <AppleDash> :D
[20:45:00] <AppleDash> Your single player suggestion is very bad BTW
[20:45:15] <AppleDash> He was on a slow dual core with 4GB RAM
[20:45:47] <AppleDash> I had to write a custom FTB launcher for him just to save 200M of RAM so that he could run the game using 3GB of compressed RAM and 2GB of swap
[20:46:01] <JustAberrant> yikes ;p
[20:46:15] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it literally wasn't stable any more

[20:57:49] <JustAberrant> hehe, memories :>
[20:59:08] <locodash11[server]> the last tekkit server I used to run always pinned one cpu without anyone ever being on :(
[20:59:26] <locodash11[server]> but /only/ used 4gb ram to itself
[21:05:38] <HoneyDrops> I enjoy playing alone... I'm not very interesting to play with either.  Unless you like watching me build a setup, tear it down, and build it again, with a few changes, then repeat ten times.  Finally, tear it down and build it where I exactly want it in my base.
[21:06:47] <locodash11[server]> I really like to be the server's item vendor once set up, I really like making tons of things, which usually ends up breaking servers
[21:43:53] * JustAberrant likes building huge things
[21:44:03] <JustAberrant> and large infrastructures to process items, but then doing like nothing with them
[21:45:00] <JustAberrant> I usually build a small "staging area" type thing while I get enough stuff going to build my "actual" massive home
[21:46:36] <JustAberrant> last time I played, I quarried out I think a 17 by 17 chunk area to bedrock, then build a 13x13 chunk floating building over it

[21:48:38] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: I dunno, I like seeing what other people do, and occasionally collaborating on stuff
[21:48:55] <JustAberrant> it's fun to explore when you have different players with totally different interests
[21:49:43] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/minecraft/2014-07-03_01.04.08.png  <-- I don't have any finished pics, but yeah, I like doing stuff on this kinda ridiculous scale
[21:49:54] <JustAberrant> the whole fun of the mods to me is that you can automate and do stuff like that
[21:50:03] *** Joins: Xefir (xefir@Pony-j2tk36.1fe2.7gl6.e080.2a00.IP)
[21:50:29] <JustAberrant> doing that by hand would take forever, but a few well(ish) written turtle scripts and appropriate infrastructure for managing resources and you can build stupidly big things :>
[21:53:20] <HoneyDrops> JustAberrant, I do the same, quarry pits make for best homes.  But I tend to stick to maybe 3x3, 5x5, or in an extreme case 7x7 chunk platform/towers
[21:53:58] <HoneyDrops> I also like to build vertical
[21:54:05] <JustAberrant> thing is, I had that whole thing chunkloaded, but I'm actually really efficient in how I set things up
[21:54:48] <JustAberrant> thing was I think 8 levels, loaded with farms and all kinds of automated stuff
[21:54:56] <JustAberrant> and was still the lightest one on the server :>
[21:55:38] <JustAberrant> building vertical is more practical, although it can be more laggy
[21:55:41] <HoneyDrops> But 13x13 chunks... I dunno what I'd do with that amount of space XD
[21:55:50] <JustAberrant> but I just love having ridiculous scale things
[21:57:20] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: that's the thing, I had almost an obsession about having just about every resource I needed automated.. so I had various farms for wood/mobs/ores/etc, tanks of all the various liquid things, and all the automated stuff for putting items together.. but once I get to that point I don't do anything with it :D
[21:58:33] <HoneyDrops> I will automate stuff too, my goal is always to emulate creative mode in survival.  However, I don't generally build a massive farm, just maybe 5 9x9 plots and let it run for longer to build up 1M+ of whatever.
[21:59:21] <JustAberrant> most of my farms actually were about that size, I just had a whole lot of them
[21:59:40] <JustAberrant> also I do tend to space stuff out rather inefficiently
[21:59:46] <JustAberrant> http://justaberrant.com/images/minecraft/2014-10-14_00.29.08.png  <-- random pic :D
[22:00:04] <HoneyDrops> But for most resources I default to cursed earth + grinders in the end, self-powered via ender gens and the pearls and mob essense drive spawners/grinders for all other mob drops.  I just do that for farm animals too >_>  Then end-game is always MFR mining lasers.
[22:01:11] <HoneyDrops> I am obsessive in trying to cram builds into the smallest space I can, hence why I will rebuild a particular setup a dozen times, each making it a little smaller or a little more efficient.
[22:01:32] <JustAberrant> hehe, I'm like the exact opposite, I like having things spaced out and reasy to follow :>
[22:01:40] <JustAberrant> * easy
[22:02:19] <JustAberrant> like the pic I just showed was one of a few distributions hubs that sent stuff out to other sections, which were all similarily laid out (you can kinda see one in the background)
[22:02:21] <JustAberrant> all very orderly ;p
[22:02:48] <HoneyDrops> I hide cables away, even lighting is microblocks hidden in the floor/ceiling, so my bases look like machines in walls in long corridors, unless you go into the cable run passages.

[22:04:25] <HoneyDrops> AE for /alll/ storage.
[22:04:40] <JustAberrant> I use AE to manage everything
[22:04:47] <JustAberrant> when I played I don't think AE could do liquids
[22:04:58] <HoneyDrops> It doesn't need the other mod.

[22:05:41] <JustAberrant> damnit now I really do want to play
[22:06:09] <JustAberrant> but yeah, once you get AE so it can make it's own components, storage ceases to become an issue :D
[22:06:31] <HoneyDrops> Must be early in that game... only 1.5k diamonds?
[22:07:06] <JustAberrant> either that or around the time I made a pixel art that used diamond blocks :>
