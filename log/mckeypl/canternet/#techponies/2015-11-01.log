[00:03:25] <Sour_Creep> Why would somebody use OS X in a VM? Well at least apart from software development.
[00:03:48] <Caerdwyn> uh, cause i dont have a mac?
[00:04:02] <Caerdwyn> nor another spare computer to try and "properly" build a hackintosh on?
[00:06:04] <Sour_Creep> The question is more why would I use OS X if I can get a full Linux :-)
[00:06:28] <Caerdwyn> just curious to see/use OS X for once in my life
[00:06:42] <Caerdwyn> never having owned a mac, or been able to get on one and use one, I'd like to experience it once
[00:11:33] <Caerdwyn> aaaaand tada, here goes the crash on reboot
[00:11:34] <Caerdwyn> http://i.imgur.com/qfaJFva.png
[00:11:42] <Caerdwyn> didnt even make it off the installer, and bam. dead.
[00:12:30] <Caerdwyn> Ghostiolus: any ideas?
[00:13:44] <Ghostiolus> I have no idea honestly.
[00:13:52] <Ghostiolus> Hackintosh, even in a VM, is a clusterfuck.
[00:13:59] <Ghostiolus> It takes hours of work and a lot of reading.
[00:14:05] <Ghostiolus> Make sure you‚Äôre following the guide well.
[00:14:10] <Caerdwyn> ..yeah, i've been at this for like..a week now
[00:14:36] <Caerdwyn> I just this morning, got it to finally boot up with a newer version of Chimera and iBoot.. it installs, everything boots, but it only crashes on shutdown
[00:14:43] <Moonlightning> init d
[00:14:44] <Moonlightning> >:O
[00:14:54] <Ghostiolus> Well, that seems like‚Ä¶ just something to deal with?
[00:14:55] <Caerdwyn> and no amount of googling that kext or its dependency has gotten me any closer to /what/ is broken
[00:15:03] <Ghostiolus> Like if the system works and it just crashes on shutdown, oh well?
[00:15:07] <Ghostiolus> Shutting it down anyway.
[00:15:49] <Caerdwyn> well, thats the thing... when its crashing on shutdown, when I force reboot the vm, it will reboot with systemShutdownCause 3, which I guess is the VM equivalent of "aborted", and it keeps running fsck constantly, and sometimes, if I reboot it enough times, will completely freeze when it hits the desktop
[00:15:57] <Caerdwyn> or the cursor becomes the spinning beachball of death and does nothing.
[00:16:10] <Caerdwyn> so it seems its losing data on shutdown or something, or at least corrupting it on some level
[00:16:46] <Ghostiolus> I have no idea, I‚Äôve never had done much 10.6 VM because it ends up s low as shit even when ti works.
[00:16:58] <Ghostiolus> Try clearing the caches I guess, v0v.
[00:17:47] <Caerdwyn> how do you do that?
[00:17:57] <Caerdwyn> ..ive never touched os x in my life, so you're talking french to me right now >_<
[00:18:21] <Caerdwyn> that screenshot was literally it shutting down from a fresh OS install... I havent even booted it back up yet
[00:18:38] <Caerdwyn> gonna change the acceleration settings, maybe take away a few cores from it or something and see if that helps, i dont even know anymore
[00:18:43] <Ghostiolus> I don‚Äôt have the command on hand you‚Äôll have to look it up.
[00:19:03] <Ghostiolus> Make sure you‚Äôre sticking to the guide at all points.
[00:19:19] <Caerdwyn> i am
[00:19:34] <Ghostiolus> -f -x -v generally boots it for me in safe mode, those switches i remeber
[00:20:09] <Caerdwyn> discard cache, safe mode, and verbose... got it
[00:20:48] <Ghostiolus> if it manages to boot with those, try just -f
[00:21:08] <init7> Do --spooky-boot
[00:21:15] <Caerdwyn> hurr hurr :P
[00:21:39] <Caerdwyn> busy shutting down the other 11 vms i had running
[00:21:42] <Caerdwyn> running out of ram lol
[00:27:40] <Ghostiolus> if you want to just experiment with osx itself, pearpc can do up to 10.4
[00:32:22] <Caerdwyn> I have multibeast running in the vm now, its updating and installing some kexts that are apparently missing from the system, one of them is nullcpupowermanagement.kext or something that is apparently required for Core*-whatever cpus, especially if being used in a VM
[00:32:28] <Caerdwyn> lemme see if this does anything
[00:34:04] *** zz_CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob
[00:34:51] <Ghostiolus> i wonder if 10.6 woudl work on a haswell native
[00:34:57] <Ghostiolus> man that would be hilariously fast
[00:35:12] <Ghostiolus> doubt it though, hackintosh compatibility seems to go a year either direction of the OSes release
[00:36:27] <Caerdwyn> yeah, i wish
[00:37:29] <Caerdwyn> im wondering if its just 10.6 thats giving this many issues
[00:37:33] <Ghostiolus> I wanna install 10.6 on my 2013 retina macbook but that ain‚Äôt happening at all lol
[00:37:36] <Ghostiolus> it‚Äôs possible
[00:37:39] <Caerdwyn> most new guides for hackintoshes are on 10.10 now
[00:37:53] <Caerdwyn> whoop, narrowed it down to one error now http://i.imgur.com/1gphFsB.png
[00:37:57] <Caerdwyn> AppleSMC
[00:38:11] <Caerdwyn> now if someone can tell me what /that/ thing does, maybe i can get somewhere lol
[00:38:48] <Ghostiolus> AppleSMC probably refers to the SMC chip on macs that does a lot of basic stuff like temperature management.
[00:39:12] <Ghostiolus> I have no idea how to approach that from a hackintosh, I believe the DSDT is supposed to emulate it.
[00:39:16] <Moonlightning> replace the SMC stuff with a dummy that returns success on everything sane and does nothing.
[00:39:21] <Moonlightning> I mean, you don't need it‚Ä¶this is a VM! XP
[00:39:23] <Caerdwyn> well, i installed FakeSMC and EasyDSDT already
[00:39:29] <Ghostiolus> no idea then
[00:39:33] <Moonlightning> temperature control et al are handled at a lower layer
[00:39:34] <Caerdwyn> yeah, thats what lost me too
[00:40:09] <Moonlightning> Hey, AppleDash
[00:40:20] <Moonlightning> search the entire v4 address space. You like doing that, right?
[00:40:49] <Moonlightning> See if you can get the Twitch Installs Arch box. Root password is 'kappa'.
[00:41:54] <howlingwolfy> curl da.gd/ip from the box, get public IP (but last I looked this was being done in a VM so inbound connections are likely impossible)
[00:42:19] <Moonlightning> or just `ifconfig`; it's shorter
[00:42:22] <Moonlightning> ‚Ä¶oh, wait.
[00:42:28] <Webster> Even if it's not it's probably behind a router blocking it.
[00:46:33] <Caerdwyn> Moonlightning: what would happen if I deleted AppleSMC.kext from the machine...
[00:46:45] <Ghostiolus> rename it and see what happens
[00:46:52] <Ghostiolus> call it applesmc.fart
[00:47:00] <Ghostiolus> and then remember to boot with cleared cashes
[00:47:02] <Ghostiolus> caches
[00:47:03] <Caerdwyn> assuming a big kernel panic?
[00:47:04] <Ghostiolus> cashews
[00:47:32] * Moonlightning stuffs Ghostiolus with cashews.
[00:47:58] <Ghostiolus> o3o
[00:48:01] <Ghostiolus> that‚Äôs my fetish
[00:48:06] <Ghostiolus> except I do the stuffing
[00:48:07] <Ghostiolus> o4o
[00:48:34] <Caerdwyn> o.o
[00:49:11] <Caerdwyn> so yeah, that did nothing
[00:49:26] <Caerdwyn> just hangs on library kext not found
[00:50:32] <howlingwolfy> Caerdwyn: applesmc.kext is required to boot OS X and the chip also functions as the hardware lock that shows OS X whether it is a legit Apple machine or not
[00:50:43] <howlingwolfy> Caerdwyn: don't use FakeSMC on virtualbox, instead do something much more illegal but much simpler:
[00:50:48] <howlingwolfy> VBoxManage setextradata "Your VM Name" VBoxInternal2/SmcDeviceKey "ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)AppleComputerInc"
[00:50:49] <Caerdwyn> ?
[00:51:06] <Caerdwyn> lol..seriously?
[00:51:09] <howlingwolfy> you.
[00:51:11] <howlingwolfy> yes*
[00:51:13] <howlingwolfy> yes.  seriously.
[00:51:22] <Caerdwyn> omg, I just have to try this now
[00:51:42] * Moonlightning blinks.
[00:51:51] <Moonlightning> Is that last string actually checked for‚Ä¶?
[00:52:04] <Caerdwyn> ive /heard/ of that long string before
[00:52:07] <Caerdwyn> i always thought it was a joke...
[00:52:27] <howlingwolfy> Moonlightning: yes.  it is.
[00:52:58] <Caerdwyn> alright, its set, lemme fire it back up
[00:53:16] <howlingwolfy> Moonlightning: it's an ascii representation of the key the SMC has onboard (it is read out in hex, bytes, big endian)
[00:53:48] <Ghostiolus> wait what
[00:53:57] <Ghostiolus> does that even actually work, howlingwolfy? I‚Äôve never heard of that before.
[00:54:17] <howlingwolfy> Ghostiolus: yes.
[00:54:19] <Ghostiolus> also lol at that string, I guess since it could be anything they had a bit of fun with it
[00:54:32] <Caerdwyn> howlingwolfy: nope, still kernel panic on shutdown with com.apple.driver.AppleSMC and org.netkas.FakeSMC as the two culprits
[00:54:33] <Ghostiolus> since it‚Äôs not like 99.9% of users can even fake that
[00:54:56] <howlingwolfy> Caerdwyn: remove FakeSMC
[00:54:57] <Caerdwyn> assuming I should find a way to remove FakeSMC and try again?
[00:55:00] <Caerdwyn> ok
[00:55:00] <howlingwolfy> Caerdwyn: it's interfering
[00:55:00] <Moonlightning> there's also a com.apple.Dont_Steal_Mac_OS_X kext
[00:55:05] <howlingwolfy> DSMOS
[00:55:08] <Caerdwyn> omg
[00:55:13] <Ghostiolus> That‚Äôs what DSMOS is!??!
[00:55:14] <Caerdwyn> so that's what "Waiting on DSMOS..."
[00:55:15] * Ghostiolus gasp
[00:55:18] <Caerdwyn> DSMOS has arrived
[00:55:20] <Caerdwyn> xD
[00:55:20] <howlingwolfy> yes
[00:55:23] <howlingwolfy> that is what it is
[00:55:30] <Ghostiolus> I had no idea I just thought of DSMOS as like
[00:55:31] <Caerdwyn> can that be removed too? XD
[00:55:33] <Ghostiolus> some abstract apple go
[00:55:35] <Ghostiolus> dgod
[00:55:39] <howlingwolfy> I used to be uh, involved with this stuff >.>
[00:55:50] <Ghostiolus> woah an apple engineer
[00:55:50] <e> woah
[00:55:51] <Ghostiolus> HEY
[00:55:56] <Moonlightning> o.o ?
[00:55:56] <Ghostiolus> WHAT‚ÄôS WITH THE PENTALOBE SCREWS EH
[00:55:59] * Ghostiolus shakes howlingwolfy
[00:56:03] <howlingwolfy> no, not an apple engineer, lmao
[00:56:06] <Caerdwyn> howlingwolfy: can I delete that DSMOS kext too? lol
[00:56:10] * Ghostiolus shakes anyway
[00:56:16] <Moonlightning> Caerdwyn: DSMOS has departed?
[00:56:18] <howlingwolfy> I was part of the JaS team around 10.4.8
[00:56:22] <Ghostiolus> o
[00:56:24] <howlingwolfy> actually, even 10.4.6, but that was like
[00:56:25] <Ghostiolus> Oh hey, howlingwolfy.
[00:56:29] <howlingwolfy> very very very buggy
[00:56:36] <Moonlightning> JaS?
[00:56:39] <Ghostiolus> Pentium 3, no SSE2- is that at all possible, even if stupid, to run OSX?
[00:56:52] <Ghostiolus> IT‚Äôs a fuckin‚Äô fast PIII and I would love to just for sillies.
[00:56:57] <howlingwolfy> Ghostiolus: the pentalobe screws are for 'protection' (read: to prevent you from taking it apart and fixing it yourself)
[00:57:03] <howlingwolfy> ah
[00:57:17] <howlingwolfy> 10.4 might do with legacy_kernel, but you won't be able to do much with it
[00:57:18] <Ghostiolus> well i bought my own screwdrivers and did indeed fix ‚Äòit‚Äô myself.
[00:57:31] <Ghostiolus> ‚Äòit‚Äô happened to be the keyboard backlight cable pinned under the board
[00:57:32] <howlingwolfy> OS X was entirely built with -msse2
[00:57:34] <Ghostiolus> i was so happy to fix that :)
[00:57:58] <howlingwolfy> notable apps that will SIGILL on your pentium 3 will be safari, quicktime, finder, xcode, and mail
[00:58:02] <Ghostiolus> now I dust it out ever few months.
[00:58:05] <howlingwolfy> however, address book and iCal work
[00:58:09] <HoneyDrops> Yeah, it's annoying to have to get special drivers, but I picked up a cheap set that had most all of the "special" bits.
[00:58:11] <Ghostiolus> so basically I could tehcnically make it owrk, but it‚Äôs pointless?
[00:58:28] <howlingwolfy> Ghostiolus: you'll be lucky to get it to open anything at all without recompiling Finder.
[00:58:38] <Ghostiolus> also I got the OSX 10.6 installer to run just fine on my 2013 retina but I can‚Äôt run the OS at all ugh.
[00:58:39] <howlingwolfy> I don't think I have *ANY* of my old JaS stuff
[00:58:41] <Ghostiolus> I really want to ;_;
[00:58:43] <Moonlightning> You can theoretically run anything on any turing-compatible(-but-with-finite-resources) box
[00:58:52] <Moonlightning> that doesn't mean it will be easy, or fast
[00:58:58] <Caerdwyn> howlingwolfy: I can't find FakeSMC.kext in System/Library/Extensions
[00:59:00] <Caerdwyn> wtf.
[00:59:08] <Ghostiolus> it‚Äôs in extra
[00:59:09] <Ghostiolus> i believe
[00:59:10] <Caerdwyn> there's not even anything in there that has "fake" in it
[00:59:12] <howlingwolfy> Ghostiolus: it is probably in /Extra/Extensions
[00:59:13] <Caerdwyn> oh
[00:59:15] <howlingwolfy> er
[00:59:16] <howlingwolfy> Caerdwyn: 
[00:59:21] <Moonlightning> /Extra? O.o
[00:59:32] <Caerdwyn> yep, it is
[00:59:37] <Caerdwyn> found it, lemme murderize it
[00:59:41] <howlingwolfy> Moonlightning: Chameleon and derivatives 'inject' any extensions in /Extra into OS X without being signed
[00:59:56] <Moonlightning> ah.
[01:00:01] <howlingwolfy> Moonlightning: basically it's the stuff you have to have in earlyboot to make OS X run on non-Apple (and non-Intel) machines
[01:00:07] <Caerdwyn> should I bother killing off IntelCPUMonitor.kext too since this is a VM, or will it matter?
[01:00:14] <howlingwolfy> Caerdwyn: NOOOOOO
[01:00:18] <howlingwolfy> you need to leave that alone
[01:00:33] <Moonlightning> ‚ÄúNOOOOOO,‚Äù she howled
[01:00:35] <howlingwolfy> you also will require nullcpupowermanagement if you have >1 core

[01:06:28] <Moonlightning> if you're going to keep ancient compatabilities?
[01:08:16] <howlingwolfy> Moonlightning: well, I mean, UEFI uses FAT32 just because every OS ever (including BSD, OS X, etc) can read it.
[01:08:29] <howlingwolfy> it's not a good FS, it doesn't even have permissions or anything
[01:08:37] <howlingwolfy> and sure, there are extXfs drivers for UEFI, and NTFS, and HFS+
[01:09:05] <Moonlightning> ‚Ä¶we need a new baselevel Fs
[01:09:24] <Moonlightning> simple but /modern/
[01:09:32] <Moonlightning> FAT's been around too long
[01:09:36] <Moonlightning> it's gotten FAT >:(
[01:11:01] <Caerdwyn> ext4 or gtfo.
[01:12:07] <Ghostiolus> o3o fat
[01:12:28] <Ghostiolus> Fat32 is a horrible OS but it works with everything and, well, it‚Äôs not like you store much on the UEFI partition.
[01:12:32] <Ghostiolus> i mean horrible fs
[01:14:01] <Ghostiolus> I think it might be because, like, what else are you going to use for a universal partition? EXT4? complex. NTFS? Proprietory.
[01:15:00] <howlingwolfy> the other "universal" FS I can think of may be HPFS, that's also proprietary.. and it sucks.. but NT, Linux, BSD can all read it, lol

[01:18:11] <HoneyDrops> ext2?

[01:18:43] <HoneyDrops> Well fuck them.

[11:41:51] <Dividenstein> Caerdwyn and Moonlightning, 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2, Verizon's DNS servers, are also respectable.  (re: the Turkey/Twitter thing.)
[11:41:57] *** Dividenstein is now known as Divide
[11:42:16] <Moonlightning> > Verizon
[11:42:36] <Divide> True.
[11:42:52] <Divide> I should perhaps state that they're /Level3's/ servers.
[11:43:53] <Moonlightning> O.o ?
[11:46:33] <Divide> Level3 Communications are, at their core, the provider of a number of services for communication suppliers in the US and Canada, such as DNS.
[11:47:05] <Moonlightning> They're one of the center-of-the-internet organizations.
[11:47:09] <Divide> Level3 most notably handles Verizon, which uses 4.2.2.1/4.2.2.2 as their DNS servers... yupyup.
[11:47:28] <Moonlightning> So it's properly Level3, and Level3 is not Verizon or a Verizon subsidiary or anything.
[11:47:39] <Moonlightning> It's just that Verizon tells their customers to use Level3's DNS servers.
[11:48:08] * Divide nodnods.
[11:49:21] <Divide> 4.2.2.x (1 through 6), really, are Level3's servers.  Which makes it all the more appropriate that Google's are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.
[11:50:47] <johnsey> should also keep in mind that you can always run your own resolver
[11:51:42] <Divide> Well, of course.  If you're able to access your modem's information, the DNS resolver provided through DHCP usually works just fine.
[11:52:47] <Divide> And unlike Google's more public servers, Level3 does offer their DNS servers to ISPs at a price, which means that they discourage folks from connecting to it otherwise.
[11:56:42] <johnsey> if they really cared though, they'd block traffic to it from outside their network
[12:09:33] <Divide> True.

[13:15:11] <johnsey> ^
[13:15:56] <Phase> Sour_Creep, those issues and more just make it painful to work with
[13:16:19] <Phase> really i'd prefer C++ to PHP for any larger project
[13:16:24] <Phase> better debuggers for C++
[13:17:55] <Sour_Creep> Most of those things have any impact really.
[13:18:07] <Sour_Creep> don't
[13:18:28] <Phase> read the second one as well
[13:20:42] <Sour_Creep> Some things about PHP are weird and bad, I agree, but a lot is fixed in more recent version even though they can be confusing (e.g. mysql_real_escape_string)
[13:21:20] * Phase was about to mention real_escape_string
[13:22:09] <Sour_Creep> But you shouldn't really use it anyway. Use prepared statements
[13:22:12] <Phase> Sour_Creep, my understanding is there was a bug/security problem where mysql_escape_string didn't consider the current character set, so a second function was added
[13:22:42] <Sour_Creep> Correct
[13:23:21] <Sour_Creep> the lack of proper UTF-8 support is something I would agree is a flaw
[13:23:27] <Phase> i would call that nasty, nust just confusing
[13:23:32] <Phase> not just'
[13:24:55] <Phase> the error/exception duality
[13:25:31] <Sour_Creep> The error message thing mentioned on one site is absolutely correct the way it is. It mentions where the compiler/parser encounters the error. A dev should now himself what it means and where to look for it.
[13:25:47] <Sour_Creep> know*
[13:25:54] <Phase> Sour_Creep, you say they don't affect much yet i've hit a chunk of them in practice
[13:26:31] <Phase> the empty() and instanceof ones are just being worked out now, finally
[13:26:41] <Phase> they're making a proper parser and ast
[13:27:31] <Sour_Creep> I never used empty() and don't see any reason why anyone should use it
[13:29:20] <Phase> that mindset is the other half of eevee's argument
[13:32:52] <Phase> it's the "memorize a thousand strange exceptions and surprising behaviors" bit i have most trouble with
[13:32:55] <Phase> my god the io lag
[13:32:58] <Phase> moving so many files
[13:33:27] <Phase> off to bed soon also
[13:33:44] <Sour_Creep> There are complaints in the doc that make no sense at all. Like PHP doesn't support threading. Why shoudl it support threading O_o?
[13:33:58] <Sour_Creep> Phase: Good night ^^
[13:34:33] <Phase> Sour_Creep, whenever i'm writing php the vast majority of the time is spent checking exactly what a function returns, especially stuff like strpos where 0 == false == string either at the start or not found
[13:35:02] <Sour_Creep> use ===
[13:35:32] <Phase> since false coerces to 0 because of course it does, and number has priority in conversion
[13:35:33] <Phase> coercion
[13:36:04] <Phase> Sour_Creep,  yes use ===, but i need to know if its returning 0 or false, or true, or 1, or something else entierly
[13:36:42] <Sour_Creep> if($var === false) ?!
[13:37:03] <Sour_Creep> If I recall correctly that should be false for 0
[13:38:11] <Sour_Creep> I don't use == at all unless there is a need for it
[13:38:13] <Phase> that is false for 0, but i 'm talking about return values
[13:40:04] <Sour_Creep> You need to do different things based the return value anyway. So an if statement solves it, doesn't it?
[13:40:51] <Phase> you're missing the point, iirc strpos returns false for not found, 0 for the start of the string
[13:41:33] <Sour_Creep> And where is the problem? It's not like 0 and false are exaclty the same
[13:41:38] <Phase> so if(strpos($x, $y) == false) {...};
[13:42:00] <Sour_Creep> don't use ==, problem solved
[13:42:01] <Phase> see how easy the == vs === mistake is to make? i just made it, but that's not my point
[13:42:09] * Phase was trying to type ===
[13:42:39] <Phase> whats the one that returns -1 on failure...
[13:42:45] <Phase> it's been quite some time since i wrote php
[13:44:53] <Phase> Sour_Creep, read the eevee thing, scroll down to 'Parts of PHP are practically designed to produce buggy code'
[13:44:57] * Phase is off to bed now
[13:46:19] <Phase> Sour_Creep, "For a more type-safe ==, we have ===. For a more type-safe <, we haveÖ nothing." so now you need boilerplate around every < and >
[13:46:37] <Phase> actually sleepign now
[13:46:38] <Phase> gnithg
[13:46:39] <johnsey> another good example: intval() will return 0 if used on a string that doesn't contain a number and 1 if erroneously used on an object
[13:46:48] <Phase> ^^^^^^
[13:48:34] <Sour_Creep> Why on earth would anyone use intval() anyway?
[13:48:38] <Phase> Sour_Creep, and the behaviour in most of these cases isn't "error" or "throw an exception" or "print a warning", it's "silently do the wrong thing", which is why my head is burried in documentation whenever doing php, trying to avoid those issues later when they're much harder to use
[13:48:41] <Phase> there you go again
[13:49:05] <Phase> Sour_Creep, if you wanted to convert something to an integer
[13:49:13] <Phase> intval("12") === 12
[13:49:13] <Sour_Creep> You don't need to?
[13:50:00] <Phase> https://github.com/search?l=PHP&q=intval&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93
[13:50:02] <PinkiePieBot> [ Search ¬∑ intval ¬∑ GitHub ]
[13:50:07] <Sour_Creep> I've encountered intval only in applications that have security issue so far.
[13:50:14] <johnsey> IMHO a language having functions where you wonder why on earth someone would use them is seriously flawed
[13:50:14] <Phase> apparently people use it to round
[13:51:04] <Phase> Sour_Creep, and is this magical whitelist of safe functions stored anywhere useful? http://php.net/manual/en/function.intval.php certainly doesn't say to avoid it
[13:51:04] <PinkiePieBot> [ PHP: intval - Manual ]
[13:51:49] <Sour_Creep> This is stupid. Use a proper function. The only valueable use of intval is in mixed string where you only need the int part and have to check it anyway (e.g. userinput)
[13:51:50] <Phase> aNYWAY
[13:51:51] <Phase> BED
[13:52:08] <Phase> Sour_Creep, USE A PROPER FUNCTION!?!? LIKE WHAT?
[13:52:13] <Phase> is intval() not proper?
[13:52:31] <Phase> you have a string, you want number, yet can't use intval()?
[13:52:40] <Sour_Creep> Also it mentions in the manual not to use it on objects and it will throw a warning
[13:52:57] <Phase> but intval(false) is totally fine
[13:53:04] <Sour_Creep> Phase: It is, but only for very limited usecases
[13:53:33] <Sour_Creep> People not knowing what they're doing will produce buggy code in any language

[21:56:03] <Moonlightning> > 00-00-00 means 2000-00-00, which is 1999-12-00, which is 1999-11-30
[21:56:12] <Moonlightning> The first leg makes sense.
[21:56:23] <Moonlightning> The last leg also makes sense, assuming I'm not derping and November actually has more than 29 days.
[21:56:35] <Moonlightning> But why the hell does 2000-00-00‚Äîoh.
[21:56:39] <Moonlightning> no zero month or day
[22:10:57] <Phase> it's not *unreasonable* but most other libraries would return some sort of error
[22:11:32] <Moonlightning> Yeah
[22:11:40] <Moonlightning> nah, that's ambiguously invalid for me
[22:12:11] <Moonlightning> If you had a Date 2000-01-01, and you said go to the previous month, /then/ it would make sense to go to 1999-12
[22:12:32] <Moonlightning> But that's not the kind of thing that should be done during parsing.

[22:15:29] <PinkiePieBot> [ CSS: centering things ]
[22:15:31] <Moonlightning> s/$/in the page, without doing tables or making it effectively text or some weird shit like that/
[22:16:03] <Phase> add a center class or something, apply that to the <form>?
[22:16:06] <Moonlightning> and without setting the width
[22:16:16] <Moonlightning> I don't know the width.
[22:16:22] <Moonlightning> And I don't want to calculate it and hardcode it
[22:16:30] <Moonlightning> because then if I change the thing, it'll break
[22:20:55] <Webster> Try the margin: 0 auto 0 auto; thing?
[22:21:08] <Webster> May also have to display:block or whatever.
[22:21:19] <Moonlightning> Doesn't `display: block;` just‚Ä¶make it a block

[22:46:13] <Moonlightning> ‚Ä¶hmmmm‚Ä¶should I be wrapping lines of HTML? o.o
[22:50:14] <Seoson> <Moonlightning>	nah, that's ambiguously invalid for me: The function allows strings that other libs woudn't even support (e.g. next Thursday), so they already went for a non strict approach.
[22:51:15] <Moonlightning> Seoson: the GNU getdate() does that too
[22:51:41] <Webster> Moonlightning: I wouldn't suggest wrapping HTML unless it's an absurdly long line for some reason.
[22:51:43] <Moonlightning> YEt‚Ä¶

[22:51:46] <Moonlightning> date: invalid date '2000-00-00'
[22:51:56] <Seoson> Also strictly speaking if it was a lib written by me any two digit year would cause an error
[22:52:37] <Seoson> Because fuck 2 digit years ;-) We don't need another y2k
[22:52:40] <Moonlightning> Webster: how long is absurdly long?
[22:52:55] <Moonlightning> Seoson: next one would be 2k1h
[22:52:57] <Moonlightning> or whatever
[22:53:22] <Webster> More than two screen widths
[22:55:07] <Moonlightning> So 362 columns?
[22:55:08] <Moonlightning> xP
[22:57:41] <Seoson> To continue a little further (I'm sorry if it's annoying) what does your prefered lib say about 24:00:00, because this is an edge case as well. Strictly technically speaking it should throw an error here as well.
[22:59:26] <Phase> Moonlightning, 2080', i believe that tends to be the cutoff for two digit years being 19** or 20**
[22:59:35] <Phase> though it depends on the system, on windows its configurable
[22:59:37] <HoneyDrops> I would say 24:00:00 should error as well.
