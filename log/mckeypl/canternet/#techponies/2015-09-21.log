[02:17:25] <init3> intresting
[02:28:33] <Colgate> lol
[02:34:15] <init3> Wiy did Windows update take over an hour to download 45M on a 100mbit connection? It seems I don't have a rootkit or any active malware (at least that can be detected by the three programs I tried) Just windows is having a fit over it not being booted for 4 months. 
[02:34:46] <JustAberrant> you can only download as fast as the server serves it
[02:34:54] <init3> I don't think that's it. 
[02:35:34] <init3> Because it went from 2% to 99% as fast as I'd expect. But it stayed at 1% for like 10 minutes and 99% for about 45.
[02:36:11] <JustAberrant> :(
[02:36:25] <Colgate> that happens all the time
[02:36:29] <Colgate> or it just sits at 0%
[02:36:38] <Colgate> I've just come to expect that from windows update
[02:36:43] <init3> So... do you just wait?
[02:36:55] <Colgate> yeah, not like I sit there watching the update anyways
[02:37:03] <Colgate> it could take a week for all I care
[02:37:14] <init3> I kind of thought it was a root kit lol
[02:37:27] <init3> and did all the things you'd do if that were the case. 
[02:37:53] <JustAberrant> the only real response to a rootkit is a reinstall imo
[02:38:18] <Colgate> nah, this happens even on fresh installs, I think it happens when the background and foreground windows udpaters get in a fight
[02:38:19] <init3> My issue is I dual boot and I hate to spend any more time in windows than I need to. I just felt that it not updating for so long could be bad if I ever actually needed my windows install.

[03:02:04] <init3> I guess the other thing of it is when I am using windows, it is almost definitley because I am playing a game. The exact time I /don't/ want WU to be updating. I'm honestly not even comfortable surfing the web on windows because I don't trust myself to remember to update every little fucking thing that needs to be updated for you to not get rekt. 
[03:03:17] <init3> Like, Java, FF, flash, windows and shit like that. They don't update all at once so I never fucking remember to hit all of them. And because I use my windows pretty much exclusively for games having auto updaters is a horrible idea.

[13:35:35] <Lapsus> I just hate how it's all "THE KEY FOR TERRORISTS"
[13:35:46] <Lapsus> I'm going to print one, and I'm not a terrorist
[13:35:59] <Lapsus> nor will I ever visit New York City
[13:45:15] <johnsey> ShivalWolf: my point is that the media is not to blame for the security problem
[13:47:09] <Lapsus> They are to blame for distributing the image so widely, but then again once it's out, it's out
[13:49:20] <Seoson> Like hiding something that was already published ever worked on the internet
[13:49:48] <Lapsus> I would say that the ones designing the key also have made the best effort that they reasonably could to prevent attacks that were viable when the key was first made, it's only really recently that getting restricted key blanks and making duplicates from photos is easily doable by joe schmoe who has access to a 3d printer via his local library or whatever
[13:50:16] <johnsey> the issue is already known since 2013, seeing that a law against possessing such a key has been introduced. hence, it's a bit late for responsible disclosure 
[13:51:00] <Lapsus> yeah, fair enough
[13:51:29] <Lapsus> hopefully people will learn eventually that "hey can I get a really good photo of your key" is something that should get a no
[13:51:37] <Seoson> Well if you really are a terrorist even a missing 3d printer wouldn't stop you. It's not like those things are impossible to replicate without one
[13:52:05] <Lapsus> Seoson: yeah, it's not impossible to mill a blank that will fit the keyway and then file out a working key
[13:52:32] <Lapsus> it's just even easier with a printer well-tuned enough to print keys :p
[13:52:58] <Seoson> Yeah key impressioning is a thing. There were even talks on defcon
[13:53:01] <Lapsus> also, the skype outage is apparently news now http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34312694

[13:53:25] <PinkiePieBot> [ Smart Froc, The World's First Smart Highchair by Froc — Kickstarter ]
[13:53:42] <Lapsus> Yeah, the key duplication thing is only getting media attention because it's so easy at this point
[13:53:59] <Seoson> What it really comes down to is that most physical keys have design flaws atm.
[13:54:20] <Lapsus> I could grab the tsa_keys.stl file and have a fresh set in probably 45 minutes
[13:54:23] <Seoson> But people won't move away from them until attacks becomes more wide spread.
[13:55:00] <Seoson> Like always something bad needs to happen first.
[13:55:03] <Lapsus> Well, keys with interactive elements in the key and whatnot are still safe for now
[13:55:23] <Lapsus> as are some weirdo keys that have covers that only open when in the lock
[13:55:33] <Seoson> That's why I said "most"
[13:55:42] <johnsey> weirdo keys? they're not so uncommon for security locks over here
[13:55:56] <Lapsus> then again, locks have always been more to keep the honest people honest for the most part
[13:56:04] <Lapsus> they're not an impassable barrier on their own
[13:56:34] <Seoson> It's useally easier just to use a screw driver on a window anyway.
[13:56:52] <Lapsus> or a nearby rock, for that matter
[13:57:00] <Seoson> But for high profile targets these attacks are worth the effort.
[13:57:09] <Lapsus> yeah exactly
[13:58:10] <Lapsus> locks are excellent in combination with other things, or other locks for that matter
[14:00:02] <Lapsus> okay right, appointment, gotta go again
