[00:47:47] <Gladiolus> It’s funny because I actually do use OSX. Doesn’t mean I don’t recognize it’s weaknesses tho.
[00:50:39] <Kinsley> I like OS X when it is trying to be Unix. I don't like OS X when it's trying to be iOS.

[00:54:14] <Sour_Sweet> I give Apple credit for OS X. They made Unix mainstream and pushed Unix/Linux gaming, even though that's probably not what they intended to do.

[03:23:54] <PinkiePieBot> [ Makers of notoriously insecure Java software ordered to help PC users clean it up ]
[03:26:13] <HoneyDrops> I think there should be a requirement if admitted wrongdoing.
[03:27:27] <HoneyDrops> I would argue that only under clearly accidental/uninteinitonal situations companies should be required to admit they screwed up/did something wrong, that's like the /bare minimum/ of any agreement.
[03:27:54] <Moonlightning> Obaskyr: yeah; I love the font and the behavior
[03:28:16] <Obaskyr> <3
[03:28:22] <ShivalWolf> they dont like admitting wrongdoing and try to avoid it as much as possible but like to make token gestures that they are helping
[03:28:27] <Moonlightning> They added an option in Yosemite to make it flash the screen on bells if the sound is muted
[03:28:33] <ShivalWolf> admit wrongdoing and they can be sued alot easier
[03:28:43] <HoneyDrops> That is half the point
[03:28:53] <Obaskyr> The font and stuff is configurable, it's the little stuff like bells and tabbing that makes it awesome
[03:29:05] <ShivalWolf> soo many companies manage to wheezle out of adminiting they are at fault
[03:29:07] <Moonlightning> I haven't found a Linux terminal emulator that I like as much.
[03:29:15] <HoneyDrops> A comapay should never be able to dodge liability via an agreement with any party other than the wronged one.
[03:29:17] <ShivalWolf> but make grand token gestures that are basicly yeah we fucked up here have money
[03:29:18] <Obaskyr> Me either.
[03:29:22] <Moonlightning> And I want the font for my `tty`s. The one I currently have is horrendous. :I
[03:29:29] <Moonlightning> …tabbing?
[03:29:39] <HoneyDrops> You get hit by the FTC, then you better line up for every last customer you wronged.
[03:29:55] <Obaskyr> You can have several tabs in a terminal window, and switch between them
[03:30:05] <Obaskyr> Just like a browser
[03:30:13] <Moonlightning> Oh. I use tmux for that.
[03:30:18] <HoneyDrops> I don't see a point in tabbed terminals
[03:30:19] <ShivalWolf> it would be amusing if oracle had to pay out to every single user
[03:30:23] <Moonlightning> ^2
[03:30:34] <Moonlightning> I usually have two full-screen terminals open, and that's it
[03:30:40] <Obaskyr> I keep one for irssi, one for SSH to my bnc
[03:30:41] <HoneyDrops> Better would be to take away thier IP and make it public domain :D
[03:30:49] <ShivalWolf> lol
[03:30:50] <Moonlightning> One with my tmux session attached
[03:30:57] <Moonlightning> The other running `cat >/dev/null` and no shell
[03:30:58] <HoneyDrops> Or revoke corporate charter
[03:31:09] <HoneyDrops> which really should happen, far more often.
[03:31:16] <ShivalWolf> would be nice
[03:31:19] <Moonlightning> ^
[03:31:35] <HoneyDrops> Fines are pointless, as you can basically just risk/reward those away.
[03:31:54] <HoneyDrops> The whole point is to say "don't do this or you will /cease to be/"
[03:32:01] *** Sour_Sweet is now known as Sour_Sweet|BNC
[03:32:27] <HoneyDrops> Also revoking charters opens them up to personal liability
[03:33:50] <Obaskyr> tabs are useful for me because I use a CLI irc client.
[03:36:55] <HoneyDrops> I have 8 terminals, 3 using tmux with 2+ windows each.  Which is a bit on the low end for me.
[03:38:06] <Moonlightning> That sounds so badass xD
[03:39:10] <HoneyDrops> I should give st another look, rxvt-unicode is nice, but still seems a bit on the heavy side.

[06:04:28] <Kinsley> Someone thinks they're richer.

[06:04:47] * JustAberrant nods
[06:05:20] <JustAberrant> either way, I don't think those features were added specifically to allow that kind of thing, though I agree I don't like how much js can muck with the browser by default
[06:05:55] <JustAberrant> that said it's trivial to disable/bypass, so not high up on my list of things I care about
[06:11:09] <HoneyDrops> I agree, as far as actual "problems" it's next to meaningless, just the basic principle that a website can, though scripting, have say in the browser's behavior is dumb.

[21:55:58] <Moonlightning> That's why backups.
[21:56:27] <Moonlightning> Thing is, it's trivial to back up a password database (cp, anyone?)
[21:56:41] <Moonlightning> It's not trivial to back up a notebook, without exposing it to this malware we're worrying about.
[21:57:09] <Moonlightning> Obvious way is to copy. By hoof. Which is hard.
[21:58:01] <Moonlightning> Oh, I suppose you could take pictures onto SD cards and use dedicated cameras to access them.
[21:58:32] <Kinsley> But that violates the "don't use a device that needs to be charged or powered" rule.
[22:02:48] <Kinsley> So there are few things with having a physical notebook that need to be considered. 1. Why pick hand writing over digital storage? 2. How do you mitigate the risks of storing information in plain text without computational encryption algorithms? 3. How you mitigate the risks of storing information in a small, portable, fragile "container"?

[22:33:25] <PinkiePieBot> [ How to store passwords written on a physical notebook? - Information Security Stack Exchange ]
[22:33:25] <Gladiolus> i am yes
[22:33:29] <Gladiolus> o
[22:33:55] <Gladiolus> I’ve done it, since #2 is pointless and #3 is a non-issue since if they get destroyed whatever it’s like I care too much.
[22:34:21] <Gladiolus> I just store(d) passwords for some dumb websites on paper years ago. Now I have a system of patterns so I can get it generally within 4 tries.
[22:34:54] <Sour_Sweet> Imho the best way to store a password on a physical notebook is not to make it look like a password
[22:36:08] <Sour_Sweet> Use some sourcecode of a programm. Look for the line that looks the weirdest or better write one yourself. Print the sourcecode and remember the line you use as a password.
[22:36:20] <Sour_Sweet> You can do that with pretty much everything
[22:36:48] <Moonlightning> This isn't secure against offline attacks, though.
[22:36:54] <Sour_Sweet> It is
[22:36:56] <Moonlightning> Like I commented, if someone can snap a pic, it's game over.
[22:37:06] <Moonlightning> They'll just use your source code as a wordlist.
[22:37:15] <Sour_Sweet> But they won't even know that the password is in there
[22:37:37] <Sour_Sweet> That's unlikely
[22:38:04] <Moonlightning> But hiding the fact that you use a notebook is security through obscurity ;p
[22:38:17] <Moonlightning> Besides, they might see you opening your notebook, then closing it, then logging into a website.
[22:38:22] <Sour_Sweet> Especially if you hide it really well. You could for example print in monospace and use a colum instead
[22:38:57] <Sour_Sweet> Well if someone can watch you that closely they might as well watch you entering the password
[22:39:15] <Sour_Sweet> Or install a bug on your computer. USB keyloggers are a thing
[22:42:54] <Sour_Sweet> I have a backup of my private keys and password database in an old state hidden on a micro SD card. It's not at my place, but hidden inside something at somebody else's place without them knowing. The passphrase is intentionally weak, so I'll always be able to remember it. It's my emergency backup. That's security through obscurity but it works very well non the less.
[22:42:54] <Gladiolus> I had (lost it in my drawer) a 3.5 inch Dos 6.22 boot disk with passwords on a file called “mubi.mif"
[22:44:08] <Moonlightning> Man.
[22:44:43] <Moonlightning> My encryption passphrases are the same as my login passphrases (which are distinct from each other and every other passphrase I use)
[22:45:25] <Quindo> My opinion on the password notebook thing, Have a system.  But only use it for casual none important passwords to you and never use those passwords for something tied to your identity.  EG, runescape password can totally go into the notebook.
[22:45:31] <Moonlightning> I have an encrypted backup of both my laptops on my netbox, and copies of the backups offsite

[22:46:55] <Moonlightning> I use `pass` (which is a wrapper around gpg) as a manager, and those files are included
[22:47:02] <Moonlightning> So if I can get any of the backups of either of my laptops (or the originals), I can bootstrap from there
[22:47:21] <Moonlightning> And I just use both passwords all day every day, so I'm not going to forget them. :P

[23:36:28] <Divide|TechSupport> They are, they really are.
[23:36:46] <Divide|TechSupport> And USB cables, while we're at it.  Like, say, cables to connect a printer to a computer so that network settings can be pushed.
[23:37:28] <Moonlightning> Mmmmm. Don't have any of those.

[23:48:23] <Compu> weirdly enough the recording sounded like just noise when i played it back in audacious after recording but when i exported and played it with vlc it sounded fine
