[00:15:09] <roflincopter> i loved the partition juggling i needed to do to get a dual boot windows + ubuntu with seperate windows, data, root, swap and home paritions.

[13:10:56] <Moonlightning> …I'm confused about `free`s accounting again. x.x
[13:11:21] <Moonlightning> stuff in /run/shm doesn't appear to be accounted for in the ±buffers|cache line?
[13:11:39] <Moonlightning> It seems to be counted as free, I mean.
[13:11:48] <Moonlightning> And it's not free, not like file cache is free
[13:11:58] <Moonlightning> It's properly used. It can't just be /discarded/; things on a filesystem would be lost!
[13:13:40] <johnsey> I assume you mean /dev/shm? that's a tmpfs and it's swapped out if the memory is needed
[13:14:09] <Moonlightning> what if there's no swap though :P
[13:14:17] <Moonlightning> also, wat
[13:14:21] <Moonlightning> I thought it was a proper ramdisk o.o
[13:14:39] <johnsey> no it's not
[13:14:53] <johnsey> tmpfs != ramfs
[13:15:16] <Moonlightning> So I want ramfs?
[13:16:12] <johnsey> if you want to prevent swapping, yes
[13:16:23] <johnsey> well
[13:16:49] <johnsey> if you disable swapping, the space used by a tmpfs IS subtracted from your free memory
[13:16:59] <johnsey> (only if actually used)
[13:17:19] <johnsey> so tmpfs without swap should theoretically behave like a ramfs
[13:17:20] <Moonlightning> As in /properly/ disable swapping?
[13:17:28] <johnsey> unless I'm missing details
[13:17:31] <Moonlightning> i.e. just having no swap devices doesn't count
[13:17:46] <johnsey> swapoff -a
[13:18:18] <johnsey> if you have none, of course you don't have swap
[13:18:49] <Moonlightning> Right, but I have no swap devices, and…

[13:42:14] <Moonlightning> `free` is so very convenient, except for this one thing. :P

[13:43:20] <Moonlightning> what about /shared/ and /buffers/

[13:47:02] <johnsey> this also explains the output of your free, too
[13:48:10] <johnsey> (and I hereby declare today "international redundancy day of redundance" today)
[13:48:26] <Moonlightning> > free displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system, as well as the buffers used by the kernel. The shared memory column represents either the MemShared value (2.4 series kernels) or the Shmem value (2.6 series kernels and later) taken from the /proc/meminfo file. The value is zero if none of the entries is exported by the kernel.
[13:48:36] <Moonlightning> This explains basically nothing.
[13:48:51] <Moonlightning> unless I cared to go hunting for documentation on what /those/ labels mean, which I don't
[13:49:34] <johnsey> see, that's what you get for using stable software
