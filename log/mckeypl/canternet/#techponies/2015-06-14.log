[08:22:30] <Starthunder> So what's up with `gpg` and `pinentry`?
[08:23:34] <Starthunder> From within `tmux`, pressing tab doesn't highlight any of the `pinentry` buttons
[08:24:48] <Starthunder> And from within and without, if I control-c at a prompt and later close the terminal, it goes into some kind of busy-wait loop, apparently (its CPU usage jumps way up)
[08:25:42] <Starthunder> That also seems to break gpg-agent. Until that instance of `pinentry` is `kill`ed, subsequent attempts to do anything will hang for about half a minute before complaining that gpg-agent isn't working and falling back to the non-agent prompt
