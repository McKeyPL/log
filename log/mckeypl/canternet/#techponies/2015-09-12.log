[01:36:08] <One-Trick> i barely use it, it just happened to come up with a opened a blank tab
[01:36:40] <One-Trick> mostly cuz i had an old pentadactyl that wouldnt work the other day

[01:43:37] <One-Trick> i was using TreeView but its a bit buggy for what i do

[01:51:53] <HoneyDrops> The tab bar only makes sense if I am using the pointer.   I also tend to have so many open that the tabs are unidentifiable.  I use the [index/total] indicator from pentadactyl for knowing where I am.

[05:48:38] <Moonlightning> â€¦what?
[05:48:41] <Moonlightning> How does that even work?
[05:48:45] <Moonlightning> IRC doesn't do HTML documents
[05:48:53] <Moonlightning> or JavaScript, or anything really, except pure text
[05:49:06] <Datguy> if loopServerCommands is true
[05:49:13] <Datguy> It doesn't escape the \ char
[05:49:43] <Datguy> it will literally inject the IRC message into onServerCommand(<RAW IRC MSG>)
[05:50:27] <Colgate> lightirc is wonderful software
[05:51:06] <Moonlightning> wat
[05:51:42] <Datguy> Like one sec...
[05:52:49] <Datguy> If I say \ in an irc message, the message never appears in the lightIRC client, and an error appears in my browser's console
[05:52:53] <Datguy> try { __flash__toXML(onClientCommand("\")) ; } catch (e) { "<undefined/>"; }
[05:53:36] <Datguy> Granted, this is using onClientCommand, but the principle is still there and works for onservercommand
[05:54:37] <Moonlightning> :|
[05:55:10] <Datguy> Like I found a vulnerable payload, and it will execute
[05:55:17] <Datguy> but there will be no message show up for the client
[05:56:09] <Moonlightning> shite
[05:56:09] <JustAberrant> haha, epic :>
[05:56:19] <Datguy> So you can basically turn everyone who uses Chrome as their browser into your own Node.js IRC Botnet :P
[05:59:07] <Colgate> Datguy: did you report this to their bug tracker?
[05:59:26] <Datguy> I told the lightIRC dude in a PM a few months ago 
[05:59:44] <Datguy> He never did anything about it except acknowledge it
[05:59:59] <Datguy> Never patched it, but it looks like im the only one who actually used onServerCommand
[06:03:14] <Datguy> 16:14:20 <valentin> thanks
[06:03:20] <Datguy> That's all he did about it lol
[06:03:26] <JustAberrant> sounds pretty normal ;p
[06:03:45] <Datguy> that was in May haha
[06:04:09] <HoneyDrops> Sounds like standard webapp security practice.
[06:06:23] <Datguy> Just tested the payload on myself using client.canternet.org you guys are fine

[06:18:09] <Seoson> That being said my ex-employer is worse. They still have a critical SQL injection inside their payment troubleshoot system effectively allowing anyone (even from outside) to authotrize payments and sign messages.
[06:18:41] <RazorSharpFang> What if you let some .... 'people' know about this?
[06:19:26] <Datguy> RazorSharpFang: ?
[06:19:42] <RazorSharpFang> You know, third parties who'd love to know that kind of information.
[06:20:28] <Datguy> I doubt many people would be interested...
[06:20:52] <Datguy> There is a very small number of vulnerable targets 
[06:20:53] <RazorSharpFang> I am referring to Seoson.
[06:21:07] <Datguy> ah my bad
[06:21:12] <Seoson> I can't. My contract strictly restricts the things I can and cannot say. Considering you need insider knowledge and I've reported that vulnerability they'd easily come back to me
[06:21:46] <RazorSharpFang> Lame.
[06:21:52] <Datguy> Seoson: not necessarily, if that endpoint is public facing then it doesn't require insider knowledge 
[06:23:20] <Seoson> The endpoint is not public facing. However you can manipulate a message and as soon as it reaches the agent in customers service/backoffice the injection is automatically executed
[06:24:01] <Seoson> The frontend the backoffice is using is vulnerable - not the backend
[06:25:27] <JustAberrant> I think that kind of thing is popular
[06:25:31] <RazorSharpFang> So... I've got a machine with a pentium 4 that's hyperthreaded. Would I get better single-task performance if it wasn't hyperthreaded?
[06:26:49] <JustAberrant> i.e. features that arn't used in any customer facing part of the system being insecure, but you'd never know they existed without inside knowledge
[06:30:55] <Seoson> The thing is it's so obvious. Every time a message arrives containing a certain pattern the backoffice frontend displays a sql error message. With a few characters I could override any entry in the table and render the department useless causing millions of euros in damage
[06:34:09] <Datguy> Nice

[10:17:47] <wolfyshy> If I may add my two woofy pence, Phase, Xen is much better at I/O (network lag is lower, disk is faster)
[10:18:32] <wolfyshy> The problem with KVM is that it's just K Qemu with a new name.  It wasn't really designed to be an "enterprise hypervisor", Red Hat just sells it that way.
[10:18:53] * Phase never considered it an enterprise hypervisor
[10:18:56] <Phase> just real damn convenient
[10:19:06] <wolfyshy> Xen is a very nice solution and after comparing all four major hypervisors in 2013 I am very satisfied with Xen
[10:19:27] <wolfyshy> I didn't say you considered it that.  I was just noting RH oversells it
[10:19:29] <wolfyshy> Hugely
[10:20:48] <Phase> i've never really looked into it, libvirt supports either though

[21:32:36] <Datguy> So like, what's the controversy over systemd about?
[21:34:47] <HoneyDrops> It's too monolithic, it replaces so many parts of an OS in a tightly integrated way.
[21:34:56] <JustAberrant> aw come on, this comes up like monthly :(
[21:34:59] <JustAberrant> but yeah, that
[21:35:40] <JustAberrant> it's a big tightly coupled mess that's practically designed to be really hard to replace
[21:36:15] <HoneyDrops> If systemd were 30 separate projects, each with a clear, documented interface between the other units and systemd was adopted on a sane timeline (eg: it is an option to sysv for 2-3 years, then the primary for 5, with sysv being a fully supported alternative)
[21:36:20] <JustAberrant> as an init system it's probably decent, and if it was just an init system that could be used as one of several options I'd probably use it
[21:36:29] <HoneyDrops> â€¦I would not have a problem with it.
[21:36:46] <HoneyDrops> Also, dbus can die in a fire
[21:37:06] <Starthunder> dbus?
[21:37:08] <JustAberrant> but it's not, it wants to be _the_ init system, and more and more the basis for a lot of key functionality on a system.. it's very much against the grain 
[21:38:49] <JustAberrant> I'm legitimately surprised it's survived in debian, it's like.. everything they're against as far as I can tell
[21:39:07] <JustAberrant> like, I've never been a big fan of the debian project as a whole, they've always been a little too high horse for me
[21:39:17] <JustAberrant> this just seems very un-them
[21:39:33] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus  Unix has IPC solved, a half-dozen ways.
[21:39:35] <PinkiePieBot> [ D-Bus - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[21:40:11] <HoneyDrops> Also, note the /name/ D means DESKTOP.  It has no place on a server or embedded systems.
[21:40:53] <JustAberrant> anyway, I've gotta run
[21:41:51] <JustAberrant> systemd will probably become the new world order.. which sucks.. I'll use openrc as long as I can but systemd is probably not going anywhere soon

[21:59:35] <init3> Looks reasonable. Seems a little over powered in the RAM/CPU department for a file server but the price seems reasonable. Still, I always recommend a dedicated RAID card if it is at all possible unless you are doing SW RAID or JBOD. 
[21:59:52] <init3> But those can be so pricey.
[22:03:10] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn|2 (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[22:04:10] <init3> The big downside of onboard RAID is if your motherboard dies you'll need to get another one with the same RAID controller or your data is hosed. Though I suppose the same can be said for if the RAID card takes a shit. 
[22:07:03] <wolfyshy> HoneyDrops: the funny part is dbus is literally just a rewritten dcop, which is what KDE used for IPC between its own apps back in kde3.x
[22:07:23] <wolfyshy> so no, it is not designed for server usage, or embedded usage, or living in the kernel

[22:40:15] <Starthunder> Antichamber, Battleblock Theater, Civ V, Portal, Portal 2, TIS-100
[22:40:28] <Starthunder> I never play Civ anyway
[22:40:50] <_desu_> I can't find a good motherboard that supports ECC
[22:40:52] <Starthunder> It doesn't really run on Rainbow, so I'm not expecting that it'll run on Caramel
[22:40:59] <_desu_> all the ones I can find require an Xeon 
[22:41:12] <Colgate> ECC support is rare in desktop hardware
[22:41:21] <tiwake> yeah, gotta get a server board
[22:41:45] <tiwake> _desu_: http://www.newegg.com/Server-Motherboards/SubCategory/ID-302
[22:41:48] <PinkiePieBot> [ Server Motherboards - Newegg.com ]
[22:41:48] <Starthunder> What is ECC, anyway? >.>
[22:41:52] <_desu_> That's unfortunate 
[22:42:28] <_desu_> It can detect errors in RAM caused by alpha particles and correct them
[22:42:40] <tiwake> and other kinds of errors
[22:42:44] <Starthunder> Youâ€¦what? XD
[22:42:55] <tiwake> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory
[22:42:56] <PinkiePieBot> [ ECC memory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[22:44:02] <_desu_> Server board == Xeon == Big bucks 
[22:44:11] <tiwake> it does not need to be xeon
[22:44:19] <tiwake> or intel
[22:44:19] <_desu_> Me == Poor
[22:45:06] <tiwake> isnt socket C32 the lower power AMD server thing?
[22:45:15] <tiwake> or is it G2?
[22:46:54] <tiwake> no, G2 is intel
[22:50:19] <HoneyDrops> I'd guess that most bit flip errors are cosmic ray based, maybe beta particles.  Alpha would mean the source is /in the case/
[22:50:53] <_desu_> So i have a question about RAID
[22:51:27] <tiwake> use mdadm, BTRFS RAID or ZFS RAID
[22:51:35] <_desu_> What do you guys recommend?
[22:51:41] <HoneyDrops> Starthunder: Xserver + dwm
[22:52:50] <tiwake> _desu_: http://www.supermicro.com/Aplus/motherboard/Opteron3000/SR56x0/H8SME-F.cfm
[22:52:51] <PinkiePieBot> [ Super Micro Computer, Inc. - Aplus Products | Motherboards | H8SME-F ]
[22:52:58] <tiwake> something like that
[22:52:59] <HoneyDrops> _desu_: depends on your goals?
[22:53:15] <_desu_> So basically I am running archive.horse with a friend
[22:53:30] <_desu_> and we are nearly out of space, only 1TB left
[22:53:34] <tiwake> HoneyDrops: meh, not really, hardware RAID is pretty much not a very good option in most cases
[22:54:02] <tiwake> unless its windows
[22:54:12] <tiwake> but server things and windows dont go together
[22:54:27] * HoneyDrops missed the clarification.  Was assuming the question was what array type (0, 1, 1+0, and so on)
[22:54:30] <_desu_> Just use a VM if you need windows :P
[22:54:39] <tiwake> oh
[22:55:06] <tiwake> _desu_: the motherboard I linked uses the AM3+ socket
[22:55:22] <tiwake> and has ECC memory support
[22:55:33] <_desu_> cool :)
[22:55:53] <_desu_> So like i dont know how to raid at all...
[22:56:02] <tiwake> its easy
[22:56:08] <tiwake> and fun
[22:56:33] <tiwake> oh, I didnt check that board for number of SATA/SAS ports
[22:56:43] <_desu_> I would like this to be fairly safe, and it will be 8 5TB drives
[22:56:55] <tiwake> RAID 6 probably
[22:57:12] <tiwake> any given two drives could fail and still keep all your data
[22:58:05] <tiwake> I think BTRFS has RAID6 built in
[22:58:15] <tiwake> ZFS does
[22:58:51] <tiwake> hmm, that board only has 4 sata ports
[22:59:17] <_desu_> That's awesome. 35TB with a fault tolerance of two disks
[22:59:34] <_desu_> and I saw that. May just need to get a PCI-E sata card
[22:59:44] <tiwake> lemme look at a couple other options
[22:59:54] <tiwake> you could wait till the A1100 comes out
[23:00:06] <_desu_> Any idea when that will be?
[23:00:13] <tiwake> its rumored to have ~14 SATA ports
[23:00:21] <tiwake> sometime this year
[23:00:52] <tiwake> low power, I think like 25 watts or something
[23:01:00] <_desu_> Even better
[23:02:20] <tiwake> http://www.amazon.com/Supermicro-H8SML-7-Motherboard/dp/B00B45NXIQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442091719&sr=8-1&keywords=supermicro+H8SML-7
[23:02:44] <tiwake> SAS will break out to something like 4 or 8 SATA ports
[23:13:13] <_desu_> So reading into ECC and RAID got me looking into unrecoverable read error things
[23:13:53] <_desu_> How concerned should I be about those? May need to get more, smaller drives instead of 5TB ones.
[23:14:31] <tiwake> neh
[23:15:28] <tiwake> though for a boot drive you either want a SSD or two single platter hard drives in RAID1
[23:16:10] <_desu_> Yeah was planning on an SSD for a boot disk 
[23:16:21] <_desu_> maybe for the database too (with backups of course) 
[23:16:38] <_desu_> It's just extremely difficult to backup 35TB 
[23:16:46] *** Joins: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-cg3.e4s.162.101.IP)
[23:16:55] <tiwake> if you use SSD for boot, it might be better to get two of them for RAID1, and after its all set up correctly disconnect one of them
[23:17:10] <tiwake> yeah
[23:17:24] <tiwake> thats when you start getting into redundant servers
[23:17:49] <tiwake> make sure you have a good battery backup
[23:18:10] <Datguy> I do. APC UPS with 130 mins runtime ;)
[23:18:28] *** Joins: LightningCrash (lightning@Pony-blfskf.tcso.qwest.net)
[23:18:55] <_desu_> I've got one of those two. Might need another one for this build though. 
[23:18:59] <_desu_> *too lmao
[23:19:08] <tiwake> yeah
[23:19:52] <tiwake> you mostly want something that will keep everything running for ~15min or more, to protect against power blips that happen all the time
[23:20:35] <_desu_> Yeah thunderstorms here are pretty common so 
[23:20:49] *** Joins: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there)
[23:21:42] <tiwake> but yeah, I'm holding off for the AMD A1100 too, to upgrade my server
[23:22:59] *** Quits: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-iqmf0q.priv.bahnhof.se) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:24:09] <tiwake> it is supposed to be released in the second half of 2015

[23:30:15] <tiwake> for a local redundant server, the 10G ethernet would be really nice
[23:32:45] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[23:35:11] <Gladiolus> bring back cyrix
[23:35:17] <Gladiolus> and powerpc too
[23:35:23] <Gladiolus> i want a do-over of the late 90s
[23:35:44] <tiwake> IBM does not want to sell decently priced processors
[23:35:59] <Gladiolus> Of course not, I don't care.
[23:36:18] <Gladiolus> Give me the Octocore PowerPC G8 anyway.
[23:42:08] <HoneyDrops> I love to see PPC make a comeback.
[23:46:27] <Gladiolus> I'm starting to honestly wonder if Apple is gonna have a go at an arm-based notebook.
[23:46:44] <Gladiolus> That iPad Pro appears to have fast enough guts to run a 'real' os.
[23:47:32] <Gladiolus> A MacBook Air with an Arm processor, perhaps two of them on some wacky Pentium-D style chip? Could be fairly powerful and get battery life of "forever"
[23:47:51] <Gladiolus> The downside is fairly obvious though lol.
[23:48:38] <HoneyDrops> For various reasons I likely wouldn't buy it, but I would love an attempt to make a "full" laptop based on ARM.
[23:50:16] *** Quits: MisterSkids (ejd@Pony-fej07d.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[23:50:31] <Gladiolus> I wouldn't buy it either- if I have a full laptop I want Windows native x86- but it would give Intel a kick in the ass and that's always good.
[23:50:42] <Gladiolus> I love my intel parts but they need competition badly.
[23:53:49] <Gladiolus> I remember in 2009 I was like "Dual core in 2005, Quad core now... We'll have octo-core in 2013 and decacore in 2016!"
[23:55:45] <Starthunder> decadore??
[23:55:46] <Starthunder> Ew!
[23:55:53] <Gladiolus> lel
[23:56:34] <Gladiolus> also how many instructions does x86-64 have in the newest intel processors
[23:56:38] <Gladiolus> there's like 8 billion now good lord
