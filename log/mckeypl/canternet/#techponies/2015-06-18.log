[00:41:27] <JustAberrant> I gave away a higher spec box to a guy at work, so any money seems reasonable to me
[00:44:07] <JustAberrant> but then I was getting rid if it anyway, so there was value in not having to haul it down to the recycling place

[03:37:20] <AppleDash> package*
[03:40:53] <GigabitPony> iwlwifi-6000g2a-6.ucode is what I need
[03:41:55] <AppleDash> You want the firmware-iwlwifi package
[03:42:48] <GigabitPony> found it
[03:42:50] <GigabitPony> deb file
[03:43:20] <AppleDash> Should just be able to install it with apt...
[03:43:43] <GigabitPony> how? I have no network connection
[03:43:52] <AppleDash> Oh
[03:43:58] <Webster> Copy it over, then dpkg -i <package>
[03:43:58] <AppleDash> Well you can use the .deb then
[03:45:11] <GigabitPony> be a moment, damn thing wont detect the second flash drive I inserted
[03:48:16] <cyborg_ar> there's a well hidden debian install iso with the nonfree firmware preloaded
[03:48:31] <cyborg_ar> i always got that one to fresh install debian
[04:15:06] <GigabitPony> ugh.. wtf..is bringing me to a command line and no gui :s
[04:18:04] <GigabitPony> it didnt install the gui -.-
[04:20:33] <GigabitPony> fuck thats why..
[04:21:18] <JustAberrant> cyborg_ar: debian shipping non-free on media.. imagine getting hold of that involves sketchy men with trenchcoats
[04:21:34] <cyborg_ar> pretty much
[04:21:47] <cyborg_ar> you have to go into the back alleys of debian's ftp servers
[04:21:51] <GigabitPony> i did a minimal install on accident.. welp, using linux mint instead
[04:21:59] <cyborg_ar> lol
[04:22:07] <JustAberrant> I just imagine it..
[04:22:12] <cyborg_ar> i love that old joke
[04:22:18] <JustAberrant> guy speaking very loudly as he hands the disk to you
[04:22:27] <JustAberrant> "no really you don't need adobe flash, gnash works pretty well!"
[04:22:38] <cyborg_ar> "Ubuntu is an ancient african word that means 'I can't configure Debian'"
[04:22:41] <JustAberrant> *whispers* don't get caught with this.. you do.. I don't know you
[04:22:58] <GigabitPony> already have mint downloaded froma  few weeks ago
[04:23:20] <JustAberrant> mint has kinda become my go to recommendation for people who just want a windows-like desktop quickly
[04:23:53] <GigabitPony> I don't persay.. I wanna learn linux better but I am not spending the time right now to download debian
[04:24:43] <JustAberrant> actually got my mother using mint on an old dell laptop (previously had XP).. she actually likes it
[04:25:10] <cyborg_ar> :) mint and ubuntu are fine
[04:25:21] <cyborg_ar> after all, the whole works are under the pretty face
[04:25:24] <cyborg_ar> so it's win win
[04:25:25] <AppleDash> cyborg_ar: No, you've got it wrong
[04:25:37] <AppleDash> Ubuntu is African for "I fuck up your computer"
[04:26:06] <JustAberrant> only big complaint with mint is the lack of a minimal install cd
[04:26:15] <cyborg_ar> AppleDash: that sounds unnecessarily violent :(
[04:26:23] <JustAberrant> like.. who the fuck still does "download a few GB of software that's all gonna have to be updated immediately anyway" any more
[04:26:38] <JustAberrant> like.. fine, have it as an option for people still living in the 90s 
[04:26:47] <JustAberrant> but.. have the minimal installer 
[04:26:50] <cyborg_ar> man
[04:27:00] <AppleDash> cyborg_ar: It's just the truth :(
[04:27:16] <cyborg_ar> in the ancient times of last decade, ubuntu's free cd system was glorious
[04:27:23] <JustAberrant> hehe
[04:27:31] <cyborg_ar> you could get an envelope with 3 cds to install linux everywhere

[04:29:54] <cyborg_ar> but yeah it was awesome
[04:30:07] <cyborg_ar> it was actually the first piece of international mail i ever received

[04:30:56] <AppleDash> :)

[05:35:58] <JustAberrant> it's not an outdated term, it's an outdated technology
[05:36:13] <JustAberrant> an outdated term is URL, which everyone still uses over URI because URI sounds silly
[05:37:14] <Apple_Bloom> The thing is it's outdated technology that has been that way since 1999
[05:37:40] <JustAberrant> no argument, doesn't mean people need to stop uttering the word

[12:31:29] <Stik> printing an rc car sounds like fun
[12:31:37] <Stik> how strong is the material you print with?
[12:31:55] <Stik> how bulky would the chassis have to be basically?
[12:33:51] <urioxis> If you could reinforce it with some metal struts, not very I'd imagine
[12:36:20] <Lapsus> Stik: I personally have only printed PLA, though I could also do ABS [think lego], nylon, and some other thermoplastics
[12:37:29] <Lapsus> there's also some filaments on the market with carbon fibres in them, but I think that's more just a gimmick, as it'd take a special nozzle to align the fibres in any meaningful way, and there would be no interweaving of the layers, so it could still delaminate
[12:38:07] <Lapsus> printing things in the right orientation would be important for strength, and you could even do 100% solid if you needed to
[12:39:02] <Lapsus> http://openrcproject.com/tiki-index.php
[12:39:22] <Lapsus> there are people working on designs specifically for 3d printing though
[12:39:52] <Lapsus> I also totally plan to rebuild the lego rc propeller car I did with printed parts instead at some point

[13:45:51] <Googie> Random thing, but I find it funny, the number people who complain about Visual Basic.net, but not C# when they're both basically the same language with different syntax :V
[13:46:24] <Googie> (There's some minor differences, but I don't think people realize that modern VB.net is so similar to C# that you can do source code translation that basically works 99% of the time)
[13:48:33] <Mono> VBS is great
[13:48:57] <Mono> I got express
[13:52:40] <Phase4> Googie, precisely because it's C# with a syntax change, people moving from vb6 got a completely different language superficially like the one they were on
[13:53:21] <Phase4> plus it coexists with vb scripting, which itself is more similar (and i think incompatible with) the vb6 dialect
[13:54:39] <Stik> does anyone actually use vb.net
[13:54:42] <Googie> Phase4: I'm talking about the people that still think VB.net == VB6
[13:55:03] <Phase4> Googie, well, can you blame them?
[13:55:18] <Googie> I used to use it a little when I was first learning to program, but moved onto C# for anything on .net
[13:55:21] <Phase4> Stik, i've seen it in the wild
[13:55:25] <Mono> if "VB.net" != "VB6"

[13:57:12] <Seoson> Why? It's a function after all.
[13:57:30] <Mono> No, it was a reserved keyword.
[13:57:37] <Phase4> plus you can do all the functiony things with it, like apply it across an array... if you feel like doing that

[14:08:52] <Phase4> Googie, only because people refuse to port :(
[14:10:32] <Googie> It's still a mess for legacy stuff though. There's no good upgrade path. A lot of stuff if I write Python for at the moment, it's basically better to target Python2 than Python3.
[14:11:09] <Seoson> Mhh no bot on canternet uses the +B user mode. Interesting ...
[14:11:45] <Googie> IIRC Weechat for example can still only target one Python version at a time, and since most existing modules are Python2...

[14:34:38] <johnsey> because people still use 2
[14:35:27] <johnsey> it could've been as easy as having a header to specify the syntax on a per-file basis or something

[20:54:07] <Colgate> user goes to a website, they have no idea if they are running closed sourcce code or not
[20:54:21] <Colgate> this is bad
[20:55:11] <urioxis> But given that it's still this new, perhaps there's a commenting period in which people could get together to demand some kind of visual indication of the openness, like the padlock icon for SSL
[20:55:42] <Colgate> I do not support running closed source code of any kind in a browser
[20:55:47] <Colgate> no matter what

[20:57:08] <Colgate> urioxis: I flat out told you I was wrong because I hadn't looked at the article yet and that goes against the stance mozilla took 5 years ago as posted by my link
[20:57:17] <Colgate> er, that you were wrong*
[20:59:16] <johnsey> I still doubt it'll happen. And if it will I'm back to text browsers
[21:00:03] <urioxis> It's possible they were pressured into it by the rest. If they thought they'd lose lots of users over it...
[21:00:16] <urioxis> But haven't they had a major change of senior staff in the last 5 years?
[21:00:24] <Colgate> I do not know
[21:02:28] <johnsey> mozilla made a few wacky decisions lately, so I wouldn't put it past them
[21:03:13] <johnsey> signed addons as a requirement which can't be disabled? come on

[21:03:44] <Colgate> hmm, didn't hear about that

[21:06:35] <johnsey> https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing
[21:06:36] <PinkiePieBot> [ Addons/Extension Signing - MozillaWiki ]
[21:06:49] <johnsey> "Mozilla will begin requiring all extensions to be signed in order for them to be installable in Release and Beta versions of Firefox. Signing will be done through addons.mozilla.org (AMO) and will be mandatory for all extensions, regardless of where they are hosted. "
[21:08:01] <Colgate> >:(
[21:08:07] <Colgate> drm on addons, seriously?
[21:08:27] <johnsey> i mean, the process is automated and supposed to "take seconds" and you can run a differnet version of firefox if you really care
[21:08:30] <johnsey> still
[21:08:54] <johnsey> "The Developer Edition and Nightly versions of Firefox will have a setting to disable signature checks. There will also be special unbranded versions of Release and Beta that will have this setting, so that add-on developers can work on their add-ons without having to sign every build. "
[21:09:39] <johnsey> it's supposed to protect people from installing malicious addons 
[21:11:09] <Colgate> if people click through the warnings that's their own fault
[21:12:12] <johnsey> i guess it's part of the "we must protect people from making dumb mistakes" hype
[21:12:22] <urioxis> Signed extensions is very bad :(
[21:12:27] <Colgate> you can't do that, people will do it anyways
[21:12:34] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[21:13:26] <Colgate> if people's addons stop working, then they will just look elsewhere, and probably download X version that is compiled without the check + free bundled malware
