[06:42:34] * JustAberrant shruggles .. any boolean comparison is going to evaluate to zero or (usually) greater than 0
[06:42:42] <JustAberrant> (and almost always 1)
[06:42:55] <JustAberrant> 1 and 1 >= 0 or 0
[06:42:58] <JustAberrant> 1 >= 0
[06:43:15] <JustAberrant> 1
[06:43:32] <Cloudie|Laptop> so you mean 0 is False and 1 is True
[06:43:40] <JustAberrant> generally
[06:43:57] <Cloudie|Laptop> so True translates as 0
[06:44:10] <Cloudie|Laptop> oops
[06:44:13] <Cloudie|Laptop> 1 actually
[06:44:21] <Cloudie|Laptop> False is zero
[06:44:51] <JustAberrant> again, usually (and almost always)
[06:45:02] <Cloudie|Laptop> so in machine code, there's 0010101101010101
[06:45:08] <JustAberrant> 0 being off and 1 being on is a pretty basic fundemental of how computers work
[06:45:36] <JustAberrant> but nothing stopping higher level logic from deciding that true will actually be -89 and 0 will be -176
[06:46:08] <JustAberrant> but in pretty much everything I've ever dealt with (with the possible exception of lisp.. which is stupid..) 0 is false and 1 is true
[06:48:16] <JustAberrant> dunno what you're getting at with the "machine code" bit.. binary is just a way of representing information, without context it's useless
[06:49:27] <JustAberrant> if you have a chunk of data in memory representing a bunch of instructions for the processor (or some higher level thing) to execute you can represent it as a bunch of "1's and 0's"
[06:49:50] <JustAberrant> but you can also represent your favorite mlp fanfic as a bunch of 1's and 0's
[06:51:17] <JustAberrant> and it would be excessively silly to do either
[06:52:00] *** Joins: Buckabee (ModusPonens@Pony-6v8n3b.ga.comcast.net)
[06:52:12] <JustAberrant> there's times when it makes sense to represent something as binary (bitmasks mainly), but most of the time it's the least convenient way to see some bit of information
[06:52:33] <Webster> Woo, bitmasks. Fun times.
[06:53:00] <Lapsus> wooo
[06:53:05] <Lapsus> A_set = (PIND & (1 << 2)) ? true : false;
[06:53:06] <JustAberrant> ... woo! :(
[06:53:07] <Lapsus> :v
[06:53:21] <Webster> So woo.
[06:53:34] * JustAberrant carefully slides a glowing tendril into Lapsus 's left ear such that he may share thoughts
[06:54:04] <JustAberrant> also doing bitwise in java is suffering
[06:54:04] * Lapsus is fortunate enough to be wearing proper closed headphones
[06:54:30] <Phase> JustAberrant, ?
[06:54:34] * JustAberrant wrote an implementation fo a really archaic filesystem in java to pull some data off some _really_ old images
[06:54:46] <Phase> bitwise worked fine on int types for me
[06:55:13] <Lapsus> I have a love/hate relationship with bitwise junk
[06:55:14] <Phase> JustAberrant, also i find python better for that sort of thing
[06:55:21] <JustAberrant> well, the lack of signed types and inability to easily represent concepts such as "these 3 bytes" makes it a pain ;p
[06:55:30] <Phase> struct.unpack + collections.namedtuple
[06:55:39] <Phase> is gud~
[06:55:53] <JustAberrant> Phase: I would have preferred c.. but there were a variety of (mostly stupid) reasons it had to be java
[06:55:55] <Phase> though int.from_bytes could be less verbose
[06:56:04] <Phase> JustAberrant, Jython!
[06:56:08] <Phase> though yeah, fair enough
[06:56:14] <Webster> Heh, did bit stuff in Java. Wasn't too horrible.
[06:56:33] <Phase> it's a very dull language to work in
[06:56:50] <JustAberrant> it's fine if you are dealing with normal enough stuff I found
[06:57:02] <Phase> somehow less expressive than C/C++, and it's GC is a nightmare
[06:57:11] <Phase> but it's better than cobol
[06:57:37] <JustAberrant> it was just really horrible at things like endiness and "I want you to take these 4 bytes from the middle of this qword and turn it into a char
[06:57:58] <JustAberrant> * 4 bits
[06:58:06] <JustAberrant> _especially_ if those 4 bits overlapped a byte boundry
[06:58:11] <JustAberrant> i.e.
[06:58:13] <Phase> Ah, so lotsa manual bit shifting
[06:58:17] <Phase> that's awkward everywhere

[06:58:49] <JustAberrant> make char from bits 7-10
[06:58:55] <JustAberrant> in c it's trivial ;p
[06:59:13] <JustAberrant> but yeah.. I get that this is a pain in any .. non c.. language.. just seems like java it was really painful
[06:59:19] <Phase> i'd do it about the same way in either?
[06:59:33] <JustAberrant> mask, shift, cast, etc
[06:59:57] <JustAberrant> problem is java has no way (that I know of) of applying a mask to more than one byte at a time
[07:00:21] <JustAberrant> also the lack of signed types meant having to always use a larger data type
[07:00:27] <Phase> Ah
[07:00:30] <Phase> you mean unsigned
[07:00:37] <JustAberrant> yeah :(
[07:00:41] <Phase> though i think the keyword is reserved regardless
[07:00:42] <JustAberrant> sorry.. Ima little drunk ;p
[07:01:06] <Phase> i've heard two reasons why java doesn't have unsigned integers
[07:01:22] <Phase> "programmers don't understand them" and "we couldn't be bothered to implement them"
[07:01:32] <JustAberrant> both of which are probably entirely valid ;p
[07:01:52] <JustAberrant> and honestly it doesn't really matter until you are dealing with data from "somewhere else" at a lower level
[07:02:06] <JustAberrant> it's the same with network code in java with regards to streaming data
[07:02:23] <JustAberrant> like.. using the various toBytes/fromBytes is fine if it's java to java
[07:02:29] <JustAberrant> and you'll never have to worry about it
[07:02:35] <JustAberrant> it's when you're talking to something that's not java
[07:02:47] <JustAberrant> and if it's from the 80s and has all kinds of "weird shit" .. it's pain
[07:02:57] <Webster> If only everything was 8-bit ASCII!
[07:03:04] <Phase> 7-bit'
[07:03:11] <JustAberrant> yeah, except java's all like.. "nah.. 2 bytes per char cause!

[12:05:44] <BabyCloudrunner> principles = what is variables, a complier, interpreter, etc

[12:07:01] <hawthornbunny> Ah, okay. You probably want something more like a computer science textbook, then
[12:07:58] <hawthornbunny> I mean, if you want to start from the very fundamentals, you'll be going back to Turing machines. Which actually isn't a bad place to start, if you can get your head around it.

[12:22:36] <hawthornbunny> BabyCloudrunner: personally, I'm fond of encouraging people to launch straight into programming. Because it's fun, and it's something that's easier to learn while you're doing it.
[12:22:57] <BabyCloudrunner> Actually, I'm 17 anyway
[12:23:13] <hawthornbunny> But actually, my biggest recommendation is this: get Linux.

[12:25:27] <BabyCloudrunner> used to have MingW
[12:26:36] <hawthornbunny> It's not a matter of development environment, but it's more the fact that Linux doesn't put a barrier between you and the machine like Windows or Mac does. Just by being exposed more frequently to your computer's low-level workings, you'll learn much more.
[12:27:36] <BabyCloudrunner> I should try reading Code Complete
[12:27:59] <BabyCloudrunner> I heard it can be for programming beginners and little experince
[12:29:38] <BabyCloudrunner> I don't care if the book is super old though
[12:32:58] <hawthornbunny> The fundamentals of coding haven't changed much in decades. What DOES change is paradigms and design patterns: the way we structure our code.
[12:33:30] <ShivalWolf> hawthornbunny: i dont know quantum code adjusts the fundamentals quite a bit
[12:33:46] <hawthornbunny> Well, true, but quantum computers aren't really here yet :)
[12:33:56] <ShivalWolf> true
[12:34:06] <ShivalWolf> but the programing structure is kinda cool
[12:34:07] <hawthornbunny> Well, they're sort of here and not here, simultaneously.
[12:34:13] <ShivalWolf> lol
[12:35:01] <ShivalWolf> the wiki entry on quantum programing is really interesting
[12:37:05] <BabyCloudrunner> I'm sure programming for dummies is helpful... NOT
[12:38:40] <hawthornbunny> It could be. The For Dummies series is pretty good.

[13:25:45] *** Awaykitty is now known as Unixkitty
[13:29:51] <BabyCloudrunner> Prolog and Perl have the same file extention
[13:30:00] <BabyCloudrunner> which is confusing to interpret
[13:34:08] <Phase> it's cute how they think a language can actually die
[13:35:11] <BabyCloudrunner> Perl and Ruby are living very well
[13:35:45] <Phase> bugzilla is in perl, ruby on rails grows like a weed
[13:37:21] <BabyCloudrunner> java is the king of languagesw
[13:41:05] <Stik> why?
[13:41:17] <Stik> java is relatively young still

[15:33:10] <JustAberrant> I still use perl from time to time, it does a few things really well and if you already know it..
[15:33:15] <JustAberrant> but probably best that it die
[15:34:03] <JustAberrant> unfortunately I really don't like python.. so I find myself lacking a better "I need to screw around with a bunch of data to make it fit into something" one-off hack language
[15:35:16] <Googie> Python feels really heavy for doing that compared to Perl :(
[15:36:05] <JustAberrant> perl is the ultimate think as you code language imo.. which doesn't lend itself to maintainability at all.. but it's amazing when you just need to get something done
[15:36:24] <JustAberrant> of the many problems I have with python, it feels too inbetween
[15:36:48] <JustAberrant> to much bs to be a quick-n-dirty one-off language, to whimsical to write stuff that's gonna be around for awhile imo

[16:53:19] <hawthornbunny> I love python!
[16:54:11] <hawthornbunny> I wouldn't describe python as quick-n-dirty. It's quick-n-clean. ^^
[16:55:20] <hawthornbunny> I was skeptical about python when I first tried it because I didn't like the idea of a language dictating my formatting, but I just kept finding that everything I wrote WORKED. It was so satisfying. ^^
[16:56:31] <BabyCloudrunner> I don't get why C programming has "int main(void) " lol
[16:57:00] <BabyCloudrunner> I only know that theres only Main()
[16:59:44] <Googie> Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Python, but I'm just a huge fan of static typing for anything serious.

[18:16:42] <Seoson> StarCom Certs for example are always valid for the root domain as well. In some cases this is unwanted. I have some services running where I would prefer a seperate cert only for the subdomain
[18:17:18] <Googie> Ah, okay.
[18:17:54] <Seoson> I haven't checked if I can cheat the system with sub-subdomains.
[18:18:48] <Seoson> Also I'm worried about the auto deploy and configuration stuff the plan to use. But we'll see how that works ^^
[18:20:05] <Googie> Well, most CAs are already fairly close to automatic, and they've said that there's no issue with using a "dumb client" that removes most of that logic as well.
[18:21:11] <Googie> There's certainly a lot of room for screwups though, but I /think/ they know what they're doing :P

[18:23:46] <Seoson> Yeah since the protocol is open even if they screw it up I guess you can still use a third party client.
[18:24:33] <Googie> Yeah, there's nothing stopping the client from just giving you a list of possible validation methods, and then just configuring one of them by hand.
