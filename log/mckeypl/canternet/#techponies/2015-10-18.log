[08:44:32] <Phase> "reflected"?
[08:44:38] <Moonlightning> It's not…

[08:51:11] <Moonlightning> how bad of an idea is that?
[08:51:21] <Googie> For certain definitions of daemon, the kernel is a daemon.
[08:51:38] <Moonlightning> letting named do anything with /etc/bind?
[08:51:47] <Moonlightning> I'm getting kinda sick of this
[08:51:50] <Phase> why would it need to touch /etc/bind?
[08:52:01] <Moonlightning> to update the zonefile?
[08:52:11] <Phase> those are usually under /var
[08:52:27] <Moonlightning> …zonefiles should be in /var?
[08:52:35] <Moonlightning> s/in/under/
[08:52:49] <Phase> they're state, not configuration
[08:53:24] <Moonlightning> seem like configuration to me
[08:53:44] <Moonlightning> but, okay. that fits better with what apparmor is configured for
[08:53:50] <Phase> and if you were running a secondary server?
[08:54:24] <Moonlightning> …I guess you could say they're /data/, not configuration
[08:54:41] * Phase would assume there's some path in the apparmor config for zone files
[08:55:07] * Phase prefers the selinux method of ea labels
[08:55:18] <Moonlightning> EA labels?
[08:55:24] <Phase> extended attribute
[08:55:39] <Phase> stores the file label in security.selinux 
[08:55:46] <Moonlightning> # /etc/bind should be read-only for bind
[08:55:46] <Moonlightning> # /var/lib/bind is for dynamically updated zone (and journal) files.
[08:55:46] <Moonlightning> # /var/cache/bind is for slave/stub data, since we're not the origin of it.

[20:21:28] <Moonlightning> There was no delay when I did it for my mane server
[20:23:34] <AppleDash> The real question is, why are you using linode
[20:25:16] <Moonlightning> Long story.
[20:25:19] <Moonlightning> Why?
[20:25:25] <AppleDash> I have time.
[20:26:05] *** Joins: Webster (Webster@Pony-910rl8.fios.verizon.net)
[20:26:46] <Moonlightning> What's wrong with Linode?
[20:27:05] <AppleDash> 1) Way too expensive for what it is
[20:27:13] <AppleDash> 2) The name's stupid
[20:27:16] <AppleDash> 3) They use the term "cloud"
[20:27:39] <AppleDash> Also, last time I had a VPS from them for some reason I was not a fan of the network performance
[20:28:30] <AppleDash> But literally the only reason places like Linode are around are to scam businesses with lots of money
[20:28:47] <Moonlightning> O.o
[20:28:51] <AppleDash> 960$ for 96GB of RAM? wtf? I could get literally 5 or 10 dedicated servers with 96GB of RAM for that
[20:29:06] <AppleDash> Heck, in 6 months I could BUY a server and colo it for 50 bucks and it would be mine
[20:29:15] * JustAberrant likes linode :(
[20:29:21] <AppleDash> I know
[20:29:28] <AppleDash> and that's why your server lags :P
[20:29:34] <JustAberrant> pff ;p
[20:29:40] <JustAberrant> it wouldn't even run on pretty much any other VPS
[20:29:52] <Moonlightning> Well, I'm just seeing how this goes.
[20:29:55] <AppleDash> AppleDashVM has good reviews
[20:29:56] <JustAberrant> when it comes to single core performance, linode pretty much kicks ass
[20:30:06] <Moonlightning> Dark Moon isn't exactly a first-class name
[20:30:11] <Moonlightning> very background pony
[20:30:19] <Moonlightning> not even one of the well-known background ponies
[20:30:56] <AppleDash> Just like Moonlightning
[20:31:04] <Moonlightning> Moonlightning isn't a canon name. :P
[20:31:31] <AppleDash> Trye
[20:31:34] <AppleDash> True*
[20:31:38] <JustAberrant> linode is definitely upper tier when it comes to speed and stability, which is probably why they are that expensive.. if you don't care about that then sure, go with prgmr or digitalocean or whatever
[20:31:57] <AppleDash> I've never had such an experience
[20:32:32] <AppleDash> Why would I pay that much when I can get 8 servers in 4 DCs and have twice the processing power with 4 times the redundancy?
[20:32:33] <AppleDash> :P
[20:33:12] <JustAberrant> well once you get past a certain tier, a VPS doesn't make sense in general
[20:33:21] <AppleDash> Agreed
[20:33:45] <JustAberrant> at that point you're paying for them dealing with the hardware/logistics/networking
[20:35:10] <Moonlightning> What the hell is up with this server
