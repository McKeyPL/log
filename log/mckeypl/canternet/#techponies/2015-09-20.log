[00:20:28] <gigaway> why is it that windows print to file (pdf) are almost 4 times larger then Linux print to file?
[00:22:20] <Moonlightning> 'cos Windows is inefficient.
[00:22:52] <gigaway> Seriously, look.  http://prntscr.com/8i8y5u
[00:23:26] <gigaway> days 23 and 24, where print to file from Arch, since day 19, its all from windows

[00:38:07] <JustAberrant> the linux implementation probably doesn't include everything :(
[00:45:54] <gigaway> file in use, yet I do not see where the file is in use.
[00:45:58] <gigaway> wtf windows >.<

[01:05:09] <gigaway> And now everytime I try to overwrite a file in my dropbox folder, it saves it as a copy. Something is going weird here
[01:09:54] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i have a client who upgraded to windows 10, and now is unable to log in, it was the microsoft download upgrade not a disk
[01:10:21] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> and its the win 8.1/10 black screen of death
[01:10:37] <Captian_init> Sounds like it'd most likley be the file manager or whatever program is saving to it at fault gigaway.
[01:11:49] <Captian_init> So what, it just goes to a black screen after you login?
[01:13:46] <Captian_init> I guess what I am asking is if you mean the login manager is shown?
[01:14:56] *** Joins: ModusPonens (test@Pony-ro8.enl.137.198.IP)
[01:15:12] <gigaway> waterfox is what is saving it I assume, or windows explorer. Even after a restart it is doing it
[01:15:13] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> no login options, before it was just saying "invalid password"
[01:15:30] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> now just black screen with horizontal grey lines in win10
[01:17:36] * DJ-C0L7[CSS] facehooves
[01:17:41] <gigaway> wait.. do I need adobe reader dc, in order to view pdf's or can I use another program? I was always under the impression you needed fucking adobe, but this new reader keeps opening in the background
[01:18:02] <Captian_init> You do not. 
[01:18:13] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> someone forced the pc to shut off while it was installing drivers >.< now the fun part is trying to get into system restore from the boot menu... which microsoft in their infinite lack of wisdom disabled
[01:18:15] <Captian_init> There are many different things than can read (and write) pdf
[01:18:34] <gigaway> I'll just get cutepdf then, because screw this
[01:18:50] <Captian_init> Well I'd assume you need a disc for what ails this computer. 
[01:19:00] <Captian_init> is sfc still a thing in windows 10?
[01:19:32] <Captian_init> Shit, I'm not even sure if it is still a thing in wondows 7. 
[01:19:59] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> it is in win7 pro and better but you still need the disk to access sfc options
[01:20:36] <Captian_init> Yeah, I think you need a disc
[01:20:47] <Captian_init> Wait though, MS disabled the boot menu?
[01:20:58] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i gave them the instructions to enable safemode
[01:21:11] <gigaway> In what, 10? No they just made it harder to access boot menu is all
[01:21:13] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> you can access a "recovery window" which gives limited startup options
[01:22:03] <Captian_init> Well if it is driver level failures I don't see safe mode working, unless you get really lucky on /which/ driver. 
[01:22:10] <Captian_init> But who knows?
[01:22:41] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> safemode should be barebones drivers with minimum processes and drivers to start the system
[01:23:07] <Captian_init> Microsoft be a foul creature. She swallow finer men whole. 
[01:23:29] <Captian_init> Right but if they are storage drivers or something similarly fundemental...
[01:23:49] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> according to all of the forums i'm finding >.< it appears to be either the southbridge, or the graphics driver
[01:24:05] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> but the fact it was showing the login screen but not accepting passwords for the user or admin accounts
[01:24:10] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> seems like a failed install
[01:24:20] <Captian_init> Graphics driver you should be fine... but southbridge.... yeah.
[01:24:34] <Captian_init> If the OS can't fully read the HDD you are pretty well fucked. 
[01:24:44] <Captian_init> But yeah, like you said
[01:24:56] <Captian_init> if a login prompt /was/ appearing that seems less likley.
[01:25:37] <Captian_init> Then again... "invalid password" kinda seems disk-like. 
[01:26:02] * Captian_init throws a Debian disc at DJ-C0L7[CSS]. Problem solved.
[01:26:44] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> if the user was able to use linux without having an anxiety attack i would have just installed either ubuntu, mint, or vanilla debian
[01:26:57] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> if not ubuntu ultimate edition
[01:28:11] <Captian_init> I know how that works. 
[01:28:30] <Captian_init> What's ubuntu ultimate anyhow? 
[01:30:39] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> ultimateedition.info
[01:31:20] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> its an lfs adaptation of ubuntu with all the extra bells and wistles, basicly a complete custom build oob with performance tweaks and pre-loaded addons

[17:38:38] <Moonlightning> Phase, RazorSharpFang [when they come back]: Python's `int` is arbitrary-magnitude (but `float` isn't :c )
[17:55:51] <Moonlightning> Is it really so bad to use NFS without really caring about its security, if all I'm doing is accessing a LUKS container?
[18:02:35] <mniip> Moonlightning, how would you imagine arbitrary size float
[18:02:50] <Moonlightning> arbitrary-precision, even
[18:03:07] <mniip> predefined size
[18:03:08] <mniip> ?
[18:03:20] <Moonlightning> Store two arbitrary-magnitutde integers; one for the whole-number part and one for the fractional part
[18:03:30] <Moonlightning> So 5.4 becomes (5, 4)
[18:03:37] <mniip> what about 1/3
[18:03:38] <Moonlightning> 5.489262647 becomes (5, 489262647)
[18:03:41] <Moonlightning> …shit.
[18:03:57] <Moonlightning> you broke my system! >:(
[18:04:00] <Moonlightning> Thanks M N Iip
[18:04:17] <mniip> ಠ_ಠ no one's called me /that/ yet
[18:04:49] <mniip> Moonlightning, usually you go for a predefined size
[18:04:59] <mniip> you declare what size you want your numbers to be and go with it
[18:05:06] <mniip> one language allows for post-defined size
[18:05:35] <mniip> you define arbitrarily sized numbers, do operations on them and so on, but when you decide to output them you have to say how many digits you want computed
[18:06:33] <mniip> very cool concept
[18:33:23] <Moonlightning> WOOOOOOO
[18:33:26] <Moonlightning> /finally/
[18:33:31] <Moonlightning> now, this shit better work, I swear
[18:33:39] <Moonlightning> also, my NFS server is probably horridly insecure :(
[18:33:43] <Moonlightning> I should fix that…
