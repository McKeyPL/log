[00:01:00] <mniip> [01:00:52]  mniip\tor's IP is 127.0.0.1
[00:01:08] <Colgate> congrats :P
[00:01:31] <mniip> tsk tsk
[00:01:33] <Colgate> that's the only effective way to cloak your IP on irc
[00:01:39] <mniip> not scrubbing out your gateway's host
[00:01:50] <Moonlightning> Or just disable autorejoin -.-
[00:02:01] <Colgate> why would I care if you know that it is connecting over localhost?
[00:02:01] <mniip> Moonlightning, not using autorejoin here
[00:02:22] <mniip> Moonlightning, I could devhost you and you wouldn't even know it
[00:02:25] <Moonlightning> …the tor-sasl thing registers as connecting over localhost? Wut?
[00:02:36] <Colgate> I mean, it is a tor hidden node, you already know it is connecting over localhost
[00:02:52] <mniip> well it could be connecting over ::1
[00:02:55] <Moonlightning> Why doesn't it show up as a Tor relay node's IP?
[00:02:55] * JustAberrant bounces around mniip 
[00:02:59] <JustAberrant> DO ME DO ME DO ME!
[00:03:00] <mniip> or... 127.13.44.102
[00:03:07] <Colgate> because it doesn't matter?
[00:03:36] <Colgate> Moonlightning: inspircd has no knowledge of tor
[00:03:55] <Colgate> and writing that in would be considerable effort for no gain
[00:04:16] <mniip> JustAberrant, well I have your IP, may I paste or should I PM
[00:04:38] <JustAberrant> paste away 
[00:04:40] <mniip>  50.116.20.45
[00:04:51] <Moonlightning> mniip: without finding it, how the hell do you do that?
[00:04:52] <JustAberrant> :>
[00:05:15] <JustAberrant> oh.. I guess that makes sense actually
[00:05:15] <Colgate> Moonlightning: /chanserv unban
[00:05:21] <mniip> Moonlightning, http://i.imgur.com/iZcUNxH.gif
[00:05:39] <Colgate> it is a known thing, that really, nobody cares about
[00:05:48] <mniip> yeah until recently
[00:05:53] <Moonlightning> … :I
[00:06:03] <Colgate> if you want to hide your IP, the only effective way is to use our tor node
[00:06:08] <Colgate> I will say that until the end of time
[00:06:09] <mniip> over there at freenode we found a way to do it in 7 UNQUIET invocations
[00:06:11] <mniip> and later
[00:06:12] <mniip> in just one
[00:06:17] <mniip> one call to chanserv
[00:06:23] <Moonlightning> Seriously, how's it work?
[00:06:33] <Colgate> Moonlightning: you set a whole bunch of cidr bans, then unquiet a use
[00:06:38] <Colgate> chanserv removes the matching bans
[00:06:46] <JustAberrant> this is actually one of the reasons I only connect to IRC via my vps
[00:06:52] <mniip> the simplest case is a binary search
[00:06:52] <Moonlightning> Oh.
[00:07:03] <JustAberrant> I figure if something's gonna get DoS'd, it's not gonna be my home connection
[00:07:06] <mniip> I implemented a binary-aligned polyary search
[00:07:25] <mniip> for example on canternet the banlist limit is 69, so I do 69-ary search aligned to 6-bit blocks
[00:07:35] <JustAberrant> also, very impressive :)
[00:07:56] <Colgate> if you want to hide your IP, use tor, plain and simple :P
[00:07:59] <mniip> it also supports IPv6!
[00:08:14] <mniip> in a really retarded way though ::)
[00:08:15] <JustAberrant> Colgate: personally I avoid tor, but that's me ;p
[00:08:16] <mniip> :)
[00:08:26] <Moonlightning> Getting a 56-bit prefix would be harder, though, wouldn't it?
[00:09:04] <mniip> instead of :: it says 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
[00:09:10] <Colgate> Moonlightning: this isn't new either, it wasn't new 1-2 years ago when some guy did a talk about it at defcon or whatever
[00:09:31] <mniip> Colgate, I've seen that talk, it's retarded :v
[00:09:40] <mniip> the guy knows absolutely nothing about irc \o/
[00:10:07] <Colgate> the fact of the matter is, cidr bans are more useful than not, so removing them is a bigger annoyance than the chance of a connecting IP being leaked

[03:02:35] <RazorSharpFang> This way, people with a 1920x1080 screen won't see MORE of the world than those who have a 800x600 display

[03:06:30] <RazorSharpFang> WebGL doesn't suffer that much from it.
[03:06:57] <JustAberrant> either way, I think your game needs more character focus, just saying
[03:07:09] <JustAberrant> I mean, we don't need to know the blue rectangles life story
[03:07:14] <JustAberrant> but we should at least care about it
[03:07:28] <Moonlightning> Call me Square.
[03:07:31] <Moonlightning> Arthur Square.
[03:07:31] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: In what way? Should it be zoomed in more? Should it center on the rectangle?
[03:07:51] <RazorSharpFang> Also, that's a tank. It's just... placeholder art.
[03:07:53] <JustAberrant> I meant more from a story perspective
[03:08:12] <Moonlightning> Call me Tank.
[03:08:15] <Moonlightning> Arthur Tank.
[03:08:18] <RazorSharpFang> This isn't a story driven game. It's an top-down arcade shooter.
[03:08:33] <JustAberrant> fair enough I guess :(
[03:08:46] <RazorSharpFang> Were you hoping for a story-driven game?
[03:08:51] <Moonlightning> Who am I? That's not important. What /is/ important is the tanks over there, about to start firing at you…

[03:13:24] <Moonlightning> But that will mean you can go faster by going diagonally.
[03:13:32] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah.
[03:13:43] <JustAberrant> serious critique: the game arena feels kinda small relative to the size of the rectangle
[03:14:08] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: The brown blocks are just collision testers. This entire room is placeholder.
[03:14:27] <RazorSharpFang> Oh, do you mean the display/view window itself?

[05:21:42] <tiwake> thought it was a paper problem
[05:21:51] <RazorSharpFang> Nah, programming.
[05:22:13] <Moonlightning> tiwake: it's the /useful/ kind of math
[05:22:23] <tiwake> sure
[05:22:30] <tiwake> well, more useful
[05:23:13] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: double-check that
[05:23:25] <Moonlightning> Your range there is [1, dots)
[05:23:31] <tiwake> I'd still probably work out an equation on paper though
[05:23:49] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: Yeah. I don't want a dot at point A.
[05:24:08] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: that gives you dots - 1 dots though
[05:24:15] <RazorSharpFang> Hmm.
[05:25:04] <Moonlightning> I think you may need to use 11 instead of 10
[05:25:21] <Moonlightning> If you want 10 in the middle
[05:25:35] <Moonlightning> 'cos 0/10 is A and 10/10 is B

[05:41:50] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, another question. There's this integer variable that holds the anti-aliasing capabilities. It could be any of these values { 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14 } How might I extract the highest level of anti-aliasing from it? 1 means not available, 2 means 2xAA, 4 means 4xAA (only), 6 means 2xAA and 4xAA, 8 means 8xAA, 12 means 8xAA 4xAA, and 14 means 2xAA 4xAA and 8xAA are all available.
[05:42:19] <RazorSharpFang> I'm a bit stumped.
[05:42:45] <RazorSharpFang> I kinda don't want to use a bit switch-case.
[05:43:20] <tiwake> what are you doing?
[05:43:32] <RazorSharpFang> I want to automatically select the largest AA mode.
[05:44:34] <Moonlightning> That sounds like a bitset.
[05:44:40] <Moonlightning> Or…whatever you call the bitwise option things.
[05:44:45] <tiwake> Colgate: I think I'm going to go with a standard install
[05:45:00] <Moonlightning> Except that you should be using 1 instead of 0
[05:45:00] <tiwake> and maybe try wayland later... or something
[05:45:08] <Moonlightning> er, 0 instead of 1
[05:45:16] <Moonlightning> You should be using 0 to mean none of them. :P
[05:45:44] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: Sorry, error on my part. 0 DOES mean not available.
[05:45:49] <Moonlightning> Good :D
[05:46:01] <RazorSharpFang> Could I use bit-wise and?
[05:46:22] <Moonlightning> So in other words, it can be any bitwise combination of 1 << 8 for 8AA, 1 << 4 for 4AA, and 1 << 2 for 2AA.
[05:46:38] <Moonlightning> err, off by one
[05:46:47] <RazorSharpFang> But which one?
[05:46:48] <Moonlightning> 1 << 7, 1 << 3, and 1 << 1 *
[05:47:00] <RazorSharpFang> All of them.
[05:47:06] <tiwake> Colgate: when did you want to meet at frys electronics?
[05:47:23] <Moonlightning> `&` smaller and smaller possible values until you get a nonzero result; that's the highest level it supports.
[05:47:45] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: wait, there's no 10?
[05:48:17] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: There /might/ be, the documentation i s a tad loose in this one.
[05:48:35] <RazorSharpFang> This variable will return a value based on the setting of bits for the different levels. So for only 2xAA, this will report 2, for 2x and 4x availability it will report 6. For 8 and 4 it will report 12. For all 3 levels (2,4 and 8) it will report 14.

[10:20:11] *** Joins: star_moon (Starry@the.little.cloud.colt)
[10:20:20] <JustAberrant> I find it weird that there's one on the wiki and one on the site
[10:20:27] <JustAberrant> both probably get you there, but.. strange..
[10:20:42] <JustAberrant> (they're probably the same)
[10:20:44] <JustAberrant> and yeah
[10:21:51] <tiwake> looks like you use a liveCD, and then stage3 or something, something something, boot into your fresh gentoo install and maybe finish compiling things 
[10:22:21] <tiwake> I think more reading is necessary
[10:23:20] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[10:25:51] <JustAberrant> that's pretty much the jist really
[10:26:45] <JustAberrant> live cd, copy the stage3 to your hard drive (basically giving you a minimal linux install), do some basic configuration, build yourself a kernel, install a boot loader, and reboot
[10:26:57] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (Bluepon@Pony-a3o7j6.cg80.k4gu.0151.2601.IP) (Quit: Ping timeout: -1 second)
[10:27:34] <JustAberrant> and honestly, the hardest parts (picking out use flags/compiler options and building your kernel) are pretty straight forward now
[10:28:24] *** Gigabit is now known as Snoarin
[10:29:43] <tiwake> JustAberrant: I know GCC has basically an all-inclusive compiler flag to optimize for whatever processor you have installed... is that what you are talking about?
[10:30:20] * Phase would use -Og -fno-omit-frame-pointer
[10:30:26] <Phase> because debugging
[10:32:09] <JustAberrant> tiwake: more or less
[10:32:21] <JustAberrant> -march=auto basically does like 99% of the work for you
[10:32:40] <JustAberrant> the default use flags are now pretty sane in the profiles
[10:32:55] <JustAberrant> and the default kernel options, again, are mostly sane
[10:32:58] <Phase> i assume that implies -mtune=auto
[10:33:01] <tiwake> or I could look up my processor?
[10:33:03] <JustAberrant> or you can use genkernel and not need to think about it at all
[10:33:19] <JustAberrant> tiwake: sure, but unless you have a reason to, why?
[10:33:40] <tiwake> donno... lol
[10:33:40] * JustAberrant has CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=native -ggdb"  :D
[10:34:05] <Phase> -ggdb vs -g, does it add much?
[10:34:32] <tiwake> amd A6-4455M
[10:34:52] <JustAberrant> Phase: probably not
[10:35:02] <Phase> i would also use https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Toolchain
[10:35:03] <PinkiePieBot> [ Hardened/Toolchain - Gentoo Wiki ]
[10:35:12] <Phase> but compile times :(
[10:35:18] <JustAberrant> ggdb produces debug information specifically for gdb, but the native debug info produced by -g is almost certainly going to be fine
[10:35:22] * Phase would likely use gentoo if not for compile times
[10:35:40] <tiwake> how long does it take to compile? lol
[10:35:50] <JustAberrant> to be honest I'm pretty sure I use ggdb because something somewhere at somepoint told me to :>
[10:36:09] <Phase> there's no reason not to unless you're using lldb
[10:36:19] <Phase> which can probably digest the gdb specific stuff anyway
[10:36:37] <Phase> tiwake, if you want firefox, leave your machine on overnight
[10:36:43] <JustAberrant> hehe
[10:36:46] <JustAberrant> firefox is brutal
[10:36:57] <Phase> there's a binary package but its use flags may not match yours
[10:37:05] <JustAberrant> the ebuild will actually bail out if you don't have some ridiculous amount of ram
[10:37:30] <Phase> as in available space (ram + swap) or straight up ram
[10:37:35] <tiwake> the SSD I have should help at least somewhat
[10:38:02] <Phase> io isn't that large a portion of build time imo, especially with c++
[10:38:40] <JustAberrant> Phase: straight ram

[10:40:21] * Phase has 24
[10:40:31] <JustAberrant> for some reason I thought this was higher
[10:40:36] <Phase> though i remember the build peaking at something like 10GB
[10:40:50] <Phase> too many templates

[10:53:44] <Compu> it says its from legalnotice@linkedin.com
[10:54:02] <Compu> something about linkedin's improper use of the add connections feature

[10:55:03] <JustAberrant> hehe, it might actually be legit, but could be some scammer trying to take advantage of the situation like some did with the sony thing

[10:56:00] <JustAberrant> up to you

[10:58:13] * JustAberrant googled out of curiosity
[10:58:15] <JustAberrant> http://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-settles-class-action-lawsuit-2015-10
[10:58:15] <PinkiePieBot> [ LinkedIn settles class-action lawsuit - Business Insider ]
[10:58:35] <JustAberrant> LinkedIn's $13 million will be distributed pro rata, meaning that the amount each person gets will depends on how many people file claims. But if the number of claims means that the pay-out amounts to less than $10 per person who filed, LinkedIn will have to add on an additional $750,000.
[10:58:37] <JustAberrant> called it ;p
[11:00:16] <JustAberrant> so basically there's a big pot of money, and the amount everyone gets depends on how many people make a claim
[11:00:33] <tiwake> yeah, class action lawsuits are pretty worthless, as its just the lawyers getting any amount of money
[11:01:02] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it's more about punishing the company than actually getting anything for the plaintiffs
[11:01:09] <JustAberrant> most of the money goes to lawyers
[11:01:20] <JustAberrant> and what's left is spread so broadly it doesn't matter

[16:56:14] <Sour_Sweet> pseudo* clickjacking*
[16:56:58] <Sour_Sweet> I'm not concerned about my bookmarks. I need webdev tools and KeePass HTTP support
[16:57:28] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: dunno about those but still look into vivaldi
[16:57:36] <Sour_Sweet> I'll have a look
[16:57:53] <Compu> i've heard its written entirely in node.js

[19:02:46] <Compu> JustAberrant: i have time warner cable, im gonna switch to fiber as soon as the local fiber company decides to support ipv6
[19:02:52] <Dusk> Sure but like it doesn't make it a good idea D:
[19:03:08] <Compu> Dusk: yes well thats ur opinion
[19:03:11] <JustAberrant> not if you rely on it for business, of course not.. but for a hobby, it's not that bad
[19:03:19] <Dusk> I suppose
[19:03:25] <JustAberrant> absolute worse that's gonna happen, the ISP will call you up and tell you to knock that shit off
[19:03:33] <JustAberrant> which is pretty damn unlikely
[19:03:40] <Dusk> Compu: doesn't Time warner do data caps?
[19:03:54] <Dusk> I don't remember as it's been a while since I've used them
[19:04:02] <Compu> JustAberrant: ISP doesnt care, they know i run a website and such and they dont care as long as i dont mind dealing with sticky dynamic ip addressing
[19:04:10] <Compu> Dusk: no thats comcast
[19:04:20] *** Joins: MisterSkids (ejd@Pony-fej07d.res.rr.com)
[19:04:20] <Dusk> comcast doesn't have a data cap anymore
[19:04:22] <JustAberrant> Compu: yeah, that's pretty normal
[19:04:29] <Dusk> They haven't for a while
[19:04:34] <Compu> k
[19:04:41] <Dusk> Source: I'm using comcast right now
[19:04:49] <JustAberrant> people have run small servers on their home connections forever.. as long as you arn't moving TBs of data a month like that fios guy..
[19:04:55] <JustAberrant> they're not gonna care
[19:05:01] <Compu> i really wanna switch to fiber but i dont want to lose my ipv6 support
[19:05:22] <Dusk> JustAberrant: I wasn't concerned about the ISP
[19:05:34] <Compu> JustAberrant: most people just use the lightirc clients i host
[19:05:36] <Dusk> most ISPs don't care unless you're getting hammered with traffic then they complain
[19:05:49] <Compu> some people like them better than canternet's webclient
[19:06:00] <Dusk> Canternet uses lightirc....
[19:06:08] <Compu> yeah but i use the dark theme
[19:06:13] <Dusk> "T
[19:06:16] <Dusk> :T*
[19:06:22] <Dusk> okidoke then I guess
[19:06:25] <Compu> people like the dark theme
[19:06:35] <Dusk> I mean I won't go back to using a web client if I can help it.
[19:06:38] * JustAberrant doesn't believe in themes ;p
[19:06:39] <Dusk> I'm too attached to weechat
[19:06:43] <Compu> me neither
[19:07:03] <Compu> but i know people who r deathly afraid of ever installing anything new on their computer
[19:07:05] <Dusk> But for people who don't know how to IRC or just don't use it then sure
[19:08:10] <Compu> Dusk: one of my main rpers in my channel is afraid of ever installing anything or sometimes even just downloading anything (like a picture or something) to their hard drive
[19:08:26] <Compu> they also r deathly afraid of ever signing up for anything ever
[19:08:37] <Compu> it took my a few days to get him to register with nickserv
[19:08:39] <JustAberrant> ironically using a web based client is probably far less secure
[19:08:41] <Compu> me*
[19:09:02] <Compu> JustAberrant: meh not like hes giving credit card numbers over irc
[19:09:09] <JustAberrant> it's not that
[19:09:24] <JustAberrant> you're basically repeatedly downloading and running something off the internet
[19:09:43] <JustAberrant> and flash is an exploit posterchild
[19:09:52] *** Quits: firestream (vinylderpy@Pony-i78.l4s.158.69.IP) (Connection closed)
[19:09:53] <Compu> yeah but u try to convince him to use a client u have to install
[19:09:56] <Dusk> Yea flash is great for exploits
[19:10:06] <Dusk> Everyone loves to break it
[19:10:22] <tiwake> screw flash
[19:10:36] <Dusk> Compu: Also you should ssl
[19:10:37] <Compu> and non flash clients apparently have to route everything through the server which makes it appear that everyone using my webclient is connecting from my ip address
[19:10:53] <Compu> Dusk: couldnt figure out how to set it up for free
[19:10:57] <Dusk> wosign
[19:11:56] <Compu> i tried kiwi for a while and link liked it but got mad when i shut it down cuz i found out it looked like everyone was connecting from my ip
[19:12:13] <JustAberrant> Compu: hehe, it's his machine, I just fine it amusing someone using a flash based irc client for security ;p
[19:12:21] <Dusk> ^
[19:12:21] <Compu> i told him that he can use the one hosted on kiwi's website but he doesnt like having to type the server address and stuff in
[19:12:31] <Dusk> Compu: make him a custom client
[19:12:38] <Compu> Dusk: custom client?
[19:12:39] <Dusk> You can do that with kiwi
[19:12:42] <Dusk> yea
[19:12:47] <Dusk> Something that he can bookmark
[19:12:51] <Compu> wouldnt i have to host it?
[19:12:53] <Dusk> No
[19:13:00] <Compu> mmm
[19:13:03] *** RedHelper|AFK is now known as RedHelper
[19:13:08] <Compu> maybe later then
[19:13:23] <Dusk> You have to have an account with kiwi (You the creator of the custom client)
[19:13:31] <Dusk> but it would just be a link on their server
[19:13:37] <Compu> eh
[19:13:42] <Compu> he might not go for it
[19:13:54] <Dusk> If you make the custom client he wouldn't know :p
[19:13:57] <Compu> i think he likes using my website rather than someone elses cuz we're friends
[19:14:08] <Dusk> And all you'd have to do is make a page with an iframe embed of this client
[19:14:11] <Compu> he'll know its not on my website
[19:14:16] <Compu> oh
[19:14:18] <Compu> eh
[19:14:23] <Compu> maybe
[19:14:26] <tiwake> Compu: http://derpy.me/mdkYy mibbit IRC client... I put the theme together
[19:14:27] <PinkiePieBot> [ derpy.me - Index ]
[19:14:29] <Dusk> It's easy and effective
[19:14:35] <Dusk> tiwake: ew mibbit
[19:14:42] <Compu> tiwake: i've found mibbit to be a bit meh
[19:14:48] <tiwake> hmm, link is no good?
[19:15:02] <Dusk> No the link isn't good
[19:15:04] <JustAberrant> mibbit :)
[19:15:06] <Compu> by the way i did make a custom 404 page
[19:15:12] <tiwake> mibbit is kinda meh, but its flank tons better than flash
[19:15:16] <Compu> http://www.compu.ml/iuhuwerg
[19:15:30] <JustAberrant> mibbit (at least used to, dunno if it still does), had a feature where it would thumbnail images
[19:15:38] <tiwake> well fudge
[19:15:48] <tiwake> JustAberrant: yeah, it does that
[19:15:48] <JustAberrant> so I wrote a script that chunks up an images
[19:15:59] <JustAberrant> and gave me a block of URLs to paste into the channel
[19:16:01] <Compu> tiwake: kiwi seems a lot better
[19:16:03] <Dusk> kiwi is a bit quicker and stuff and looks nicer by default
[19:16:03] <tiwake> I might be able to turn that off though, or maybe I did in my theme
[19:16:17] <tiwake> I dont recall
[19:16:17] <Compu> tiwake: try kiwi out first
[19:16:21] * JustAberrant used to torture someone in particular with that back before freenode banned mibbit

[19:16:46] <PinkiePieBot> [ Kiwi IRC ]
[19:17:21] <tiwake> it was the first pony thing I did... heh
[19:17:25] <Compu> JustAberrant: freenode banned mibbit? i see people still using it
[19:17:29] <Compu> on freenode
[19:17:54] <JustAberrant> hmm, possibly they've unbanned it
[19:18:01] <JustAberrant> this was awhile ago
[19:18:09] <Compu> maybe, or mibbit found a way around the ban
[19:18:19] <JustAberrant> like probably 2009
[19:18:21] <Dusk> No I believe the unbanned it
[19:18:41] <Dusk> I've definitely seen people in some channels I'm in using mibbit
[19:19:21] <Dusk> Or maybe they just like their ident to be mibbit
[19:19:23] <Dusk> iunno
[19:19:29] <Dusk> it's not impossible I guess
[19:19:37] <JustAberrant> hehe
[19:19:43] <JustAberrant> probably people being smart-asses

[19:28:15] <Sour_Sweet> Like all bookmarklets work? Visit randome website, click bookmarklet, get short url in prompt, profit!
[19:28:45] <JustAberrant> tiwake: aw ;p
[19:28:59] <AppleDash> Alright
[19:29:07] <AppleDash> I just wasn't sure where you wanted the short URL to happen
[19:29:09] * JustAberrant just found his old script :D
[19:29:24] <AppleDash> be it in a prompt or in a "shortened" page in a new tab
[19:29:42] <Sour_Sweet> Best thing would be indeed a javascirpt prompt (cause copy paste and things without leaving the site linked)
[19:30:01] <AppleDash> alright
[19:30:25] <Sour_Sweet> Negative site is users won't see the derpy.me page (and therefor no ads and similar)
[19:30:30] <AppleDash> The issue with a bookmarklet though is it kinda opens up a vector for spamming URLs
[19:30:30] <Sour_Sweet> side*
[19:30:32] <AppleDash> but we'll see
[19:30:43] <Sour_Sweet> Sure that's a problem
[19:31:27] <AppleDash> Any suggestions on how to combat that?
[19:31:51] <Sour_Sweet> One could use a one time registration (silly CAPTCHA) and include a unique API key in the bookmarklet
[19:31:54] <tiwake> no you stupid GPS
[19:31:57] <tiwake> bah
[19:32:34] <AppleDash> There's an idea
[19:32:43] <AppleDash> I THINK there's actually support for generating an API key
[19:32:47] <AppleDash> Or was that in the Rails version?
[19:33:38] * Sour_Sweet doesn't even know what software derpy.me uses :P
