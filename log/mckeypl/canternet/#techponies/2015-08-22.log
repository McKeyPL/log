[07:55:01] <init3> Damnit pulseaudio, why do you hate me?
[07:56:00] <init3> I'm trying to trigger a super long audio file so I can tell my IRC client to stop trying to play audio out of the HDMI port, which /everything always/ defaults to. 
[08:05:08] <One-Trick> i had to set the default in my ~/.soundrc
[08:05:16] <One-Trick> but then i stopped using pulse
[08:05:25] *** Quits: MisterSkids (ejd@Pony-fej07d.res.rr.com) (Connection closed)
[08:05:40] <init3> I probably should just do the latter. 
[08:06:04] <init3> I've tried setting the default a number of times in different places it's told me to and it always seems to fuck up
[08:06:34] <init3> There's a reason I need pulse though I think, but I'm at a loss for why that is at the moment. 
[08:07:08] <One-Trick> pulse is getting better at making things work but its still a debacle
[08:07:15] <One-Trick> i just stick to plain ole alsa
[08:07:20] <One-Trick> works wonderfully
[08:08:14] <One-Trick> pulse seems it needful to activate every single device that can act as a soundcard, which is a lot of things on my system, so then i end up with 6 different audio devices and it never gets the order correct
[08:08:49] <init3> Hmm. I wonder what it is that I didn't like about pain alsa.
[08:09:16] <One-Trick> the config can be a bit daunting depending on your needs
[08:09:21] <One-Trick> but it works every time
[08:09:40] <init3> Hmm
[08:09:56] <init3> Fuck it. Pulse has been irritating me a lot. 
[08:10:03] <init3> I'll at least try
[08:10:22] <One-Trick> you can always just turn it back on if you want
[08:10:33] <init3> aye
[08:11:04] <init3> I think it may have had to do with Ableton, but I really don't use that anymore. 
[08:11:26] <One-Trick> perhaps so
[08:11:41] <One-Trick> i would use JACK for things like Ableton, though

[08:19:49] <init3> A ton of packages have libpulse as a hard dependency. I don't even see why but I think it'll keep getting reinstalled. Ugh. It should be simple to just set a default device. Sometimes I just think about disabling the HDMI port sound completely. 
[08:20:19] <init3> I don't know the context Moonlightning but I would guess so
[08:20:49] <Moonlightning> mutt config
[08:21:26] <Moonlightning> which makes me think maybe it's relative to a mail dir or something

[08:22:49] <init3> Hehe.
[08:23:14] <init3> It has been working fine-ish before. I just need to at some point specify to use the right output with some programs
[08:23:37] <init3> And I wiped my PA config the other day to try to track down some weird issue I'm having. 
[08:24:02] <One-Trick> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples
[08:24:05] <PinkiePieBot> [ PulseAudio/Examples - ArchWiki ]
[08:24:09] <One-Trick> about ... 3 examples down
[08:24:15] <init3> Yeah I have that page open
[08:24:16] <One-Trick> how to set the default device
[08:24:20] <init3> And did that 
[08:24:25] <init3> ;p
[08:24:33] <One-Trick> well, then you should be done
[08:24:58] <init3> Should be lol
[08:25:04] <init3> It's pulseaudio
[08:25:32] <One-Trick> just make sure pulse cant write to the file
[08:25:43] <One-Trick> it has a fun time deciding whats best for you
[08:25:46] <Moonlightning> I'm wondering if this is for me
[08:25:48] <JustAberrant> jackd forever!
[08:25:48] <init3> It isn't changing the file
[08:26:01] <init3> It is just ignoring the directive. 
[08:26:05] * JustAberrant has never used pulse.. I either use alsa or jack :>
[08:26:08] <Moonlightning> it seems to be oriented toward storing things as single files
[08:26:15] <One-Trick> alsa4lyfe
[08:26:46] * One-Trick goesbed. ambien wins.
[08:27:17] <init3> I want to go straight alsa but pacman is listing a shit ton of stuff as dependant on it. 
[08:27:36] <init3> Maybe I'll just remove it and blacklist the package
[08:27:50] <Moonlightning> oriented toward a single mail account *
[08:28:36] <Moonlightning> Can I use those percent-encodings here?
[08:28:44] <Moonlightning> ~/mail/%a/drafts
[08:29:41] <Moonlightning> …hayyy, I have an `lpr` binary
[08:29:44] <Moonlightning> wonder where that came from

[15:56:20] <Googie> RainbowHacks: So, that discussion on Firefox...
[15:56:24] <Googie> https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/
[15:56:25] <PinkiePieBot> [ The Future of Developing Firefox Add-ons | Mozilla Add-ons Blog ]
[16:05:40] <tiwake> Googie: thats cool
[16:08:13] <Googie> I'm not really sure that it is. I can certainly see the benefits, but they'll have to tread carefully
[16:08:46] <Googie> Stuff like Pentadactyl could easily be completely impossible under the new model
[16:11:01] <Googie> Interesting that they mention that a possible benefit of the new API would be integration of Servo
[16:11:36] <JustAberrant> not a fan of the whole mandatory signing thing
[16:11:40] <JustAberrant> I mean I get why, but still :(
[16:13:11] <Googie> That too
[16:14:08] <Googie> But by the sounds of it, it won't really be a /huge/ concern. Most people using unsigned addons are power users who won't care about having to install a slightly different build of Firefox anyway

[16:26:55] <JustAberrant> :(
[16:27:01] * JustAberrant still hopes palemoon keeps up
[16:27:05] <JustAberrant> I.. really like pale moon :(
[16:29:43] * HoneyDrops|Half hates all web browsers, just hates FF least.
[16:30:03] * JustAberrant indeed
[16:33:24] <JockeTF> I use Firefox because it integrates well with my desktop environment...
[16:33:41] <JockeTF> ... When using a custom theme for GNOME 3.
[16:35:59] <HoneyDrops|Half> I use it because noscript, requestpolicy (or uMatrix), and a working adblock are the minimum extensions needed to make browsing sane.  pentadactyl is needed to give it a sand UI.
[16:36:11] <HoneyDrops|Half> sane*
[16:40:32] <Googie> On the plus side at least, Pentadactyl is being acknowledged by the developers, which is a good sign
[16:41:48] <Googie> I can understand where they are coming from though, it's pretty hard to improve Firefox's core design at this point with how tightly a lot of addons are integtayed
[16:41:56] <Googie> *integrated
[16:45:07] <HoneyDrops|Half> I don't think there is any way to meaningfully escape that.

[18:20:44] <Moonlightning> Hmmmmmm.
[18:22:02] <Moonlightning> I could make an encrypted volume on my netbox and use it for storing mail and related configfiles and stuff
[18:22:24] <Moonlightning> I'd need to SSH in and mount it by hoof after reboots, but that's not so bad
[18:22:44] <Moonlightning> If it wasn't mounted, mail could just collect on the relevant servers
[18:23:27] <Moonlightning> But when it was mounted, I could have a daemon downloading new stuff and then deleting it all from the servers
[18:23:59] <Moonlightning> And then the mail server my clients would use would just be on the netbox.
[18:24:08] <Moonlightning> How bad of an idea is this?
[18:27:50] <JustAberrant> what is the end goal :(
[18:28:53] <Moonlightning> That's toying with the idea of not leaving mail on providers' servers, while still leaving it accessible to multiple clients.
[18:29:05] <Moonlightning> And keeping it secure.
[18:29:32] <JustAberrant> just run your own mail server?
[18:30:40] <Moonlightning> But if it's on an encrypted volume and the server gets rebooted, the mail server won't be up
[18:31:09] <JustAberrant> don't reboot the server ;p
[18:31:14] <JustAberrant> or have a backup mx
[18:32:03] <Moonlightning> That'd have the same problem.
[18:33:07] <Moonlightning> …I suppose I could rig an alternate daemon on the same machine that would encrypt inbound stuff with my public key before writing it to disk?
[18:34:41] * JustAberrant honestly thinks the only sane way to do it is have two of your own servers (for redundancy) with full disk encryption 
[18:35:10] <JustAberrant> one gets rebooted, other picks up the slack, forwards it back to your main one (over a secure connection) when it comes back up
[18:35:24] <JustAberrant> everythings on your own servers on an encrypted filesystem, boom, done ;p
[18:35:31] <JustAberrant> you can even run your own web client if you want
[18:36:10] <JustAberrant> the kind of rube goldberg stuff you're describing is just asking for it
[18:36:20] <Moonlightning> :I
[18:36:28] <JustAberrant> I mean if you want to do it for the hell of it, sure, but it doesn't seem like a great solution
[18:36:50] <JustAberrant> more moving parts is more stuff to go wrong (and for your paranoia, more attack surface)
