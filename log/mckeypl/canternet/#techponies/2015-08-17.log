[06:36:15] <Moonlightning> :P
[06:39:45] <Phase> PAM is stupid complicated, but you do want an api that does "i am 'ssh', how does auth?"

[17:22:50] <init3> Ohai RainbowHacks. 
[17:23:03] <Moonlightning> init3: backup sharing. Thoughts?
[17:23:17] <init3> I have somehow successfully bullshitted my way through a Windows interview. 
[17:23:26] <init3> What do you mean exactly?
[17:24:04] <Moonlightning> I store backups on your homebox. In exchange, you can store backups on my homebox.
[17:24:23] <init3> Eh
[17:24:32] <Dusk> That requires a lot of trust
[17:24:42] <init3> I guess assuming a very high level of encryption it'd be okay. 
[17:24:50] <Dusk> Yea prolly
[17:24:57] <Moonlightning> Trust of non-malice…yes. Trust of privacy, not so much.
[17:25:14] <Dusk> Unencrypted backups wouldn't be shared regardless of anything
[17:25:26] <Moonlightning> I already trust ponies who hang around here and chat as non-malicious to a degree anyway
[17:25:27] <Dusk> That's just unsafe in general
[17:25:43] <Dusk> Moonlightning: it's not that, I'm just thinking data security in general :p
[17:25:45] <init3> Like I'd be comfortable doing that with Truecrypt but you aren't going to be able to do differential backups. 
[17:25:51] <Dusk> I'm not saying that you'd do something with it
[17:26:05] <init3> Honestly, I think I'd trust that more than say, dropbox. 
[17:26:22] <Dusk> I just happily use my owncloud :3
[17:26:42] <init3> DB is going to bow to a subpeona and have access to your data.
[17:26:59] <Dusk> indeed
[17:27:17] <Moonlightning> I would bow to a subpeona and happily hoof over all the encrypted blobs. :p
[17:27:23] <init3> In the case of a backup exchange the other person is not going to have access to it at all.
[17:27:26] <init3> Exactly
[17:27:27] <Moonlightning> And your IRC nicknames.
[17:27:35] <Dusk> lol
[17:27:52] <Moonlightning> Yeah, I don't actually know anything about these people. Sorry~!
[17:28:03] <init3> Right. Not much more you can do. I wouldn't expect you to be in contempt for my sake.
[17:28:12] <Dusk> exactly, so sure. Swapping encypted backups isn't a bad thing I guess.
[17:28:16] <Moonlightning> Why am I letting them store random information on my computer? Well, because then I can store random information on their computer!
[17:28:24] <init3> Right.
[17:28:27] <Moonlightning> I get free offsite backups—albeit slow ones—but hey, it's free!
[17:28:42] <init3> I kind of like this idea. 
[17:28:47] <init3> Like, a lot.
[17:28:49] <Moonlightning> Online backups are /expensive/, don't you know. And they'd /still/ be slow!
[17:28:58] <Moonlightning> #SharingIsCaring :3
[17:29:11] <init3> I mean, it's going to mostly be limited by your upstream. 
[17:29:29] <Moonlightning> Indeed.
[17:29:35] <Moonlightning> Which is slow. :(
[17:29:49] <init3> I've got 75/10. If your upload speed is faster than that you can just cry me a river. 
[17:29:52] <Moonlightning> It will take days for the initial to complete.
[17:30:13] <Dusk> Moonlightning: If I had a machine to dedicate to this I would
[17:30:17] <init3> But what I lack is a lot of space on my server unfortunate. 
[17:30:24] <Dusk> I however don't have any spare drives that aren't fixing to die
[17:30:30] <Moonlightning> Well, my current backup is ~400 GiB
[17:30:36] <init3> Awhell naw
[17:30:38] <init3> lol
[17:30:39] <Moonlightning> I have 2.3 TiB free
[17:30:51] <Dusk> My current backup is...7.2 TB
[17:31:01] <Moonlightning> I'm willing to allocate…oh, what the hell. I'm willing to allocate one tebi to anypony.
[17:31:11] <Dusk> so...finding an offsite for that is gonna be interesting
[17:31:22] * Moonlightning hopes to one day have lots and lots of space!
[17:31:30] <Dusk> but I guess it already is offsite technically since that drive isn't here with me
[17:31:44] <Dusk> *set of drives
[17:31:51] <Moonlightning> The box I'll be using will host my backups and others', and currently has one 3.5-tebi disk and three open hotswapping bays :D
[17:32:29] <init3> I have about 1Tb free but most of that is on a drive that refuses to operate at USB 2.0
[17:32:44] <init3> So it is slow as hell
[17:33:06] <Moonlightning> 6_9
[17:33:07] <init3> And my curb computer doesn't have SATA so I can't stick it in. 
[17:33:21] <Moonlightning> My network is definitely the bottlnext
[17:33:28] <init3> Huehue. I said 'stick it in'
[17:33:52] <init3> Yeah. I have some crappyish hw
[17:34:07] <HoneyDrops|Half> I have about 300GB of stuff that I consider worth backing up, only about 20GB is worth "multiple backups" to me.
[17:34:33] <init3> Honestly, I'd probably only have 1-2G max. 
[17:35:10] <init3> Most of my storage is stuff that is replaceable. TV shows, movies, games, isos and whatnot. 
[17:36:18] <Moonlightning> Mmm. Yeah, I wouldn't back those up.

[20:29:49] <Finwe> RazorSharpFang: Or did you have some other context in mind?
[20:30:13] <RazorSharpFang> I did; I'm using java frames to create windows. I'm not sure how to do what I want to do though.
[20:30:44] <Finwe> Hmm, graphics in Java.
[20:30:59] <RazorSharpFang> It's not really graphics, just a gui
[20:31:09] <RazorSharpFang> I have no need for OGL or DX
[20:31:43] <RazorSharpFang> Only thing I really need to draw is the gui and an image.
[20:33:35] <RazorSharpFang> Really, I don't think I have a need for window listeners, I just need to get the keyboard and mouse input when the window is in focus.
[20:33:41] <Finwe> Frame is a subclass of Window.
[20:34:51] *** GigaZzz is now known as Gigabit
[20:35:21] <Finwe> An instance of Window is just a plain window, a Frame has e.g. a titlebar.
[20:35:38] <RazorSharpFang> A titlebar is good. I have a titlebar.
[20:36:21] <RazorSharpFang> Finwe: http://i.imgur.com/n2rPQyR.png - this is what I've got so far.
[20:39:34] <Finwe> There is also a JFrame class in javax.swing that extends Frame.
[20:39:51] <RazorSharpFang> Yes. I'm just working with Frame, not JFrame.
[20:40:07] <Finwe> So if you think that you're going to need Swing stuff, use JFrame.
[20:40:20] <RazorSharpFang> I don't know what Swing is.
