[01:29:07] <Gigabit> since when do laptops have propitiatory connects for opitcal drives?
[01:33:24] <Gigabit> Also, if you can figure this out, congrats :P  http://c.wrzuta.pl/wi17346/9737987b00219e614fcf47f6
[01:34:01] <Seoson> Gigabit: I'm quite sure my old Dell did. You could swap the optical drive for a battery. If you meant internal connectors, than I dunno
[01:34:34] <Gigabit> every laptop I have owned, I could take the optical out and the connectors where sata
[01:34:37] <Sombra> The idea of optical drives seems so cool.
[01:34:46] <Moonlightning> laserdiscs :p
[01:35:14] <Colgate> indeed, my uh, 2nd laptop had a dual battery slot that could be either a battery, cd drive, or floppy drive
[01:35:15] <Moonlightning> /laserdisc/ sounds so much cooler than /CD/ ..>
[01:35:22] <Moonlightning> >.> *
[01:35:30] <Moonlightning> fuckkin' missed opportunity gaise
[01:36:10] <Moonlightning> And they are. They're discs that are read and written (sometimes) with lasers. What the hell else is a /laserdisc/ gonna be :p
[01:36:37] <Seoson> Actually thinking about it I don't think the laptop of a friend I took apart had a standard SATA connector for the drive. It was some flatband cable.
[01:37:11] <Seoson> (which probably is only a different layout for SATA)
[01:40:08] <Moonlightning> just to fuck with people? 9.9
[01:40:10] <Divide|TechSupport> What brain donor decided to tell this customer of mine that the IP address for their gateway was 192.168.0.0/23?  I want to end them.

[01:41:11] <Divide|TechSupport> Which had an IP address of 192.168.0.1 by default.
[01:41:36] <Divide|TechSupport> /24, while we're at it.
[01:41:48] <Moonlightning> Seriously? Wow.
[01:42:31] <Divide|TechSupport> In what universe is 192.168.0.0 a valid IP?  I mean, come /on./
[01:42:54] <Colgate> looks like a valid IP to me :P
[01:43:03] <Moonlightning> Well, it is in v6; it's just reserved
[01:43:32] * Moonlightning made the mistake of assigning the all-zero-bits-host-portion address to his netbox.
[01:43:34] <Divide|TechSupport> It's valid, but as Moonlightning said, it's reserved under various different items.
[01:43:37] <Colgate> I would contest any value between 0-255.255.255.255 is a valid IP ;)
[01:43:45] <Divide|TechSupport> Hush, you.  :P
[01:43:50] <Moonlightning> If you do that, you won't notice it unless you try to add another router @.@
[01:43:55] <Moonlightning> or so I'm told
[01:43:58] <Moonlightning> that makes sense though
[01:44:32] <Colgate> I've done some awful things with networking to get more IPs :)
[01:45:14] <Colgate> I was assigned a /30, so I used the broadcast address as unicast :D
[01:46:30] <jaderain> Don't forget IPv6!
[01:47:54] <Colgate> I can't set rdns on my ipv6, makes it a bit limiting :(
[01:48:17] <Seoson> Using either .0 or .255 can lead to problems, since awful network devices eventually filter .255 at least
[01:48:52] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[01:48:53] <jaderain> That sucks :(
[01:49:07] <Seoson> I had a friend that got an .255 from his host for a VPS and he needed to request a new IP because clients were unable to connect
[01:49:24] <jaderain> Anyway, just don't use the network and broadcast IPs and just treat them as /32s and add the static routes :D
[01:50:05] <jaderain> That's what Rylee and I do on our routing VM on ESXi with OVH to avoid losing addresses
[01:50:18] <Rylee> lol
[01:50:19] <Moonlightning> It's /easier/ to do RDNS with v6
[01:50:28] <Moonlightning> you can just delegate the zone for whatever block your customers have to them
[01:50:36] <Moonlightning> you /should/
[01:51:01] <Colgate> I should do that, but it is already setup this way
[01:51:02] <Colgate> >.>
[01:51:04] <Moonlightning> â€¦okay, maybe not, since a lot of people seem to like managed RDNS
[01:51:20] <jaderain> I would prefer it honestly
[01:51:21] <Moonlightning> But you should have a button somewhere easily accessible that does the delegation.
[01:51:22] <jaderain> but that's just me
[01:51:23] <Colgate> managed rdns?
[01:51:35] <Moonlightning> Where someone else does the DNS stuff for you.
[01:51:37] <Moonlightning> Iunno.
[01:51:47] <Colgate> eh, running my own dns is inconvenient :P
[01:51:55] <Moonlightning> I like maintaining zonefiles myself, by hoof.
[01:52:10] <jaderain> Sure, but you could just as easily pick up Route 53 for pennies on the dollar
[01:52:18] <Moonlightning> speaking of, /still/ need to find a way to get BIND to quit clobbering my zonefile
[01:52:21] <jaderain> And just make the NS/SOA entries point there
[01:52:25] <Moonlightning> wat
[01:52:26] <Colgate> and I really don't want to handle that stuff, I can do it, I have done, but it's just annoying
[01:52:27] <jaderain> Moonlightning: What's it doing?
[01:52:37] <Moonlightning> jaderain: well, I tried to configure DNSSECâ€¦ :p
[01:52:49] <Moonlightning> So every hour or so, it rewrites it and makes it all messy. :(
[01:52:55] <Moonlightning> with a bunch of DNSSEC stuff
[01:53:00] * Moonlightning doesn't see why that needs to be written to disk.
[01:53:13] <Seoson> It's not entirely bad that inexperienced users don't run their own NS. There are quite a few pitfalls
[01:53:26] <Moonlightning> Ideally, it would /also/ follow the serial-number convention, but that's not as big a deal
[01:53:40] <Rylee> 18:51:55    Moonlightning â”‚ I like maintaining zonefiles myself, by hoof.
[01:53:41] <Rylee> how awful
[01:53:47] <jaderain> Ah, so what I do, is I make the last 2 entries in the file the DNSSEC entries for my zone,
[01:53:49] <Seoson> I don't run any public NS/DNS server myself. Only for a local network
[01:53:51] <jaderain> As an example:
[01:53:53] <jaderain> ; DNSSEC Keys
[01:53:53] <jaderain> $INCLUDE Kjkaufman.me.+007+09422.key
[01:53:53] <jaderain> $INCLUDE Kjkaufman.me.+007+23628.key
[01:53:53] <Rylee> that sounds like pretty much the worst thing ever
[01:54:09] <Colgate> Seoson: same
[01:54:11] <jaderain> And then I just have a script that's cron'd daily to resign to discourage zonewalking
[01:54:21] <Moonlightning> Rylee: I haven't found a web panel thingy that doesn't feel ridiculously limiting.
[01:54:28] <Rylee> who would ever want to maintain their own bind instance
[01:54:32] <Moonlightning> I prefer the freedom and syntax highlighting of vim c:
[01:54:33] <jaderain> Basically, increment the serial, and then do /usr/sbin/dnssec-signzone
[01:54:40] <jaderain> with the proper arguments
[01:54:40] <Rylee> why use vim
[01:54:42] <Rylee> it sucks
[01:54:42] <jaderain> and that works really well
[01:54:45] <Rylee> have you tried Atom?
[01:54:56] <Moonlightning> Oh, you're joking. >.>
[01:55:03] <Rylee> vim is awful
[01:55:05] <Rylee> why would you ever use it
[01:55:14] <Rylee> it's 2015, we can afford to use a real editor now
[01:55:15] <Moonlightning> jaderain: yeahhhhâ€¦see, I set the option to have bind resign automatically.
[01:55:47] <jaderain> ah, so yeah, you're discovering that rndc and the built in bind utilities are shit
[01:55:59] <jaderain> i can't help you with that
[01:56:00] <jaderain> xD
[01:56:14] <Seoson> I'm currently using Cloudflares NS server and I'm very happy. DNSSEC, an API, TTLs as low as I want (default is 5 min), anycast ...

[01:56:41] * Moonlightning nods.
[01:56:44] <Moonlightning> I'll take a look at it later.
[01:57:16] <Seoson> Their API rate limit is 5000 requests per hour iirc. I could run a DNSBL from that ;-)

[01:58:07] <jaderain> but i've had a good experience with Route 53 and Google's Hosted DNS
[01:58:22] <Seoson> And they're actually reasonable and allow you to download and upload zonefiles
[01:58:37] <Colgate> I've been using HE for a while, does just about everything I've cared about besides dnssec
[01:58:42] * Googie likes a lot of vim. Though the core of the editor itself has issues

[01:59:00] <Googie> neovim and Emac's Evil Mode are both options though
[01:59:03] <Seoson> Moonlightning: file upload and API
[01:59:17] <Moonlightning> Seoson: with more scripts and a cronjob? Messy.
[01:59:31] <Moonlightning> Updating the file and reloading bind to make a change is nice and clean.

[02:00:36] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-lu48ce.lnk.telstra.net)
[02:00:44] <Moonlightning> That's the problem, I only have one (permanent) server. You're s'posed to have at least two.
[02:00:45] <Seoson> I may try to run a public NS in the future, since we consider streaming service bans using a custom DNSBL
[02:01:04] * Moonlightning has two NS records; ns1 and dns1. Both point to the same IP.
[02:01:26] <Moonlightning> Mmm, mine isn't a public nameserver.
[02:01:48] <jaderain> Yeah
[02:01:54] <jaderain> ANd they're supposed to be on different subnets/servers too
[02:02:07] <Moonlightning> Well, that goes without saying
[02:02:10] <Seoson> Moonlightning: There are services that will host the 2nd for you - even free
[02:02:26] <Seoson> jaderain: It's not enforced though
[02:02:40] <Moonlightning> Aren't they supposed to be on like different continents or something, too?
[02:02:48] <Moonlightning> Seoson: Iunnoâ€¦the ones I checked out seemed pretty sketch.
[02:02:52] <HoneyDrops> vim's ui-model is ideal, however vimscript is pretty sucky
[02:02:54] <Moonlightning> 'd rather have somepony from here do it :P
[02:03:08] * Moonlightning has never gotten into vimscript. It seems pretty daunting. @.@
[02:03:17] <Rylee> just use atom
[02:03:20] <Rylee> then you could use Javascript
[02:03:22] <Rylee> easy language
[02:03:50] <Moonlightning> function truncate_to_int(num) { return ~~num; }  // best language
[02:05:14] <Seoson> I'd host it, but as I said I have almost zero experience with bind as of now
[02:05:25] <HoneyDrops> I'd rather use perl, or even python.
[02:05:48] <HoneyDrops> LISP is good too, but then you'd just as well use emacs

[02:07:53] <Moonlightning> vim has spoiled me to nano
[02:08:10] <Seoson> It might be the simple fact that the first 'nix editor I used was nano
[02:09:16] <HoneyDrops> nano is fine, I'll use it in a pinch.

[22:15:34] <Moonlightning> DS records seem to be the missing piece for me.
[22:15:38] <Moonlightning> That website seems to agree.
[22:15:53] <mniip> imagine a free bits/gems exchange market
[22:16:04] <mniip> there is not a single bits/gems price
[22:16:25] <mniip> there are just some people wanting to sell and buy gems at different prices
[22:16:53] <mniip> and whenever someone wants to sell a gem for X bits, and someone else wants to buy a gem for X bits, they annihilate
[22:16:56] <mniip> a trade occurs
[22:17:34] <mniip> as such, all sell prices are always above all buy prices
[22:17:55] <mniip> and the "price" is somewhere inbetween
[22:18:41] <mniip> for example if no one sells gems for less than 10 bits, and no one wishes to buy gems for more than 9 bits,
[22:18:48] <mniip> it's fair to say that the price is between 9 and 10
[22:18:54] <mniip> now the thing is
[22:19:06] * Moonlightning nods?
[22:19:09] <mniip> if you start selling gems for 9 bits
[22:19:32] <mniip> eventually, people who wanna buy gems for 9 bits are going to run out
[22:19:40] <mniip> and only those who buy for <9 would be left
[22:20:16] <mniip> if you try to sell a lot of gems, this will eventually happen
[22:20:29] <mniip> and
[22:20:50] <mniip> since there is no one to buy gems for 9 bits
[22:20:55] <mniip> the price is now between 8 and 9
[22:21:00] <mniip> the price has been shifted!
[22:21:23] <mniip> it works the other way too, if you buy a lot of gems the price will go up
[22:21:30] <mniip> now the question is
[22:21:41] <mniip> exactly how many gems can you buy before the price goes up
[22:21:48] <mniip> that is what buy walls are
[22:21:55] <mniip> (and their opposite, sell walls)

[22:25:46] <mniip> hmm no, make that $10

[22:54:19] <Moonlightning> Damn XD
[23:01:41] <mniip> wow
[23:01:44] <mniip> it's going down
[23:01:50] <mniip> $414
[23:02:36] <mniip> someone is pumping
[23:03:00] <mniip> damn chinese
[23:03:31] <mniip> :O
[23:03:47] <mniip> active pump from 405 to 440 in last 10 minutes
[23:04:22] <Seoson> Moonlightning: "9.9.5-3ubuntu0.5-Ubuntu" You might want to add version "Some text here"; under options
[23:05:42] <Moonlightning> Seoson: What? What's that from?
[23:05:56] <Seoson> dig txt chaos version.bind. @sugar-belle.blackl.net
[23:07:37] <Moonlightning> â€¦wat? Those arguments are out of order.
[23:08:18] <Seoson> Works fine for me ;-)
[23:08:52] * mniip wonders what would happen if a .bind tld were to exist
[23:09:50] <Moonlightning> There's a bid. :o
[23:09:53] <Seoson> With the current state of newl gTLDs that could actually happen
[23:09:58] <Moonlightning> yeah :P
[23:10:15] <Moonlightning> That's reallyâ€¦
[23:10:19] <Moonlightning> I really don't like it.
[23:10:35] <Moonlightning> Everything that's using a domain name, but isn't actually a domain name, should be under invalid. :V
[23:11:04] <Seoson> There were two almost indentical ones. .game and .games maybe? I don't recall exaclty
[23:11:13] <Moonlightning> What was that other one?
[23:11:40] <Moonlightning> Docker or something uses fake domain names internally, which is likely to break soon|is breaking now because of a new TLD
[23:11:46] <Moonlightning> invalid.!! :V
[23:12:01] <Seoson> or .local
[23:12:33] <mniip> yeah no
[23:12:34] <Seoson> or use your own namespace (e.g. somedomain.virtual.company.com)
[23:12:34] <Moonlightning> local. is for when it's a real name, just local.
[23:12:40] <mniip> sure icann can't register .local
[23:12:51] <Moonlightning> It's like 2001:db8::/32
[23:13:03] <Moonlightning> I mean *facehoof*
[23:13:23] <Moonlightning> fc00::/7 *
[23:13:47] <Moonlightning> If it's /not a real domain name/, it goes under invalid.
[23:13:58] <Moonlightning> If it's not under invalid., it should have real DNS servers backing it up. :V
[23:14:21] <Moonlightning> I should be able to query about it and get back the same things you expect.
[23:14:36] <Moonlightning> (or, in the case of local., I should be able to if I managed to get onto the right network)
[23:16:54] <Seoson> Wasn't there an application for .onion? ^^
[23:17:44] <Moonlightning> â€¦mmmmmmm.
[23:18:02] <Moonlightning> Okay, good point. What about onion. and bit. and the like?
[23:18:21] <Moonlightning> Based on what I just finished saying, they should be under invalid., too. x.x
[23:18:53] <mniip> oh oh oh 
[23:18:54] <mniip> .int
[23:18:59] <Seoson> Technically no, since invalid host names must be invalid
[23:18:59] <Moonlightning> Would it be possible to set up a system where the network consensus is queried forâ€”
[23:19:03] <Moonlightning> int.?
[23:19:15] <mniip> services.int
[23:19:25] <Moonlightning> services.invalid. -.-
[23:19:51] <Seoson> .invalid must not resolve to any existing records, but i2p for example does
[23:20:04] <Seoson> So that would be a violation of the RFC
[23:20:12] <Moonlightning> Another inconsistencyâ€¦I think e.g. what I did with my server names is acceptable.
[23:20:37] <Moonlightning> I used names right under blackl.net. (and blacklnet.org. before that) before it existed
[23:21:02] <Seoson> Yeah that's now the recommended way for intranets
[23:26:04] <Moonlightning> So, wait, do I send my registrar a DS record, or do they generate it?
[23:26:26] <Seoson> You have to send it silly
[23:26:33] <Seoson> It contains your public key
[23:26:57] <Moonlightning> Which is accessible by querying :P
[23:27:08] <Moonlightning> dig blackl.net. DNSKEY
[23:29:01] <Seoson> That would however defeat the purpose, since being insecure and things
[23:29:34] <Moonlightning> What assurance do I have that this support-ticket mechanism is secure?
[23:29:58] <Seoson> SSL and 2FA on any reasonable registrar
[23:30:09] <Moonlightning> My connection to the website is encrypted with TLS, yes.
[23:30:23] <Moonlightning> But the ticket could easily just be an email.
[23:30:44] <Seoson> It's more likely a website in their intranet
[23:30:56] <Seoson> Or some app connected to a server
[23:30:58] <Moonlightning> Worse, the server I'm getting could just be a facade.
[23:31:05] <Moonlightning> And everything else is taking place not over TLS.
[23:31:20] <Moonlightning> Seoson: It's more likely than not that the DNSKEY record they get from querying is good. ;p
[23:31:41] <Moonlightning> anyway, in either case, the best thing to do is just to check the resulting DS record once it's in place.
[23:31:50] <Moonlightning> And set up notifications if ever it changes
[23:32:23] <Seoson> You have to trust them anyway ^^
[23:33:26] <Moonlightning> Let's Encrypt should expand to being a registrar, too XP
[23:33:36] <Seoson> Please don't
[23:34:00] <Seoson> Registration would be an automatic pain :D
[23:34:40] <Seoson> And you'd have to renew your domain every 90 days because that's more secure
[23:34:54] <Seoson> </sarcasm>
[23:34:57] <Moonlightning> How is it more secure?
[23:35:05] <Moonlightning> 'sides, you can automate it :P
[23:35:34] <Seoson> It not more secure, that's the point. I did a rant on LE a few days ago
[23:36:13] <Colgate> Seoson: wait, what was that about i2p? something uses .i2p now besides i2p?
[23:36:22] *** zz_CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob
[23:36:57] <Seoson> No. We just talked about that could become a thing with some unusual domains (.bind, .onion, .i2p)
[23:37:13] <Colgate> oh, yeah
[23:37:19] <Seoson> And could possibly break some things
[23:37:32] <Colgate> I would think that if someone saw that, they would claim prior use
[23:37:39] <Colgate> and try to blockade it
[23:38:09] <Colgate> probably the same with namecoin
[23:38:15] <Moonlightning> we should submit a request to have bit, onion., and i2p. reserved
[23:38:18] <Colgate> I don't remember the namecoin tld
[23:38:34] <Moonlightning> bit. seems rather likely to be made a new TLD
[23:38:41] <Colgate> indeed
[23:38:42] <Moonlightning> compared to the others, anyway
[23:39:14] <Seoson> Actually .bitnet is a reserved name.
[23:39:21] <Seoson> Use that ;-)
[23:39:30] <Colgate> it is? what is it reserved for?
[23:40:18] <Seoson> It was an historical IBM thing marketed as because itâ€™s time - net.
[23:40:28] <Colgate> "In 1984, a text-based BITNET game called MAD became the first global Multi-User Dungeon (MUD). Players connected from the United States, Europe or Israel to a single server running in France."
[23:40:30] <Moonlightning> well they can't just up and change it now
[23:40:30] <Colgate> neat
[23:40:41] <Seoson> I didn't read the full details. ^^
[23:40:54] <Colgate> apparently it is still around, kind of
[23:41:04] <Colgate> "As of 2007, BITNET has essentially ceased operation. However, a successor, BITNET II, which transmits information via the Internet using BITNET protocols, still has some users."
[23:44:20] <AppleDash> "Thank you for your interest in our beta program! We're excited to let you know that your domains (below) have been whitelisted, and you can now utilize an ACME client to obtain a certificate for them."
[23:44:22] <AppleDash> woo
[23:44:25] <AppleDash> re: let's encrypt
[23:44:41] <Seoson> Old news
[23:45:01] <AppleDash> Um?
[23:45:10] <AppleDash> Not for me considering I just got an email 10 seconds ago
[23:45:11] <Seoson> Enjoy your domain + www subdomain if you didn't apply for every single sub ^^
[23:46:21] <Moonlightning> yeah, that's really stupid :/
[23:46:41] <Moonlightning> I'm hoping and assuming that the stable isn't going to be run like that
[23:46:50] <Seoson> It's not
[23:47:05] <Seoson> But the beta looks like they don't actually wont people to use it
[23:47:17] <Seoson> want* derp
[23:47:39] <Moonlightning> That knda makes sense?
[23:48:22] <Seoson> I was in the 2nd invite wave. I think about 10.000 invites were send out before I got mine and when I started less than 200 certs were deployed
[23:48:44] <AppleDash> Wait, how does this work? How does it stop me from issuing certs for whatever domain I want?
[23:48:49] <Seoson> (That being siad with a 2 day gap I believe)
[23:48:59] <Seoson> AppleDash: There are auth modules
[23:49:27] <Seoson> It either uses a server on 80 or 443 on your machine, an apache2 module, or needs to place files in your webroot
[23:49:59] <Seoson> The later one requires a workaround to work with SANs with different document roots
[23:50:14] <Seoson> And NEVER use apache2 auto-configuration
[23:50:26] <Seoson> It's a pain and did only BS for me
[23:51:02] <AppleDash> s/ auto-configuration//
[23:51:07] <AppleDash> Fixed
[23:51:22] <Seoson> Here is the workaround I mentioned (imho the best method) https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/using-the-webroot-domain-verification-method/1445/7
