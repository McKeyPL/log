[08:25:24] <Moonlightning> Anypony have any idea what could cause an Internet connection to stop working, necessitating a cycling of the Wi-Fi?
[08:26:43] <Phase> no but if you find out i'd love to know

[08:29:55] <LegionRed> Sounds like someone else is broadcasting on your channel. Or something with a strong electric field is completely blocking out your router's ability to transmit.
[08:30:28] <Moonlightning> But why is the cycling so effective?
[08:31:10] <LegionRed> Unsure. 
[08:36:03] <LegionRed> I highly recommend going into the settings, to see if your router supports the scanning function. Which should scan to see if there are other networks attempting to transmit on the same channel. At which point it should choose it's own, open channel and switch to transmitting there. If there is not another conflicting network online... then perhaps it's an issue with the router itself. 
[08:36:03] <LegionRed> Because unless you've placed the router right under a powerful electric motor or microwave... I can't think of what your problem might be otherwise.
[08:36:34] <Moonlightning> damn, I don't know enough about how this stuff works. :I
[08:38:20] <LegionRed> Well, it's not extremely complicated. Least not at what level you're working at.
