[03:35:08] <Gigabit> So with AMD being shakey ATM, do you think its bad time to invest in AMD stock? They are 2.35 right now. 
[03:35:30] <Gigabit> Thinking of investing 20 bucks into penny stocks
[03:36:50] <JustAberrant> best time to buy imo
[03:37:03] <JustAberrant> especially if you are long term
[03:37:05] <JustAberrant> same as VW
[03:37:08] <Gigabit> I need to find out where to now. No clue how
[03:37:14] <JustAberrant> if you don't mind waiting 6 or 7 years to see a return
[03:37:26] <Gigabit> That's fine for me
[03:37:43] <Gigabit> Figured I would do 10 bucks in AMD and the rest in other stocks
[03:38:03] <Gigabit> I know it isn't much but its all I want to risk right noa
[03:38:06] <Gigabit> Now*
[03:38:32] <JustAberrant> keep in mind you're gonna have to pay a brokerage fee
[03:39:30] <JustAberrant> and most brokerage firms will set a minimum purchase
[03:40:05] <Gigabit> That's the only way yo get stocks?
[03:40:14] <Gigabit> To*
[03:40:18] <JustAberrant> well, you can sometimes buy directly from issuers
[03:40:39] <JustAberrant> but they won't talk to you for that kind of money
[03:40:58] <JustAberrant> honestly $20 isn't worth it imo, do some paper trading to practice until you've got at least $1000 to play around with
[03:41:33] <Gigabit> Paper trading? XD
[03:41:41] <JustAberrant> pretend money ;p
[03:41:49] <JustAberrant> whole bunch of sites offer trading simulators and stuff
[03:42:03] <Gigabit> Ooh :s
[03:42:27] <JustAberrant> but yeah, at $8 a trade or so (varies but that's generally what you'll pay), that'll eat up any kind of real return you're gonna get on a $20 investment unless you get really damn lucky
[03:42:49] <JustAberrant> keep in mind you pay that when you make the initial purchase _and_ when you sell
[03:43:21] <JustAberrant> so you'd actually only be buying $12 worth of stock 
[03:43:27] <JustAberrant> and then when you sell it, you'll pay another $8
[03:44:42] <JustAberrant> which means you basically need to see a %230 percent or so return to break even ;p
[03:45:55] <JustAberrant> which is... non-typical ;p
[03:46:12] <JustAberrant> you pretty much need $1000 just to negate the brokerage fee with the kind of increase you can actually expect

[07:15:37] <Moonlightning> dammit, periodic-wrapper is a binary
[07:15:43] <Moonlightning> and the ponypage is useless
[07:16:01] <Moonlightning> bleh, I'll just hope|assume it doesn't modify $PATH…
[07:16:16] <Moonlightning> So…the question now is what $PATH do launchd jobs get.
[07:18:12] *** Quits: Webster (Webster@Pony-4eid99.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:29:08] <Moonlightning> Bingo.
[07:29:19] <Moonlightning> launchd sets PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin GO FIGURE
[07:37:31] <Moonlightning> I feel like I shouldn't add /usr/local/bin to the $PATH for security reasons
[07:38:42] <Moonlightning> but I don't see a better way to do this, and I also feel like if someone is far enough in to be able to edit /usr/local/bin, I have bigger problems
[07:39:12] <Googie> The /usr/local directory is meant for the Administrator to install software to globally, outside anything managed by the distro.
[07:39:32] <Googie> No regular users should have write access to anything there.
[07:41:05] <Moonlightning> Homebrew insists on not running as root, though :/
[07:41:10] <Moonlightning> ugh I dunno
[07:41:21] <Moonlightning> I should really just jump to Gentoo
[07:41:32] <Moonlightning> this is annoying me again
[07:41:39] <Googie> Oh right, OSX.
[07:41:59] <Moonlightning> Fuck it; I'm editing the environment for these jobs
[07:47:11] <Moonlightning> …dammit, they're in /System
[07:49:40] <Moonlightning> OH
[07:50:38] <Moonlightning> …
[07:50:40] <Moonlightning> rainbow-dash:~ blackl% sudo launchctl config system path /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
[07:50:40] <Moonlightning> Configuration applied. You must reboot for changes to take effect.
[07:50:44] <Moonlightning> You're kidding.
[07:50:46] <Moonlightning> You're kidding, right?
[07:51:11] <HoneyDrops> XD
[07:51:13] <Moonlightning> WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF INIT SYSTEM CAN'T RELOAD ITSELF WITHOUT BEING ACTUALLY RESTARTED
[07:51:16] <Finwe> No kidding.
[07:52:29] <Finwe> Moonlightning: Why are you still here and not writing a C compiler from scratch for compiling Gentoo?
[07:52:51] <Moonlightning> why would I do that
[07:53:39] <Finwe> Or why not write the whole OS from scratch? Then you get exactly what you want.
[07:54:18] <Moonlightning> It'd be so hacky
[07:54:23] <Moonlightning> If I tried to write an OS
[07:55:50] <HoneyDrops> Better, design and build your own CPU with a custom instruction set, then code your own *nix clone to it!
[07:56:22] <Moonlightning> We actually could do with a free CPU…thing
[07:56:41] <Moonlightning> And there'd just need to be an LLVM backend for it, yeah?
[07:56:50] <Moonlightning> then you could compile C, C++, and Rust for it
[07:56:55] *** GeekBrony is now known as GeekBrony_Zz
[07:57:12] <Moonlightning> from there, you can bootstrap Python from C, and probably other scripting languages
[07:57:56] <Moonlightning> everything else that uses LLVM is good
[07:58:00] <Moonlightning> and you're basically golden
[07:58:26] <HoneyDrops> perl!
[07:59:52] <Moonlightning> What's Perl run on?
[08:00:31] <HoneyDrops> So, because I am late to the party, WTF is the different between PSP custom firmwares?  I am using 6.60-LME-2.3  But the same dev also has a 6.60-ME-2.x branch as well?  It seems to be working fine, but there is so much out of date info... and I don't really want to read several 80+ /page/ threads ;_;
[08:00:53] <HoneyDrops> perl should just need a c compiler and a libc?
[08:01:04] <Moonlightning> Sure; we have a C compiler
[08:01:15] <Moonlightning> That's like the first thing
[08:01:17] <Moonlightning> silly
[08:01:39] <Moonlightning> hmmm…can you bootstrap PyPy from another Python?
[08:02:51] <HoneyDrops> There is also some "PRO" firmware too.

This orange haired baboon (no offense the the many polite and civil baboons out there) has advocated forced registration based on religious affiliation, closing borders on the basis or religion, and now is proposing shutting down the global free exchange of ideas?  The parallels are painfully clear.  I would have liked to

[23:22:29] <tiwake> what is a good IRC client for android?
[23:22:52] <Gladiolus> IrcCloud is what I use on ios, I'm sure it has an andorito.
[23:23:03] <tiwake> screw iOS
[23:23:14] <Xefir> I use AndroIRC, it feets my needs
[23:23:17] <Xefir> Hi all ^^"
[23:23:29] <tiwake> feets your needs

[23:24:27] <tiwake> I don't like android either, really
[23:24:39] <tiwake> going to try install SailfishOS on my cellphone sometime soon
[23:25:07] <Gladiolus> why tho
[23:25:16] <Gladiolus> It just slightly annoys me and is white noise.
[23:25:34] <tiwake> why SailfishOS? or why do I not like android? or why do I not like iOS?
[23:26:41] <tiwake> Xefir: thats alright, I prefer hooves, but feet are a valid thing to like too XD
[23:27:41] <HoneyDrops> I can say my dislike of iOS and Android is more or less the same:  Both are beholden to masters other than the user.

[23:29:01] <HoneyDrops> I can't speak to the interface, never having used it first-hoof.
[23:29:29] <tiwake> android's UI seems better, at least the version I'm running (6.something)

[23:29:51] <tiwake> I've heard SailfishOS's UI is the best

[23:30:23] <tiwake> internet hearsay
[23:31:41] <HoneyDrops> I have a craplet that uses Android... I don't care for it, but that is more the hardware than the software - onscreen keyboards universally suck.
[23:31:44] <Sour_Sweet> Android's UI makes me want to puke sometimes
[23:32:11] <Sour_Sweet> Like I cannot find the USB settings anymore
[23:32:26] <johnsey> imma try out SailfishOS once i got my fairphone 2, then i'll let you know if the ui is any good
[23:32:30] <Sour_Sweet> It used to be a notification as soon as you plug a USB cord in
[23:33:27] <HoneyDrops> My android tablet mostly just sits there being a very bright digital clock 99.9% of the time.
[23:34:50] <tiwake> johnsey: I suspect my SailfishOS experience is between now and the weekend
[23:35:40] <tiwake> I might hold off on installing SailfishOS till the weekend so I can say I gave it a fair chance

[23:48:11] <Gladiolus> and the vm wouldn't be that, I guess. I dunno fart.

[23:48:19] <tiwake> OEM or not
