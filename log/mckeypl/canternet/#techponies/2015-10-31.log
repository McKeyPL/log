[01:07:18] <Moonlightning> You might be breaking that law, though. By having an offshore server you use as a proxy, you might count as an ISP under that law and be required to log all of your own traffic for the local NSA… -.-
[01:07:55] <Moonlightning> Sour_Creep: So…uh…do it the manual way! I didn't want it messing with my config, either; I just had it drop the relevant files in a directory and leave the configuration to me.

[01:13:55] <Moonlightning> Derpibooru lost all of my notifications from before the migration! D:
[01:17:28] <Divide|TechSupport> JustAberrant: Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.  Heck, an innumerable number of devices simply run one version of Linux or another.  Many of my customers are confused when they see a Linux box on their network which is, in fact, just a modem/router.
[01:24:44] <Moonlightning> A /proper/ Linux box. Not just something that runs Linux.
[01:25:08] <Moonlightning> Android and OpwnWRT devices are, for example, not proper Linux boxes.
[01:25:31] <Moonlightning> I should say proper *nix box, actually. Doesn't have to be Linux, just a full-featured POSIX-compliant OS.
[01:45:05] <JustAberrant> what Moonlightning said..
[01:46:45] <Moonlightning> So…depends on what you distribute as your netboxes :p
[01:46:52] <Moonlightning> /My/ netbox is a proper Linux box, but that's just /me/
[01:46:57] <JustAberrant> big difference between a minimalist linux or bsd running on a sbc and something you can ssh to without soldering
[01:46:59] <Moonlightning> presumably, yours are less…featured
[01:47:07] <Moonlightning> yeah, exactly
[01:47:32] <Moonlightning> note that if it makes attempts to stop you from messing with it *cough* ANDROID *cough*, it's not a proper box

[01:50:29] <JustAberrant> should be good and hackish
[01:56:12] <Moonlightning> I know OSes zero memory previously allocated to one process before allocating it to a new one…do they also tend to zero memory allocated to a process when it exits?
[02:04:38] <Phase> i wouln't imagine they do
[02:04:56] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: lots of different ways to go about that.

[02:08:14] *** Joins: Phase (Phase4@Pony-u4lofk.internode.on.net)
[02:09:29] <Moonlightning> I mean, it's either zero it then, or zero it when it needs to be reused
[02:09:43] <Moonlightning> but, once the process exits, you know you're gonna have to zero it anyway before you give it to anything else
[02:10:03] <wolfyshy> there is https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.securestring%28v=vs.110%29.aspx on windows
[02:10:07] <wolfyshy> which uses DPAPI internally
[02:10:09] <PinkiePieBot> [ SecureString Class (System.Security) ]
[02:10:17] <Moonlightning> Or…I guess you could zero it slowly, using system idle time
[02:10:21] <Moonlightning> …what?
[02:11:20] <wolfyshy> it is encrypted in memory and erased (0'd) immediately on free
[02:11:48] <wolfyshy> FIPS-compliant payment gateways use securestring for PANs
[02:12:15] <Moonlightning> that's…kinda not at all what I was asking
[02:12:51] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: at least all of windows, linux, solaris, aix, and freebsd don't 0 out when it exits because it will just be 0d out again when another process needs it
[02:12:55] <wolfyshy> why 0 it twice
[02:13:20] *** Quits: ButterBean (Dragony@Pony-458.d8k.20.198.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[02:13:21] <wolfyshy> but typically you only care/ask about that if you have something sensitive in your memory, so you use something like securestring for that
[02:13:23] <wolfyshy> then it doesn't matter
[02:13:45] <Moonlightning> oh, allocations are zeroed unconditionally during allocation?
[02:13:52] <wolfyshy> I think openbsd can be coerced to 0 out memory as it is freed, which would include the entire process image on exit, but it incurs a severe performance penalty
[02:14:17] <Moonlightning> why zero the process image though?
[02:14:35] <Moonlightning> most of the time, the binary's going to be sitting on disk anyway
[02:14:49] <wolfyshy> uh, that includes .data, .bss, etc.
[02:14:51] <Moonlightning> and if you're storing passwords or keys in the binary, you're doing it wrong :p
[02:15:00] <Moonlightning> …ohh.
[02:15:05] <wolfyshy> static allocations (i.e. char passwd[64];)
[02:15:13] <Moonlightning> Okay yeah.
[02:15:37] <Moonlightning> as an author, though, shouldn't you be doing all that stuff on the heap?
[02:15:41] <Moonlightning> for exactly that reason
[02:17:36] <wolfyshy> also, something like securestring can be done on linux using a variety of syscalls
[02:17:51] <wolfyshy> madvise with MADV_DONTDUMP, mprotect with PROT_READ
[02:18:03] <wolfyshy> or even PROT_NONE until you need it
[02:18:28] <wolfyshy> was looking hard into implementing a securestr in python, but it's a LOT harder than it seems.
[02:19:10] <Moonlightning> I feel like Python is not the kind of thing you wanna be doing that with anyway :P
[02:19:15] <Moonlightning> password and crypto stuff
[02:20:18] <wolfyshy> well I was writing a chat client in it
[02:20:30] <wolfyshy> and wanted to dispose of the user's sasl password or certificate when it was no longer needed
[02:20:45] <wolfyshy> turns out that is a lot harder than it sounds with python
[02:21:18] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[02:22:03] <Moonlightning> and then, there's the risk that something you pass it to might make a copy

[20:31:41] <Moonlightning> It's just really annoying, especially when I try to use my weechat relay, 'cos I connect over the VPN, and everything takes a long time to upload to the relay client.
[20:31:52] <Moonlightning> Also, the laaaag in IRC
[20:32:18] <Moonlightning> Anyway, my point is that I want to throttle this upload so that everything else has normal latency.
