[09:57:23] <ShivalWolf> and good luck when your behind a nat. which is why its not the default
[09:57:43] <HoneyDrops> Yeah :/
[09:57:54] <Phase> ShivalWolf, the issue with that is less dcc and more no client i've seen even tries to work with nats
[09:58:10] <Phase> no upnp or nat-pmp support
[09:58:17] <ShivalWolf> Phase: thats becuase irc is a simple protcol and handling nats is a pain in the ass and upnp sucks balls
[09:58:33] <ShivalWolf> anyone who did implment it would be like skype
[09:58:35] <HoneyDrops> I mean I guess end-to-end encryption is passable, but ideally the server shouldn't even be able to tell PMs are happening.
[09:58:37] <ShivalWolf> which tries to open up port 80
[09:59:00] <Phase> and 443, one of the ways it works around firewals
[09:59:05] <ShivalWolf> yeah
[09:59:09] <ShivalWolf> a chat client should not do that
[09:59:12] <Phase> it's real scummy about working around firewalls
[09:59:34] <ShivalWolf> skype causes sooo many ids alerts when it tries
[09:59:42] <Phase> skype isn't a chat client, it's a tool for controlling the voip market
[09:59:51] <ShivalWolf> becuase its all seen as corrupted http
[10:00:01] <HoneyDrops> In an ideal world firewalls would not be configured badly.
[10:00:17] <ShivalWolf> firewalls dont need to be configured baddly
[10:00:24] <ShivalWolf> its just random things reaching in is a terrible idea
[10:01:07] <ShivalWolf> anyhting point to point with chat is kinda poinless now days. just make sure you encrypt on both ends and who cares what it goes though in the middle
[10:01:09] *** Quits: Mike_Coltfield (Larscis@colt.in.the.rain) (Quit: Well, that was unexpected...)
[10:01:24] <ShivalWolf> propper OTA support in irc would be nice
[10:02:04] <HoneyDrops> The problem is the middle can still know party A is taking to party B
[10:02:35] <HoneyDrops> even if you don't know what is being said, you know there is a conversation.
[10:02:45] <ShivalWolf> which is far better then both party A and party B having to open communication ports
[10:02:53] <ShivalWolf> for direct connectivity
[10:03:23] <ShivalWolf> and also nothing stops you boucing irc via proxies
[10:03:29] <ShivalWolf> and then the server only has the proxy endpoint
[10:03:42] <ShivalWolf> but if your that paranoid
[10:03:46] <ShivalWolf> maybe you shouldnt be using the net at all

[10:29:14] <Moonlightning> Ahh
[10:29:28] <Moonlightning> Well, implementing any kind of OTR, you'd have infrastructure issues
[10:29:55] <Moonlightning> At best, you get protection against passive eavesdropping by the IRC network
[10:32:17] <ShivalWolf> OTR for PM's not for in channels
[10:32:27] <ShivalWolf> OTR in a channel woudl be almost impossible

[12:44:33] <Moonlightning> Hmmm…what kind of caching policy would be best for this?
[12:45:16] <Moonlightning> building chains of Wikipedia articles based on the first (non-italicized, non-parenthesized) link in their text, until the chain terminates at /Philosophy/ (or in a loop)
[12:48:12] <Moonlightning> Thing is, there seem to be a few very common “last legs”
[12:48:30] <AppleDash> Oh, you're playing the hitler game but with less hitler and with a script
[12:49:22] <Moonlightning> For example, Science -> Knowledge -> Awareness -> Consciousness -> Quality (philosophy) -> Philosophy
[12:49:32] <Moonlightning> a LOT of things are going to end in that.
[12:50:02] <Moonlightning> like, a LOT A LOT A LOT
[12:51:09] <Moonlightning> Because so many articles will start with /In <X field of science>/, with a link to X, and if you follow that, you'll end up at /Science/, and then you'll be following the chain I just posted
[12:52:11] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: Hitler game?
[12:52:34] <Moonlightning> In this context, you always follow the /first[*]/ link; you can't pick any of them
[12:52:43] <Moonlightning> according to xkcd, you will always end up at /Philosphy/
[12:53:32] <Moonlightning> (and, yes, /Philosophy/ loops back to itself after a few iterations. HoneyDr_ps checked that.)
[12:54:12] <Moonlightning> …uh-oh.
[12:54:19] <Moonlightning> > Adolf Hitler -> Austria-Hungary -> Austria-Hungary
[12:57:03] <Moonlightning> If you take the /second/ link in /Austria-Hungary/ instead, you get Constitutional monarchy -> Government -> State (polity) -> Political division -> Region -> Geography -> Science -> Knowledge -> Awareness -> Consciousness -> Quality (philosophy) -> Philosophy
[12:57:26] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: Pick a random page and follow links until you get to the page about Adolf Hitler. Either you vs friends the shortest chain wins, or you have to get it in under a certain #
[13:00:16] <Moonlightning> Mmm.
[13:00:30] <Moonlightning> Enlarged to Show Detail -> Documentary film -> Non-fiction -> Content (media) -> Information -> Question -> Referring expression -> Linguistics -> Science
[13:00:32] <Moonlightning> Aw /man/
[13:00:37] <Moonlightning> That one was so promising

[13:19:26] <Moonlightning> > [The user's] keys need to be less than 256 characters long
[13:19:33] <Moonlightning> What? Why? Why not support adding fingerprints?
[13:20:14] <Sour_Sweet> (Also for the record I'd not use that when using a 3rd party DNS provider
[13:21:36] <Sour_Sweet> Moonlightning: OpenSSH limitations. Also you want to have a copy of the public key and not trust the client to provide you with one.
[13:22:52] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: if you're not verifying DNS records yourself (or at the very least delegating verification to an intimately-trusted host via a secure link), then you are //doing it wrong.//
[13:23:24] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: also, using a hash is fine! SHA2 has no preimages.
[13:23:35] <Moonlightning> If SHA2 DOES have preimages, then we have a LOT of problems.
[13:24:59] <Sour_Sweet> Moonlightning: I trust CF, but that doesn't mean they don't receive a court order / NSL
[13:26:26] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: CloudFlare receives a court order to start serving up bogus DNS records. (/What?/ Never mind; let's just pretend it happens.) Client receives bogus DNS records. Records fail validation and are rejected. Your point is…?
[13:27:00] <Moonlightning> : >~alice/.ssh/authorized_keys; chown root ~alice/.ssh/authorized_keys; chmod 600 ~alice/.ssh/authorized_keys;
[13:27:04] <Moonlightning> Also, what the /hell/ is that? ^
[13:27:05] <Sour_Sweet> Aha except for CF manages the keys
[13:27:31] <Sour_Sweet> They can (and do) sign your records
[13:27:47] <Moonlightning> Ohhh, you meant the /other/ kind of DNS provider
[13:28:03] <Moonlightning> yeahno; I do my own DNS
[13:28:14] <Sour_Sweet> When required to they can serve any record they want  ;-)
[13:28:26] <Moonlightning> They'd have to court order ChunkHost to hack my server and edit the zonefiles (and signal bind)
[13:28:30] <Moonlightning> which would be even more WTF
[13:29:07] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah and if you use disk encryption on your server that'd fail.
[13:29:11] <Moonlightning> …actually, I guess they could probably make the net. people change the DS… :/
[13:29:35] <Moonlightning> I'm told that there's FDE, but they have the keys.
[13:29:52] <Moonlightning> which I'm fine with, because I want my server to come back up autonomously <.<
[13:29:57] <Moonlightning> 'cos, y'know, it's a SERVER
[13:30:54] <Sour_Sweet> I'm on a physically separated server. I could set up my own encryption if I wanted to

[20:34:55] <tiwake> Colgate: "knowing everything about you does not hurt you", so it must be made legal
[20:36:52] <Colgate> "All of the evidence contained in smartphones and similar devices will be lost to law enforcement, so long as the criminals take the precaution of protecting their devices with passcodes. Of course they will do so."
[20:37:02] <Colgate> recent events have proven that most criminals don't
[20:38:08] <HoneyDrops> Colgate: I think because the fail to grasp the very basic fact that the universe is utterly indifferent to their wants.  They can shout at the wind all they like, but it will still blow.  Math does not care.  Math will never care.  You can't make it care, no matter how hard you believe, pray, stamp your feet or legislate.
[20:38:44] <Colgate> hell, most people don't even secure their phone in any way
[20:39:04] <Colgate> it might be encrypted, but that doesn't matter when it is on 24/7 with a simple swipe to unlock screen
[20:40:01] <Colgate> the biggest security hole I have is that law enforcement might be able to keep my phone running for long enough time that an exploit to get past the lock screen happens
[20:40:09] <tiwake> whenever security comes up I think of this comic https://xkcd.com/538/
[20:40:09] <PinkiePieBot> [ xkcd: Security ]
[20:40:22] <Colgate> maybe I should set a script to reboot my phone every 2 weeks, no matter what
[20:41:41] <HoneyDrops> tiwake: yeah, but at least in civilized society we have rules that forbid the latter.  Plus you can reasonably set up systems where the wrench will still not get you what you want.
[20:42:44] <AppleDash> HoneyDrops: Those rules will go out the window if they REALLY want what you have
[20:42:47] <tiwake> civilized is an artificial construct, and breaks down very fast
[20:42:50] <HoneyDrops> The threat of violence to coerce is a practice that can't end quickly enough.
[20:43:23] <HoneyDrops> AppleDash: and those who throw out those rules, deserve the pain and misery they get for it.
[20:44:10] <tiwake> need the death penalty to be enforced more often
[20:44:36] <HoneyDrops> In any case, again, I will repeat: the problem solves it self.  Humanity can rise above the baggage, or will just be another footnote in the fossil record.
[20:47:16] * HoneyDrops opposes the death penalty.  Irreversible punishments make a poor fit for an imperfect system.  Plus it's a lousy punishment, really.  Plenty don't fear death, or don't consider teh consequences anyway.  Plus it's over relatively quickly, unless you make the form of execution slow and painful :/  (or you have buy into the fairy tale of an afterlife)
[20:48:19] *** Gigaway is now known as GigaBookworm
[20:58:17] <HoneyDrops> "Netflix's chief product officer Neil Hunt has admitted that the company has 'no magic solution' to subscribers who use VPNs to access content not licensed for their geographical region"  I guess it's good to admit the obvious, now how about lets abandon the idiocy of license-regions?
[21:05:41] <Colgate> so random thought
[21:05:54] <Colgate> if new york state outlaws encryption on phones
[21:06:13] <Colgate> how can places be hipaa compliant? it requires data to be encrypted at rest
[21:07:43] <tiwake> Colgate: same with insurance sales people... have to have encryption
[21:08:32] <tiwake> also, my $12 tempered screen protector came in today
[21:08:48] <tiwake> after like a month or so of waiting
[21:08:49] <tiwake> heh
[21:09:24] <HoneyDrops> Colgate: medical practices can no longer operate in NY?  Insurance companies can no longer operate, thus driving is effectively banned.

[21:45:13] <HoneyDrops> Well the obvious solution is any of the following: A) use old/existing phones, B) go to NJ and buy a phone, C) post-sale replacement of the crippled software.  All of which utterly gut any hope such a law would actually do anything meaningful.
[21:46:15] <Colgate> could be hardware!
[21:46:55] <HoneyDrops> Which is why any such law, even on a national scale fails.  The only difference is you might have to go further than NJ.

[23:46:25] <Sour_Sweet> When you're too lazy to search for the remote control and use your phone's IR sender instead. :D IR senders in phones should be a standard feature. So helpful, so good for trolling ...
