[09:29:30] <Kinsley> Moonlightning: I hate Buzzfiend because they represent all that's wrong with modern web articles. That's scummy, don't get me wrong, but I don't think they're the first to do it.
[09:29:50] <Moonlightning> Kinsley: Still.
[09:32:34] <Kinsley> I'd rather beat them with the "you churn out garbage constantly to the point that I won't be surprised when we see a 'Top 7 Ways Buzzfeed Fucks You on Each Visit' article" stick.
[09:46:12] <Moonlightning> Garbage out isn't inherently harmful.
[09:46:14] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (Zeta@batpones.are.for.snuggles) (Quit: Ping timeout: -1 second)
[09:46:31] <Moonlightning> But /this/, what they did to those creators, is.
[09:48:41] <Kinsley> I'd argue that garbage out /is/ harmful, because when it's so aggressively marketed and pushed on social media, it starts to dictate how other sites operate because they either see the money-for-nothing approach or they see dips in traffic and fear the competition and sink to that level.
[09:48:57] <Kinsley> Buzzfeed makes cheap shit.
[09:49:46] <Kinsley> A few stock photos, a page or two of writing, and suddenly you've got a Top X of some BS list.
[09:49:57] <Kinsley> Takes an hour, tops.
[09:50:32] <Kinsley> But if you want serious material, worthwhile material, that takes more time and it means less shit is being pushed in people's face.s
[09:50:36] <Kinsley> faces.*
[09:51:30] <Kinsley> Eventually the volume-first approach just overwhelms a quality advantage.
[09:53:34] * JustAberrant nods
[09:54:08] <JustAberrant> cracked maintains a reasonable balance imo, although lately they've been getting a bit too political/social issues-y
[09:55:15] <JustAberrant> still they manage to crank our 3 or 4 articles and usually at least one of them is decent enough.. and they apparently are pretty decent to staff/writers
[09:56:47] <Moonlightning> Mmm, okay.
