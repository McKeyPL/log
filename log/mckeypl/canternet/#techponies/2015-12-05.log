[00:21:34] <HoneyDrops> DataByte, Compu: old credit cards (or gift cards) are better for pry tools than a knife or driver when dealing with those horrid internal clips.  The are soft enough to not mar the plastic cases and they bend before you an apply too much force (you can still break the clips, but it's a lot harder to)
[00:22:41] <HoneyDrops> You can also cut them up and can leave them in as spacers if you are working around the edge and finding it reclipping as you progress.

[01:05:38] <wolfyshy> my favourite vampire movie would have to be the 1970s version of dracula... but supernatural, there's so many more to choose from

[01:35:26] <Colgate> I named it null :P

[05:54:57] <Kinsley> Quick question. /mode +D sets the channel to not show join messages until a nick messages the channel, yes?
[05:56:53] <Colgate> yes
[05:57:06] <Colgate> or a mode set on them
[05:57:13] <Colgate> such as +o
[05:57:45] <Kinsley> Wait, at the channel level, you can set like /mode +D nick!user@host ?
[05:57:51] <Colgate> no
[05:58:22] <Colgate> if someone joins a channel, and chanserv or whatever gives them +o, it will show the join
[05:58:31] <Kinsley> OH!
[05:58:48] <Kinsley> Incidentally, is there a way to do the thing I want?
[05:58:51] <Colgate> no
[05:58:59] <Colgate> +D is an all or nothing thing
[05:58:59] <Kinsley> Fuck IRC then. :/
[05:59:34] <Colgate> considered making it an extban, but we ended up not doing that because of reasons
[06:00:26] <Kinsley> Can you maybe reconsider that?
[06:00:29] <Kinsley> Pretty please?
[06:01:02] <Colgate> can bring it up again
[06:01:25] <Colgate> I think the biggest thing was someone could use it to hide themselves from the channel list selectively
[06:01:55] <Kinsley> Well, who can set /mode +D ? Just channel ops, yeah?
[06:02:00] <Colgate> yes
[06:02:19] <Kinsley> Like, it's not a user mode where I could set /mode +D on myself and not show up in channel joins?
[06:02:29] <Colgate> it is set per channel
[06:02:52] <Colgate> but a channel op could set a +b D:*!*@their.hostmask, and then join the channel and secretly watch
[06:03:15] <Colgate> since all the other joins are happening normally, this isn't obvious to people that it is happening
[06:03:16] <Kinsley> ... But didn't you just say that anything that sets a mode on a nick forces the join message?
[06:03:25] <Gigabit> Wouldn't we see said user in the list though?
[06:03:28] <Colgate> no
[06:03:37] <Kinsley> So someone who's an auto op gets the +o on join.
[06:03:41] <Kinsley> Forces the join message.
[06:03:45] <Colgate> you can easily disable auto-op
[06:03:51] <Colgate> it is just a chanserv flag
[06:04:03] <Colgate> or a nickserv set option, both work
[06:04:23] * Gigabit secretly joins Colgate's channel!
[06:05:40] <Colgate> they would still show up in /who #channel, but not in /names
[06:05:57] <Colgate> and ban lists of channels are public
[06:06:08] <Colgate> so people could see that there is a D: ban active

[06:14:34] <Kinsley> Unrelated to the previous.
[06:15:07] <Kinsley> AMD's first on-chip graphics came with the A-series, correct? The FX and Phenom chips did not have graphics hardware on the CPU die?

[06:36:06] * Moonlightning puts that box in another box
[06:36:11] * Moonlightning then puts /that/ box in /another/ box
[06:36:16] <Gigabit> Speaking of flex, anyone see the articles about Intel CPUs, bending or something when cooled?
[06:36:16] * Moonlightning mails that box to himself
[06:36:36] <Kinsley> I saw a bit.
[06:36:54] <AppleDash> Because of the presure of the cooler's retention system being too much
[06:37:02] <Kinsley> It sounds like an easy problem to solve, just unbolt your cooler before moving the tower.
[06:37:44] <Kinsley> AppleDash: it sounds like it's not a static load thing, though. That's part of it, yes, Intel didn't update any load ratings, so cooler makers didn't do anything different for mounting.
[06:38:02] <Kinsley> But it sounds like the extra kinetic forces from moving can cause damage.
[06:38:34] <AppleDash> Maybe
[06:38:43] <Kinsley> Which, to be fair, I've had happen to a lesser degree. I had a big air cooler on my Bloomfield come loose but not damage anything, it just wasn't making full contact with the die any more.

[20:22:03] <PinkiePieBot> [ How Apple Is Giving Design A Bad Name ]
[20:22:13] <tiwake> but we knew this already
[20:48:55] <HoneyDrops> I do actually agree with de-emphasizing metaphors, tying interfaces to the physical world ultimately imposes limits for just an upfront bonus.
[20:50:29] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[20:52:28] <HoneyDrops> I also agree with mental model being the focus, however it should also be accepted that there is no single mental model.  Rather an interface should be flexible to allow the user to mold it to their way of thinking.
[20:52:55] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[20:53:31] <HoneyDrops> The best (human) interface is the one that defines the absolute minimum, and the user dictates everything beyond that (and ideally can override the defaults).
[20:55:22] <mniip> which is why I like lua so much
[20:55:30] <mniip> despite it not being a functional language
[20:56:00] * JustAberrant prefers his tool stack to be orderly
[20:56:04] * HoneyDrops would, of those options, rank descending: User Control, Mental Model, Consistency, Feedback, Forgiveness.  The rest are largely irrelevant, or wholly secondary to those 5.
[20:56:10] <JustAberrant> the user should be brought into line with the way they system works
[20:56:30] <JustAberrant> s/they/the/
[20:56:47] <JustAberrant> (which joking aside, is actually true for the type of software I work on)
[20:58:28] <HoneyDrops> The UI should communicate the underlying system, but it should not be defined by it.
[20:59:07] <JustAberrant> either way, I think until we get anything approaching AI, any attempt at a freeform interface is just gonna be clunky and horrible because without the ability to actually "comprehend" what the user wants, it's still going to come down to some specific set of actions the user needs to do to make the system do what they want
[20:59:12] <JustAberrant> only now it's less defined and obvious
[20:59:21] <JustAberrant> like current voice control systems
[20:59:43] <HoneyDrops> I would say vi/emacs largely hit those principles.
[21:02:41] <JustAberrant> sure, but both have a significant learning curve, you can make anything flexible if you don't care about user friendliness
[21:03:31] <JustAberrant> and people will choose a far less flexible tool that's quicker and easier to use most of the time
[21:05:01] <JustAberrant> and ultimately if you make something with vi's flexibility that has a user friendly "beginner" layer on top of it, most people will never bother delving into the flexibility
[21:05:16] <HoneyDrops> Yes, but ultimately the best tools are the ones the user shapes to their needs.
[21:05:21] <JustAberrant> until you can get flexibility and intuitiveness together, it's going to be pick one or the other, even if you implement both
[21:05:47] <HoneyDrops> Anyone can drive a nail with a rock, but a carpenter is going to invest in some hammers.
[21:05:54] <JustAberrant> depends on the metric
[21:06:13] <JustAberrant> from a business standpoint, the best tool is the one that does it the cheapest when you factor everything in
[21:06:31] *** Quits: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[21:06:36] <JustAberrant> from a personal standpoint, the best tool is the one that makes you the happiest I guess, through whatever (highly variable) metric defines that
[21:07:28] <JustAberrant> if paying someone less money to use a cheaper and shittier tool to do the same job is cheaper than paying someone more money to shape and use a more expensive tool, by any business metric the first option is probably better
[21:07:38] <JustAberrant> which is why most businesses run on really unintuitive and shitty software
[21:08:02] <JustAberrant> for things that don't directly give them a competitive edge (payroll, internal management, etc)
[21:09:16] <JustAberrant> from a personal standpoint, this is largely why I've stopped using vi
[21:09:20] <JustAberrant> yes I can shape it to do what I want
[21:09:33] <JustAberrant> but it's become more effort than shaping eclipse/etc to be more like vi
[21:09:41] <JustAberrant> so I go the path of least resistance
[21:10:04] <JustAberrant> the advantages vi provides over eclipse (with appropriate plugins installed) have ceased to be worth it
[21:10:33] <JustAberrant> likewise for qt-creator for c++, even though I don't know of a "vi commands" plugin equivalent
[21:11:00] <JustAberrant> I guess my point is, flexibility isn't the only (or most important) factor
[21:11:03] <JustAberrant> flexibility+effort
[21:11:33] <JustAberrant> or even  flexibility+effort-advantage
[21:12:36] *** Joins: Pocky (Pocketguns2@Digging.a.Hole)
[21:13:00] <JustAberrant> and there's always going to be types who factor flexibility over everything else in some areas, it's why I still use gentoo.. but on the whole I this is largely true
[21:13:35] <JustAberrant> and probably why excessively flexible but unintuitive tools are declining in popularity compared to inflexible but dead simple tools

[21:43:42] <aji> there's no good reason tbh

[23:09:56] <WuBzY> why everyponys so quiet?
[23:10:02] <Colgate> define "critical"
[23:10:14] <WuBzY> porn
[23:10:20] <Colgate> porn is the least of my worries
[23:10:20] <WuBzY> ..
[23:10:28] <WuBzY> :D

[23:10:45] <Colgate> I'm more concerned about my financial details or identity theft :P
[23:10:46] <aji> hardcore cat-on-cat action
[23:10:48] <WuBzY> nah I dont even have that :D
[23:12:39] <WuBzY> well I stopped usin popcorn time when I heard that there was big risk of being catched usin it
[23:13:43] <Colgate> too bad they stopped development of that before fully integrating it with i2p
[23:13:57] <WuBzY> they did?
[23:14:23] <Colgate> they got served a legal notice, so anything else is a fork
[23:15:10] <WuBzY> oh
[23:15:30] <Colgate> I don't even know if popcorn was open source though
[23:16:56] <Colgate> hmm, it is
[23:17:27] <Colgate> wonder if anyone finished that i2p stuff, that would make it effectively impossible to block/track

[23:29:06] <Kinsley> I dunno what's going on with that, but I disabled the module for now.
[23:29:15] <JustAberrant> :(
[23:29:18] <Kinsley> I'll look into what the fuck is causing it.
[23:29:43] <JustAberrant> from the error message I would gather that some database is locked ;p
[23:29:54] <Kinsley> No shit.
[23:30:16] <Kinsley> I want to know how it got locked and I want to find a way to unlock it.
[23:30:34] <Sour_Sweet> Why are error messages sent anyway? I thought it's Pinkie, not Derpy ;-)
[23:31:13] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: well the second one is easy enough, though hacky
[23:31:46] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: basically just dump the contents and recreate the database (that really does seem to be the general solution, at least it's what we do at work)
[23:32:34] <JustAberrant> there's probably a simpler way, but I don't know it :(
[23:33:46] <JustAberrant> one of our internal tools uses sqlite and is a piece of shit, any time it crashes the database becomes locked and we have a script that basically does exactly that

[23:36:08] <Kinsley> In anything that's not rendering.
[23:36:16] <WuBzY> no im here like 4k all the time with dat :D

[23:37:52] <Sour_Sweet> I still have a backup 8800 GTS
[23:38:18] <Sour_Sweet> Not used in years, but it should still work
[23:38:19] <Kinsley> I have an 8400 GT stashed somewhere.
[23:38:23] <JustAberrant> shitty video cards unite!
[23:38:29] <WuBzY> ill be gettin athlon x4 860 8 gigs of ddr3 and r9 380 or gtx 960
[23:38:46] <Gigabit> Have a 9600gts sitting here
[23:38:49] <Kinsley> Should my GTX 770 ever fail... My tower won't be without video out.
[23:39:37] <Gigabit> Hey do you think if I snggdd a cheap 270, that xfire would offer performance to be worth it?
[23:39:38] <Sour_Sweet> I'm currently using an over clocked GTX 670
[23:39:52] * JustAberrant needs to upgrade :(
[23:40:31] <WuBzY> I used to have 8500gt :D
[23:40:45] <WuBzY> http://www.vgamuseum.info/images/zaatharen/nvidia/8500GT_asus_fhq.jpg
[23:40:58] <WuBzY> actualy supported sli :D
[23:41:32] <Colgate> went from an 8800gt to a 670gtx
[23:41:47] <Colgate> should be using this card for a few more years
[23:41:53] <WuBzY> bit of power change :D
[23:42:16] <Colgate> I don't upgrade until I need to
[23:42:23] * JustAberrant nods
[23:42:32] <JustAberrant> this is actually my longest running desktop
[23:42:34] <Colgate> only reason I upgraded was because I couldn't play a game I wanted to due to fps issues
[23:42:53] <JustAberrant> first gen i7, upgraded from 6g to 12g ram, and changed the vid cards once.. 
[23:43:07] <JustAberrant> only just now starting to feel like an upgrade would be nice
[23:43:39] <Colgate> no point upgrading until you can't do something you want to imo
[23:43:43] <JustAberrant> might keep the same case and PSU
[23:43:49] <Sour_Sweet> I'd like to have reasonable 60 fps on most games. As long as my card offers that I won't upgrade unless it fails

[23:45:33] <Sour_Sweet> VR are might change hardware needs, but the first generation of consumer devices likely sucks anyway
[23:45:55] <Colgate> will see when it is more mature
[23:45:55] <Phase> frame drops and latency are far worse in vr

[23:46:53] <Phase> it should have the same option?

[23:53:58] <WuBzY> well I got 400W psu but the system takes about half of it
[23:54:18] <WuBzY> but that mb is awesome
[23:54:47] <WuBzY> because it supports ddr2 and ddr3
