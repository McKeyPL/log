[02:43:15] <Sour_Sweet> MS makes it way to complex to download ISOs directly. So the techbench site offers you to download ISOs directly, but the links will be generated uniquely and are only valid together with a few cookies and the same IP-address. In order to download them to my server without a GUI I needed to forge the request using a SSH tunnel and firefox, copy the URL and cookies set, just to be able to
[02:43:17] <Sour_Sweet> fetch them headless with curl afterwards.
[02:46:11] <Phase> torrents solve all those issues
[02:46:36] *** Jouva_ is now known as Jouva
[02:46:37] * Phase has to wonder why they don't just host the iso's
[02:47:52] <Kinsley> Probably because of assholes who'd target them.
[02:48:47] <Sour_Sweet> But downloading it this way took about 30 seconds, the ISOs are genuine, I don't need to look up checksums and I don't have a torrent client on my server anyway
[02:50:37] <Phase> Sour_Sweet, 'techbench'? you mean technet?
[02:51:12] <Sour_Sweet> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench
[02:51:35] <Phase> ah, just for windows 10 iso's?
[02:52:26] <Sour_Sweet> Also 7 and 8
[02:52:50] <Sour_Sweet> Or at least that's what the page I got it from said

[03:54:33] <tiwake> what is twrp?
[03:54:45] <tiwake> the twrp about page does not say what twrp is
[03:54:49] <Phase> android thing? team win recovery project
[03:54:55] <Phase> or something like that
[03:55:00] <Phase> alternate recovery
[03:55:08] <tiwake> its something having to do with android
[03:55:18] <tiwake> no idea what it is about though, cause it does not say what it is
[03:55:31] <Colgate> it is a recovery manager for phones
[03:55:35] <Colgate> and tablets
[03:55:52] <Colgate> usually android, works with firefoxos and sailfishos too
[03:56:04] <tiwake> right
[03:56:06] * Colgate uses it
[03:56:16] <tiwake> instructions say to use twrp, but no idea what it was
[03:56:25] <Colgate> basically, it takes images and images them onto the phone
[03:56:53] <Moonlightning> I was going to install TWRP
[03:57:09] <Moonlightning> but I couldn't find a way to verify a copy of the image
[03:57:24] <Moonlightning> the images aren't signed, and the site doesn't do TLS
[03:57:35] <AppleDash> nobody cares
[03:57:48] <Moonlightning> Clearly, because ^2.
[03:57:48] <tiwake> I just unlocked the phone and did a factory restart
[03:57:51] <Colgate> AppleDash: Moonlightning does :P
[03:57:58] <AppleDash> Download 2 copies from different networks and md5sum them both
[03:57:58] <HoneyDrops> Did they not at least do a sha sum?
[03:58:16] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: an attacker with the ability to replace the image in transit could also replace the hash in transit…
[03:58:19] <HoneyDrops> I wouldn't trust md5 for anything other than corruption.
[03:58:24] <AppleDash> If they match and it's compromised, then any attackers would have the ability to replace the image on the server side
[03:58:32] <AppleDash> Md5 is literally intended for file checksumming
[03:58:35] <AppleDash> MD5*
[03:58:50] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: that just means I'm trusting two networks together, instead of one.
[03:58:51] <AppleDash> err, would have the ability to replace the sig on the server side*

[06:41:49] <HoneyDrops> It lets you split a file based on patterns.
[06:48:32] * Moonlightning longblinks.
[06:48:44] <Moonlightning> Okay, my /netbox/ is getting slow speeds from the Ubuntu repos, too
[06:49:52] <Colgate> neat, didn't know that was in coreutils XD
[06:54:49] <JustAberrant> HoneyDrops: I've determined that we pretty much disagree on everything btw ;p
[06:55:27] <JustAberrant> csplit is like sed, on it's own not a tool of evil, but it has brought too much evil into the world in the form of unmaintainable scripts that really aught to have been a proper application
[06:57:07] * Moonlightning wonders what the usecases for csplit are.
[06:57:17] <JustAberrant> see what I just said ;p
[06:57:44] <JustAberrant> it's for people still living in the 80s who think 160 commands chained together with pipes is the right way to do things ;p
[06:59:05] <JustAberrant> I worked at a weather place once where they had what can only be described as debian levels of scripting ... only without having been beaten into submission by the user community (cause the user community was just that company)
[06:59:25] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AppleDash/4269ef1805b6d438a1c4/raw/53b7740a174d78d424ad91852e3533618af69f11/droplet.sh
[06:59:27] <AppleDash> :>
[06:59:42] <AppleDash> I have no idea if that still works
[06:59:44] <AppleDash> It did a year ago
[06:59:53] <JustAberrant> ehe, that's not so bad because it's just calling things in sequence
[07:00:00] <AppleDash> It has some sed magic :P
[07:00:09] <JustAberrant> although short circuit logic that long is always fun to debug
[07:00:09] <AppleDash> Also it has like 3 different contexts
[07:00:13] <JustAberrant> "it failed... somewhere.."
[07:00:19] <AppleDash> Local machine, remote machine, and remote machine inside of su
[07:00:34] <JustAberrant> hehe
[07:00:36] <JustAberrant> oh yes
[07:00:44] <JustAberrant> ssh some box some command > some file
[07:01:07] <JustAberrant> that like 5 seconds that _everyone_ pauses for to remember if some file ends up on some box or the machine you run the command from :D
[07:01:12] <AppleDash> lol
[07:01:17] <AppleDash> It ends up locally :P
[07:01:23] <AppleDash> because it's not inside of quotes
[07:01:28] <JustAberrant> I know, but I have to think about it like every time I see that command
[07:01:49] <JustAberrant> because  ssh some_box some_command some_argument > file  will also work afaik
[07:02:17] <Gigabit> Think it would be easy to change out the instrument cluster on a older truck, to one with a higher speedometer gauge?
[07:02:29] <JustAberrant> no
[07:03:19] <Gigabit> damn.. My gauge stops at like 85 and I hate it
[07:03:46] <JustAberrant> if you're going over 85 do you _really_ need to know how much by?
[07:03:53] <JustAberrant> (assuming Mph)
[07:04:12] <Gigabit> For personal interest, yes
[07:04:18] <JustAberrant> you're pretty much speeding at that point
[07:04:24] <JustAberrant> put an app on your phone ;p
[07:04:50] <Gigabit> Not as accurate.
[07:05:28] <Gigabit> Will have to see about something else then.
[07:05:46] <wesley> sup
[07:06:14] <JustAberrant> I thought GPS based speed indication was actually more accurate than most car speedos
[07:06:45] <Gigabit> Maybe it is, I'm not sure. 
[07:07:03] <JustAberrant> because it's measuring actual change in distance vs trying to guestimate based on all kinds of highly variable things
[07:08:20] <Gigabit> If I can afford to keep my phone on, I will have to try it
[07:09:11] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|Sleepies
[07:10:52] <JustAberrant> well, you don't really need a data plan to run a gps based speed app
[07:11:28] <JustAberrant> also given the choice between buying a new speedometer for my car and keeping my phone, I'd _probably_ keep the phone ;p
[07:12:09] <Gigabit> Unemployed at the moment, until the supermarket hires me on officially.
[07:12:16] <Colgate> JustAberrant: I thought care speedometers were really accurate since they just measure tire rotations
[07:12:31] <Colgate> this is of course, assuming that you have the right sized tires on your car
[07:12:48] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: really? I don't have to think about it
[07:13:31] <JustAberrant> Colgate: hehe, I googled, first result: ""GPS isn't perfect, but it's a lot more accurate than a vehicle speedometer," says Richard Langley, professor of geodesy and precision navigation at the University of New Brunswick."
[07:13:37] <JustAberrant> but it may be one of those contested points
[07:13:49] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: pure GPS relies on a publicly-usable network of satellites and a passive receiver.
[07:13:55] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: yeah but your weird, you probably do way more shell scripting than is healthy ;p
[07:14:10] <Moonlightning> Now, if you want to actually take your location and put it on a /map/, then you'll need Internet access, to pull in the map. ;p
[07:14:31] <Moonlightning> But since your usecase is measuring speed, you don't need a map; you only care about the change in coordinates over time.
[07:15:01] *** Quits: Gigabit (Gigabit@Bazinga) (Quit: Canternet Public Bouncer!)

[07:35:17] <Moonlightning> so, YouTube Rewind
[07:35:33] <Moonlightning> it has the horrible horrible viral earworm from lateish this year, of course
[07:35:36] <Moonlightning> BUT
[07:37:25] <Moonlightning> it also has Markiplier in the FNaF1 pizzeria, set to a kinda mashup of /Lean On/ and
[07:37:26] <Moonlightning> uh
[07:37:28] <Moonlightning> fuck
[07:37:37] <Moonlightning> oh, /Can't Feel My Face/
[07:37:48] <Moonlightning> which I like the music of
[07:41:26] <Moonlightning> 2:12..3:55 best part
[07:41:54] <Moonlightning> Also has the LaBeouf motivational speech
[07:42:51] <Moonlightning> I want the music from that. :<
[07:44:02] <Kinsley> I can't really bash "Let's Play" as a format because my favorite videos are Beaglerush's Live and Impossible series.
[07:44:07] <Moonlightning> Oh, and John Oliver
[07:44:18] <Kinsley> But I can't stand the whole face-cam-jump-scare BS.
[07:47:45] <Moonlightning> Hmm?
[07:50:26] <Moonlightning> In defense of FNaF, I will say just that it's not about the jumpscares; it's about the anticipation.
[07:50:51] <Moonlightning> Even so, you don't have to like it. Just that if you think it's all jumpscare, you're missing the point.
[07:50:54] <Kinsley> I'm not saying it's a bad game.
[07:52:15] <Kinsley> I'm saying the genre that Markiplier sits in, that PewDiePie sits in, that a lot of other Youtubers sit in is that face-cam-jump-scare BS. So it becomes not about them enjoying a good game and telling a compelling story through it, it's about drama and personality and drama and bullshit.
[07:52:19] <Kinsley> And drama.
[07:53:57] <Lapsus> Markiplier's other stuff is actually pretty good sometimes, but yeah
[07:54:14] <Lapsus> he was excellent on gamegrumps, for example
[07:55:49] <Moonlightning> To be fair, I have no sense of quality, so I should probably be shutting up about five minutes ago
[07:57:14] <Kinsley> Well, to be equally fair, I watch TotalBiscuit because options menus are fun.

[22:40:54] <tiwake> bah... its trying to hide
[22:42:04] <tiwake> how do you nick complete?
[22:42:12] <mniip> the search button
[22:42:48] <mniip> if you don't have a hardware one you can configure it to display a completion button
[22:43:09] <mniip> see in the screenshot to the left from "Enter a message"

[22:43:56] <mniip> here's some more tips: long-press to copy a line
[22:44:12] <mniip> double tap -> channel list
[22:44:25] <mniip> well I mean tab list, not /list stuff
[22:44:41] <tiwake> seriously, this is a 1920x1080 screen... it should be able to diaplay a lot mor information
[22:45:02] <tiwake> more*
[22:45:27] <mniip> make the font smaller?
[22:45:54] <mniip> I have a font size of 11 with 0 line spacing
[22:46:27] <tiwake> in the settings? I already set it as small as it would let me. I'd like it a lot smaller
[22:46:59] <tiwake> system-wide settings
[22:48:27] <mniip> you clearly aren't trying hard enough

[22:49:13] <mniip> huh
[22:49:16] <mniip> system-wide?
[22:49:21] <mniip> no in the androirc settings
[22:49:30] <tiwake> oh, a setting for the program
[22:49:34] <mniip> Settings -> Settings
[22:49:39] <mniip> in the settings menu
[22:52:29] <tiwake> what about system-wide? I don't care about one program so much
[22:52:42] <mniip> no idea
[22:53:11] <mniip> I don't have a lot of programs that display walls of text
[22:53:14] <mniip> only 3
[22:53:24] <mniip> all have a configurable font size

[22:55:57] <tiwake> yeah, a quick google says you cant make it smaller than "small"
[22:57:58] <tiwake> maybe edit a config file somewhere
[23:00:58] <johnsey> yay for binary patching?
[23:01:26] <tiwake> johnsey: would it be?
[23:01:41] <tiwake> I sure hope its not hard-coded in
[23:03:18] <johnsey> well, as a last option

[23:19:16] <Sombra> Do I want a steam link, or a nvidia shield console thing?
[23:19:54] <tiwake> Donno what an NVIDIA thing is
[23:22:26] <Sombra> It's an android TV, that also streams games from your PC to the TV

[23:23:42] *** Quits: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-9leqdm.priv.bahnhof.se) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:24:54] <Sombra> Correct, but to my knowledge the shield console is the most powerful one, and the only one dedicated to game streaming.
[23:26:07] <tiwake> my problem is I don't like NVIDIA as a company :p

[23:33:48] <Sombra> Why do I want the shield AppleDash?
[23:38:03] <Sour_Sweet> Windows RDP works so fucking well. I should read what they use to make that work behind the scenes.
[23:38:47] <tiwake> Sombra: just get the valve one, because its not made by NVIDIA
[23:38:49] <tiwake> :P
[23:39:15] <tiwake> wait, didnt mozilla foundation make one?
[23:39:31] <Sour_Sweet> They do the silly Firefox OS

[23:40:26] <tiwake> firefoxOS is different
[23:40:48] <Sour_Sweet> It uses Firefox OS ;-)
[23:41:17] <tiwake> I thought they were dropping firefoxOS
[23:41:54] <Sour_Sweet> No they drop the useful Thunderbird instead, because logic
[23:46:11] <Colgate> I thought that matchstick project died
[23:47:56] <Sour_Sweet> At least I haven't heard much news recently
[23:48:08] <Colgate> they refunded all their kickstarters
