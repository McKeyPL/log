[02:31:01] <Moonlightning> Let's see…I bought the thing in November of 2009…disk died around the very beginning of this year.
[02:31:36] <Moonlightning> So…five years?
[02:31:40] <Moonlightning> I guess that's expected? :p
[02:32:38] <Moonlightning> Five years of more or less active use, plus Past Moonlightning being an ignorant and using sfill a lot

[07:37:16] <HoneyDrops> But I know others that they have to RMA WD drives 3 times before they can go longer than a month on one :/

[10:21:49] <Moonlightning> so what is this Telegram and why does everyone seem to be moving from Skype to it, and not Tox. :/
[10:24:11] <JockeTF> As long as it works with third party clients I don't mind.
[10:24:23] <Moonlightning> :/
[10:24:28] * Moonlightning is very privacy-focused.
[10:24:28] <JockeTF> Anything is better than the locked down piece of poop that's Skype. :P
[10:26:55] <Moonlightning> Not necessarily.
[10:26:58] <JockeTF> Better privacy sure would be nice though.
[10:27:09] <Moonlightning> I skimmed the Wikipedia article.
[10:27:11] <Moonlightning> I don't like it.
[10:27:35] <Moonlightning> from my skimming, it's /probably/ better than Skype (I'm not convinced about its security…)
[10:27:54] <Moonlightning> But everything besides its “secret chats” seem way open to passive attack
[10:28:02] <Moonlightning> and the “secret chats” are very limited
[10:28:33] <Moonlightning> They're tied to two specific devices. That's all you get.
[10:29:00] <Moonlightning> Besides this, it's centralized, and the server software is closed-source
[10:29:10] <Moonlightning> And you apparently have to link your Telegram account to a phone number(!!)
[10:29:52] <johnsey> sounds like whatsapp
[10:30:00] <JockeTF> Ah, well, I haven't looked into either of them. I usually just get forced into using whatever is popular that month. *_*
[10:31:17] * johnsey remains reachable only over mail, irc, xmpp and phone, no matter what strange trends people around him choose to follow, which is more than enough
[10:31:28] <Moonlightning> IRC is good.
[10:31:41] <Moonlightning> Mail requires crypto on top
[10:31:47] <Moonlightning> XMPP, ditto, probably
[10:31:55] <Moonlightning> phone is just, pffff, don't even try

[10:32:39] <johnsey> that's a good thing to have
[10:32:45] * Moonlightning Twilight-bounces around the channel going “YesyesyesyesYESSSSSyesyesyesyesYESSSSS”
[10:33:12] <johnsey> have you considered an off-earth backup? 
[10:33:33] <Moonlightning> That sounds prohibitively expensive to make and to restore from
[10:33:38] <Moonlightning> not to mention excessively unreliable
[10:34:13] <Moonlightning> for the time being
[10:35:12] <JockeTF> I backup all my data using DerpyBot's mbox!
[10:35:21] <JockeTF> Don't tell johnsey though.
[10:36:00] <Moonlightning> I need more, though.
[10:36:03] <Moonlightning> I must have more…
[10:36:13] <Moonlightning> At least one more, preferably two or three

[10:41:37] <johnsey> that sounds like a file sharing channel. or your plan to crowdsource offsite backups
[10:42:03] <johnsey> in any case, you probably haven't noted me down because you did not ask 
[10:42:44] <Moonlightning> No? :O

[10:43:24] <Moonlightning> usually using home boxes, so, slow connections and stuff, but yeah
[10:43:29] <Moonlightning> it's free c:
[10:43:40] <JockeTF> That's an interesting idea.
[10:44:20] <JockeTF> Do you use some kind of encryption though?
[10:44:39] <johnsey> Moonlightning: not currently but i may come back to that
[10:44:55] <Moonlightning> Not inherently, but it's very much encouraged that you strongly encrypt on your end before uploading.
[10:45:03] * Moonlightning nodnods!
[10:45:45] * JockeTF happens to have a 100Mbps connection and a tiny server running at home. :P
[10:46:10] * JockeTF has figured out an off-site solution using his parents though.
[10:46:31] <Moonlightning> Well, that's better than I've got!
[10:46:42] <johnsey> Moonlightning: you may actually wanna consider changing that to a requirement to protect yourself against legal issues
[10:46:44] * Moonlightning has 1.5 MiB/s down and 96 KiB/s up
[10:47:05] <Moonlightning> johnsey @.@
[10:47:29] <Moonlightning> I mean…I guess I'm trusting ponies to encrypt their stuff? :P
[10:47:43] <Moonlightning> I really haven't thought about legal ramifications though @.@
[10:47:44] <Moonlightning> bleh
[10:48:15] <JockeTF> Does that even matter if it's just a private thing where everyone agrees to take responsibility for their own data?
[10:48:18] <johnsey> well, if somebody stores material on your box that may be illegal to possess in your jurisdiction and for whatever reason your harddrives get seized, you may run into problems
[10:48:28] <JockeTF> Ah.
[10:48:30] <JockeTF> That's true.
[10:48:33] <Moonlightning> yeah.
[10:49:51] * Moonlightning …frowns.
[10:49:59] <Moonlightning> Sparsebundles don't provide any forward secrecy.
[10:50:25] <Moonlightning> …nor does the thing I'm using to back up my Gentoo laptop
[10:50:48] <JockeTF> I'd use something like encfs together with rsync for those kinds of backups.
[10:50:57] <JockeTF> But, encfs has kind been deemed broken.
[10:51:12] <JockeTF> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EncFS
[10:51:13] <PinkiePieBot> [ EncFS - ArchWiki ]
[10:51:33] <Moonlightning> Well, my backups are already encrypted on my local backup box
[10:51:39] <Moonlightning> So I'm mostly just `rsync`ing them.
[10:51:43] <JockeTF> (As in, SSHFS + EncFS + rsync.)
[10:52:00] <Moonlightning> My Mac's backup has sensitive data lying around outside of the encrypted container though -.-
[10:52:09] <JockeTF> I rsync drives with full-disk encryption.
[10:52:28] <johnsey> duplicity is a fairly decent choice for encrypted backups
[10:52:30] <Moonlightning> so what I've been doing is excluding those files from the rsync, and then tarballing all of the meta files, encrypting those, and tossing the result up on the server.
[10:52:37] <Moonlightning> meh, duplicity
[10:52:53] <Moonlightning> I'm using `btrfs` snapshots :3
[10:54:11] <Moonlightning> I /would/ FDE this box, but that would completely break autonomous reboots
[10:54:16] <Moonlightning> which I kind of need, because it's my router
[10:54:54] <johnsey> you want your router to reboot autonmously?
[10:55:13] <Moonlightning> I want it to come up autonomously, yes :P
[10:55:25] <Moonlightning> I most certainly do not want it to GO DOWN autonomously >.>
[10:55:37] <johnsey> a reboot implies that it goes down..?
[10:55:52] <Moonlightning> s/reboot/boot/g  # -.-
[10:56:01] <johnsey> if you initiate the reboot, what's wrong with sticking around to type your passphrase on boot?
[10:56:14] <Moonlightning> What I /meant/ was that, in the event that it /did/ go down (frequent power outages…), it would come up without intervention.
[10:56:27] <Moonlightning> Also I don't have a monitor. :p
[10:56:44] <johnsey> UPSes are cheap these days
[10:56:54] <Moonlightning> Yeah, I'm thinking of getting one.
[10:57:02] <johnsey> what do you need a monitor for, you can type the passphrase over SSH
[10:57:31] <Moonlightning> But how does it get at the SSH server keys?
[10:57:55] <johnsey> they are in the initramfs..?
[10:58:09] <Moonlightning> who puts SSH server keys in an initramfs?
[10:58:12] <johnsey> i do
[10:58:16] <Moonlightning> Touché
[10:58:23] <johnsey> as well as the ssh daemon
[10:58:32] <Moonlightning> Well, that's public info.
[10:59:34] <johnsey> if you are worried about local access, you have to provide secure boot as well
[11:00:15] <Moonlightning> wat
[11:00:49] <johnsey> why worry about the ssh keys when somebody with local access could tamper with your kernel..?
[11:01:16] <Moonlightning> Mmm. I haven't been worrying about that /too/ much…
[11:01:25] <johnsey> if you want to rule out a local attacker with hardware access, then you got a far bigger problem 
[11:01:40] <Moonlightning> yeah, I'm not gonna try to defend against that.
[11:02:41] <johnsey> so, putting a unique ssh keypair into an initramfs shouldn't be too worrisome :)
[11:07:12] <Moonlightning> Okay.
[11:07:57] <Moonlightning> First I have to actually get a UPS, though
[11:10:10] <johnsey> APC makes good ones
[11:10:54] <Moonlightning> American Power Conversion?
[11:11:53] <johnsey> yeah
[11:11:56] <Stik> could build an ultra low power pc and run it off a car battery
[11:12:13] <Stik> i always said i was going to do that, but never did
[11:12:20] <Moonlightning> oh gods they want cookies to remember this country selection thing
[11:12:22] <Moonlightning> :/
[11:12:36] <Stik> hmm how much power does a rpi use?
[11:15:16] <Stik> looks like they're a bit underpowered to serve as a home router as well
[11:15:39] <Moonlightning> Yeah, I'd think so
[11:17:13] <Googie> I imagine they've probably got more than enough processing power to act as a router.
[11:17:25] <Stik> http://www.deckle.co.uk/blog/using-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-super-fast-broadband-router-performance/
[11:17:26] <PinkiePieBot> [ Limitations to using a Raspberry Pi as your Super Fast Broadband router | Oskar Pearson's Blog ]
[11:17:28] <Moonlightning> Not for me, though. My router's also a fileserver and yeah.
[11:17:30] <Stik> that guy doesn't seem to think so
[11:19:10] <Googie> The Pi 2 is a fair bit faster, but compared to most random crappy home routers, I can't imagine that hardware wise, the Pi is any worse.
[11:19:51] <Googie> Though I've never had an internet connection fast enough that an IBM PC would have trouble keeping up :P
[11:19:55] <Moonlightning> Haaanh!
[11:20:19] * Moonlightning should probably actually figure out the power draw here.
[11:20:32] <Stik> oh is that a rpi 1
[11:20:39] <Stik> i don't know a lot about them
[11:21:01] <Moonlightning> I should probably also try harder to make the fans not be so aggressive ._.
[11:21:13] <johnsey> a rbpi runs on a usb 2.0 port, so the maximum it can draw should be 500mA and 5V, so 2.5W
[11:21:15] <Moonlightning> I'm sure they don't need to be; there's nothign processor-intensive going on…
[11:21:36] <Moonlightning> > load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
[11:22:43] <Googie> The original Pi is a 700Mhz ARMv6 design. The Pi 2 is a quad core @ 900Mhz using a Cortex7 based architecture.
[11:23:13] <Googie> (Obviously hard to compare by just that... and I don't have benchmarks off the top of my head, but that's a fair bit of a difference :P)
[11:25:14] <johnsey> if you're talking about performance, there are worlds between ARMv6 and ARMv7
[11:30:54] <Moonlightning> Hmm
[11:31:01] <Moonlightning> should I bother factoring in this combo box?
[11:31:12] <Moonlightning> I feel like its usage would be pretty much negligible

[11:41:34] <Moonlightning> I'm trying to find the maximum power draw to a UPS, were I to get one
[11:41:50] <Googie> It's pretty common for servers to have multiple, redundant PSUs
[11:42:14] <Googie> It's not like the model of PSU really tells you the power draw anyway.
[11:42:33] <Moonlightning> Well, it tells you that maximum that could possibly be drawn, right?
[11:44:08] <Googie> (As an aside, do you have somewhere to put that where the fans won't drive you crazy ? :P)
[11:44:40] <Moonlightning> Somewhere to put what?
[11:45:12] <johnsey> the rack mountable server your linked, probably
[11:45:19] <Moonlightning> Oh! Nope. :D
[11:45:24] <Moonlightning> But I'm used to it now.
[11:45:43] <Moonlightning> Had it for a year now, and it's been my router since August.
[11:46:22] <Moonlightning> It's actually very nice. It does an excellent job of masking those cursed whispers…
[11:46:24] <johnsey> you're using a dual xeon as a home router?
[11:47:26] <Moonlightning> Yuup. :D
[11:47:40] <Moonlightning> Some ponies think I'm bonkers
[11:47:45] <Moonlightning> But I just think I'm free
[11:47:55] <Moonlightning> Man, I'm just livin' my life; there's nuffin crazy 'bout meeeeee
[11:48:02] <Googie> I hope you're also using that server for other stuff though :P
[11:48:18] <Moonlightning> Well, it's also my local backup box (see #SharingIsCaring )
[11:48:18] <Googie> That's fairly insane overkill otherwise. Especially with the cost of power these days :(
[11:48:18] <Moonlightning> why?
[11:48:23] <Moonlightning> Oh. :P
[11:48:29] <Moonlightning> Well, I wanted a Linux router
[11:48:31] <Moonlightning> I've got a Linux router
[11:48:33] <Moonlightning> \o/
[11:48:53] <Moonlightning> Maybe I should run Folding@Home on it.
[11:49:04] <johnsey> oh it's fine, it's just a bit like using a space shuttle for traveling between two cities
[11:49:11] * Moonlightning laughs.
[11:49:29] <Googie> I have a proper server as a router. It just does other jobs as well :P

[11:59:10] <Moonlightning> without shutting it down ;p
[11:59:47] <johnsey> look at what the PSU is rated for, unless it's terribly oversized
[12:00:05] <Unixkitty> Which is why some of those don't really need more than a relatively short temporary one
[12:00:13] <Lapsus> plug it in through a power meter
[12:00:14] <Lapsus> :D

[12:03:13] <johnsey> Moonlightning: yes, you can get the maximum draw from the PSU numbers, even though that's probably too high, it leaves a little room. metering is of course the best method, but you can also try to get an estimate with one of the many calculators like http://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator

[21:36:59] <Sakura> I'm looking into getting a 1TB HDD for my laptop & I'm wondering if I need to replace my 5400 RPM 320 HDD with a 7200 RPM 1TB HDD or if I should stick with my current RPM
[21:37:02] <Sakura> ?
[21:37:51] <Divide|TechSupport> Man, today is just weirding me out...
[21:37:56] <Sour_Sweet> There is no problem when replacing with a higher RPM useally
[21:38:20] <Sour_Sweet> Higher RPM drives are generally faster.
[21:38:26] <Divide|TechSupport> It can throw things off if you're trying to get your computer to walk across the room, though.
[21:39:35] *** Creeps|AFK is now known as RedHelper
[21:39:50] <Sakura> So, it would not mess up my computer or it's components like the CPU, power supply, etc.?
[21:40:24] <Sour_Sweet> No
[21:40:36] <Sakura> OK good then.
[21:41:23] <Sour_Sweet> It just needs to have the same formfactor (2.5" for notebooks useally) and connectors. Proprietary connectors for HDDs are uncommon though
[21:41:49] <HoneyDrops> There might be a small change in battery life, but it should be minimal.
[21:41:51] <Sakura> And what about RAM?
[21:42:09] <Sour_Sweet> Sakura: Doesn't matter
[21:42:32] <Sour_Sweet> An SSD would make most sense for a notebook due to physical movement in HDDs
[21:42:42] <Sakura> RAM won't effect my computer components either as I'm looking into that as well.
[21:42:45] <Sakura> ?
[21:42:51] <Sour_Sweet> But SSDs are expensive ^^
[21:43:02] <Sour_Sweet> Sakura: RAM is a different problem
[21:43:06] <HoneyDrops> You will need to select RAM that is compatible with the mainboard/CPU.
[21:43:41] <HoneyDrops> There are inexpesive SSD options, but you won't have as large of a drive.  However, 1TB in a laptop is bordering on excessive.
[21:43:42] <Sour_Sweet> The RAM needs to be compatible (^) and notebook RAM has a different form factor than desktop RAM
[21:44:27] <Sakura> So, do I gotta focus on just having a DDR3 1333 PC3-10600 RAM as that's what I have right now.
[21:44:31] <HoneyDrops> I have a 250GB SSD in my laptop, and that is more than enough.  Bulk storage goes on a server/NAS
[21:45:10] <Sour_Sweet> Also sometimes the RAM is permanently soldered into position for notebooks not allowing you to easily change that
[21:46:27] <Sakura> That's no problem. I upgraded my 2GB RAM to 4 on this laptop.
[21:53:26] <Sakura> Damn, SSDs are more expensive compared to the HDDs on Newegg.
