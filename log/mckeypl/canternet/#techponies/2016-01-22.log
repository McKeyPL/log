[00:31:09] <nite> Arch is where it's at~
[00:31:20] <JustAberrant> bleh ;p
[00:31:25] * JustAberrant still dislikes arch ;p
[00:31:49] <JustAberrant> it's like gentoo, except without the advantages and somehow more fragile
[00:31:52] <HoneyDrops> Arch didn't impress me, or make a good first impression.
[00:32:03] <HoneyDrops> Yeah that :/
[00:32:13] <nite> I like the minimalist approach, I've never had an issue wit it
[00:32:25] <nite> It was certainly more tedious to get up and going but since that point it's been great
[00:32:51] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[00:32:55] <JustAberrant> meh, gentoo is more tedious, but I'll take it any day ;p
[00:33:05] <JustAberrant> gentoo takes longer to get up and running, but it's more stable once you get there
[00:33:16] <nite> I have not tried Gentoo yet :o
[00:33:17] <JustAberrant> big complaint early on with arch is how often it epically breaks itself
[00:33:40] <nite> though I have somewhat irresponsibly upgraded Arch and also not broken it >_>
[00:34:23] <JustAberrant> pacman does very little to protect previous config files or notify you that something has (possibly) broken.. unless you feel like skimming through the entire log every update you don't notice that it nuked your config until you go to use something and it just breaks
[00:34:42] <JustAberrant> and pacman .. good god how did they pick those flags
[00:34:50] <nite> Wh o.o
[00:35:06] <nite> It creates .pacnew config files if the upstream default has changed, it shouldn't touch your own
[00:35:14] <nite> (but yes I agree, the syntax for it is complete garbage)
[00:35:23] <JustAberrant> nite: sure.. but chances are your old config doesn't work
[00:35:29] <JustAberrant> I guess nuke config isn't the right word
[00:35:35] <nite> Heh, that's more the fault of the developer than Arch tho >>
[00:36:05] <JustAberrant> gentoo has a nifty system where it flags config files that have changed and is like.. "hey man, you gotta go update these"
[00:36:20] <JustAberrant> arch might now, it's been awhile, but at the time I tried it, it didn't
[00:36:20] <nite> if you were going to upgrade the package manually in that case the same thing would happen & the dev should be scolded for not providing backwards compatibility 
[00:37:29] <JustAberrant> well sure, but world we live in and all ;p
[00:37:47] <nite> I'll prolly try Gentoo at some point though
[00:37:54] <Phase> JustAberrant, it shouldn't overwrite anything in /etc
[00:38:01] <Phase> creates .pacnew files instead
[00:38:18] <nite> I actually use Windows as my everyday desktop OS, I use Arch for my VPS which serves several things
[00:38:22] <nite> and CentOS at work
[00:38:36] * Phase would advise against arch for any server-type workload
[00:39:04] <JustAberrant> either way, just didn't leave a good impression on me at all.. I tried it for maybe 3 months before going back to gentoo
[00:39:45] <HoneyDrops> I installed it on a secondary system, first update broke libc.  I fixed it, but as for first impressions :/
[00:39:55] *** Pony_91235 is now known as Dude
[00:40:11] <JustAberrant> yeah, my impressions in order were probably...
[00:40:25] *** Dude is now known as Pony_35422
[00:40:45] <JustAberrant> "who the fuck designed these options", "this documentation sucks", "my god, another thing broke on an update.."
[00:41:43] <JustAberrant> and on the last one, there's this whole philosophy of "well you should have read up on all the updates you were about to apply, you'd have found it clearly stated in this forum posting here that this update completely breaks compatibility for x and we should have a fix in place soon[tm]"
[00:42:15] <JustAberrant> fuck that shit, that's why we use package managers in the first place, so we don't need to micromanage every little library and helper utility
[00:42:22] <HoneyDrops> Worst breakage I ever had on Gentoo was when Xorg was a thing and I was migrating from xfree86
[00:42:30] <JustAberrant> hehe
[00:42:45] <HoneyDrops> And that was becaues I was still pretty new, so no-X actually bothered me
[00:43:12] <JustAberrant> well, the profile change when gcc bumped versions messed things up a bit for me.. but most recent has been systemd because I wasn't using eudev and had a bunch of random gnome bits that kept trying to pull systemd in
[00:43:27] <Phase> arch kinda demands constant maintenance
[00:43:46] <JustAberrant> which is why it sucks ;p
[00:44:06] <JustAberrant> if a _source based_ distro with pretty much infinite configuration possibilities can manage to be relatively stable, a binary based one's got no excuse ;p

[02:40:22] <JustAberrant> ehe, gotta admit, that's starting to be my reaction

[02:42:07] <JustAberrant> Phase: I do that for stuff I mostly don't care about
[02:42:16] <Moonlightning> Yeah. I use `pass`, which is basically just a wrapper around gpg and a dotdir.
[02:42:27] <Moonlightning> You could do the same thing, without the wrapper :P
[02:42:28] <JustAberrant> honestly there's only a small number of really important passwords, and those I keep in my head and actually change periodically
[02:43:26] <Phase> and really the only reason i trust firefox is it's open source and client-side encrypted
[02:43:31] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: the only people that would actually /kidnap and drug me/ are probably government, and there are rumours milling about that they already have a cluster that can attack and decrypt 4096-bit RSA so they don't even need to drug me.

[02:45:15] <wolfyshy> consider the russian malware that was attacking firefox's pdf.js: it was specifically downloading .purple and .ssh for keys and to grep logs for passwords
[02:45:48] <wolfyshy> wouldn't affect me, though, since I don't talk about passwords over IM and my ssh keys have AES256 passphrase encryption
[02:46:30] <wolfyshy> if enough people start using pass or whatever, they'll just start grabbing those dirs and cracking gpg
