[03:40:38] <Starthunder> wolfyshy: last I checked, there was an option for that
[03:40:56] <tiwake> wolfyshy: "by microsoft in, and so far, only windows 10 home and pro. and that is telemetry. called feedback and diagnostics in the privacy pane in settings. feedback can be fully disabled, but not "diagnostics" which is further away from the truth by microsoft. diagnostic and usage data has 3 levels on home and pro. basic, enhanced, and full."
[03:41:13] <Starthunder> My copy of the Play Store has an option to restrict auto-updating of apps to Wi-Fi uplinks or disable it altogether
[03:41:20] <tiwake> wolfyshy: evidently that is a feature that tells microsoft that the operating system is working correctly
[03:41:30] <Starthunder> It /also/ lets me disable auto-updating on a per-app basis
[03:41:31] <HoneyDrops|Half> I have no idea how one could argue ad Ids are good for the user.
[03:41:58] <Starthunder> HoneyDrops: I dunno, if you have tons of money to throw around, maybe you /want/ people to market to you?
[03:42:03] <Starthunder> Is that an actual thing?
[03:42:13] <tiwake> nope
[03:42:23] <tiwake> if I want something, I will find it

[03:44:29] <tiwake> there might be a possibility as a business owner, that I want a sales guy from a place I buy stuff from to swing by... I suppose thats 'marketing to me'
[03:45:01] <Starthunder> But that doesn't involve app IDs.
[03:45:08] <tiwake> yeah
[03:45:20] <HoneyDrops|Half> Given my stance that ads are about 33% of what is wrong with the internet (the other thirds being a lack of ubiquitous end-to-end encryption and insufficient decentralization)... one would be hard pressed to ever convince me.
[03:45:41] <Starthunder> Then again…some small sites use ads to support themselves.
[03:45:47] <Starthunder> Like…uh…Derpibooru.
[03:53:50] <tiwake> those are community adds for the community

[04:33:34] <ShivalWolf> Gigabit: get all files put in folder run the start command 
[04:33:43] <ShivalWolf> use the existing modpacks as a base
[04:34:14] <Gigabit> Well my cousin wants me to host a server with 5 mods, but so far two require forge, and I am not sure if all are compatible
[04:34:22] <Midnight_Tinker> "run it and hope it works" vouch for ShivalWolf
[04:34:34] <ShivalWolf> Gigabit: grab a modpack use it as a template
[04:34:37] <ShivalWolf> it has all the launcher stuff
[04:34:44] <ShivalWolf> and will have forge in there already
[04:34:52] <ShivalWolf> then jsut remove all the mods and config and replace with what you want
[04:35:25] <Gigabit> Not sure what you mean exactly,it has been forever since I hosted a MC server
[04:35:34] <Gigabit> and I never used mods on it

[04:37:09] <PinkiePieBot> [ Safe artist:facelesssoles granny_smith war young_granny_smith ]
[04:37:27] <ShivalWolf> well what version of MC? if its say 1.7.10 go grab the agrarian skies modpack server files. it contains everythign you should need
[04:37:30] <ShivalWolf> unzip it
[04:37:32] <ShivalWolf> delete all the mods and configs
[04:37:35] <ShivalWolf> and then put what you want
[04:37:37] <Gigabit> We are using 1.8
[04:37:45] <ShivalWolf> then find a 1.8 modpack
[04:37:48] <Gigabit> going to be using 1.8
[04:37:50] <HoneyDrops|Half> Ok, so 1.8, what forge version you want?
[04:37:58] <wolfyshy> wow tiwake that is really well done o.o
[04:38:06] <ShivalWolf> its got all the launchers and stuff already there 
[04:38:22] <tiwake> wolfyshy: yeah... kinda badass too
[04:38:26] <wolfyshy> 1.8 has modpacks?
[04:38:33] <Gigabit> Not sure, which ever can do these mods as I list here--- Not enough items, Better pvp, battle towers, tinkers construct, twilight forest, iron chest
[04:38:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> I'm pretty sure some of those don't have 1.8 versions
[04:39:04] <wolfyshy> twilight forest desperately needs a 1.8 port
[04:39:11] <wolfyshy> I love those damn biomes
[04:39:20] <Gigabit> So far, all but tinkers are 1.8, I have been searching in that order
[04:39:28] <Gigabit> tinkers is 1.7.10
[04:39:31] <HoneyDrops|Half> Twilight Forest doesn't have a 1.8
[04:39:51] <Gigabit> okay so we are going to need 1.7.10 it seems
[04:40:04] <wolfyshy> http://www.minecraftmods.com/twilight-forest-mod/
[04:40:04] <HoneyDrops|Half> 1.8 is likely to be a dud for modded MC, unless 1.9 really takes forever.
[04:40:28] <ShivalWolf> Gigabit: why dont you just tell your cousin to find a modpack they like
[04:40:30] <ShivalWolf> and just install that
[04:40:40] <ShivalWolf> its not like there isnt thousands
[04:40:52] <Gigabit> because he did look, and they don't have these exact ones
[04:40:55] <HoneyDrops|Half> I generally use curseforge for mods, or the dev's own servers.
[04:41:05] <ShivalWolf> so find one that has mode of them
[04:41:08] <ShivalWolf> and just add the one thats missing
[04:41:29] <ShivalWolf> almost all packs now days have most of those mods

[04:42:57] <wolfyshy> am I gonna get flamed for liking spigot?  'cause if so I'll just stand in the corner over there -->
[04:43:02] <HoneyDrops|Half> There are like a dozen "larger chest" mods, I still use iron chests as it gets the job done.
[04:43:35] <ShivalWolf> theres nothign wrogn with spigot but its got its own uses just like forge has its own uses
[04:43:44] <wolfyshy> yeah
[04:43:52] <wolfyshy> I like the new release of AWE
[04:43:57] <wolfyshy> it's made it worth it
[04:44:17] <HoneyDrops|Half> spigot is still violating the GPL, or at the very least facilitating its users to.

[04:45:21] <HoneyDrops|Half> Gigabit: FML, it comes with Forge.
[04:45:24] <Midnight_Tinker> Bukkit was also taken down for violating GPL wasn't it
[04:45:54] <HoneyDrops|Half> Midnight_Tinker: craftbukkit was as it does exactly what spigot does: link GPL'd code with non-gpl-compatibly licensed code.
[04:47:07] <HoneyDrops|Half> There is no legal way to use the Bukkit API with the MC server, shortly of some system to ensure they are never running in the same process and only interact via IPC.

[04:58:59] <Midnight_Tinker> the closest legal allegory I can think of is FFL requirements for an AR-15, legally you as a private consumer can modify an AR-15 as long as you have rights to own the part considered a firearm
[04:59:33] <Midnight_Tinker> however, the original manufacturer cannot add certain things to the firearm and then sell it to you legally

[05:01:25] <init3> Haven't even heard of that one but I'll look into it. 
[05:01:39] <Midnight_Tinker> likewise, distributing a program licensed under GPL without the underlying program that makes it work is not illegal
[05:01:44] <init3> Oh yeah I have
[05:01:45] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> .mkv
[05:01:49] <Midnight_Tinker> distributing the original program, not under GPL, isn't illegal
[05:01:55] <Midnight_Tinker> distributing them TOGETHER, however, is
[05:02:07] <Midnight_Tinker> at least according to my reading of the GPL
[05:02:51] <Midnight_Tinker> as long as its the end user combining them and not providing them for distribution, there is no violation

[05:12:53] <HoneyDrops|Half> Midnight_Tinker: at the very, very least that practice is utterly contrary to the spirit of the GPL.  One could argue that while they don't distribute the violating product, they likely had to commit a violation in order to test.

[05:52:26] <Gigabit> should I do forge before or after that?
[05:53:04] <HoneyDrops|Half> It's unrelated,  MultiMC will fetch and install forge itself for instances that you set to use forge.
[05:53:28] <Gigabit> okay so I can tell forge to install now and configure all the mods in it then eh?
[05:53:35] <HoneyDrops|Half> You will need to recall what version of forge you install for the server instance. 
[05:54:07] <HoneyDrops|Half> I would install the mods in the client instance, config them using SSP, then copy over the mods & config directories.
[05:54:24] <Gigabit> they all require forge XD
[05:56:00] <HoneyDrops|Half> Install MultiMC, make a new instance, pick 1.7.10 as the MC version for the instance, right click the instance, Edit Instance, Install Forge (select version that matches whatever you picked for the server), then Loader Mods -> Add to add the mods you want

[06:48:26] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> DD-WRT seems to have died as far as dev has gone
[06:49:22] <init3> There hasn't been an update for the firmware in quite a while for my WRT54G but I don't know if I really care enough. 
[06:49:37] <init3> Not sure if I'd have to flash it back to stock then to openwrt. 
[06:50:16] <init3> Also it's an older 54G, not the 54GL that are super duper for hacking. 
[06:50:29] <init3> It is pretty limited on the storage/RAM front. 
[06:51:28] <Googie> Yeah, it looks like they kinda no longer support it on modern versions :(
[06:52:00] * Googie had one of those as well, but it died ages ago.
[06:52:05] <init3> In all fairness it is an old ass thing. 
[06:52:12] <init3> I owned 4 at one point lol
[06:52:23] <init3> I collected those damn things
[06:53:01] <init3> But gave all but one away after they got discontinued and all my friends really really wanted one. 
[06:53:22] <HoneyDrops|Half> I've been meaning to setup a pfSense box... hmm
[06:53:37] <init3> In Austin there is a computer goodwill. THat was like the jackpot for older WRTs
[06:56:32] <init3> This is annoying. I would ideally like to get an N router I have working but the thing only has 2MB of flash so custom firmware just ain't happening. 
[06:57:47] <init3> Because technically 802.11G is slower than my internet. 
[06:58:19] <Googie> Plus the actual bandwidth that you get over wifi is basically always less than you'd expect/hope
[06:58:50] <Googie> pfSense is good, though occasionally I wonder if I should just use plain old openBSD and configure pf manually.
[06:58:59] <init3> Ugh. I dunno though. This N router sucks ass. 
[06:59:20] <init3> It it was a good N one I might consider running two physical APs
[06:59:45] <init3> I dunno if I can really get 75mbps from my ISP though either. 
[06:59:51] * Googie is getting to that point where just working directly with the underlying components always seems more appealing.
[07:00:15] <init3> Yeah, I used to run a router type distro with a web gui.
[07:00:31] <init3> But that was exactly it, I just liked working with it myself. 
[07:00:50] <init3> I used FreeBSD for a while but eventually settled on Debian.
[07:00:59] <init3> Because I suck at Unix
[07:01:23] <HoneyDrops|Half> I totally was using an old PIII w/ gentoo as a firewall/router for a while, but the HW died
[07:02:17] <Googie> I'm curious when nftables will finally start to really replace iptables.

[07:09:25] <Starthunder> AFAIK generally “uninstalling” an OS is done by deleting the partition or partition table under which it resides, yes
[07:09:43] <Starthunder> Beyond that, we'd need to know more generally what you want to do.
[07:09:44] <Googie> Yes. The only potential problem is that if you have grub or similar installed to the MBR, deleting the Linux partition will make you unable to boot easily.
[07:09:58] <Shed-34046> Starthunder so removing ubuntu is as easy as 1..2..3 just disk mangement in windows and right click the partition and remove? lol
[07:10:10] <Gigabit> I can vouch for the MBR issue..had it a few times
[07:10:18] <Shed-34046> I know how to restore mbr
[07:10:37] <Googie> But yeah, restore that, delete partition, done.
[07:10:40] <Starthunder> Shed-34046: that (after making /sure/ you have nothing on the partition you want to keep), and possibly reconfiguring your bootloader.
[07:10:46] <Shed-34046> Its using my recovery disk to load up a command prompt and typing bootrec.exe /fixmbr?
[07:10:47] <Starthunder> Are you using GRUB, or what?
[07:11:14] <Shed-34046> yes Grub
[07:11:22] <Shed-34046> My computer has UEFI
[07:11:34] <Starthunder> You'll probably want to revert to…whatever the hell Windows uses when it's on its own, then.
[07:11:46] <Starthunder> Also, before you ditch a hybrid for just Windows, be warned of Microsoft's new privacy policy.
[07:11:48] <Shed-34046> would bootrec /fixmbr restore that?
[07:12:03] <Starthunder> No; you need to actually uninstall grub and install Windows' bootloader.
[07:12:12] <Shed-34046> Wait Microsoft can spy on me or no?
[07:12:22] <Shed-34046> Starthunder how would i do that o.o
[07:12:26] <Gigabit> ugh, damn dark themes..
[07:12:35] <Starthunder> In short, yes, they almost certainly can in Windows 10, and they maybe can in previous versions of Windows.
[07:12:41] <Googie> Starthunder: The bootrec /fixmbr command does that
[07:13:01] <Starthunder> …unless by “fixing the MBR” they mean something that includes—yeah, okay.
[07:13:54] <Starthunder> Shed-34046: the relevant text from their new privacy policy is as follows:

[07:14:43] <Starthunder> This implies to me that they have already introduced or will soon be introducing a technical means with which to “access, disclose and preserve […] files in private folders”
[07:15:01] <Gladiolus> the reason it is that way is because they copy pasted the onedrive eula over

[07:26:57] <Moonlightning> I'd ask the zsh channel, but I'm not sure how to reduce this. >.>
[07:27:34] <Moonlightning> Most channels I can tabcomplete by going '.w/l/i.c.#' and then a few letters

[08:39:39] <init3> :p
[08:39:47] <init3> But it actually does
[08:40:32] <init3> It isn't a number. I do get there is countable and uncountable infinity but that doesn't make it any better. 
[08:40:58] <Googie> Moonlightning: No :V
[08:41:11] <HoneyDrops|Half> Anyone have any exp with Crucial's Ballistix line?

[08:41:40] <Gigabit> wat.. my root password is wrong? bullshuit
[08:41:57] <init3> YOu probably don't even have a root password
[08:42:07] <init3> Which is fine
[08:42:13] <init3> If you use sudo instead. 
[08:42:23] <Gigabit> well.. I tried a blank field and it still said its wrong
[08:42:29] <Moonlightning> init3: “If you have 4 pencils and I have 7 apples, how many pancakes will fit on the roof?”?
[08:42:36] <Gigabit> I am trying to edit iptables to open my game port
[08:42:41] <init3> There you go
[08:42:49] <init3> Oh shit

[08:43:18] <Moonlightning> Ubuntu has no root password by default.

[08:44:58] <Gigabit> My router is
[08:45:18] <init3> WEll iptables isn't your problem. 
[08:49:43] <Gigabit> Hmm, failed to bind port this time
[08:50:03] <init3> What port number does MC run on?
[08:51:53] <Gigabit> I found out why it failed that time. I didn't actually end the server when I restarted..
[08:52:06] <init3> Makes semse
[08:52:08] <init3> sense
[08:52:39] <Gigabit> 192.168.1.4:11100
[08:52:57] <Gigabit> all my games run on the same port
[08:53:34] <init3> Well if you are unsure if smething is bount to a port you can do
[08:53:39] <Phase> they have to fight over who gets to listen()
[08:53:51] <init3> netstat -ntuap |grep <NUMBER>
[08:54:10] <init3> so netstat -ntuap | grep 11100
[08:54:25] <Gigabit> I just portchecked and my game port is open from canyouseeme.org
[08:54:52] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: sounds like a bad idea
[08:55:06] <Moonlightning> you plan to have only one gameserver running at a time?

[08:55:29] <Gigabit> I close the port when I am done for the day
[08:55:54] <init3> So others play on your server usually?
[08:56:04] <Gigabit> they do, locally is all
[08:56:23] <init3> As in on your local network?
[08:56:25] <Moonlightning> You mean by changing the NAT config? Why not just leave it and stop the server? Connection attempts would still get connref
[08:57:08] <Gigabit> as in local network ya, I leave the setting like that because sometimes me a friend play terraria or Risk of Rain
[08:57:12] <Moonlightning> Meh, I dunno. I'm going to sleep. 'night.
[08:57:26] <init3> Night
[08:57:34] <Gigabit> sleep well Moon butt
[08:57:55] <init3> Oh. Well note internally they should use your NAT IP 
[08:57:57] * Moonlightning wiggles butt. x3
[08:58:08] <Gigabit> they do use my nat IP
[08:58:18] <Gigabit> I cannot even connect to the server and I am on the same machine
[08:58:21] <init3> So the 192 one?
[08:58:24] <init3> Oh
[08:58:28] <init3> Well there ya go
[08:58:57] <init3> If that's the case it is unlikley a networking issue of any sort. 
[08:59:21] <init3> A port number that high shouldn't require root either so I dunno. 
[09:00:51] <Gigabit> On windows I could connect to the server when I hosted it on the same machine x.x
[09:01:18] <init3> Hehe I wasn't clear
[09:01:29] <init3> I mean it tells you the problem is with the MC server itself
[09:01:37] <init3> Not a OS level issue

[09:02:09] <init3> Of course you should be able to connect to a server on the same machine
[09:02:21] <init3> Connection refused usually means the server isn't running 
[09:02:23] <Gigabit> wait.. its because I am logged in twice isn't it?
[09:02:29] <init3> Or not fully running
[09:02:41] <init3> Uhh. I don't think so
[09:02:42] <Gigabit> according to tmux, it is
[09:02:52] <Gigabit> ?

[09:03:47] <Gigabit> let me edit the config and turn online mode to false
[09:03:56] <init3> Uuhhh
[09:04:20] <init3> I dunno how MC works but I kind of doubt it. If it worked in windows it should work here
[09:05:42] <HoneyDrops|Half> There is no account for the server.
[09:05:47] <Googie> ^
[09:05:49] <Gigabit> odd..
[09:05:56] <Gigabit> I never had this issue before
[09:06:35] <Googie> I know early versions of Minecraft had issues with the server being local to the client, but I haven't heard anything about that for ages and ages and ages.
[09:06:42] <Googie> (This was back before mobs worked in multiplayer)
[09:08:48] <HoneyDrops|Half> I have run a MC server locally, it can be done with 1.7.10.  Though performance is not great.
[09:09:25] <HoneyDrops|Half> Gigabit are you sure you set the client to connect to the port you're running the server on?
[09:10:02] <Gigabit> yep, tried localhost:11100 and 127.0.0.1:11100 and 192.168.1.4:11100
[09:13:03] <Gigabit> this is strange, and they are asleep so I cannot have them try

I've tried submitting it to EqD, DHN, asking around for affiliates, and made a few posts under Creative Works on brony forums, but I keep getting the same answer for the most part: "Please don't advertise sites", which is frustrating.

[21:47:19] <Gladiolus> Then you're gonna be very annoyed. 
[21:47:45] <Gladiolus> there is a thing to delay updates in pro, but i have no idea how long
[21:48:23] <Colgate> "A forced restart isn’t something to panic about," --yes it is
[21:48:30] <Gladiolus> when i do stuff like that tho i disable internet connections and only leave the one program up
[21:48:38] <Colgate> if you can't stop the restart... you aren't in control of your computer
[21:48:38] <Gladiolus> Not for most people.
[21:48:46] <HoneyDrops|Half> Remotely forcing a reboot has a name: Denial of Service attack.
[21:48:51] <Colgate> ^
[21:49:15] <Colgate> what will happen when MS forcibly releases an update that bricks a lot of computers?
[21:49:32] <Gladiolus> a lot of people will be very annoyed and that already happened several times lol
[21:49:33] <Colgate> this has happened in the past, so it isn't without precedenc
[21:50:02] <Colgate> will I have to take my PC to the computer repair shop because of a forced update?
[21:50:11] <Colgate> have them repair it, come back, and have it happen immediately again
[21:50:14] <Gladiolus> geez guys i'm not trying to hold msft on some sort of pillar of godlyness, but they aren't Computer Satan either.
[21:50:23] <Colgate> yes they are, w10 is a disaster
[21:50:31] <Gladiolus> I enjoy it v0v
[21:50:32] <Colgate> it is the worst version of windows yet
[21:51:16] <HoneyDrops|Half> At the very least some very poor design choices were made.
[21:51:27] <Gladiolus> for suuure
[21:51:29] <Colgate> and ethically questionable decisions
[21:51:34] <Gladiolus> also yes
[21:51:47] <Colgate> disabling "unauthorized hardware" with windows update
[21:51:52] <Gladiolus> but w/e it's better than 8.1 usably and has better dpi scaling than 7
[21:51:52] <Colgate> wonderful, just what I want
[21:51:58] <Gladiolus> so don't use it
[21:52:05] <Colgate> I won't and neither should you or anyone else
[21:52:10] <Gladiolus> but i like it
[21:52:14] <Colgate> you are a fool
[21:52:15] <Gladiolus> why are you against my freedom
[21:52:36] <Colgate> note: I am saying you should not use it, not that you can't
[21:52:40] <HoneyDrops|Half> ^
[21:52:59] <Gladiolus> kay whatev
[21:52:59] <Colgate> also calling you an idiot for doing so based on the knnowledge you have
[21:53:11] <Gladiolus> yes that's likely to make me come around to your way of thinking
[21:53:19] <Gladiolus> not simply make me get defensive and angry
[21:53:23] <Colgate> I don't care, you won't change anyways
[21:53:26] <Colgate> so it doesn't matter
[21:53:31] <Colgate> you are already lost to the MS
[21:53:54] <Gladiolus> I'm gonna get my brother to upgrade to 10 now just to spite you.
[21:54:16] <Colgate> if lines about how MS can disable your hardware for no reason, read all your private data for no reason, and whatever other horrors are in there is ok by you, you are too far gone to argue with
[21:54:17] <Gladiolus> and then i'll get a job at the nsa
[21:54:37] <Gladiolus> i think all those lines are kinda stupid but my other choice for this use case is windows 8.1
[21:54:39] <Gladiolus> which also blows
[21:54:44] <Gladiolus> so w/e plays my video games
[21:55:03] <HoneyDrops|Half> I'm all for you running whatever you want.  However, choosing to run something despite knowing some extremely serious downsides... I don't know how else to characterize it.
[21:55:14] <Gladiolus> i'm not afraid of some microsoft boogyman coming and stealing all my worthless data tho
[21:55:42] <Colgate> you say worthless, but when some hacker breaks MS and grabs your banking info and steals thousands of dollars from you
[21:55:47] <Colgate> you might not be the same ;)
[21:56:06] <Midnight_Tinker> you're implying I have thousands of dollars Colgate
[21:56:07] <HoneyDrops|Half> I don't give two shits about MS having the data.  It's the fact I know that data /will/ find its way into other hands.
[21:56:10] <Gladiolus> they would probably break into apple first
[21:56:14] <Midnight_Tinker> the reality is I have 92 cents
[21:56:19] <Gladiolus> i'm 150 in the hole
[21:56:55] <Rylee> Colgate: it's truly depressing how many people just don't give a shit about their privacy
[21:56:58] <HoneyDrops|Half> As far as why it bothers me that others are willing to accept MS's BS is that it sets a standard that their crap is acceptable.  
[21:57:02] <Gladiolus> anyway call me when a linux can do dx12 at 100% native speed and compability and i'll consider it
[21:57:06] <Gladiolus> until then welp
[21:58:15] <johnsey> to say it with somebody else's slightly changed words: you are a number, you are not a free man

[22:05:05] <HoneyDrops|Half> ( I should add a minor correction.  I called it "MS's BS" but it is not limited to MS.  Apple, Google, and many other companies are no better. )
[22:05:35] <Commodus> Ew Apple.
[22:05:50] <Gladiolus> I like my macbook :O
[22:06:09] <Gladiolus> but yes apple, google, and microsoft are all assholes
[22:06:26] <Gladiolus> windows still plays my videogames and my 4s still works for email
[22:08:32] <HoneyDrops|Half> Unfortunately given the prevailing system, the only way to call them on their BS is abstention.  Complaining to them only gets you so far.

[22:08:51] *** Experiencing is now known as Commodus
[22:09:03] <Gladiolus> I would if I could, go make wine support dx11+ and I'll definitely consider it.
[22:09:11] <Commodus> Yus.
[22:09:21] <Commodus> MS will be severely crippled if you don't buy their stuff.
[22:09:35] <Gladiolus> I don't heh.
[22:10:04] <Gladiolus> The only MS product I ever bought was a copy of 8.1 last year. 7s DPI scaling sucked and the student discount (50 bucks) made it seem fair.
[22:10:04] <johnsey> well, your only way to show support for other platforms is buying games for these platforms and playing them there, even if the game is available for windows :)
[22:10:42] <johnsey> the number of multi-platform games is growing, so it should be too hard
[22:10:53] <Gladiolus> If Fallout 4 is on linux then I will. 
[22:11:16] <Commodus> Are Beth games on Linux? Huh.
[22:11:39] <Gladiolus> I doubt it, might be able to use wine tho.
[22:12:56] <HoneyDrops|Half> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYqkU1y0AYc  At it's core this is what basically of the problems with Win10 represent, either directly or lay the foundation for further meaningful encroachments.

[22:13:15] <Commodus> Windows 10 is great.
[22:13:23] <Commodus> Microsoft never released bad products.
[22:13:24] <Commodus> Eveeeer.
[22:22:52] <Colgate> probably won't be able to use wine
[22:22:59] <Colgate> since wine only does up to dx9
[22:23:08] <Colgate> reverse engineering dx is hard you know :P
[22:23:52] <Gladiolus> so if i wanna play my video james the choice is obvious, i just won't do anything important like banking on here
[22:24:22] <Gladiolus> uugh now i feel bad that I got rude :I
[22:24:29] * Gladiolus sits on Colgate apologenically
[22:30:15] <HoneyDrops|Half> You at least have the privilege of making an informed choice, even if I (and others) think it is a bad one.  You are aware of the concerns and cognizant of how they may impact you.  The scary part is how many people click "I agree" on buying a new computer have no idea what they are agreeing to and how it can impact them, much less that they even have other choices.  Those are the people I
[22:30:17] <HoneyDrops|Half> am truly worried for.  They are the ones that who will suffer the greatest direct harm.
[22:33:13] <Commodus> What kinda harm is this?
[22:34:27] <Colgate> Gladiolus: pssh, I was the rude one doing ad homonium attacks :P
[22:34:51] <HoneyDrops|Half> Colgate, I can most succinctly sum it up: They have a computer that they cannot trust will always act in their best interests, and not against them.
[22:35:09] <HoneyDrops|Half> err

[22:41:05] <HoneyDrops|Half> A computer should never do anything without the users consent, nor should it not obey its user because someone else has imposed some artificial limit.
