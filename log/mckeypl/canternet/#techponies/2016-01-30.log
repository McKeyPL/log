[04:09:27] <Not-Renny> It doesn't need to be fast, just doable...
[04:10:08] <Not-Renny> Excellent. Where could I look to learn how to do this?

[07:43:01] <Renny> Ah.
[07:43:28] <Googie> Web development has basically become a bit of an in-joke among a lot of the traditional "hacker" crowd these days.
[07:43:56] <Moonlightning> (Ignoring obfuscation--I will make no argument for or against it here--)I see no reason that even generated HTML should not be readable.

[07:45:25] <RENSleep> Legible generated *
[07:45:46] <Googie> Minificiation and the like cuts down file size, and can speed up page load speeds a little bit. Unfortunately obfuscation has a legitimate technical purpose :(
[07:46:51] *** Pony_36522 is now known as Dude
[07:47:10] <Moonlightning> I doubt that minification has enough of an effect to justify it.
[07:47:20] *** Dude is now known as Pony_61345
[07:47:34] <Moonlightning> If you're worried about transfer times, look into compression and caching first.
[07:48:01] <Moonlightning> s/transfer/load/
[07:51:17] <mniip> isn't jquery.min.js something like 2 MB?
[07:54:03] <Phase> Moonlightning, at some scales the effect is worthwile
[07:54:11] <Phase> but we have source maps how so everyone wins
[07:54:19] <Phase> assuming people implement source maps which they should
[07:56:19] <Moonlightning> Huh?
[07:57:31] <Phase> so there doesn't seem to be a nice doc on mdn
[07:58:00] <Phase> Moonlightning, it's a map between minified code and the original source, works really well in practice
[07:58:07] * Phase has debugged heavily minified code in situ using it
[07:58:17] <Moonlightning> A...map?
[07:58:41] <Phase> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/
[07:58:42] <PinkiePieBot> [ Introduction to JavaScript Source Maps - HTML5 Rocks ]
[07:58:52] <Moonlightning> Why not just link to the unminified code and document the procedure for minification?
[07:59:06] <Phase> it's for debuggers
[07:59:15] <Phase> maps renamed variables/functions for example
[07:59:36] <Moonlightning> Ahhhh.
[08:01:00] <Moonlightning> On an unrelated note, anypony know how to encrypt (/well/) pieces of a large block of data, separately?
[08:01:23] <Moonlightning> My first thought was dm-crypt, but that's not available. (Context in a moment)
[08:02:09] <Phase> Moonlightning, source maps also allow something like the coffeescript compiler to map its output to the original coffeescript code
[08:02:41] <Phase> and i think the major minifiers can preserv that map through its own process
[08:05:00] <Moonlightning> What I'm trying to do here is extract a filesystem from a FileVault|Apple Core Storage container. The disk it's on isn't otherwise encrypted, so it needs to be encrypted, somehow. The only system that's available is an OS X one (so e.g. dmcrypt is out), and I don't think there's enough space on the internal disk to use that as an intermediary.
[08:06:24] <Moonlightning> gpg is available, but I tried imaging the filesystem and piping it through gpg, and estimated that it would take over a day, and it's hard to impossible to keep the system running for that long.
[08:08:07] <Moonlightning> And `gpg --encrypt` will produce different results each time.
[08:08:24] <Phase> why's dm-crypt out? put it on a loopback device, done
[08:08:36] <Phase> OH
[08:08:37] <Phase> derp
[08:08:39] <Phase> osx
[08:08:41] <Moonlightning> Yeah. :P
[08:08:53] <Phase> excuse me i can't reed god
[08:09:08] <Moonlightning> If I could get gpg to /behave/ like dm-crypt--to produce the same output block given the same input block--that would be ideal.
[08:09:47] <Moonlightning> Smallish things like encryption parameters (an IV, some keys, whatever) can be stored on the internal disk (which is secure) for as long as necessary.
[08:10:25] <Moonlightning> I skimmed the gpg ponypage but didn't see anything relevant.

[12:00:36] <Moonlightning> Returning to the crypto thing...what about a userspace program that encrypts a file block by block, without any kind of chaining or anything?
[12:00:40] <Moonlightning> That's /gotta/ exist, right?
[12:00:50] <Moonlightning> (basically dm-crypt, without the /device/ bit)
[12:00:58] <Moonlightning> (and the /mapper/ bit)
[12:01:09] <Googie> Without the chaining ? You mean ECB mode ?
[12:02:36] <Moonlightning> I dunno. What does dm-crypt use?
[12:02:50] <Googie> I'm not sure what you want. It's probably not ECB though.
[12:03:02] <Moonlightning> ...actually, dm-crypt is recommended against, because pitfalls

[12:13:41] <Moonlightning> There's gpg and...that's about it. An ideal solution involves getting gpg to behave like dm-crypt, and then just using it to reencrypt X blocks at a time.
[12:14:25] <Moonlightning> (`gpg --encrypt` doesn't work; it produces different results each time. You couldn't just encrypt pieces of a file in different sessions and then splice the results together.)

[17:30:25] <Renny> Hmm, there is one that is actually laptop compatible for like $20
[17:30:59] <Crimson_Tail> If you're upgrading the RAM, make sure you don't mix brands unless those sticks are on the same clock rate
[17:31:25] <Crimson_Tail> The sticks in this laptop are diff brands, but both are on the same clock rate and works

[19:54:36] <JustAberrant> seriously though, I say avoid fancy bullets/other silly junk, just keep it plain and professional

[19:55:55] <Duck> lol
[19:56:35] <Duck> i did my own very basic resume. quite honestly, if the employer cares that much about what my resume actually looks like, rather than my pertinent experience, then fuck them
[19:57:22] <Renny> Well, I think your employer would care of it was messy and unorganized....
[19:57:36] <Renny> But yep. Clean and simple is best way to go.
[19:58:17] <JustAberrant> well, the thing to keep in mind is that (especially at larger companies) HR is more of a barrier than a representation of what it's like to work there

[21:04:49] <Gigabit> anyone know how to fix libre office formatting fuck up? Saved my resume in docx and now it completely fucked the formatting up I had..
[21:06:02] <Gigabit> I had a column made and now it turned my whole document into a column
[21:06:58] <Moonlightning> Just use HTML. XP
[21:07:32] <Moonlightning> Things don't generally fuck up rendering simple HTML.
[21:08:09] <Gigabit> Oklay, any clue how to remove these stupid column without destroying the text?
[21:08:22] *** Quits: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: )
[21:09:08] <Moonlightning> Oh, résumé? I'd use whatever to maintain it, and send others a PDF version.
[21:09:27] <Gigabit> ya I made the mistake of not doing that and now its all fucked
[21:09:36] <Gigabit> I had it looking nice and now its shit
[21:10:35] <Moonlightning> Worstcase, you can always just redo the formatting. You don't have backups?
[21:11:04] <Gigabit> I literally just saved this, the first save as docx went fine, told it to save again after correcting stuff and it screwed up
[21:11:14] * Moonlightning now has a cronjob to take a snapshot of the root filesystem every hour. Yay CoW filesystems!
[21:11:30] <Moonlightning> And you don't have a good copy open?
[21:11:42] <Gigabit> no because im a dumbass
[21:12:25] <Moonlightning> Uhh…//maybe// saving it again in the original format (don't clobber any other instances of it!) will help?
[21:12:38] <Moonlightning> Might help, might make it worse
[21:14:40] <Moonlightning> I dunno. This feels like a lossy thing to me. Like, whatever formatting you had is just not in the file anymore.
