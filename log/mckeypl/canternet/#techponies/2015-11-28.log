[01:07:18] <tiwake> silly question, do managed switches handle DHCP stuff?
[01:07:49] <tiwake> or is a router explicitly defined as DHCP stuff?
[01:09:36] <Googie> Switches don't touch DHCP. In theory routers don't either.
[01:09:44] <HoneyDrops> A switch does not handle DHCP, it works on layer 2.  A consumer router common has a DHCP server, but there is not reason a router must do it.
[01:10:04] <Googie> Though there's often a blurred line between a managed switch and a router these days, depending on the model
[01:10:21] <tiwake> so if a router does not han... yeah, my question, difference between router and switch
[01:10:35] <tiwake> erm, managed switch and router
[01:10:48] <Googie> A switch would really be the wrong place for a DHCP server.
[01:10:48] <HoneyDrops> A router routs, a switch just passes packets?
[01:11:16] <Googie> HoneyDrops: Some managed switches are capable of routing, but are sold as switches
[01:11:35] <tiwake> what defines routing?
[01:12:52] <HoneyDrops> It decides where to send things (NAT, redirection, etc).  A switch just passes whatever it's given, whereever it's told to go (and does not generally work on an IP-address level)
[01:13:20] <tiwake> what about a dumb switch?
[01:14:02] <Googie> Same thing. It just passes what it's given where it needs to go (Ethernet Frames, not IP packets)
[01:14:26] <tiwake> then why spend the money and get a managed switch?
[01:15:29] <HoneyDrops> One use case would be port mirroring.
[01:15:34] <Googie> Because they tend to be a lot more configurable. For example handling VLANs, port mirroring...
[01:15:57] <tiwake> donno what either of those are :-x
[01:16:28] <HoneyDrops> port mirroring is for when you want to listen to /everything/ the switch passes
[01:16:35] <Sour_Sweet> VLANs are used to have multiple isolated networks on one physical network
[01:17:41] <HoneyDrops> Generally the switch will only send things out where they need to go (as opposed to a hub that just blasts it at everyone).  Port mirroring lets you always send a copy to one port where you have a device to listen/record it all for various reasons.
[01:17:55] <Googie> And I suppose for the purpose of completeness, we should also mention Hubs
[01:18:36] <Googie> Which are basically just all the Ethernet wires wired together, connecting all the machines directly
[01:18:51] <Sour_Sweet> Also some switches do QoS
[01:20:06] <Googie> Spanning Tree Protocol as well.
[01:20:35] <Googie> (Without it, you can easily take down a network simply by plugging into two ports into each other)
[01:21:34] <tiwake> I want to read up on network stuff before I spend a lot of money on some 10G network stuff, make sure I'm getting what I want to get
[01:22:32] <Googie> How much is a 10G-Base-T switch these days anyway ?
[01:22:44] <Sour_Sweet> Prosumer/Economy grade switches will also do a lot of things traditionally done by a router. DHCP, Firewall, Port and MAC adress based access control, packet filtering
[01:24:04] <Sour_Sweet> Generally speaking almost no consumer needs those
[01:24:05] <Googie> (Switches running ios for example)
[01:24:20] <tiwake> screw iOS
[01:24:36] <Sour_Sweet> Switches running iOS?
[01:24:43] <Googie> Cisco ios
[01:24:48] <Sour_Sweet> Ahh
[01:25:00] <tiwake> oh, so different from apple's iOS
[01:25:03] <tiwake> lol
[01:25:06] <Sour_Sweet> That confused me for a sec.
[01:25:33] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah Cisco also does VPN things on some models as far as I'm aware
[01:25:56] <Googie> Though I'm pretty sure a lot of people still have the same opinion on /cisco/ ios :P
[01:27:49] <Sour_Sweet> (hehe ask Google. They leaked VPN credentials through a refurbished switch)
[01:35:57] <Googie> But tiwake, for the purposes of what you're doing, you probably just want to put all the stuff like a DHCP server on the router.
[01:36:25] <HoneyDrops> I wonder if there is a nice little dual 10G little ARM boards that would make a good linux/bsd-based router.

[04:28:07] <Compu> hey it just signed in finally
[04:30:07] <Compu> and now my phone says PSN is on maintenance
[04:38:58] <Moonlightning> Why do you need the PSN to use YouTube -.-
[04:40:30] <cyzon> poor design
[04:41:21] <Compu> Moonlightning: because the youtube app cant see which profile ur using cuz of how apps work on PS3 but it can see what PSN account ur signed into so to sign into youtube u link ur PSN to ur youtube (u can unlink it) so that way each user can sign in individually
[04:41:55] <Moonlightning> Compu: no local accounts?
[04:42:12] <Compu> Moonlightning: PS3 has them but apps cant see them
[04:42:30] <Moonlightning> :/
[04:42:54] <Compu> Moonlightning: because on PS3 unlike game data app data is saved the same for all local accounts
[04:43:15] <Moonlightning> …that rather defeats the point of having local accounts.
[04:43:31] <Compu> it still has individual game data for each account
[04:43:36] <Compu> so thats the point
[04:46:33] <Moonlightning> Accounts serve to partition user data and privileges.
[04:47:06] <Moonlightning> If the PS OS only partitions /some/ user data, it's not really honoring the spirit of accounts.
[04:48:22] <Compu> Moonlightning: well it is a console
[04:48:39] <Compu> and it has free multiplayer so i have no complaints
[04:49:17] <Moonlightning> So? It has local accounts. It uses them to partition game data. Is it really too much to expect it to also partition other app data?
[04:50:14] <Compu> yes because people like to sign into the netflix app and not have to sign in again every time the switch profiles since the whole house usually uses one netflix account
[04:53:04] <Compu> Moonlightning: keep in mind people who use consoles dont use them the same way u use a computer
[04:54:15] <Moonlightning> Netflix is the exception, not the rule. Most services don't intend for multiple people to use the same account.
[04:54:23] <Moonlightning> Though I can't really argue with ^2
[04:57:01] <Compu> Moonlightning: name services besides youtube on PS3 where people dont use the same account
[04:57:08] <Compu> i can name ones where people DO
[04:57:12] <Compu> amazon video
[04:57:28] <Compu> and pretty much any other subscription service
[04:57:31] <Moonlightning> Does that use normal Amazon accounts?
[04:58:12] <Compu> yes but each account has to have its own amazon prime so people normally just pay for one account to have amazon prime and just use that
[05:00:38] <Moonlightning> Hmm. 'd make sense for that to be true of paid subscriptions in general.
[05:02:08] <Compu> and most media services on PS3 r subscription based

[16:27:57] <Sour_Sweet> So I search for a software that does drive management on Windows, found a tool that does what I need and the site recommends me to download the Fallout 4 full nude mod with a preview picture. That's a brilliant idea to recommend that on software that's often used in cooperate environments
[16:33:33] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> always fun
[16:33:43] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> windows 8.1 or 10?
[16:35:24] <Sour_Sweet> 10
[16:35:59] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> *nods*
[16:36:06] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> microsoft "push" advertisements
[16:36:15] <Sour_Sweet> Zhh 8.1. I would throw my drive out of the window before installing any Win8 version
[16:37:00] <Sour_Sweet> (Considering it's an SSD it would probably survive that)
[16:38:24] <Sour_Sweet> Windows is just silly and internal drive management wouldn't let me delete a partition, so I needed a tool to do that. I was not willing to search for my gParted CD for such a simple task

[16:39:00] <Divide|TechSupport> 8.1's not too terribad, really, now that it's been patched through the roof.  10, however, eats laptops.
[16:40:16] <Sour_Sweet> If your OS needs a patch for basic functionality to work I don't touch it. I'm using 10 on my notebook as well with no problems so far

[18:37:30] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> its cold, its raining, and its blowing HARD out of the north
[18:37:52] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> so i cant get anything out of my truck because soon as i open the tailgate everything will get soaking freaking wet
[18:39:39] <Lapsus> Sour_Sweet: I gave +v to everyone that was left after the first split :v
[18:39:44] <Lapsus> we'll see how long it lasts
[18:42:29] <init3> Derpy is best server. Get on my level ipv4 plebs. 
[18:42:48] <init3> :p
[18:42:57] <tiwake> whatever freenode server I'm connected to, it does not like staying online
[18:43:49] <tiwake> not connected at the moment, and havent been for... uh
[18:44:10] <tiwake> 12 hours
[18:44:30] <init3> There was a notice at 6 that it was getting ddosed
[18:44:58] <tiwake> not surprising
[18:45:12] <init3> Why do irc networks get DDoSed so fucking much?
[18:45:30] <HoneyDrops> Idle hands?
[18:45:46] <tiwake> there is apple.com to DoS up though
[18:45:54] <tiwake> or amazon or whatever
[18:46:32] <init3> Well like most places I have worked don't allow irc servers on their networks because of the ddos risk.
[18:47:12] <init3> I have been told they are a magnet for that shit.
[18:47:39] <tiwake> freenode seems to be, I don't think any others
[18:47:46] <tiwake> or as much for others
[18:48:07] <init3> Well freenode is giant
[18:48:14] <tiwake> I havent seen any against quakenet for example
[18:48:33] <tiwake> is that the one thats bigger than freenode?
[18:48:57] <init3> Canternet and ponychats have been hit a number of times, but that might just be bring hate
[18:49:12] <init3> Fucking autocorrect
[18:49:21] <init3> Brony hate
[18:49:47] <tiwake> yeah, quakenet is larger than freenode
[18:50:05] <init3> I didn't realize that
[18:50:37] <tiwake> there are one or two larger networks than freenode
[18:50:46] <tiwake> quakenet is larger because its game focused
[18:50:56] <tiwake> never been channel surfing though
[18:51:12] <tiwake> freenode and canternet I channel surf :)
[18:51:29] <init3> Freenode just seems to have most of the cool tech channels.
[18:51:41] <tiwake> yeah, its more useful by far
[18:51:49] <tiwake> <3

[20:14:42] <Sour_Sweet> Wait since when do I have +v? :P
[20:15:02] <Sour_Sweet> Ahh I see

[20:41:46] <Sour_Sweet> I already assumed it being a ddos. As I said earlier the timing was way too convenient. That nonsense makes me angry.
