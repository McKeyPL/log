[09:57:00] <Kinsley> I am beating my head against a wall with this fucking bug.
[09:58:47] <Kinsley> My bot, Pinkie, needs to get a list of nicks in a channel.
[09:59:41] <Kinsley> The way I've figured out based on her architecture is to write a raw command to the IRC server to trigger a 353 event.
[10:00:25] <Kinsley> Now, my problem is that I need two functions. One handles the event because I can't gather new input without it, the other responds to a command that needs the list of nicks.
[10:00:58] <Kinsley> However, for whatever fucking reason, none of the variables are persisting between these two functions.
[10:01:30] <Kinsley> As soon as the event function exits, it wipes the data in any variable it touched.

[10:13:23] <ShivalWolf> but the bot also had oper status so im not sure if that would make it behave differntly
[10:13:37] <Kinsley> ShivalWolf: my issue isn't getting the list, it's /keeping/ it.

[13:58:19] <Moonlightning> It seems to me that caching DNS servers could speed up user-perceived response times by taking note of requests that are repeated often and prefetching the relevant records as they expire. Is that a thing?

[13:59:34] <Moonlightning> …okay, actually, I can see why that's probably not a thing.

[14:20:52] <Stik> you can explain it to us lot
[14:21:00] <Stik> honestly i'm still a bit vague on how it actually works :P
[14:21:31] <Moonlightning> Like the overall infrastructure stuff, or the protocol details?
[14:22:35] <Stik> whatever you feel like :)
[14:24:50] *** Quits: Pocky (Pocketguns2@Digging.a.Hole) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[14:28:10] <Moonlightning> big-picture stuff first, then? x3
[14:29:10] <Moonlightning> You have primary authoritative servers (“I /run/ this domain; what I say goes”), secondary authoritative servers (“I'm in close contact with the dude that runs this domain, so I know everything about it”), recursive servers (“I can find out anything about a name for you”), and, of course, clients.
[14:30:48] <Moonlightning> Traditionally, an admin would maintain a /master file/ (I like to call them /zonefiles/; I'm not sure if that's actually a correct term) on the primary server for a domain. Nowadays, people who don't really want to get into DNS use web panels. (I hate the web panels. They're so LIMITING!)
[14:33:03] <Moonlightning> The primary is also configured to allow one or more secondaries to fetch the complete, exhaustive set of records for the domain (those fetches are called /zone transfers/). It may also be configured to notify secondaries whenever the domain is updated, so they can fetch the updates immediately.
[14:33:18] <Moonlightning> (Of course, the primary and a secondary have to support that, or else it ain't happenin')
[14:39:54] <Moonlightning> Recursive servers provide name services for some set of clients by itering over the components of the relevant name and asking the authoritative servers at each level. They'll get just an authority section (“I dunno, but here're the authoritative servers for the next level down”) from the first few, and then at one level they'll get a response to send back to the client.
[14:40:14] <Moonlightning> They usually also cache records so as to not bother a bunch of servers next time a client want to know something.
[14:44:09] <Moonlightning> ISPs almost always run recursive servers for their customers. Google also runs two (their v4 addresses are very memorable: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. You may've heard of them.)
[14:44:38] <Moonlightning> Those are usually what you think of when you think /DNS server/.
[14:46:15] <Moonlightning> Machines can play multiple roles, too, sometimes for different sets of clients. My server, for example, is a primary for my domain to everyone, and also a recursive server just for me. So you can ask it anything about my domain, but not about anything else.
[14:47:28] <Moonlightning> Almost every Internet-connected machine ever is also a DNS client. The ones that run recursive servers are generally configured to talk to themselves for DNS. :)
[14:49:45] <Moonlightning> Anyway, name resolution goes like this: A client asks a recursive server for a specific type of records for a name; the server checks its cache and asks other servers if necessary, then sends a response back to the client. \o/

[16:48:42] * Moonlightning showed up to say…
[16:48:56] <Moonlightning> I hit bedrock! With 53 minutes to go.
[16:49:14] <Moonlightning> It looks…creepy.
[16:53:26] <Moonlightning> It feels weird to be standing on it and it's honestly kinda scaring me. ;-;
[16:53:38] <Moonlightning> Especially with these SCARY NOISES, AAAAAAGH
[16:53:50] <Moonlightning> I'M IN PEACEFUL MODE; CUT IT OUT
[17:04:53] *** Eventide|Sleepies is now known as Eventide
[17:14:22] <HoneyDrops> The void fog limites visibility.  Though oddly, the bedrock is more safe than regular blocks.  Internally it counts as transparent and mobs can't spawn on it.
[17:14:35] <HoneyDrops> s/tes/ts/
[17:15:48] * JustAberrant sudden urge to get back into minecraft
[17:15:52] * JustAberrant just waits for it to pass ;p
[17:21:15] <HoneyDrops> mobs also can't spawn on half/slab blocks... though I hate using that and prefer to just do proper lighting.
[17:23:20] * JustAberrant pretty much exclusively plays heavily modded versions of minecraft, where the spawning rules are always inconsistent and constantly changing :>
[17:27:21] <HoneyDrops> I play modded mc, but nothing that messes with mob spawn.  I tend to play skyblock (well did before I largely stopped playing last spring), and mobs only spawn if I specifically want them to.
[17:28:50] <Moonlightning> I can't see the void fog.
[17:30:00] <Moonlightning> Rule for finding your way out of a bedrock field: make holes in the ceiling at periodic intervals; place torches with their points pointing to the way out.
[17:30:21] <Moonlightning> Well, I've got fourteen minutes. What do?

[17:32:07] <Moonlightning> …oi! The pattern on the bedrock blocks reverses at this point!
[17:33:49] <Moonlightning> …oh, no, wait, that's just a coincidence. It's not really consistent anyway.
[17:34:21] * Lapsus pokes Moonlightning.
[17:34:46] <Lapsus> Once you fall victim to minecraft and own a copy, let me know so I can play with you.
[17:36:26] * JustAberrant wonders if AppleDash's server is still alive
[17:36:49] * JustAberrant guessing not :(
[17:37:14] * Moonlightning counterpokes Lapsus.
[17:37:17] <Moonlightning> I remember~
[17:37:54] <Moonlightning> So, last thirteen minutes, bedrock field, wut do?
[17:39:47] <HoneyDrops> Find a hole, fall out of the world?
[17:40:31] <JustAberrant> clear an overhead area and hunt slimes ;p
[17:41:16] <Moonlightning> Didn't the hole thing get patched?
[17:41:27] <Moonlightning> Also, I'm playing in peaceful mode.
[17:42:12] <JustAberrant> peaceful on a non-modded server is pretty bleak, build something I guess ;p
