[00:19:38] <ColtonDRG> Thanks.
[00:20:35] <ColtonDRG> Again, sorry for all those issues. Occasionally my ISP turns off my connection, but they don't do it correctly, so my connections become very unstable instead of turning off outright.
[00:21:04] <ColtonDRG> And often, certain applications do not get affected, this time my Nagios system was not affected, so I was not made aware of the issue.
[00:22:02] <Colgate> you have nagios configured for your home net?
[00:22:06] <ColtonDRG> Yes.
[00:22:32] <Colgate> hmm, maybe you should make your flapping detection a bit more strict
[00:22:40] *** Joins: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net)
[00:22:46] <ColtonDRG> It's supposed to prevent things like this from happening, because I can log in and turn everything off until I can get it sorted with the ISP, but this time I guess it didn't work.
[00:22:56] <ColtonDRG> I came home and everything was just exploding.
[00:23:36] <ColtonDRG> That's the thing. I have flapping detection enabled and set pretty strict, it just didn't go off because Nagios was unaffected.

[11:12:22] <Angeline> miggyb, that's the thing
[11:12:28] <Angeline> My router doesn't work for that at all
[11:12:48] <Angeline> Also, what I was really hoping to do was manage to connect the DS to the internet
[11:12:52] <Angeline> So I could play co-op MH4U
[11:13:35] <miggyb> Angeline: if you turn off DHCP on your router and plug both the laptop and the PS4 to the LAN ports, and leave the WAN unplugged, it should work automagically
[11:13:44] <Angeline> uhh
[11:13:45] <Angeline> wha
[11:14:18] <miggyb> depends on whether your laptop is briding the connection or if it's creating its own subnet
[11:14:30] <Angeline> uhhh
[11:14:30] <Angeline> what
[11:14:38] <Googie> You use your laptop as a Wireless client on the neighbor's network, and the Router broadcast's its own wireless network, but wired into your laptop.
[11:14:50] <Angeline> yes that is what it tried to do
[11:14:59] <Angeline> I could connect to the router but not to the internet
[11:15:22] <Googie> Did you enable connection sharing in Windows ? (I'm assuming you're using Windows ?)
[11:15:36] <Angeline> I am, and I have no idea, Googie 
[11:16:09] <Topsie_Mobile> Thanks for that shutter, does it take photos quickly? Will cost about £270 which is roughly what I can get the OPO for
[11:16:29] <Googie> In the connection properties, select your Wifi adapter, go into properties->sharing
[11:16:37] <Googie> Then share it with your ethernet adapter.
[11:17:16] <Googie> While your laptop is connected to your neighbor's Wifi, it will now share the internet connection through that Ethernet port, which you can plug into your router.

[16:05:15] <AppleDash> I don't understand the big deal about poodle
[16:05:36] <AppleDash> It's an extremely hard to execute attack that really shouldn't be considered anything other than low-priority
[16:09:53] <Googie> The biggest issue is that it's very wide spread, and most people take the possibility of broken encryption very seriously. It's certainly not high priority, but perhaps not low priority, simply because of the range of vulnerable machines
[16:17:24] <Googie> It's also potentially a practical MITM attack, though I haven't heard of any use of it in practice
[16:17:50] <Googie> (key words being /potentially practical/)
[16:31:08] <Googie> Honestly in that article, a lot of the security problems probably aren't that important (A significant amount are from images with Mercurial installed with a security flaw. I haven't looked into it, but since Mercurial is just a developer tool, and only runs when invoked, I don't think the implications in production are severe)
[16:31:30] <Googie> But it does raise an interesting point on the security of Docker images.

[18:40:15] <AppleDash> So,
[18:40:30] <AppleDash> Is there any reason why PCs use a different connector for internal USB than for external?
[18:41:04] <AppleDash> I think it'd make it a lot easier for testing and things if motherboards internally just had a row of standard USB connectors, and the panel connectors and card readers and what have you just used a standard USB plug
[18:41:15] <AppleDash> I mean, the USB connectors don't take up too much more space than the pins we're using now
[18:41:33] <Dusk> because you can have 2 connectors per port.
[18:41:37] <Dusk> instead of just one.
[18:42:07] <Dusk> If you're just gonna replace it with just one then I don't see the point when you could have double the bandwidth on those ports
[18:42:17] <AppleDash> I guess, but it wouldn't be that big of a deal to just have double the ports
[18:42:35] <Dusk> The reason is because computers were designed to be in cases AppleDash.
[18:42:40] <AppleDash> You could just have a grid of like 6 in the same way as SATA connectors are, that'd be enough for anyone (and if it wasn't, you could even use a hub)
[18:42:41] <Dusk> >Questioning convention
[18:42:44] <AppleDash> I know this, Dusk
[18:43:00] <AppleDash> This doesn't really have anything to do with cases or not,t hough
[18:43:19] <Dusk> Some PC mobos do have what you're asking about
[18:43:29] <Dusk> I've owned two that had a row of internal USB rows
[18:43:38] <AppleDash> Great
[18:43:42] <AppleDash> This needs to become standard
[18:43:43] <Dusk> but they were both mini itx boards
[18:43:45] <Dusk> no it doesn't
[18:43:55] <AppleDash> In my opinion it does at least
