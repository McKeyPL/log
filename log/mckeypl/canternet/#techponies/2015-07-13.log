[06:26:58] <Soarin> hmm, well I aint doing it then.
[06:27:07] <cyborg_ar> there have been some exploits for breaking the hypervisor itself, but all the known ones have been patched i think
[06:27:28] <cyborg_ar> it's mostly just like having a computer plugged in to your network
[06:28:14] <cyborg_ar> certain combinations of weak hosts and particularly vicious infections could break out through the network
[06:29:22] <Lapsus> IIRC there are a few viruses that attempt to break out of VMs, but most just try to hide and don't activate if they detect a vm to make it harder to analyse
