[04:38:50] <Moonlightning> I use eight-word passphrases (title case, with spaces). The first four and the last two were picked out of /usr/share/dict/words at random back in March of this year. The remaining two are generally related to the machine or service the password grants access to, in an attempt to mitigate the password-reuse thing to some degree.

[04:41:02] <Moonlightning> It's rather frequent, though.
[04:41:40] <Moonlightning> Anyway…skimming that wordlist, I can see that a lot of them aren't words I'd actually pick
[04:42:15] *** Quits: ColtonDRG-Core (coltondrg@ColtonDRG.is.best.pony) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:42:18] <Moonlightning> I guess I'd use maybe a quarter of them. (That's still a lot, though.)

[04:42:21] <Lapsus> lol
[04:42:45] *** Joins: ColtonDRG-Core (coltondrg@ColtonDRG.is.best.pony)
[04:42:57] <Moonlightning> A quarter of the words in the list is just over 2**16 == 65536 possible words.
[04:42:57] *** ColtonDRG-Core was kicked by Lapsus (Boop)
[04:43:18] <Lapsus> let's see if his client autojoins or if he's just in the channel
[04:44:09] <Moonlightning> So six, picked at random, give 2**(16*6) == 79228162514264337593543950336 possibilities, or 16*6 == 96 bits of entropy
[04:46:01] *** Quits: ColtonDRG (coltondrg@ColtonDRG.is.best.pony) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[04:46:23] <Lapsus> oh there's two of him, derp
[04:46:53] <Lapsus> either way, hopefully that kick was pre-ping and his client received it
[04:47:28] <Moonlightning> As for the variable two…let's be conservative and say there's only 8 related words I'm likely to pick from. 8 == 2**3, so two of them yields an additional 64 possibilities, or 6 bits of entropy
[04:49:38] <Moonlightning> So altogether…5070602400912917605986812821504 possibilities and 102 bits of entropy

[11:43:22] <Seoson> Wait until they freeze your account - that's fun I can tell you
