[01:53:29] <init3> OS drive on my gateway turned.... weird
[01:53:52] <init3> Like half of /usr and /var got turned into jelly or some shit.

[01:56:21] <Caerdwyn> XD
[01:57:05] <init3> And the rsync of the old drive to a safe place on the new one took like 2 hours.
[01:57:21] <Caerdwyn> rsync and not cp?
[01:57:26] <Caerdwyn> i am disappoint, init3 
[01:57:52] <init3> Probably because the drive may have been manufactured before 2003
[01:58:00] <init3> cp is for plebs
[01:58:00] <Caerdwyn> o.O
[01:58:06] <Caerdwyn> cp is for peasants

[02:08:42] <HoneyDrops|Half> GigaWork: no and there never will me
[02:08:45] <HoneyDrops|Half> s/me/be/
[02:11:24] <HoneyDrops|Half> The reason being it is a terrible idea.  MC mods are executable java bytecode, it would be a huge risk to let a game server you connect to push that to a client.

[03:58:07] <AppleDash> Well, FAT32
[03:58:10] <Caerdwyn> no, that's squashfs on a flashdrive
[03:58:12] <AppleDash> But close enough
[03:58:12] <Caerdwyn> not a full install
[03:58:13] <AppleDash> No it's not

Whenever I start X, the virtual console "shows through" underneath. Like, in the left bottom corner of my screen there is a blinking cursor, and if I star typing into lightdm's login screen, it also types into the underlying virtual console and I can see the text I'm
[04:04:46] <AppleDash> typing. Once I get into XFCE and I type more things, it still types also into the virtual console beneath in addition to XFCE. Also, after about 30s to 1m, XFCE just completely freezes and I have to hard reset.

[04:06:48] <AppleDash> Also, I've tried SSHing in after the freeze, the system is 100% unresponsive
[04:07:12] <Caerdwyn> AppleDash: add to your boot command line: acpi_osi=Linux nomodeset elevator=deadline
[04:07:23] <Caerdwyn> try booting with that in place once
[04:07:26] <AppleDash> I don't trust that
[04:07:27] <Caerdwyn> see if anything is different
[04:08:31] <Caerdwyn> acpi_osi=Linux changes how the kernel reads acpi (may or may not do anything), nomodeset will modify the kernel setting certain graphic modes on your video card, elevator=deadline just changes your I/O scheduler to something a bit faster then the default CFQ scheduler
[04:08:40] <Caerdwyn> I use elevator=noop on my laptop because SSD
[04:08:53] <Moonlightning> elevator=deadline? O.o

[04:09:05] <Caerdwyn> elevator=deadline/noop/cfq
[04:09:07] <Phase> XD
[04:09:27] <Phase> iirc the deadline scheduler, well, enforces a deadline on io operations
[04:09:38] <Caerdwyn> deadline is a low-latency scheduler, noop disables scheduling for SSDs and super fast hard drives, and CFQ is the default "complete fair queueing" scheduler
[04:09:42] <Phase> cfq has a habbit of blocking one read if it improves the performance of another
[04:09:52] <Phase> for a rather long time in some cases
[04:09:57] <Caerdwyn> Phase: deadline is awesome on hard drives

[04:12:16] <AppleDash> It didn't do that before I switched mobo/CPU/RAM
[04:12:25] <Caerdwyn> just add the things i said AppleDash and try pls
[04:12:32] <Caerdwyn> and tell me if it does anything different with the video
[04:12:41] <AppleDash> Also, I added nomodeset, the radeon driver complained about not supporting UMS, but it booted anyways
[04:12:46] <AppleDash> I'm still getting the lovely video issue
[04:12:51] <Caerdwyn> hmm...
[04:12:51] <AppleDash> And it also spammed about the PCI device
[04:13:06] <Caerdwyn> ok, a different one then
[04:13:14] <Caerdwyn> nomodeset vga=ask
[04:13:37] <Caerdwyn> find your resolution in the list and feed it the vga code manually once, see if it can manually be set on boot, might fix it?
[04:13:48] <Caerdwyn> I know in android it has to be done that way sometimes when video breaks

[16:23:48] <Googie> Also, I feel like idly mentioning that the recent systemd discussion in here (alongside a few other things) is basically making me think heavily about switching about from Debian Sid for my laptop. Still not sure what I'll end up going with though.
[16:24:22] *** Joins: Shutter (tips@Sudoku.Prevention.Hotline)
[16:27:47] <RainbowHacks> Googie, if you like Debian, Devuan seems to be a good contender.
[16:28:19] <RainbowHacks> Obviously I personally suggest FreeBSD but if you like debian and want to stay in Linux-land, Devuan is basically Debian but patched and altered for init freedom.
[16:28:46] <RainbowHacks> Debian/kFreeBSD is also an option, though I don't know why you'd want to use the FreeBSD kernel and not the FreeBSD userland as well.... >.>
[16:29:04] <RainbowHacks> D/kFBSD is a cute project but it just seems....useless tbh.
[16:29:52] <Googie> My thoughts have basically been Gentoo, but there's a couple of things about it (well, one thing in particular) with turns me away from it. Slackware... honestly, I don't know enough about, and FreeBSD is something that I do need to experiment with at some point.
[16:30:20] <RainbowHacks> Slackware is nice if you like simplicity, and sane defaults.
[16:30:38] <RainbowHacks> Gentoo is really the only Linux left for the tweaker, Arch went SystemD and just...ugh.
[16:30:51] <RainbowHacks> but IMO FreeBSD kicks the everloving hell out of any Linux distro.
[16:30:57] <Googie> I'm finding myself more moving towards simplicity as time moves on.
[16:31:23] *** Joins: MisterSkids (ejd@Pony-fej07d.res.rr.com)
[16:31:31] <RainbowHacks> Sane defaults, simple setup, the core OS itself is developed as a singular whole in the same source tree (easier to audit if you're so inclined, easier to track the bleeding edge as well)
[16:31:45] <RainbowHacks> and of course because you're just given the core OS, you can outfit it however you want.
[16:31:55] <RainbowHacks> also ZFS is just....really really nice <3
[16:34:31] <Googie> I'm currently running btrfs on that machine as a test. Not really taking advantage of any of the more useful features that well though. Only got room for a single 250GB SSD.
[16:34:38] * RainbowHacks nods
[16:34:44] <RainbowHacks> I rock ZFS on my 55 GB SSD
[16:34:55] <RainbowHacks> the compression is REALLY nice... x3
[16:35:11] <Googie> My main fileserver is ZFS though.
[16:35:18] <RainbowHacks> SSD and decent CPU mean I don't really deal with the lag, even though I've got stuff compressed really heavily
[16:35:34] <RainbowHacks> What'll be really nice

[16:36:00] * Rylee fluffs RainbowHacks
[16:36:11] <Googie> I'm surprised that it's usable with compression. I'd basically heard that using ZFS + compression was... less than great in terms of performance.
[16:36:20] <RainbowHacks> set up a couple big HDDs in a zraid, get a nice big SSD in front as an l2ARC and slam her full of ram for the ARC
[16:36:28] <RainbowHacks> o.o

[17:24:22] <RainbowHacks> brb

[17:24:22] <AppleDash> Installed a bunch of adware and on next boot Windows wasn't working

[21:21:06] * Gladiolus drink!
[21:44:00] <Caerdwyn> I know this is gonna be a really stupid question, but what does the in-home streaming thing in Steam do? everytime I login to my laptop now, a little baloon pops up on the corner of the screen with "In Home Streaming Connected: Optiplex" (the hostname of my desktop)
[21:44:11] <Caerdwyn> what does it actually do? send videos or something from one pc to another?
[21:44:47] <Gladiolus> You can play games that are rendered on one pc from another.
[21:45:07] <Gladiolus> Kinda neat to do stuff like have a tiny computer plugged into your TV and a giant game station downstairs doing the work.
[21:45:38] <Caerdwyn> does it get decent framerates? I mean, how's that gonna survive wifi streaming an entire game?
[21:45:42] <Caerdwyn> that sounds really resource intensive
[21:46:04] <Gladiolus> it's not streaming the game just the image and sound
[21:46:11] <Caerdwyn> hmm...
[21:46:19] <Caerdwyn> how do you launch a game over the network? just open it like normal?
[21:46:28] <Caerdwyn> like, i have portal 2 on my desktop, but not my laptop
[21:46:29] <Gladiolus> it kinda is but newer video cards can do the streaming stuff fairly easily
[21:46:37] <Caerdwyn> do i just click it and it opens over the network automatically?
[21:46:48] <Gladiolus> open your laptop, open steam, ensure it's connected and if it says "stream" instead of "play", there you go
[21:46:54] <Caerdwyn> ah ok
[21:46:57] <Caerdwyn> thanks Gladiolus ^_^
[21:46:59] * Caerdwyn nuzzles
[21:47:06] <Gladiolus> I haven't used it actually, heh.
[21:47:11] * Gladiolus snugs Caerdwyn!
[21:47:18] <Caerdwyn> me either
[21:47:27] <Caerdwyn> i keep seeing it all the time, but i dont really play games in steam at all
[21:47:32] <Caerdwyn> ..i only own 3 ffs xD
[21:50:26] <init3> Is Suse something that is really commonly used at an enterprise level? Kinda seems like news to me but I might just be out of touch. '
[21:50:57] <init3> Everyone seemed to be all about RHEL in my day. 
[21:53:04] <Gladiolus> i saw suse used on a POS machine when i worked retail
[21:55:44] <init3> Honestly ever time I've seen suse used personally it was on old systems being deprecated. 
[21:57:18] <init3> But a lot of these positions I'm applying for seem to be all about the suse. 'bout that suse, no red hat. 
[22:00:47] <RainbowHacks> I'm out for now y'all, headed to the local 2600 meeting@!
[22:00:48] <RainbowHacks> o/
[22:01:00] <init3> Later
[22:01:32] <Sukasa> <Caerdwyn> does it get decent framerates? I mean, how's that gonna survive wifi streaming an entire game?
[22:01:34] <Sukasa> having done this
[22:01:37] * init3 whispers: I don't know what that is
[22:01:37] <Sukasa> it works really, really well
[22:01:41] <Sukasa> as long as nobody turns on the microwave
[22:01:58] <Sukasa> however, Steam has a bad habit of simply killing your game if the connection drops
[22:02:10] <Sukasa> My sister's burrito cost me four hours' progress in XCOM :/
[22:02:27] <Gladiolus> lel
[22:03:30] <init3> There are too many funny things about that sentence. 
[22:03:38] <Caerdwyn> Sukasa: I guess what I'm lost on is how the host machine has to take the task of not only running/rendering the game, but doing some sort of screen capture to send it over the network
[22:04:04] <Caerdwyn> I'm just thinking about all the performance issues related to that, not to mention the immense bandwidth usage with streaming something at *hopefully* 30fps or so over wifi to another machine
[22:04:44] <AppleDash> Caerdwyn: It's meant for use on machines with good specs
[22:04:47] <init3> OK, you know what. Spell check makes me question this time and time again. Is "datacenter" one word or two?
[22:05:15] <Caerdwyn> 1 word
[22:05:31] <init3> That's how I've been using it. 
[22:07:49] <init3> I swear fast internet just makes life better. I've pretty much stopped smoking too lol. I used to go for a cig all the time to wait for downloads but @70-100mbit that's become completely unnecessary.
