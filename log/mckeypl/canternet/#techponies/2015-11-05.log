[11:14:56] <Moonlightning> I'm getting nginx to return 404s, 403s, and 500s

[11:28:41] <Moonlightning> TIL you should never use `ldd` on an untrusted binary o.o
[11:28:55] <Moonlightning> ponypage says to use `objdump -p` instead

[11:36:06] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> anypony here versed in ohms law?
[11:36:27] <Moonlightning> I'd like nginx to return 403 for dotfiles that exist and 404 for those that don't, actually
[11:36:46] <Moonlightning> though I guess returning one of them all the time makes more sense for security reasons
[11:36:55] <Moonlightning> it's less…aesthetically pleasing? Iunno.

[12:59:30] <Moonlightning> I don't suppose you know anything about nginx+uwsgi+flask?
[12:59:37] <Moonlightning> I've hit a snag
[12:59:43] <Moonlightning> also I don't really know what I'm doing
[13:04:35] * Seoson is an apache2 child
[13:05:34] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: I know about it
[13:05:55] <AppleDash> Also, that's not a dangerous link, it's an AZEnv script, AKA a proxy judge, that dumps HTTP headers
[13:06:05] <AppleDash> That bot was trying to determine if your httpd was a good proxy or not
[13:09:46] <Moonlightning> That's completely invalid though
[13:09:58] <Moonlightning> /var/www/http: doesn't exist :P
[13:10:22] <Moonlightning> woulda made more sense if it'd tried CONNECT instead of GET
[13:10:40] <AppleDash> No
[13:10:53] <Moonlightning> you can't GET with a scheme and a host
[13:10:57] <AppleDash> Yes you can.
[13:11:02] <Moonlightning> really? O.o
[13:11:03] <AppleDash> That's how HTTP proxy servers work.
[13:11:15] <AppleDash> You send a GET with the URL you wish to proxy plus any headers you wish to send
[13:11:24] <AppleDash> and it returns the headers and content that the remote URL returnms
[13:11:27] <Moonlightning> …but only if the httpd is configured for that.
[13:11:27] <AppleDash> returns*
[13:11:30] <AppleDash> Sure
[13:11:32] <Moonlightning> In which case, why not just use CONNECT?
[13:11:39] <Moonlightning> that's what it's /for/, yeah?
[13:11:43] <AppleDash> No
[13:11:56] <AppleDash> CONNECT is for tunneling non-HTTP (urually HTTPS) traffic through an HTTP proxy
[13:12:06] <Seoson> Not every proxy support connect
[13:12:09] <AppleDash> most HTTP proxies either disallow CONNECT or only allow it on port 443
[13:12:11] <Seoson> supports*
[13:12:19] <Moonlightning> so is this GET with full URI sanctioned by a standard?
[13:12:48] <Seoson> Yeah asked myself as well why it would use such a weird query/path string
[13:13:13] <AppleDash> Either way, Moonlightning, what do you need help with?
[13:14:39] <Moonlightning> I'm trying to ““deploy”” a ““webapp””
[13:15:02] <Moonlightning> i.e. make requests under a certain directory call code in this Python script I wrote
[13:15:29] <AppleDash> OK?
[13:15:31] <Moonlightning> which involves nginx config that I haven't sorted out yet
[13:16:10] <AppleDash> I can give you what I use for derpy.me

[13:19:58] <Moonlightning> I didn't configure nginx right though
[13:20:04] <AppleDash> There's 2 files
[13:20:04] <AppleDash> :P
[13:20:30] <Moonlightning> oh duh
[13:21:51] <Moonlightning> yeah see
[13:22:02] <AppleDash> Using the @thing is the recommended way
[13:22:02] <Moonlightning> You're doing the `try_files $uri @foo;` thing
[13:22:11] <Moonlightning> I don't want it to try the literal file first :P
[13:22:11] <AppleDash> Although I don't have an =404 because Flask will pass a 404
[13:22:17] <AppleDash> Then remove $uri
[13:22:22] <AppleDash> And just try_files @whatever
[13:22:26] <Moonlightning> You can't try_files with just one argument; I tried that
[13:22:31] <AppleDash> Oh
[13:22:42] <AppleDash> Then just try_files @whatever =404 seems like the best option
[13:22:42] <Moonlightning> yeah
[13:22:46] <Moonlightning> … :P
[13:23:51] <AppleDash> What if you don't use an @thing at all
[13:24:00] <AppleDash> and just put the contents of the @block into location / { }
[13:24:16] <Moonlightning> …I guess I could try that, for dbugging
[13:25:00] <AppleDash> I'm surprised you haven't yet said "sockets are for /run not /tmp"
[13:25:10] <Moonlightning> They are?
[13:25:21] <Moonlightning> mine's in /var/lib 'cos I didn't want to deal with permissions and stuff in /run
[13:25:35] <Moonlightning> …oh, wait, /run isn't world-writable-sticky! o.o
[13:25:50] <Moonlightning> okay, I'll move the socket there later
[13:25:57] <AppleDash> :P
[13:26:21] <AppleDash> Mine's in /tmp because I'm the only one with access to this server, and any remote holes would be via the www-data user which would obviously be able to access that socket
[13:27:14] <Moonlightning> Well, I'm getting a different 404 page >XD
[13:27:20] <AppleDash> :D
[13:27:28] <Moonlightning> …oh! This one must be from Flask.
[13:27:30] <AppleDash> Does it look like https://derpy.me/static/404
[13:27:43] <Moonlightning> it looks really plain
[13:27:46] <Moonlightning> more plain than nginx's
[13:27:50] <AppleDash> Then it probably does look like that
[13:27:55] <Moonlightning> yes, exactly like that
[13:27:57] <AppleDash> If so, it's from Flask
[13:28:08] <AppleDash> Well, now any bugs are in the Flask app and not your nginx comf!
[13:28:10] <AppleDash> conf*
[13:28:11] <Moonlightning> todo, later: make flask return nginx error pages
[13:28:14] <AppleDash> lol
[13:28:22] <Moonlightning> Well, there's a massive hack in the nginx conf now :p
[13:28:38] <Moonlightning> my document root is going to be used as an imagebin and stuff, so
[13:28:52] * Moonlightning …sets /var/www +t
[13:29:03] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> speaking of hacks, looks like i get to cut up a wiring harness when i get home to repair a massive problem caused by the FACTORY in my '88 cherokee
[13:29:14] <Moonlightning> 6_9
[13:29:37] <Moonlightning> Yeah, and uwsgi is keeping a running log of accesses
[13:30:00] <Moonlightning> …this is completely backwards >XD
[13:30:08] <Moonlightning> anything under /file is handled directly by nginx
[13:30:13] <Moonlightning> anything else gets passed to the app
[13:30:31] <Seoson> Sadly nginx is that optimal in shared setups. Since it doesn't know the concept of .htaccess files I would need to give each user access to the server config, which I don't want to do.
[13:30:42] <Seoson> isn't* derp
[13:30:48] <Moonlightning> this ain't really shared
[13:31:01] <Seoson> In my case it is
[13:31:15] <Moonlightning> Okay, so there's one route in my app
[13:31:29] <Moonlightning> @app.route('/file/<path:file_path>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
[13:31:54] <Moonlightning> …wait, lemme just disable the `location /file {}`. For debugging.
[13:32:52] <Moonlightning> Closer! Got a 500 from Flask :D
[13:33:15] <AppleDash> lol
[13:35:26] <Moonlightning> Okay, uh
[13:35:51] <Moonlightning> oh, I think I know whu
[13:35:56] <Moonlightning> why *
[13:36:10] <Moonlightning> > render_template('file/authentication.html')
[13:36:18] <Moonlightning> that's not how you do that, Past Moonlightning
[13:37:02] <AppleDash> Is it not?
[13:37:05] <Seoson> So wait you let python deliver your "static" content? Why not do a static subdomain and gain additional performance?
[13:37:21] <Moonlightning> > static subdomain
[13:37:22] <Moonlightning> ew.
[13:37:23] <AppleDash> Seoson: because Moonlightning is me from 2 years ago
[13:37:27] <AppleDash> he doesn't believe in the modern web
[13:37:46] <Moonlightning> If you're going to do that, it should be static.www
[13:37:56] <Moonlightning> and…no I don't want to do that :P
[13:38:06] <Moonlightning> No, I'm not routing static content through Python. That's silly.
[13:38:11] <Moonlightning> This is just temporary, for science.
[13:38:13] <Moonlightning> I mean debugging.
[13:38:15] <AppleDash> Nobody sane uses www. anymore
[13:38:29] <Moonlightning> This domain handles multiple protocols.
[13:38:30] <AppleDash> It's just unnecessary URL lengthening
[13:38:33] <AppleDash> So does mine
[13:38:47] <AppleDash> Have you heard of a revolutionary new networking technology
[13:38:48] <Moonlightning> So either @ does everything, or it does nothing.
[13:38:51] <Moonlightning> I prefer the latter.
[13:38:52] <AppleDash> I think it's called "ports" or something
[13:39:05] <Moonlightning> Convince me, later.
[13:39:10] <AppleDash> will do
[13:39:35] <Seoson> There is nothing revolutionary about ports. Actually it's quite a dumb concept
[13:40:00] <Moonlightning> iiiis iiiit becauuuuuse…this is a bytes?
[13:40:13] <Moonlightning> fuck it
[13:40:19] * Moonlightning changes all the bytes back to `str`s
[13:40:59] <AppleDash> Seoson: But Moonlightning was implying that to serve multiple protocols from the same machine he needed multiple subdomains
[13:41:07] <AppleDash> So I figured that he had not been introduced to this concept
[13:41:31] <Moonlightning> That's not what I meant.
[13:41:59] <Moonlightning> It's just that blackl.net. is ambiguous.
[13:42:03] <Moonlightning> Really ambiguous.
[13:42:23] <Moonlightning> I have server subdomains and service subdomains; those are clear
[13:42:28] <Moonlightning> sugar-belle is a specific server
[13:42:31] * Seoson does create useless subdomains for different protocols himself, because he might move things to a different host at some point.
[13:42:33] <Moonlightning> irc means /any server that does IRC/
[13:42:39] <Moonlightning> what does @ mean?
[13:42:42] <Moonlightning> what do you want?
[13:42:55] <Moonlightning> How should it resolve?
[13:42:58] <AppleDash> Yes, but
[13:43:03] <AppleDash> I connect to port 80 for HTTP
[13:43:06] <AppleDash> 443 for HTTPS
[13:43:08] <Moonlightning> Before that, AppleDash!
[13:43:11] <Seoson> Also I hope SRV RRs get more common at some point
[13:43:12] <AppleDash> 6667 or 6697 for IRC or IRCS
[13:43:12] <Moonlightning> DNS doesn't know what your port is!
[13:43:17] <AppleDash> DNS doesn't need to know
[13:43:23] <Moonlightning> How should @ resolve?
[13:43:29] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> g2g, talk to everypony later :3
[13:43:31] <Moonlightning> Not all servers do all protocols.
[13:43:31] <AppleDash> It should resolve to the IP address I chose
[13:43:34] <AppleDash> See you, DJ-C0L7[EIT]
[13:43:40] *** Quits: DJ-C0L7[EIT] (IceChat77@DJ-C0L7.EIT.LLC) (Quit: "be back after a while everypony")
[13:43:47] <Moonlightning> You know what I mean.
[13:44:15] <Moonlightning> Like I said. sugar-belle is a specific server; irc is any server that does IRC; what is @?
[13:44:19] <AppleDash> I just think it's dumb to type irc.dash.sh and www.dash.sh when I know that dash.sh points to the server that hosts both of those things
[13:44:31] <AppleDash> @ is what you know it to be.
[13:44:40] <AppleDash> What if I name my server irc?
[13:44:41] <Moonlightning> So every server that does every protocol on the domain?
[13:44:46] <AppleDash> Or I invent the sugar-belle protocol?
[13:45:18] <Moonlightning> I'm maintaining the namespace so as to avoid collisions.
[13:45:24] <Moonlightning> ^3
[13:45:48] <AppleDash> That's not something that will ever happen with my personal domains
[13:46:00] <Moonlightning> What?
[13:46:26] * Moonlightning drops out of this thread until AppleDash answers the question /what should @ be?/
[13:46:33] <AppleDash> ANYTHING
[13:46:35] <AppleDash> Anything you want
[13:46:40] <AppleDash> It is user-defined
[13:46:49] <AppleDash> It could be my ircd or it could be the moon
[13:46:51] <AppleDash> it doesn't matter
[13:47:50] <Moonlightning> Well, if it's anything, then you can't use it as you're advocating.
[13:48:07] <Moonlightning> You can't connect to @:6697 because the relevant host might not run an IRCd.
[13:48:12] <Moonlightning> You should use irc:6697 instead.
[13:48:34] <AppleDash> I'm alright
[13:48:39] <AppleDash> I know that my domain points to my VPS
[13:48:43] <AppleDash> which runs an IRC daemon
[13:48:53] <Moonlightning> YES! :D
[13:48:58] <Moonlightning> VISIBLE PROGRESS~
[13:49:00] <AppleDash> So I can connect to my domain, which I know points to my VPS, which I know runs an ircd, to get to that ircd.

[13:49:19] <Moonlightning> shit, what was the password I set on this thing
[13:49:33] <Moonlightning> I've lost that terminal now lol
[13:49:37] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: you should make the thing open source
[13:49:45] <Moonlightning> I will, once it's not terrible.

[13:51:21] <Moonlightning> mmm, submitting the form results in another 500
[13:53:42] <AppleDash> username and password to download a file
[13:53:44] <AppleDash> that's one way
[13:54:07] <AppleDash> What are you using for a database?
[13:54:11] <Moonlightning> sqlite3
[13:54:20] <AppleDash> I guess it works
[13:54:26] <Moonlightning> and .$file.shadow files everywhere >XP
[13:54:34] <Moonlightning> which are actuallysqlite3 databases
[13:54:52] <Moonlightning> I need this uwsgi thing to give me tracebacks x.x
[13:55:15] <AppleDash> Why don't you use the development server?
[13:55:31] <AppleDash> if __name__ == "__main__": app.run(debug=True)
[13:55:34] <AppleDash> python2 app.py
[13:56:01] <Moonlightning> They've put me off of that :P
[13:56:08] <AppleDash> How come?
[13:58:02] <Moonlightning> UGH
[13:58:03] <Moonlightning> unrelated, but
[13:58:13] <Moonlightning> I feel so much pressure to use `str`s
[13:58:20] <Moonlightning> but…these are file paths! they're not guaranteed to be valid Unicode!
[13:59:11] <Seoson> Wait since when does Firefox view-source:http://domain.tld ?
[14:01:41] <Seoson> Changelog says since 42.0 -.-
[14:02:10] <Seoson> They should rename Firefox to Chrome Lite already
[14:03:25] <Seoson> Please tell me I can turn that off somehow
[14:04:28] <Seoson> About:config view_source.tab thanks -.-
[14:06:41] <AppleDash> Why would you want to turn that off?
[14:06:50] <AppleDash> The view source window was soooo inconvenient to me
[14:06:57] <AppleDash> I loved when I saw they added a tab
[14:08:23] <Seoson> exhibit a) Line numbers
[14:09:07] <Seoson> Wait something is buggy
[14:09:14] <AppleDash> What's wrong with the line numbers
[14:09:37] <Seoson> When it was on default there were no line numbers, now there are. What?
[14:09:48] <AppleDash> lol
[14:10:00] <Seoson> But apart from that tab pollution
[14:10:43] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: MHFD?
[14:10:54] <AppleDash> Moonlightning's Horrible File Datastore
[14:10:54] <Moonlightning> Moonlightning's HTTP File Distributor
[14:10:58] <Moonlightning> :I
[14:10:59] <AppleDash> Close enough :P
[14:11:11] <Moonlightning> remember, this is for non-tech-ponies
[14:11:16] <Seoson> Smartfox. It did view-source:view-source:http://domain.tld the first time
[14:11:18] <Moonlightning> else I would just encrypt it to them or something
[14:11:32] <Moonlightning> give them SSH access
[14:11:34] <Moonlightning> a better way
[14:11:52] <Seoson> That's why there were no line numbers nor syntax highlighting
[14:12:04] <AppleDash> lol
[14:12:17] <Moonlightning> Lite?
[14:12:20] <Moonlightning> it's not exactly light
[14:12:24] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: you're not complying with some arbitrary spec I just made up
[14:12:27] <Moonlightning> it's got tons of memory leaks
[14:12:34] <AppleDash> you're serving an html page at .txt files
[14:12:46] <Moonlightning> It's /file/$filename
[14:12:53] <AppleDash> Also, I've never seen Firefox use more than 1.5GB of RAM when running for over a month with 200 tabs
[14:12:54] <AppleDash> so yeah
[14:12:57] <Moonlightning> I'm not only going to serve files whose names end in HTML
[14:13:01] <Moonlightning> Really?
[14:13:05] <AppleDash> Really
[14:13:07] <Moonlightning> Mine's using like 2.5 gigs RIGHT NOW
[14:13:11] <Moonlightning> Watch.
[14:13:13] * Moonlightning checks.
[14:13:25] <Moonlightning> 2.16
[14:13:26] <Moonlightning> Closanuff.
[14:13:31] <AppleDash> Mine's using like 1.4
[14:13:41] <AppleDash> with similar usage except it's been open for a couple days and not a month
[14:13:52] <Moonlightning> Less than a week. Since the 31st.
[14:14:15] <Moonlightning> besides, that's ridiculous
[14:14:26] <Moonlightning> if I were to close ALL THE WINDOWS, right now, it would only drop to maybe like…2
[14:14:40] <AppleDash> All I can say is YMMV
[14:14:40] <Moonlightning> complete and utter bullshit
[14:14:52] * Moonlightning fucks AppleDash's odometer.
[14:15:03] <AppleDash> um
[14:15:05] <AppleDash> Not sure if hot
[14:15:24] <Seoson> I don't want to have 200 tabs in one browser :P
[14:16:10] <Seoson> I don't use that tab organizing thing either
[14:17:01] <AppleDash> I do
[14:17:08] <Seoson> Also Chrome rellay likes to nom all the RAM. But as long as performance is O.K. I don't care. I have plenty
[14:19:49] <Seoson> The hotkey for it is mapped to capslock, that doesn't work on my system anyway ^^
[14:20:07] <Seoson> Derp it's not
[14:20:18] <Moonlightning> I don't have plenty of RAM.
[14:20:21] <Moonlightning> I only have eight gigs
[14:20:25] <Seoson> I always confuse German key labels :P
[14:20:33] <Moonlightning> and I'd like to use it for actual things, dammit
[14:20:43] <Moonlightning> not just sitting around, allocated but unreachable
[14:21:33] <Seoson> I have 12 GiB. 2 being allocated to a RAM disk most of the time.
[14:23:16] <Seoson> I don't see any reason to install more than 16 on a regular computer without any specific use case.
[14:24:25] <Seoson> Most programs using soo much are just badly optimized (e.g. games like CoD and Batman Arkam Night)
[14:24:41] <Seoson> There are exceptions for video editing and 3d rendering
[14:25:03] <Moonlightning> >.>
[14:25:11] <Dawn> I regularly use 12 GB of ram
[14:25:17] <Dawn> without video rendering
[14:25:43] <AppleDash> I have managed 33GB with what I consider light usage
[14:25:52] * Moonlightning thinks Dawn is hotter than Dusk
[14:26:03] <Dawn> :o
[14:29:22] <AppleDash> excuse me
[14:30:51] <Moonlightning> I must be sleepdrunk o.o;
[14:31:03] <Moonlightning> I actually wouldn't feel so bad about posting the Python script behind this, right now

[14:40:03] <Moonlightning> have you nothing to say, AppleDash?
[14:40:07] <AppleDash> Not much

[14:40:22] <AppleDash> It's too early :P
[14:40:30] <AppleDash> Although I'd just use BCrypt for passwords
[14:40:32] <AppleDash> it's the standard
[14:40:50] <Moonlightning> I thought pbkdf2 was better than bcrypt
[14:42:26] <Moonlightning> what do you mean syntax error
[14:42:51] <Moonlightning> lines 82..85, apparently my SQL has a syntax error
[14:44:34] <Moonlightning> …oh, whitespace
[14:44:34] * Moonlightning facehoofs
[14:45:50] <Moonlightning> o3o !
[14:46:04] <Moonlightning> It took a couple seconds before returning 502 this time!
[14:46:07] <Moonlightning> VISIBLE PROGRESS~
[14:46:13] <Moonlightning> That means it actually hashed a password!
[14:55:29] <Moonlightning> almost there
[14:55:37] <Moonlightning> It's just choking on an enum it doesn't have a copy of
[15:06:40] <Moonlightning> YAY~
[15:06:42] <Moonlightning> No more crashing!

[15:11:32] <Moonlightning> oh, okay, I probably just did the send_from_directory() wrong
[15:12:25] <Moonlightning> YAY~! :D

[16:46:04] <Seoson> silly me
[16:46:40] <Moonlightning> Yeah. :P
[16:47:15] <Seoson> You should attach a parameter to prevent caching. In some weird situations the browser might cache the HTML file and fails to display the jpg
[16:47:57] <Seoson> A no-cache header would do as well I guess (not checked yet if present)
[16:49:06] <Moonlightning> Really, it could do that?
[16:49:23] <Moonlightning> I mean, I just serve a file in response to the POST
[16:49:33] <Moonlightning> there's no key to check against a cache…?
[16:50:00] <Seoson> There are no XSRF checks. As long as it's only a login it doesn't matter, but anything like an upload or admin panel would need checks
[16:50:11] <Moonlightning> XSRF?

[16:52:35] <Seoson> The idea is I can silently make POST requests on my site targeting https://www.blackl.net/fileadmin with the POST data job=delete, file=example.jpg, when you're logged in via cookie
[16:53:12] <Seoson> The browser will send the request as soon as you visit a page I created and the file is gone
[16:53:19] <Moonlightning> > logged in via cookie
[16:53:24] <Moonlightning> No cookies though!
[16:53:33] <Moonlightning> you POST, you get the file, that's it
[16:53:39] <Seoson> Yeah that's why I said in it current state it doesn't matter
[16:54:00] <Seoson> Only relevant for uploads and control panels
[16:54:30] <Seoson> (Basically anything that can make persistent changes)
[16:57:45] <Seoson> A HSTS header would also be helpful ;-) (It doesn't allow http by default which is nice)
[16:58:17] <Moonlightning> That's all webserver config.
[16:58:22] <Seoson> Yep
[16:58:23] <Moonlightning> And there SHOULD be an HSTS header

[18:47:33] <PinkiePieBot> [ Ben Carson's Strange Theory About The Egyptian Pyramids ]
[18:47:46] <Shutter> '"My own personal theory is that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain," Carson said, referring to the Old Testament. "Now all the archeologists think that they were made for the pharaohs’ graves. But, you know, [something to store that grain] would have to be something awfully big, if you stop and think about it."'

[20:57:59] <Seoson> Would someone with a IPv6 connection be so kind to help me out for a second?
[21:05:31] <AppleDash> Maybe
[21:05:34] <AppleDash> What do you need?
[21:06:05] <Seoson> Please be so kind to ssh to 2a01:4f8:150:5407::3 an tell me the host's fingerprint
[21:06:38] <AppleDash> no
[21:06:41] <AppleDash> my v6 is down
[21:06:44] <AppleDash> for some reason
[21:06:45] <AppleDash> sorry :P
[21:06:53] <Seoson> No problem xD
[21:07:07] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: do the thing
[21:07:32] <Seoson>  I want to make sure routing works correctly, but I'm behind a IPv4 only connection atm and cannot test from the server itself (that would be dumb)
[21:09:16] <Seoson> If erverything works the fingerprint is 92:26:c4:81:a3:ed:34:a0:14:d9:0b:7e:9c:8d:18:0f if I screwed up it's c1:9b:4e:51:5e:74:42:0d:f4:f9:97:9d:67:f4:e9:db

[21:42:19] <johnsey> still trusting those NSA curves?
[21:42:56] <Seoson> Colgate: Thank you ;-)
[21:45:25] <Seoson> It's only the fingerprint, not the key exchange
[21:47:03] <Seoson> Apart from that while I'm not a fan of anything funded by the U.S. government I imagine greater weaknesses will be public probably by the time they are exploitable with reasonable effort.

[23:21:14] <Moonlightning> …I don't suppose there's a way to forbid JavaScript on the page, given that I'm not using it?
[23:21:20] <Moonlightning> Or on the site?
[23:21:42] <Moonlightning> Or should I just learn proper XSS-avoiding things instead.
[23:21:54] <Seoson> The later xD
[23:22:38] <Seoson> You can set a frame options header
[23:22:49] <Seoson> That will at least prevent clickjacking
[23:24:39] <Seoson> Also there is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy which can highly restrict JS
[23:24:39] <PinkiePieBot> [ Content Security Policy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[23:27:15] <Seoson> Here is a better overview: http://content-security-policy.com/
[23:27:15] <PinkiePieBot> [ Content Security Policy Reference & Examples ]
[23:27:55] <JustAberrant> policy :(
[23:30:31] <johnsey> Moonlightning: put up a disclaimer that says the page is optimized for text based browsers and best viewed in lynx 2.8
[23:33:41] <Moonlightning> > content-security-policy.com.
[23:33:43] <Moonlightning> sounds legit
[23:33:48] * Moonlightning uses Wikipedia.
[23:34:16] <Seoson> Wikipedia doesn't have everything
[23:34:24] *** Quits: Pocky (Pocketguns2@Digging.a.Hole) (Quit: Stick with the Slack and you won't get whacked!)
[23:34:59] <Seoson> The site also links the source from w3c
[23:35:12] <Seoson> You can read the specs if you want
[23:35:43] <Moonlightning> > covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
[23:35:44] <Moonlightning> yes o3o
[23:35:53] <Moonlightning> CSS and images; that's it.
[23:36:04] <Moonlightning> dun need any of the rest of that :D
[23:36:13] <Seoson> CSS can contain javascript
[23:36:31] <Seoson> Just for the records
[23:36:39] <Colgate> isn't CSS turing complete?
[23:37:05] <Seoson> Preventing XSS is easy with the right framework. Just honor one simple rule: Never trust user input and always escape it.

[23:56:52] <Moonlightning> VPN might not even work, if they're intercepting /all/ TLS handshakes
[23:56:57] <Moonlightning> just don't use the network
[23:56:58] <Moonlightning> just don't even
[23:57:00] <Moonlightning> just don't
[23:57:15] <Moonlightning> don't just don't just don't
[23:57:35] <Colgate> ipsec vpn!
[23:57:49] <Moonlightning> in fact
[23:57:53] <Moonlightning> leave.
[23:58:02] <Colgate> or you could tunnel ssh over tls
[23:58:08] <Moonlightning> geezus fuck pick a different institution to give your money to
[23:58:19] <Colgate> sure, it would be mitmed, but they would just see an ssh handshack and encrypted data
[23:59:14] <Seoson> I doubt it checks all encrypted traffic - only https
[23:59:29] <Seoson> Did not look at the specs for that device though
[23:59:43] <Moonlightning> you mean by port?
[23:59:51] <Colgate> if they wanted to really lock down things, they would block other outgoing ports
[23:59:59] <Moonlightning> btu that breaks some website >.>
