[01:29:00] <Moonlightning> When even do you use those?
[01:29:09] <Not-Renny> There is a 6 pin power connector with a 2 pin connector attached to it.. They don't click together but can you use those together as an 8 pin connector or will I break something if I turn the computer on?
[01:29:21] <JustAberrant> in solaris, all the damn time, but especially when setting up a box/trying to fix things
[01:29:28] <Moonlightning> even systemrequest has a use now, with Linux' Magic Sysreq

[01:32:01] <JustAberrant> Not-Renny: assuming it's for a vid card or other pci-e aux power input

[01:32:16] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Pony-osmcfg.co.comcast.net)
[01:32:16] <JustAberrant> Not-Renny: reason they do that is to support 8 and 8 pin pci-e aux power connectors
[01:32:31] * Moonlightning holds forehooves up. "No idea."
[01:32:41] <Moonlightning> I really don't know much about hardware
[01:32:45] <JustAberrant> I thought you were talking about the mainboard connector, which is usually 4 or 8
[01:33:15] <JustAberrant> also notice how they're all shaped differently.. that's basically so even if you don't have a clue what your doing, and just randomly plug shit in, you'll probably still be fine
[01:33:40] <JustAberrant> only things you can really screw up on a modern computer are the usb, and front panel connectors
[01:33:46] <AppleDash> That is a connector for PCIe graphics cards
[01:33:48] <JustAberrant> everything else will basically only fit where it's supposed to
[01:34:14] <Not-Renny> Well, I did get the front panel part right. *shudder*
[01:34:51] <JustAberrant> in the AT days you could destroy your mobo completely by putting the power connectors in backwards
[01:35:10] <JustAberrant> you could also put IDE cables in backwards but it didn't usually do any damage
[01:35:31] * JustAberrant gets all nostalgic
[01:36:53] * HoneyDrops changes JustAberrant's jumper settings.
[01:36:53] <AppleDash> lol
[01:37:34] <Moonlightning> fucking jumpers
[01:38:12] <Moonlightning> We need less jumpers and more of those switchy things
[01:40:41] <Not-Renny> Crap

[01:41:39] <Not-Renny> The graphics card doesn't have the other kind of output D:

[01:45:29] * JustAberrant nods
[01:45:42] <JustAberrant> can't really avoid that until you're ready for the fun of making your own power cables
[01:46:18] <Not-Renny> Maybe I'll practice on Ethernet cables
[01:46:42] <JustAberrant> hehe, I still suck at that :>
[01:46:57] <JustAberrant> I've made a bunch of them but it still takes me a good like 5 mins a cable
[01:47:03] <Not-Renny> Like that one 0.001 inch cable floating around the interwebs.
[01:47:13] <Moonlightning> what
[01:47:40] <Moonlightning> That's a tiny fraction of a millimeter!
[01:47:41] <Moonlightning> wtf
[01:48:25] <Not-Renny> Well 0.001 inches long.
[01:48:43] <Moonlightning> So basically a connector, and then another connector?
[01:48:48] <JustAberrant> I don't even know how the fuck you're supposed to do cat7
[01:48:54] <Not-Renny> Yes.
[01:49:17] <Moonlightning> Since when is there a cat7? o.o
[01:49:27] <Webster> There isn't, officially.
[01:49:38] <JustAberrant> dunno if it's official yet
[01:49:47] <JustAberrant> but basically they were like.. "so about that whole unshielded part..
[01:49:54] <Webster> Heh.
[01:49:59] <Colgate> JustAberrant: waaaaaaaat
[01:50:04] <Colgate> not even a cmos clear jumper?
[01:50:24] <JustAberrant> to be honest no... I don't tend to go insane with the OC
[01:50:30] <Colgate> ah, ok
[01:51:38] <JustAberrant> but yeah, I've done shielded cables before.. but cat7 is like.. we shield the cable then we shield the pairs yo!
[01:52:12] <JustAberrant> every cable making kit is gonna require a package of bandaids and tweezers to pluck bits of wire out of your flesh
[01:52:41] <JustAberrant> https://shop.bechtle.co.uk/medias/5rY3f4L6nrc477NMkJYV58-30.jpg
[01:55:18] <Moonlightning> ...and you make this stuff by HOOF?
[01:55:57] <JustAberrant> I probably won't be, but I'm sure somepony will ;p
[01:56:36] <JustAberrant> I can't even imagine how much of a pain in the ass that would be
[01:57:08] <Webster> We have F/UTP work, but that's about it.
[01:57:30] <Webster> To get good quality Cat7/8 terminations I'd just buy a cable at that point.
[01:57:37] <Webster> Or say feck it and use fiber.
[01:57:54] <JustAberrant> and then when you're all done, and blood flows freely down your arm, you squint through your open eye (the one without the metal filing in it) at the network tester as it tells you there's an error
[01:58:08] <JustAberrant> and that's when you turn to drugs :>
[01:58:22] <Moonlightning> How is this not automated by now?
[01:58:33] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: what, terminating cables?
[01:58:44] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: it is, but the machine to do it costs a fuck tonne of money
[01:59:41] <JustAberrant> but yeah, I'm almost at that point with cat6 ;p
[01:59:49] <JustAberrant> that damn plastic splitter
[02:01:40] <Lapsus> Not-Renny: nice job on the cables, looks pretty good
[02:01:44] <Not-Renny> >_> why the poop would you need a cable like that??
[02:01:57] <Lapsus> I want to do custom length ones eventually, but I don't know how the fuck to make custom sata cables

[02:02:09] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: hehe, that's where I'm at
[02:02:22] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: I make my own power cables, which is easy
[02:02:29] <JustAberrant> but haven't attempted sata cables
[02:02:41] <Lapsus> I need a molex crimper eventually
[02:03:04] <JustAberrant> I have a pin remover/etc, but honestly if you don't care about looks you can just cut and splice
[02:03:16] <Lapsus> it's all about looks
[02:03:17] <Lapsus> lol
[02:03:27] <Lapsus> that and I want to make some proper cables for my printer
[02:03:30] <JustAberrant> for sata power connectors you can by the terminators ultra cheap and you literally just clamp them onto the cable
[02:04:04] <JustAberrant> Lapsus: for me I like not having a bunch of excess cable that has to be bundled and tucked away
[02:04:13] <Lapsus> I can't find my 0mm network cable to take a picture :c
[02:04:19] <Moonlightning> So, what, is cat7 faster?
[02:04:53] <Webster> Supports 40Gbps speeds.
[02:05:02] <Webster> 10Gbps for full runs, 40 for short.
[02:05:19] <Webster> Cat6A has technically replaced Cat7 as Cat7 was meant for 10GbE.
[02:05:41] <Webster> Cat8's the next one, for 40Gb and supposedly 100Gb.
[02:05:52] <JustAberrant> lol, I just went to the wiki page, the image they have their is even more horrifying

[04:50:13] <locodash11[server]> the 250 isn't terrible, it should be able to play a lot of games reasonably at medium settings at least, as long as the cpu is decent
[04:51:34] <AppleDash> GTX 250
[04:53:04] <locodash11[server]> that wouldn't be too good, r7 250
[04:54:03] <locodash11[server]> I had a 265 for a while, it played a lot of games on max, or close to it

[05:01:03] <Moonlightning> So, currently I'm just naming the snapshots after the time they're taken, in UTC
[05:01:12] <Moonlightning> %F--%T
[05:01:57] <Moonlightning> It shouldn't be possible for any snapshot taken /later/ than another to end up with a name lexicographically /earlier/, right!
[05:02:02] <Moonlightning> s/!/?/
[05:02:05] <HyperDash> the r7 250 is supposed to play reasonable frame rates at medium... after all, I can play quite a few games on my radeon HD card with 256 mb (that's all I know about it, I can't find anymore)
[05:02:53] <HyperDash> I don't really care beyond that. I'ma get a 980ti when I can afford an HTC vive alongside it anyway. hopefully in a year
[05:04:00] <locodash11[server]> make sure you have a good cpu by then as well, getting something like an amd octocore will slow down a bunch of games
[05:05:02] <HyperDash> intel 4770k is planned, 4790k if my budget jumps another $100
[05:05:18] <HyperDash> they have the same socket, so either way works at this point
[05:05:26] <locodash11[server]> the 4790k was cheaper where I am
[05:05:35] <HyperDash> wher you am?
[05:05:48] <locodash11[server]> just in the us, idk
[05:06:00] <HyperDash> ...
[05:06:03] <locodash11[server]> it was $30 cheaper than a 4770k
[05:06:18] <HyperDash> link?
[05:06:39] <locodash11[server]> look for it on amazon or newegg
[05:06:55] <locodash11[server]> they were close or the same most times I looked
[05:07:12] <locodash11[server]> like $330, sometimes lower
[05:08:13] <mniip> Colgate, you around?
[05:08:40] <mniip> oh, nevermind
[05:08:48] <Colgate> ?
[05:08:58] <HyperDash> I think you have the wrong processor, they're both i7s, the 4770k is just older
[05:09:13] <HyperDash> same cache, hyper threading etc. just slower clock speed
[05:09:39] <mniip> I was wondering how to tell a ~#channel statusmsg from a normal ~channel message but apparently CHANTYPES=#~ is an illusion coming from ZNC partyline
[05:10:47] <locodash11[server]> yeah, they're pretty much the same, I think the 4790k overlocks better as well, it does 4.7ghz fine with a barely raised voltage
[05:11:37] <locodash11[server]> but when I looked though, the 4770k was always more expensive
[05:14:04] <locodash11[server]> oh, about $30 cheaper now
[05:14:25] <HyperDash> used on amazon foe $225USD
[05:14:47] <locodash11[server]> oh, I don't exactly like the idea of used cpus for some reason
[05:15:04] <locodash11[server]> I think gpus are pretty much fine, but maybe not cpus

[07:07:40] <Moonlightning> As far as I can tell, it prevents them altogether o.o

[07:11:06] <Moonlightning> The signature sent by the client includes the session identifier. If the attacker negotiates a different session ID with the client and server, the ID the server has won't match the ID the client signed, and authentication will fail.

[07:13:43] <Moonlightning> (The attacker can't intercept the signature and produce a different one for lack of the client's private key. The only other thing it could do would be to pass the ID negotiation messages through unchanged, which would prevent it from reading or tampering with further messages.)

[16:22:51] <mniip> you can't

[22:16:58] <Gladiolus> it’s 2016
[22:17:29] <JustAberrant> pff, SSDs are for posers, buy ram and boot over nfs ;p
[22:17:57] <Gladiolus> and what’s that NFS stored on, hmm?
[22:18:12] <JustAberrant> spinning disks hopefully ;p
[22:18:18] <Gladiolus> boot from NFS II: SE
[22:18:33] <Gladiolus> Don’t forget to install the Glide drivers so you can use your Voodoo 2!
[22:18:46] <JustAberrant> :>
[22:18:54] <HoneyDrops> I will never use a spinning drive in a laptop again.  I'd be fine with them in a desktop or server.
[22:19:12] <JustAberrant> hehe, yeah
[22:19:41] * JustAberrant uses SSDs in anything that isn't running in my basement where it can be as loud as it wants
[22:19:44] <Gladiolus> I bought a 2TB external with my macbook in 2013 and it was my only computer until I got a haswell desktop.
[22:19:55] <Gladiolus> That has a 120gb SSD and the same external plugged into USB3
[22:20:07] <Gladiolus> That damn external drive is faster than any sata drive I ever had lol
[22:20:15] <JustAberrant> I have been seriously considering trying to do a diskless desktop though
[22:20:25] <Gladiolus> DUMB TERMINALS ARE BAAAAAACK
[22:20:26] <JustAberrant> the media pc I'm planning is definitely gonna be diskless
[22:20:54] <Colgate> I want to go to that kind of system at work
[22:21:00] <Colgate> would be so much easier to manage
[22:21:04] <JustAberrant> doesn't have to be a dumb terminal, ram is so cheap you can easily load up a decent image into ram .. and most of my media/actual files and such are on my file server anyway..

[23:51:29] <Shutter> Yes
[23:51:47] <mniip> Shutter, what about that scram patch
[23:52:32] <Shutter> Pretty busy IRL at the moment, so haven't felt like doing anything with it yet. Sorry.
[23:53:12] <Shutter> Haven't even gotten around to putting the last touches on the anope patch z.z
[23:53:31] <Shutter> And right now I'm drunk, so definitely not doing anything right this moment :P
[23:54:10] <mniip> [01:53:56] <TingPing> k, this week would have been the best time to get it merged, so i guess it will hold off until next release :P
[23:55:11] <Shutter> Sounds good
