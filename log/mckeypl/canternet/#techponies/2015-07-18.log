[00:41:54] <Minccino> I'm really confused on what \r does
[00:42:48] <Seoson> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return
[00:42:49] <PinkiePieBot> [ Carriage return - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[00:43:16] <Minccino> Is it an ms word thing?
[00:43:27] <Seoson> No.
[00:43:58] <Seoson> It's a general computer thing. It's on all OSs I think
[00:44:51] <Seoson> Imagine it as the "printer head" returning to the start of the line once a line in the document is finished
[00:45:42] <Seoson> In a console application to enter a new line you would have to print \r\n
[00:46:17] <Seoson> \r resets the cursor position and \n "scrolls" one line down.
[00:46:51] <Minccino> So \r does the thing where it last new lined/
[00:46:53] <Minccino> *?
[00:47:27] <Seoson> I don't understand what you mean by that
[00:48:16] <Minccino> Like say Hello \r\tWorld
[00:48:47] <Minccino> Then it wouldn't be Hello   World
[00:49:28] <Minccino> It would do nothing because \r just pulled \t's ass back to near o
[00:56:48] <Seoson> Actually that should output "Hello \tWorld"
[00:57:50] <Seoson> More interesting is 'Hello \rWorld' which would output 'World"
[00:59:19] <Seoson> You can test that in a terminal if you are on linux with echo -e "STRING"

[05:00:03] <Moonlightning> I just realized
[05:00:26] <Moonlightning> Homestuck's ~ATH could be rewritten to be more similar to Mozilla's Rust
[05:00:44] <Moonlightning> that would work /perfectly/, because of Rust's concepts of lifetimes
[05:01:01] <Moonlightning> it would also make ~ATH even more frustrating to use :p
[05:04:19] <Moonlightning> the syntax is really weird though
[05:04:38] <Moonlightning> I feel like `~ath`, `execute`, and `die` should be /keywords/
[05:05:26] <Moonlightning> `die` could be dropped in favor of just using scopes, killing things as they go out of scope (like Rust)
