[00:11:22] <Moonlightning> `purge` doesn't actually help with anything. It just drops disk cache.

[04:15:32] <Moonlightning> Okay, so I'll just give this a low-energy cursory skim, and point out at most two big things wrong with it.
[04:16:12] <tiwake> the headline is horribly written... lol..
[04:16:18] <Moonlightning> Oh, so this is about deprecating SHA1.
[04:16:34] <Moonlightning> Or, dropping support for *
[04:16:40] <Moonlightning> How long has it been deprecated for? At least a year, right?
[04:16:52] <Moonlightning> If you still don't support SHA2, then fuck off. We're leaving you behind.
[04:17:25] <tiwake> Moonlightning: its just a really badly written headline
[04:17:46] <Moonlightning> Clickbait headline. SOP for buzzfeed
[04:18:08] <Colgate> sha-1 is insecure
[04:18:17] <Colgate> for certs at least
[04:19:05] <Sakura> It may affect not just phones but probably OSes with browsers that don't even support SHA2. I can only think of the latest versions of maybe Mozilla & even Netscape compatible with Windows 9x & Mac OS Classic that could have support but I doubt it.
[04:19:10] <Moonlightning> You mean for cryptographically-strong integrity checks, yeah?
[04:19:16] <Colgate> XP, whoo!
[04:19:30] <Moonlightning> Sakura: If you're still using Netscape, fuck off.
[04:19:35] <Colgate> pretty sure XP only does sha1
[04:19:42] <Moonlightning> Ditto for Mac OS <10 and Windows XP
[04:19:43] <Sakura> Chrome & Firefox, mate.

[04:20:14] <Moonlightning> like I said, fuck off
[04:20:34] <Moonlightning> Not gonna let people clinging to obsolete software hold us back
[04:21:20] <Colgate> it was claimed that a sha-1 cert could be broken with 100k$ or so of compute power?
[04:21:24] <Colgate> iirc
[04:21:40] <Moonlightning> Broken as in…?
[04:21:44] <Moonlightning> Forged?
[04:21:45] <wolfyshy> I wonder if anyone's even realised that SHA-1 *certificates* have not yet been broken, and using SHA-256 is literally just an abundance of caution; and that even on windows 95 and Mac OS 8.6, you /can/ get SHA-256 compatible browsers
[04:21:51] <wolfyshy> though most period hardware won't be happy with it
[04:21:55] <Colgate> as in a hash collision
[04:22:09] <Moonlightning> collision, or preimage?
[04:22:15] <Colgate> collision
[04:22:28] <Moonlightning> wolfyshy: I like abundances of caution. :P
[04:22:29] <mniip> collision with an arbitrary prefix?
[04:22:38] <wolfyshy> it was 300k$, and that was a napkin calculation in a comment on schneier blog article
[04:22:50] <Colgate> wolfyshy: yeah, that's what I'm referring to
[04:22:56] <Colgate> 300k$ is nothing
[04:23:26] <wolfyshy> later comments realised that guy based his calculation on bitcoin mining which uses SHA-256
[04:23:32] <wolfyshy> have fun with that.
[04:23:35] <Colgate> and even if their napkin math was wrong by a factor of 10... 3m$ is nothing
[04:23:40] <Moonlightning> …what?
[04:23:51] <Moonlightning> How'd we get into mining?
[04:24:05] <Colgate> Moonlightning: they used btc asics to estimate the cost of sha1
[04:24:05] <wolfyshy> that was the method the guy used to figure out "it would take 300k$ to break an SHA-1 certificate"
[04:24:14] <wolfyshy> which is wrong on so many levels
[04:24:18] <Colgate> of course, sha1 asics probably exist
[04:24:27] <Colgate> and are probably used to crack sha1 hashes :P
[04:24:28] <wolfyshy> but are more expensive *and* take longer.
[04:24:48] <Moonlightning> Than SHA256? O.o
[04:24:49] <wolfyshy> yeah the best part about this is SHA-256, due to BTC, is actually *easier* to collide.
[04:24:55] <wolfyshy> have fun! :D
[04:24:56] <Moonlightning> Wat.
[04:25:04] <Colgate> Moonlightning: more demand for sha-256 asics due to demand, so more production
[04:25:09] <mniip> or is it
[04:25:13] <Moonlightning> Ahh.
[04:25:18] <mniip> sha256 asics aren't actually sha256
[04:25:27] <Colgate> wolfyshy: I doubt that

[04:35:42] <Colgate> Jeremy Rowley, digicert CA rep
[04:37:44] <wolfyshy> Colgate: looking at the code itself, it does a pretty interesting - and horribly naive - way of determining it
[04:37:59] <wolfyshy> Colgate: if the cipher suite used is "old", it sends the SHA-1 certificate, if it has one.
[04:38:34] <wolfyshy> it's naive because those ciphers are sometimes used by TLS 1.2, in certain contexts and situations

[04:40:32] <wolfyshy> the best you could do is downgrade to the SHA-1 certificate, which as I said, everyone is massively jumping the gun on this
[04:40:50] <wolfyshy> anyone who has 3m$ to throw at colliding sha1 can throw 4m$ at colliding sha2.

[07:26:31] <Moonlightning> I was all digging down into it, and I found /two/ separate lava lakes
[07:27:00] <Moonlightning> accidentally spilled a lot of lava down my staircase, too. Spent way too much time trying to put it back out.

[21:31:16] <Unixkitty> I could be wrong though

[21:32:26] <locodash11[server]> I dunno about that, but it depends on what version you get

[21:34:38] <locodash11[server]> and I don't think multicore render existed back then either
[21:34:41] <HoneyDrops> Forge doesn't care iirc, some launchers don't support offline-mode.  And most servers don't suppoer offline-mode.
[21:35:01] <Unixkitty> The latter did, and it was even more of a mess
[21:35:06] <Unixkitty> Chisel didn't
[21:35:30] <Unixkitty> You would see world holes much more frequently
[21:35:32] <locodash11[server]> but if you make your own private-ish server, offline mode is easy to enable
[21:35:38] * HoneyDrops always plays vanilla textures and no shaders.  Aside from that is what my integrated graphics handles best, anything else doesn't look like MC to me.
[21:36:13] <Unixkitty> Even without shaders and vanilla textures some stuff messes up with this rendering unfortunately
[21:36:18] <locodash11[server]> I don't really know if any fun packs anymore actually
[21:36:27] <locodash11[server]> dunno what to even do with minecraft
[21:37:27] <locodash11[server]> and glitching is a normal part of any minecraft version as far as I know, mods or not
[21:38:29] <Unixkitty> Hooray lazy coding
[21:38:38] <HoneyDrops> In 1.7 it's easy enough to throw together your own pack.
[21:39:18] <Unixkitty> The hardest part would be browsing and picking mods
[21:39:28] <locodash11[server]> but servers are much less easy in that version
[21:39:35] <Unixkitty> Why?
[21:39:41] <AppleDash> I love Minecraft's world renderer
[21:39:46] <Unixkitty> They're practically the same to setup as the client
[21:39:53] <locodash11[server]> no bukkit I thought?
[21:39:54] <AppleDash> By the time you're rendering a block you're in at least 20, maybe 30 nested for loops
[21:40:03] <Unixkitty> Bukkit is still a thing?
[21:40:06] <Moonlightning> Whoa!
[21:40:13] <locodash11[server]> I'd prefer it
[21:40:24] <Moonlightning> Unixkitty: that looks like claymation o.o

[21:47:12] <locodash11[server]> well, and it made servers generally run better
[21:47:35] <locodash11[server]> less cpu usage, or at least spread over more than one core
[21:48:14] <Unixkitty> It only worked well enough for either vanilla or servers with 10+~ people
[21:48:41] <locodash11[server]> or mod intensive servers
[21:48:58] <HoneyDrops> I think there are some forge mods that do some optimization/performance patching.
[21:49:17] <Unixkitty> I don't know, I used to run a 20~ people Forge server with 200~ mods for over a year, and never even considered bukkit
[21:49:22] <locodash11[server]> allowed my tekkit lite server to run for months longer after being bogged dowb by IC stuff with the more vanilla server
[21:49:27] <Unixkitty> Like fastcraft, HoneyDrops 
[21:49:55] <locodash11[server]> I guess the newer servers are designed better anyhow
[21:50:08] <locodash11[server]> bukkit for me was kinda to make them less crap
[21:51:45] <locodash11[server]> but even with bukkit and a better cpu than before, my lite server is still overloaded, and isn't worth using anymore

[21:53:59] <locodash11[server]> idk, someeone here make a good modpack, and I'd like to try playing it
[21:55:01] <HoneyDrops> Last spring I was working on a skyblock pack, but kinda lost interest in it.  The pain of keeping mods updated got to be too tedious.
[21:55:14] * HoneyDrops wants a package manager for MC mods.
[21:55:31] <Unixkitty> locodash11[server], FTB Infinity
[21:56:28] <locodash11[server]> I think I'm a actually running a server for that right now, but never got on because it always ran like crap for the people I wanted to play with
[21:56:55] * Lapsus whinnies
[21:57:01] <locodash11[server]> well, an I tried it last year on my laptop, and 8gb of ram wasn't enough
[21:57:25] <Lapsus> All you horses making me want to play minecraft again
[21:57:33] <AppleDash> I was running the server and the client for that on my desktop
[21:57:38] <AppleDash> RAM used: 33GB
[21:57:40] <Unixkitty> How so? It hardly uses more than 2700 with 3k allocated
[21:58:20] <locodash11[server]> I set 5gb, it used 7.5
[21:58:36] <locodash11[server]> computer flipped out, and it needed force ended
[21:58:47] <Unixkitty> Don't ever give jvm more RAM than it needs to
[21:58:54] <Unixkitty> It's going to eat ALL of it
[21:59:25] <locodash11[server]> I gave my test technic packs 12gb, they never used more than 4.5 on extreme render
[21:59:58] <Unixkitty> The more you give it, the more it uses, garbabe collection is the way to go
[22:00:03] <locodash11[server]> and ftbacks take forever to load as well, which is kind of annying
[22:00:11] <locodash11[server]> *ftb packs
[22:00:13] <Unixkitty> Because they have many mods
[22:00:55] <locodash11[server]> but the technic ones I've used have had nearly the same ammount with less than 1/4th the load time
[22:01:20] <Unixkitty> I've never used technic, so can't really say anything on that
[22:01:49] <HoneyDrops> They load up about the same speed in MultiMC (which is the only launcher you should ever be using).
[22:02:09] <Unixkitty> MultiMC <3
[22:02:35] <HoneyDrops> Both the FTB and Technic launchers are awful, if for no other reason than not using a proper toolkit for the UI.
[22:03:30] <locodash11[server]> never heard of multimc
[22:03:40] <Unixkitty> https://multimc.org/
[22:03:46] <Unixkitty> It's always been the best launcher ever

[22:03:57] <Unixkitty> Profile management was born there first
[22:04:28] <locodash11[server]> I've also never tried making my own pack, or even really played at all in months
[22:04:48] <HoneyDrops> It's by far the best, easy to duplicate instances, lets you import instances from other launchers (makes it easy to install multiple versions of a pack concurrently, unlike the FTB launcher)
[22:05:44] <HoneyDrops> You'll still need the FTB launcher to install a pack, but you can just use the pack from MultiMC and reap the benefits.
[22:05:48] <Unixkitty> Well the FTB launcher is supposed to be like "proprietary" and more of a distribution platform for packs, so lazy people can play with mods as well
[22:06:02] <Unixkitty> One click install and all that stuff
[22:06:28] <locodash11[server]> ftb stuff has just always seemed to run badly for me
[22:06:39] <locodash11[server]> I'll try that thing then
[22:07:10] <HoneyDrops> MC always runs badly, the question is always just /how badly/ it runs.
[22:07:11] <locodash11[server]> but I'm not sure it'd help with my technic stuff, as they load in a few seconds at most
[22:07:22] <locodash11[server]> heh
[22:07:36] <locodash11[server]> it runs much better with a high end cpu though
[22:07:41] <Unixkitty> They don't really use anything exclusive besides a few tweaks in their modpacks, I don't know why their performance would be any different from any other packs

[22:10:01] <locodash11[server]> I tried it, but didn't have much a way to test, as any settings were super vague,
[22:10:26] <locodash11[server]> that's what I thought
[22:10:49] <Sour_Sweet> The Win10 MC version is a piece of crap, don't bother :P
[22:11:03] <Unixkitty> What is the point of it anyway?
[22:11:09] <HoneyDrops> I still wish they'd just turn it into a game engine, as that is all MC is good for.  Vanilla is like the demo game to show the engine off.
[22:11:34] <Sour_Sweet> The only amazing thing is that it runs much smoother than the java version
[22:11:55] <Unixkitty> HoneyDrops, not the console version, but pocket edition rather
[22:12:15] <Unixkitty> Of course it does, because C++ and not java
[22:12:21] <HoneyDrops> I think that only tells us that badly coded C++ runs better than badly coded Java.
