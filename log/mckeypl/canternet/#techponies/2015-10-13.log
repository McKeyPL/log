[04:17:51] <Moonlightning> Parrhesia: Inductive reasoning works well on nature. It tends to break down very quickly when applied to sapient creatures.
[04:17:52] <Parrhesia> how did you interpret it?
[04:18:14] <JustAberrant> the problem is, on the whole, I don't think it breaks down
[04:18:32] <JustAberrant> it's just we've decided it's an unethical thing to do
[04:18:53] <JustAberrant> especially when applied in aggregate and on larger sets
[04:18:56] <Moonlightning> It /is/ unethical. It's unfair.
[04:19:10] <JustAberrant> sure, but doesn't mean it's not effective
[04:19:17] <Parrhesia> what did you think I meant by "we can criticize or ridicule our own culture but not those of others?"
[04:19:24] <JustAberrant> on an individual basis it's usually pointless, but on large sets of people I think it works
[04:19:24] <Moonlightning> It wouldn't be fair to e.g. lock me up because I'm black, because statistically black people are more likely to commit crimes.
[04:19:37] <Parrhesia> it's not unethical, it's being rational and applying probability and inductive reasoning.
[04:19:37] <Moonlightning> Or to take any kind of punitive measure against me until I /actually/ committed a crime.
[04:19:55] <JustAberrant> that's not to say I'm advocating it, just saying that ethical and effectiveness don't necessarily correlate
[04:19:56] <Moonlightning> Parrhesia: that kind of rational thinking //doesn't work// on people.
[04:20:06] <Moonlightning> It doesn't work so often that you should //stop trying to do it.//

[04:23:08] <Moonlightning> Why do you have to apply race and appearance?
[04:23:21] <Parrhesia> If I seen an asian kid studying in the library next to a hispanic kid, I'm going to ask the asian kid for help on my math homework, and the hispanic for help in my spanish class
[04:24:06] <JustAberrant> ok, here's a very salty example: hiring programmers educated in india
[04:24:09] <Moonlightning> Again, why? Why not just see two fellow students and ask them collectively if they could help with your math and Spanish homework?
[04:24:27] <Parrhesia> why treat everyone the as if they're identical when there's clearly actual discrepancies among the so called "races"?
[04:24:44] <Moonlightning> Because it's going to fail so often!
[04:24:50] <Parrhesia> to do so is to ignore probability and statistics for the sake of being sensitive.
[04:25:00] <Moonlightning> It's not very unlikely that your Hispanic kid moved to America at a very young age and never really learned Spanish.
[04:25:14] <Moonlightning> That sounds like a good reason to me.
[04:25:23] <Parrhesia> he's going to be more likely than the asian to know spanish.
[04:25:30] <Moonlightning> Statistically, yes.
[04:25:36] <Moonlightning> But, again, this is not the place to apply statistics!
[04:25:36] <Parrhesia> there you go
[04:25:45] <Parrhesia> that's all I'm saying. Statistically.
[04:25:46] <Moonlightning> [19:19:24] < Moonlightning> It wouldn't be fair to e.g. lock me up because I'm black, because statistically black people are more likely to commit crimes.
[04:25:53] <Parrhesia> did I say to do that?
[04:26:02] <Moonlightning> Slightly extreme example. Same principle.
[04:26:02] <Parrhesia> no, you must balance the action with the statistics.
[04:26:06] <Moonlightning> Why not do that?
[04:26:10] <Moonlightning> Hey, STATISTICS!
[04:26:14] <Moonlightning> The statistics will totally back you up!
[04:26:22] <Parrhesia> because asking someone for HW help is a LOT less serious than locking someone up
[04:26:37] <Parrhesia> and hence requires A LOT less probability to make a decision
[04:27:04] <Moonlightning> Sigh. Touché.
[04:27:06] <Parrhesia> that's the reason for misdemeanors, the standard of proof is that guilt is more likely than not, whereas for murder cases, it's beyond a reasonable doubt.
[04:27:09] <Moonlightning> Still, my point stands.
[04:27:26] <Moonlightning> …that's not really true, is it? :/
[04:27:39] <JustAberrant> your arguing ethics not effectiveness though
[04:27:41] <Parrhesia> what isn't true?
[04:27:44] <Moonlightning> You can't be charged with a misdemeanor even if not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?
[04:27:59] <Parrhesia> you totally can. it's a "preponderance of evidence"
[04:28:29] <Parrhesia> the more serious the charge, the more proof is required.

[04:28:56] <Parrhesia> A requirement that more then 50% of the evidence points to something.  This is the burden of proof in a civil trial.
[04:28:56] <Parrhesia> For example: At the end of civil case A v. B, 51% of the evidence favors A.  Thus, A has a preponderance of the evidence, A has met their burden of proof, and A will win the case.

[04:36:26] <Moonlightning> Once again, your statistics don't always work. Even the age groups that are arguably less bad.

[04:38:04] <Moonlightning> There's a reason child soldiers are so effective…
[04:38:33] <Parrhesia> if 100% of Group A are terrorists, 100% of the people checked should be Group A
[04:38:51] <Parrhesia> If 0% of group A are terrorists, 0% of people checked should be of A
[04:39:16] <Parrhesia> *if 100% of terrorists are group A, excuse me
[04:39:17] <Moonlightning> Good thing everyone walks around with completely accurate terrorist and not-terrorist group labels!
[04:39:30] <Moonlightning> …seriously?
[04:39:41] <Moonlightning> I'm pretty sure that's a literal logical fallacy.
[04:40:17] <Parrhesia> if X% of terrorists are group A, X% of the people you check should be A.
[04:41:23] <Parrhesia> Moonlightning, what is your solution? Check everything equally? look at that squirrel, he might be a criminal! Look at that trash can, he might a terrorist!
[04:41:56] <Moonlightning> -.-
[04:41:58] <Parrhesia> By limiting your scope to just humans, that I don't think anybody will argue against, you are already discriminating!
[04:42:40] <Moonlightning> You're discriminating sapient beings from non-sapient beings and inanimate objects, yes.
[04:42:40] <Parrhesia> if there's a sudden uptick of crimes committed by children, adjust your filters accordingly.
[04:42:46] <JustAberrant> species racist :(
[04:42:48] <Moonlightning> I have no objection to that. ^3
[04:43:05] <Parrhesia> Moonlightning, so why not discriminate among each subclass?
[04:43:14] * Moonlightning facehoofs so hard.
[04:43:19] <Parrhesia> why stoop at just "sapience/non-sapience"?
[04:43:29] <Parrhesia> Because it doesn't ALWAYS work?
[04:43:33] <Moonlightning> Now you're just being obtuse.
[04:43:56] <Parrhesia> how have I mischaracterized your argument against using stats?
[04:44:04] <Moonlightning> False dichotomy.
[04:44:09] <Parrhesia> explain
[04:44:29] <Moonlightning> You seem to be saying either all kinds of [literal|mathematical] discrimination are okay, or none of them are.
[04:44:38] <Moonlightning> Your argument is that because we do one kind of [literal] discrimination, we should do more.
[04:45:52] <Parrhesia> what do you think I mean by "discrimination"?
[04:46:37] <Moonlightning> [19:41:58] < Parrhesia> By limiting your scope to just humans, that I don't think anybody will argue against, you are already discriminating!
[04:46:46] <Moonlightning> In this line, you use /discrimination/ as in /literal discrimination/
[04:46:56] <Moonlightning> That is to say, the act of distinguishing one thing or category from another.
[04:47:12] <Parrhesia> you realize categories are all made up right?
[04:47:14] <Moonlightning> Any kinds of things or categories—anything from living vs nonliving to races.
[04:47:24] <Moonlightning> Yes, I do.
[04:47:25] <Parrhesia> just like races, another category
[04:47:33] <Moonlightning> Categories are often useful.
[04:47:36] <Parrhesia> or religion, another category
[04:48:12] <Moonlightning> For example, when deciding what to search, you can first group all entities into sapient and nonsapient (including inanimate objects like your trash cans).
[04:48:55] <Moonlightning> The latter can be ignored for searching (or rather, subject to different kinds of searches—luggage goes through X-ray machines.)
[04:49:52] <Moonlightning> In software package repositories, packages can be grouped into—you guessed it—categories!
[04:50:04] <Moonlightning> If I'm looking for an editor to install, I can just look in app-editors/ and ignore everything else.
[04:50:08] <Parrhesia> depends on the thing you're searching for. Let's say you're looking for car thieves. Well then you can ignore any non-human thing.
[04:50:15] <Moonlightning> Exactly.
[04:50:20] <Moonlightning> This is an acceptable kind of discrimination.
[04:50:25] <Parrhesia> why though?
[04:50:40] <Parrhesia> Because of statistics. B/c no car has ever been stolen by a non human.
[04:50:53] <Moonlightning> I disagree.
[04:51:14] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i've seen a rat terrior run a car through the front of a pizzaria by a friend of mines place
[04:51:15] <Parrhesia> oh god, here you go with your fringe examples
[04:51:43] <Parrhesia> so then if you search a million things, 1 of them should be a rat terrier at most then.
[04:52:47] <Moonlightning> It is an acceptable kind of discrimination simply because it does not meet the criteria of unacceptable discriminations (e.g. it does not involve stereotyping people).
[04:53:22] <Parrhesia> that seems circular
[04:53:39] <Parrhesia> It's acceptable b/c it's not not acceptable
[04:53:39] <Moonlightning> At first, perhaps; but it does terminate.
[04:54:09] <Moonlightning> And I've provided a (partial) set of criteria for determining when things are not acceptable.
[04:54:12] <Moonlightning> There's your terminus.
[04:54:19] <Parrhesia> and why, is it unacceptable to apply statistics to people, that is to stereotype?
[04:54:40] <Moonlightning> Because, again, it often does not work.
[04:54:52] <Moonlightning> And doing so will inevitably lead to things like profiling at airports.
[04:55:09] <Parrhesia> security checks often do not work. let's not do ANY of them!
[04:55:10] <Moonlightning> And acts that are tantamount to harrassment on the basis of appearance.
[04:55:23] <Parrhesia> Medication often does not work, let's not take any medicines!
[04:55:32] <Parrhesia> Doctors are often wrong, screw em!
[04:55:34] <Moonlightning> I'll admit that my articulation was crude.
[04:55:46] <Parrhesia> Moonlightning, you're letting the best be the enemy of the good
[04:56:00] <Parrhesia> you're demanding a perfect solution and dismissing any imperfect but good ones
[04:56:09] <Moonlightning> What have you to say to the rest of what I just said?
[04:56:13] <Parrhesia> so let me ask you, in lieu of profiling, what is YOUR solution, and is it perfect?
[04:56:42] <Moonlightning> Parrhesia, you are at this point deliberately ignoring part of my arguments.
[04:56:43] <Parrhesia> I say people need to get over themselves and understand that it is a rational thing to do. Get over their sense of fawned outrage.
[04:56:58] <Parrhesia> it may be nasty, but it's a necessary evil imo.
[04:57:47] <Parrhesia> until technology improves such that you can check everyone at an airport and maintain functionality, what other option is there?
[04:58:00] <Parrhesia> there, what part of your argument have I not addressed?
[04:58:15] <Moonlightning> [19:54:52] < Moonlightning> And doing so will inevitably lead to things like profiling at airports.
[04:58:26] <Moonlightning> You are attacking my articulations, not my ideas; you have ignored that line.
[04:58:37] <Moonlightning> You //know what I mean.// You're just being obtuse.
[04:58:47] <Parrhesia> uh, this entire argument has been about the justification of profiling.
[04:59:00] <Moonlightning> How is that relevant to what I have just said?
[04:59:06] <Parrhesia> You read minds? If not, you don't know what I know. Henlon's razor, etc.
[04:59:40] <Parrhesia> <Moonlightning> Statistics are not to be applied to groups of people.

[05:01:14] <Moonlightning> Let me make a second attempt, with hopefully better articulation.

[05:02:19] <Moonlightning> Statistics should not be applied to groups of people, because the negative consequences of doing so (e.g. acts tantamount to harrassment solely on the basis of appearance) are too great.
[05:03:01] <Moonlightning> Would have a Middle Eastern-looking guy pulled out of line and searched on most or all of his plane trips?
[05:03:11] <Moonlightning> Just because he's /statistically more likely/ to carry a bomb?
[05:03:35] <Moonlightning> s/Would have/Would you have/
[05:04:09] *** locodash11[lagout] is now known as locodashie11
[05:06:22] <Moonlightning> Doing so would be a gross injustice.
[05:10:48] <Parrhesia> It is an even grosser injustice to not utilize limited security resources optimally and heighten the chances of a terrorist slipping through out of a misplaced and wrongly applied sense of fairness.
[05:11:25] <Parrhesia> It isn't fair? The world isn't fair. People are not the same.
[05:11:30] <Moonlightning> To be clear, I was using /justice/ in the sense of fairness.
[05:12:13] <Moonlightning> You're not seriously using /the world isn't fair/ as a justification of unfair acts, are you?
[05:12:34] <Moonlightning> We should be striving to MAKE the world fair, as much as possible. Certainly in institutional and governmental contexts.
[05:12:56] <Moonlightning> Or, if you like…how about I have you thrown in jail for life. No trial, no nothing. Why? Because the world isn't fair.
[05:13:05] <Parrhesia> fairness implies an equality, a sameness about people that is simply false
[05:13:35] <Parrhesia> we don't judge children the same as adults, even though it would be fair to treat them equally in the eyes of the law.
[05:13:36] <Moonlightning> Fairness means that you treat people based on the merits they've earned as an individual, not based on their group memberships.
[05:14:13] <Rylee> hardly
[05:14:17] <Moonlightning> The discrimination between adults and children can be justified (at least to a degree) by pointing out that young children's minds are still developing.
[05:14:18] <Rylee> that's a terrible unilateral statement
[05:14:22] <Parrhesia> so when a child commits a crime, he should be punished just as severely as the adult that commits the same crime?
[05:14:32] <Parrhesia> but Moonlightning, that's not fair.
[05:15:02] <Moonlightning> It is not strictly fair in the sense that I have just described, but it has a justification that is backed by science.
[05:15:14] <Moonlightning> …I'm going to regret that articulation, aren't I./
[05:15:16] <Moonlightning> s:/::
[05:16:16] <Parrhesia> Fairness means that you treat people based on the merits they've earned as an individual, not based on their group memberships.
[05:16:31] <Parrhesia> but you can make a group out of literally any predicate.
[05:16:35] <Moonlightning> Besides the child vs adult distinction…fairness should certainly be applied with regard to race, gender, etc.
[05:16:40] <Moonlightning> Touché.
[05:16:50] <Moonlightning> Allow me to refine my articulation.
[05:16:55] <Parrhesia> please do
[05:16:58] <Gigabit> Xe dent nl
[05:18:23] <Moonlightning> s/on their group memberships/on things like race, gender, sex, orientation, fandom…/
[05:19:56] <Moonlightning> While it is perfectly fair to discriminate based on personal-merit things like previous offenses, despite the fact that you can declare a group of people who have committed a given crime perviously. 9.9
[05:20:16] <Moonlightning> s/perviously/previously/
[05:21:34] <Parrhesia> but you do agree that it is not optimal security? For the interest reducing false negatives and positives, it is not the best method to be blind to observable features such as race, gender, clothing, appearance, beards, behavior etc.?
[05:22:36] <Moonlightning> It may not be optimal, no. But I do not think that optimization is an excuse for profiling.
[05:24:29] <Parrhesia> then this is our fundamental disagreement. when the stakes are as high as they are in airlines, I think it's wrong to forego optimal security screening for the sake of hurt feelings.
[05:25:06] <Moonlightning> And I think it's wrong to subject individuals to harassment based on things like appearance, in the name of security.
[05:25:26] <Parrhesia> what actual harm does being profiled do? imperceptible. What actual harm does allowing a terrorist to slip through? Unimaginable.

[05:25:49] <Moonlightning> Wouldn't all the terrorists just change their appearance, then?
[05:25:57] <Moonlightning> Or get people with different appearances to carry bombs.
[05:26:07] <Parrhesia> they don't have the resources to
[05:26:16] <Parrhesia> you don't think they would if they could?
[05:26:16] <Moonlightning> They don't have the resources to change appearance?
[05:26:30] <Moonlightning> They can't shave hair, apply skin paint…?
[05:26:36] <Parrhesia> to undergo a skin a facial reconstruction?
[05:26:43] <Parrhesia> and do it convincingly?
[05:26:56] <Moonlightning> Or, as I said, simply get someone else to do it.
[05:27:10] <Parrhesia> not as simple as you think
[05:27:11] <Moonlightning> Am I right in assuming you would have women searched less than men?
[05:27:16] <Parrhesia> yes
[05:27:27] <Moonlightning> Well, then, that alone increases their chances of /slipping through/
[05:27:29] <Parrhesia> and babies and the elderly less than adults
[05:27:44] <Moonlightning> That even more—get an older person to do it.
[05:27:49] <Parrhesia> and how many fundamental Islamic terror groups you know employ women?
[05:28:05] <Parrhesia> they're so blinded by their ideology that they aren't rational about this 
[05:28:07] <Moonlightning> I'm sorry, I thought we were talking about ALL terror groups, not fundamental Islamic ones in particular.
[05:28:18] <Moonlightning> Besides, if it is paramount that NOT ONE TERRORIST slip through…
[05:28:25] <Moonlightning> If we should be optimizing for that…
[05:28:42] <Moonlightning> Then we mustn't restrict ourselves to thinking about just the Islamic ones.
[05:29:17] <Parrhesia> for some weird potentiality, you'd ignore the entirety of past statistics?
[05:29:43] <Moonlightning> For the sake of ensuring that not a single terrorist slips through, you wouldn't?
[05:30:28] <Parrhesia> when we have limited security resources to apply? I'd ONLY use knowledge of the past, including statistics.
[05:31:39] <Parrhesia> I'm not going to screen for the lone elderly man that has some strange middair death fetish and wants to bring everyone else into it, whether they want to or not
[05:32:03] <Moonlightning> But in the event that one of your Islamic terror groups wises up and employs an elderly European woman to carry out an attack, your security will fail, causing UNIMAGINABLE HARM! >:O
[05:32:42] <Moonlightning> Anyway, I think it's about time that we agreed to disagree.
[05:32:53] <Parrhesia> and when they get the resources to do so, I'd adjust my filters accordingly
[05:33:05] <Parrhesia> so far, no terrorist group has been successful at doing that outside of ISIS.
[05:33:59] <Parrhesia> and even then, it's easy enough to screen for those people. "You white?" "yes". "It says here on your passport you've been to Syria and Iraq". "Uhmmm...." "what are you doing with such a clunky looking jacket?"
[05:34:17] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|Sleepies
[05:35:00] <Parrhesia> come on, Moonlightning. I've already conceded that it's unfair. You can't concede that it's optimal?
[05:37:34] <Moonlightning> I concede that it's more optimal than anything I could come up with on the spot, but I hold that it is not justified.
[05:38:00] <Moonlightning> Similarly, reducing privacy to optmiize law enforcement is not justified.
[05:38:09] <Parrhesia> then we've made some ground at least
[05:38:23] <Moonlightning> Optimizing security should not be paramount.
[05:38:59] <Parrhesia> anyways, this seems to be a good stopping point, since further discussion would involve a completely different point

[18:20:21] <RazorSharpFang> What would a program do if you bitshifted its entire memory 1 bit to the left ?
[18:22:28] <Moonlightning> What, all as one contiguous block?
[18:24:15] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: Yeah
[18:24:28] <RazorSharpFang> Wrapping around as well if the final bit is 1
[18:25:30] <Moonlightning> Well, it would become horribly corrupt
[18:25:33] *** Joins: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning)
[18:25:36] <RazorSharpFang> But would it function?
[18:25:42] <Moonlightning> It depends on what the program would try to do next.
[18:25:55] <Moonlightning> Are we talking everything on the heap as one contiguous block, and everything on the stack as a separate one, too?
[18:26:05] *** LightningCrash is now known as Cloud_Kicker
[18:26:07] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: Yeah, everything.
[18:26:10] *** Cloud_Kicker is now known as Double_Diamond
[18:26:25] <RazorSharpFang> Probably.
[18:26:41] <Moonlightning> It would very likely segfault on the next pointer dereference.
[18:26:52] <Moonlightning> Because now all the pointers on the stack point to something completely different.
[18:27:04] <Moonlightning> …well, actually…shift by 1?
[18:27:13] <Moonlightning> Oh, no, still.
[18:27:22] <Moonlightning> …well…it depends on what they are.
[18:27:32] <RazorSharpFang> Suppose instead we bit-shift only the heap.
[18:28:13] *** Joins: LegionRed (LegionRed@The.DragonHorse.DraconisEquus)
[18:31:54] <RazorSharpFang> How hard would this feat be to do?
[18:32:02] <RazorSharpFang> In terms of programming it.
[18:32:41] <Moonlightning> Well, heap allocations aren't contiguous.
[18:32:58] <Moonlightning> There'll almost certainly be a bunch of different bits all over
[18:33:15] <RazorSharpFang> Does that prohibit us from treating it as if it's a contiguous one for the bitshift?
[18:34:09] <Moonlightning> Yes, unless you already have a thing that does it for you.
[18:34:23] <Moonlightning> Are we assuming the program is trying to bitshift all its memory for whatever reason?
[18:34:29] <Moonlightning> Or that something else is doing it?
[18:34:49] <Moonlightning> Beacuse if you're the program and you're doing it, you need an exhaustive list of all the memory allocations, so you know what the bitshift.
[18:34:52] <Moonlightning> what to bitshift *
[18:34:59] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: A foreign process.
[18:36:12] <RazorSharpFang> I assume it'd need to have priviledges for something like this.
[18:37:14] <Moonlightning> Well, I mean, if you can grab the heap-allocation table from the kernel, that makes everything easier
[18:37:23] <Moonlightning> easier|not impossible
[18:37:37] <Moonlightning> You kinda need to know what all the target process allocated
[18:37:46] <RazorSharpFang> Would *nix have something that could do that?
[18:38:18] <Moonlightning> *nix presumably has a heap-allocation table managed by the kernel somewhere locked in RAM, yes
[18:38:28] <Moonlightning> else how's the kernel know what belongs to what process
[18:38:47] <RazorSharpFang> By 'something' I meant function call that could give me that information.
[18:39:01] <Moonlightning> From userspace? Seems unlikely.
[18:39:17] <Moonlightning> If you can get kernel code executing, then maybe.
[18:40:00] <RazorSharpFang> This seems like a difficult task.
[18:41:19] <Moonlightning> Well, it's not /too/ hard
[18:41:27] <Moonlightning> Once you have the table, I mean
[18:41:43] <RazorSharpFang> Well, getting it seems to be the hard part.
[18:41:48] <Moonlightning> Indeed.
[18:41:56] <Moonlightning> Like I said, you'd probably need to get kernel code executing.
[18:42:07] <RazorSharpFang> I don't even know what that means. : /
[18:42:10] <Moonlightning> Though that's certainly possible if you're root on the box and you just wanna mess with your users.
[18:42:24] <Moonlightning> A kernel module, basically
[18:42:47] <Moonlightning> That, or code from /the/ kernel itself, though as far as I know you can do most everything you can do in the kernel, from a module
[18:43:25] <Moonlightning> You'd probably wanna write a function that takes a pointer and a length and does the bitshift on that length, returning the bit that got pushed out (so you can push it into the next allocation)
[18:43:59] <RazorSharpFang> So it'd return an int, but it'd basically be a boolean.
[18:45:03] <Moonlightning> I'd have it return a boolean; makes more sense
[18:45:11] <Moonlightning> This assuming it doesn't have any other useful value to return
[18:45:18] <RazorSharpFang> no bool(ean) in C though,
[18:45:26] <Moonlightning> There is in C99.
[18:46:12] <RazorSharpFang> Isn't that just typedeffed to int ?
[18:52:21] <Moonlightning> Naw, no way…
[18:54:14] <RazorSharpFang> typedef int bool; #define TRUE 1 #define FALSE 0 ?
[18:54:31] <Moonlightning> really? :(
[18:54:43] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not really sure.
[18:55:02] <Moonlightning> I mean, you would think it would be at /most/ a char, if they didn't bother to add proper compiler support
[18:55:14] <Moonlightning> an array of bools should take n/8 bytes of space :V
[18:56:08] <RazorSharpFang> bool is an alias of _Bool, I think.
[18:57:23] <Colgate> ^
[18:57:30] <Colgate> #define bool    _Bool
[18:57:31] <Colgate> #define true    1
[18:57:32] <Colgate> #define false   0
[18:57:43] <Colgate> that's all the relevant lines from stdbool.h XD
[18:57:47] <Colgate> for C
[18:57:58] <RazorSharpFang> typedef enum { false, true } bool; ? 
[18:58:18] * RazorSharpFang shruggies
[18:58:59] <Moonlightning> Anyway, I feel like you'd have to shift bytes individually
[18:59:27] <Colgate> looks like _Bool is a primitive type
[18:59:27] <Moonlightning> or, at best, treat things as arrays of `long long`s and shift those one by one, potentially with a remainder at the end
[18:59:30] <Colgate> /shrug
[18:59:33] <Moonlightning> Good :P
[19:00:03] <Colgate> it might not be, I don't know how bools work in C99 besides that they do!
[19:00:29] <Moonlightning> now I'm curious
[19:00:31] <RazorSharpFang> I didn't touch the stdbool.h library when I was taught C.
[19:00:42] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: you should do this, and tell me how long it takes for various processes
[19:00:54] <Colgate> well...
[19:01:06] <Colgate> stdbool.h is literally 3 lines, and all preprocessor
[19:01:07] <Moonlightning> They'd probably crash pretty quickly, but at the very least, you might get some interesting terminal output
[19:01:11] <Colgate> I pasted it above :P
[19:01:20] <Colgate> not including include guards and C++ stuff
[19:01:23] <Moonlightning> especially if it uses e.g. ncurses
[19:01:46] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: Well, I wouldn't know how. Never done anything even remotely like that.
[19:01:53] <RazorSharpFang> Heck, I've never used malloc.
[19:02:04] <Moonlightning> malloc() is fairly opaque
[19:02:13] <Moonlightning> as it should be, I guess
[19:02:17] <RazorSharpFang> That means not-transparent, right?
[19:02:31] <RazorSharpFang> As in, it's impossible to see within and understand, right?
[19:02:38] * RazorSharpFang is confused
[19:02:48] <Moonlightning> I'm using it to mean that the caller has no idea what goes on within it, only that it works.
[19:02:51] <Moonlightning> I think I'm using it wrong.
[19:03:02] <RazorSharpFang> You mean the black box
[19:03:24] <Moonlightning> well, it's not a black box, beacuse yo ucan see its source if you want?
[19:03:32] <Moonlightning> I dunno. It's properly abstracted. :p
[19:03:49] <Moonlightning> Anyway, my point is that it's not hard to start using! XD
[19:04:02] <Moonlightning> You call malloc() and pass in how many bytes you want
[19:04:14] <Moonlightning> You get back either a null pointer or a pointer to the beginning of the allocation
[19:04:27] <RazorSharpFang> But it's void.
[19:04:30] <Moonlightning> When you're done with it, you pass the pointer to free()
[19:04:41] <Moonlightning> Oh, yeah, it's a `void *`. You cast it to whatever you want.
[19:05:22] <RazorSharpFang> Could I cast it to `int` ? as in, not `int *` ?
[19:05:48] <Moonlightning> You would almost certainly lose precision.
[19:06:03] <Moonlightning> int is guaranteed to be at least 4 bytes; I think it /is/ on most systems
[19:06:32] <RazorSharpFang> So, 32-bit.
[19:06:47] <Moonlightning> Oh.
[19:06:52] <Moonlightning> Well, it might work on a 32-bit system
[19:06:57] <Moonlightning> Better to just use a real pointer type though
[19:07:12] <Moonlightning> If you haven't got a concrete pointer type to put it in…`void *`. :p
[19:07:30] <RazorSharpFang> Is there an upper limit to the amount of memory one can reserve at once?
[19:07:43] <Moonlightning> Yeah, see rlimit
[19:08:15] <Moonlightning> My laptop doesn't seem to use those limits, though—it's unlimited here
[19:08:28] <Moonlightning> obviously just bound by the size of your address space (RAM + swap)
[19:09:07] <Moonlightning> There's a separate limit to what you can mlock()
[19:09:17] <Moonlightning> …which is again unlimited on this box O.o
[19:09:18] <Colgate> I mean, int foo = (int)malloc(sizeof(int)); should work, but now you have to manually free an int for no real gain :P
[19:09:38] <Colgate> actually, wouldn't that leak
[19:09:41] <Colgate> hum
[19:09:55] <Colgate> well, that casting the pointer, not the data
[19:09:58] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: What is up with  your box?
[19:10:02] <Moonlightning> I dunno.
[19:10:05] <Moonlightning> It runs OS X :p
[19:10:16] <RazorSharpFang> That's a separate issue in itself.
[19:10:17] <Moonlightning> There's no limit on my Gentoo laptop either though
[19:10:25] <Moonlightning> though it does have a 64KiB limit on mlock()s
[19:10:47] <RazorSharpFang> Does that mean you cannot allocate like, 1.5MB of memory in a contiguous chunk?
[19:11:11] <Moonlightning> No; it just means that you can't allocate more than 64 KiB total and tell the OS not to swap it (mlock()).
