[01:08:43] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> does hacking them count?
[01:09:02] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you talking about Ethernet Over Powerline adapters?
[01:09:15] <Sour_Sweet> Yes
[01:09:40] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> they are okay, but you cannot connect them on a switched circuit, or a circuit that is independantly grounded from the rest of the house
[01:10:06] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> but they are okay for 10m full dup, or 100m half dup
[01:10:55] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> Wlan would be better, but in a pinch or in a situation where wifi isnt working right, these do okay
[01:11:40] <Webster> They've gotten up to at least couple hundred Mb these days, but it depends on the wiring.
[01:12:01] <Sour_Sweet> WiFi is horrible, the latency is a nightmare. That's why I try to avoid it
[01:13:21] <Sour_Sweet> The adapters I'm looking into offer full gigbit (or at least they claim). I'm not such much concerned about the bandwidth than I'm about latency and packet loss
[01:13:40] <Sour_Sweet> so*
[01:15:50] <Sour_Sweet> Also some are insecure using either no or weak encryption, but to be honest any valueable traffic on my network is using some sort of TLS anyway
[01:19:57] *** zeta__ is now known as Crimson_Tail
[01:28:09] <Googie> There's a standard that most adapters adhear to
[01:36:46] <Colgate> supposedly mine are aes-128 encrypted, but I have no way of actually verifying that

[02:15:03] <Sour_Sweet> On windows? That's not really a problem
[02:15:33] <Sour_Sweet> Cyan_Spark: That depends on your programming language.
[02:16:12] <Cyan_Spark> C++
[02:16:13] <Sour_Sweet> Some languages think of strings just as an array of chars, so as long as they allow multi demensional arrays you're fine

[07:59:00] <Moonlightning> no terminal scrollback? D:
[07:59:41] <HoneyDrops> I do... but this is like 1.8k files I was sorting though
[08:00:03] <HoneyDrops> I think I have an ls of most of what I want.
[08:00:25] <Moonlightning> oh, damn D:
[08:01:41] <HoneyDrops> This isn't even uncompressing them to find the actual roms, these are the 7z archives of every variant of each SNES game
[08:03:04] <HoneyDrops> And no, scrollback doesn't go back that far.
[08:03:21] <HoneyDrops> Oh well, at least I finished NES.

[08:15:10] <Moonlightning> …actually, it's not every site. Equestria Daily and Stack Exchange are fine.
[08:15:28] <Moonlightning> as is Imgur
[08:15:45] <Moonlightning> But GitHub is baaaad, and I feel like the overwhelming majority of sites are, too
[08:17:59] <Phase> o_O
[08:18:13] <Moonlightning> You do web design, right, Phase?
[08:18:16] <Moonlightning> Halp ;-;
[08:18:37] <Moonlightning> and by web design I mean web UI stuff
[08:18:39] <Phase> i hit css with a hammer until it looks passable
[08:19:04] * HoneyDrops grins, bash history to the rescue!
[08:19:19] <Phase> Moonlightning, whats more concerning is the lack of scrollbars
[08:19:39] <Phase> or is that an osx thing
[08:19:57] <Moonlightning> Phase: who the hell uses scrollbars
[08:20:03] <Moonlightning> you mean you don't have a scroll wheel?
[08:20:11] <Moonlightning> why the hell don't you have a scroll wheel
[08:20:25] <Moonlightning> fuck, whatever, just use space|shift-space or pagedown|pageup
[08:20:51] <Moonlightning> Phase: in seriousness, I have a trackpad, and the scrollbars appear only when I'm scrolling
[08:21:00] <Moonlightning> if I need to scroll a lot, I scroll a little first, then drag the bar
[08:21:05] <Moonlightning> but that doesn't happen very often
[08:21:15] <Phase> it's not that i USE them, i just have them
[08:21:32] <Phase> just want to make sure the issue isn't overflow: hidden
[08:21:50] <Phase> and i have a touchpad with two finger scroll, including horizontal :D
[08:22:55] <Moonlightning> what
[08:23:03] <Moonlightning> what the hell kind of trackpad doesn't have omnidirectional scrolling
[08:23:14] <Phase> the crappy kind
[08:23:17] <Moonlightning> exactly
[08:23:18] <Valiant> I love the touchpad on my macbook. Like, unf.
[08:23:22] <Phase> rather, the crappy driver kind
[08:23:27] <Moonlightning> Apple trackpads are the shit
[08:23:31] <Phase> *ANTI-SYNAPTICS NOISES*
[08:23:37] <Moonlightning> Most trackpads I've tried are shitty
[08:23:38] <Valiant> OSX hides scrollbars unless you have a mouse, just mentioining that.
[08:23:40] <Phase> stupid oem centric drivers
[08:23:46] <Valiant> If you have a mouse detected the scrollbars show up.
[08:23:50] <Moonlightning> like, you go to the store, and you mess around with the display laptops
[08:23:53] <Moonlightning> they're all shite
[08:24:14] <Valiant> I seriously like my macbook. Apple is an evil megacorp, and the prices are high- but man do I like their toys.
[08:24:26] <Moonlightning> They do make pretty stuff
[08:24:34] <Moonlightning> And like I said, I love their trackpads.
[08:24:45] <Valiant> I wouldn't buy one now though, they took the GPUs out of the 'low' end model and the canadian dollar being shit made prices higher.
[08:24:57] <Valiant> The direct upgrade to my 2013 15'' costs 3 grand, it cost 2 when new
[08:25:01] <Phase> Moonlightning, most of them feel crap, the other problem is usually oem's chosing settings for you
[08:25:03] <Moonlightning> Anyway…is it just me, or is GitHub serving `width: 980px;`
[08:25:04] <Valiant> the 2 grand one now has no gpu
[08:25:09] <Phase> because synaptics is big on that
[08:25:21] <Moonlightning> Phase: my beef is with the rough-textured ones.
[08:25:22] <Moonlightning> I can't stand those.
[08:25:26] <Moonlightning> I need my trackpad to be glassy.
[08:25:27] <Valiant> Which like, I don't need a GPU in my laptop- but I had used that laptop as a desktop for a year and a half, worked quite well.
[08:25:32] <Phase> i hate the ones that feel like rubber
[08:25:34] <Valiant> oh fuck rough trackpads
[08:25:34] <Moonlightning> YES
[08:25:36] <Moonlightning> THOSE, TOO
[08:25:40] <Valiant> give me thinkpad clitmice
[08:25:46] <Phase> and your fingers stick to them
[08:25:46] <Valiant> clitmice on an PC and macbook trackpads
[08:25:52] <Phase> Valiant, could never use those
[08:25:52] <Valiant> best
[08:25:58] <Valiant> Gotta get used to them!
[08:25:58] <Phase> had two thinkpads, never touched them
[08:26:06] <Moonlightning> I actually had a laptop with a clitmouse for the longest time
[08:26:08] <Valiant> I could even play Quake with one :)
[08:26:27] <Moonlightning> that was years ago, but my memory of it is actually pretty neutral
[08:27:02] <Valiant> I also had a thousand dollar asus once that /literally/ fell apart after a year of moderate use. 
[08:27:09] <Moonlightning> :/
[08:27:13] <Valiant> Serial sticker fell off so no service, went from 1000 dollars to utterly worthless.
[08:27:20] <Valiant> Macbook meanwhile is nearly 3 years old and looks like day 1.
[08:27:27] <Phase> my asus's tended to hold well
[08:27:31] <Moonlightning> heheh
[08:27:34] <Moonlightning> six-year-old macbook here
[08:27:39] <Phase> one had a gpu failure, the other still works
[08:27:42] <Valiant> I have a 2005 powerbook I got used that's like.
[08:27:48] <Valiant> It's nearly useless but it's so PRETTY.
[08:27:53] <Moonlightning> replaced battery once, disk once, disk bracket twice
[08:27:55] <Valiant> perfect quality and everything
[08:27:56] <Moonlightning> runs fine
[08:28:04] <Moonlightning> though I should get another battery
[08:28:09] <Moonlightning> but no monehs :(
[08:28:18] <Moonlightning> prolly just gonna leave it like this and use my other laptop for actually going places
[08:28:24] <Phase> bad memorys of the HP though
[08:28:44] <Phase> i don't know what plastic they used but i've eaten biscuits with more structure than that crap
[08:28:51] <Phase> first day something snapped
[08:28:55] <Moonlightning> damn
[08:29:12] <Valiant> I do wish that there were more user servicable parts on my macbook, but eh 8 gigs of ram is enough so v0v
[08:29:18] <Valiant> Give and take, nothing is perfect.
[08:29:26] <Phase> 24GB ram laptop
[08:29:31] <Phase> get on ma level
[08:29:50] <Moonlightning> Still waiting on those free-as-in-speech laptops
[08:30:11] <Moonlightning> FOSS drivers for //everything//, fully user-servicable
[08:30:42] <Moonlightning> actually…guess I should be looking at just building my own, huh
[08:30:48] <Phase> 24G is sorta exessive but it means i can run a handful of vm's and still never touch swap
[08:30:52] <Moonlightning> I'd like it to not be that bulky though ;-;

[08:31:57] <Moonlightning> no, just GitHub

[08:32:13] <Phase> oh, i seem to have no margins also

[08:34:44] <Valiant> like srsly lol the prices for ram are hilarious.
[08:34:54] <Valiant> 100ish in my experience, desktop DDR3 1600
[08:35:00] <Moonlightning> you'll be happy to hear that this RAM is third-party, then :P

[14:48:24] <Cyan_Spark> Newbie here, what is "EXC_BAD_ACCESS"? 
[14:49:03] <Cyan_Spark> Do compilers start puking if you ask them to do thatArray[i] = thisArray[i]?
[14:56:34] <Stik> what language?
[14:56:50] <Stik> generally the answer is "no"
[14:56:53] <Cyan_Spark> C++
[14:57:10] <Stik> not my forte but i wouldn't have thought it'd have a problem with that
[14:57:42] <Cyan_Spark> It's really strange, I put in some other variable name and the string copies over just fine
[14:58:01] <Cyan_Spark> uh, I meant variable value 
[14:58:03] <Stik> do you have some code you can show?
[14:58:11] <Stik> suspect you have a problem on another line
[14:58:11] <Cyan_Spark> Yus, hold on...
[15:00:31] <Cyan_Spark> External function + Outputs: http://i.imgur.com/BW10Iad.png
[15:00:51] <Cyan_Spark> The problematic function: http://i.imgur.com/E9iuoJv.png 
[15:06:23] <Stik> unsure i'm afraid
[15:06:30] <Stik> there's definitely some c++ ponies in here tho
[15:06:38] <Stik> hopefully they'll help you :)
[15:06:41] <Cyan_Spark> Aw, thanks for your help though ^^
[15:07:27] <Stik> only thing that jumps out at me is that you limit it to 6 inputs, but your arrays can only hold a max of 5 
[15:07:52] <Stik> would expect you to get errors when typing the names in though, rather than in copyNames
[15:08:07] <Stik> but perhaps it's just overwriting memory the first time and nothing immediately bad is happening

[15:12:16] <Cyan_Spark> Don't arrays start counting from zero? 
[15:12:38] <mniip> depends on the language
[15:12:42] <RazorSharpFang> In C/C++ they do
[15:12:46] <mniip> ^
[15:12:47] <Stik> they do
[15:12:53] <mniip> lua has 1-based arrays
[15:12:57] <Stik> but the name[5] is a *count*
[15:13:00] <mniip> pascal has arbitrary-based arrays
[15:13:04] <Stik> so it means the indices go from 0..4
[15:13:05] <RazorSharpFang> Matlab uses starting index of 1.
[15:13:10] <mniip> and I've written a language where arrays start from -1
[15:13:17] <Stik> why would you do that
[15:13:18] <RazorSharpFang> mniip: Why... ?
[15:13:25] <mniip> for the glory of satan of course
[15:13:32] <Cyan_Spark> OH
[15:13:33] <RazorSharpFang> Best reason.
[15:13:36] <Cyan_Spark> Maybe that's the problem 
[15:13:49] <mniip> haskell doesn't have a fixed concept of array, but
[15:13:58] * Cyan_Spark knocks his head with a hoof
[15:13:58] <mniip> Data.Array can start from an arbitrary position too
[15:14:28] <Cyan_Spark> I've had this phobia of arrays for a while now, guess that's what happens when you try to ignore it too long x3
[15:14:28] <Stik> pascal's 1-based arrays are to mirror strings, which were historically 1-based because the 0-th element was the length of the string
[15:14:38] <RazorSharpFang> Anyone play games that have hexagonal grids?
[15:14:48] <Stik> settlers :)
[15:15:02] <RazorSharpFang> I... meant computer games. Sorry.
[15:15:05] <Stik> oh
[15:15:11] <mniip> pascal doesn't have 1-based arrays
[15:15:14] <Stik> well, there was a computer game inspired by settles of catan
[15:15:24] <Stik> called settlers in fact
[15:15:28] <Stik> that was hexagonal
[15:15:32] <mniip> you can say
[15:15:34] <Stik> hmm i thought it did mniip ?
[15:15:42] <mniip> array : array [4 .. 13] of integer;
[15:15:43] <Stik> maybe i misremember, it's been a long time ;)
[15:15:50] <mniip> and then array[4] would be the first element
[15:15:50] <RazorSharpFang> I
[15:15:57] <Stik> hmm maybe that's what i'm thinking of
[15:16:04] <mniip> and array[13] the last
[15:16:09] <RazorSharpFang> I'm just wondering how to make a game that uses a hexagonal grid.
[15:16:30] <Stik> represent it as a normal square grid, but offset each row by half the y-coord
[15:16:54] <mniip> no
[15:16:57] <RazorSharpFang> What does that even mean?
[15:17:25] <mniip> this http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/retro-pattern/06.jpg
[15:18:00] <Cyan_Spark> :D it works!
[15:18:10] * Cyan_Spark glomps Stik. "Thank you!"
[15:18:14] <Stik> heh you're welcome
[15:18:26] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not sure how to follow that.
[15:18:32] <Stik> yeah mniip, that's what i mean, but when rendering you have to transform it
[15:18:39] * Cyan_Spark is really newbish at programming ^^;
[15:18:40] <Stik> skew
[15:18:43] <Stik> that's the word
[15:21:03] <RazorSharpFang> Can a hex grid be represented by an array of arrays or equivalent? 
[15:21:36] <Stik> probably better off with a single array of n*m, but yeah, conceptually it's an array of arrays, a 2D array
[15:22:23] <Stik> if you want the board to be hexagonal as well then you'll need to ignore the corners, since what you'll have this way is a paralellogram shaped board
[15:23:02] <RazorSharpFang> Uh, no. I kinda wanted the board to be roughly square.
[15:23:12] <mniip> yeah no
[15:23:16] <mniip> you could center the center
[15:23:18] <Stik> similar thing i guess, you'll ahve to work out which bits to ignore
[15:23:26] <mniip> I wonder what the metric is on that hexagonal grid
[15:23:52] <Stik> metric?
[15:25:06] <mniip> well in a euclidian space, distance is measured by sqrt(Δx^2+Δy^2+Δz^2)
[15:25:20] <mniip> in taxicab world it's |Δx|+|Δy|
[15:25:28] <RazorSharpFang> euclidian space is the best space
[15:25:36] <mniip> in minkowski space it's sqrt(Δx^2+Δy^2+Δz^2-Δt^2)
[15:25:39] <mniip> notice the minus sign
[15:25:42] <Stik> what's taxicab world?
[15:25:54] <mniip> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry
[15:26:06] <Stik> i see
[15:26:53] <mniip> pi equals 2*sqrt(2)
[15:26:54] <mniip> :P
[15:26:56] * RazorSharpFang yawns
[15:27:32] <RazorSharpFang> 2.82 != 3.14
[15:27:40] <mniip> yeah, in the hexagonal world you have a metric of max(|Δx|,|Δy|,|Δx+Δy|)
[15:27:46] <mniip> so
[15:27:55] <mniip> if your board is centered at 0, 0
[15:28:09] <mniip> a hexagon would be delimited by max(|x|,|y|,|x+y|) < r
[15:28:56] <RazorSharpFang> I was kinda after a square shaped board broken into hexagonal pieces. 
[15:30:16] <mniip> then
[15:30:20] <mniip> |y| < height
[15:30:26] <mniip> |x+y/2| < width
[15:30:36] <Stik> you need to transform y too
[15:30:49] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not sure how movement would work. Like, if you were at {2,3} and want to move northwest, would that put you at {1,2} or {1,3} ?
[15:31:37] <mniip> Stik, no
[15:31:50] <Stik> i think yes
[15:32:01] <mniip> RazorSharpFang, you have 6 movement opportunities
[15:32:04] <Stik> draw it out, you don't get equilateral triangles 
[15:32:24] <RazorSharpFang> Doesn't that depend on your hexagon?
[15:32:39] <mniip> (+1, 0) (-1, 0) (0, +1) (0, -1) (+1, +1) (-1, -1)
[15:33:12] <mniip> Stik, http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=|x%2By%2F2|+%3C+1+%26%26+|y|+%3C+1
[15:33:27] <RazorSharpFang> mniip: How can you move just west? That's not possible on a hex-grid.
[15:33:52] <Stik> that's not going to form a regular hexgon mniip 
[15:34:06] <mniip> E W NW SE NE SW
[15:34:15] <mniip> Stik, x and y are array coordinates here
[15:34:40] <Stik> you don't transform them
[15:34:48] <Stik> the transform only applies to the rendering
[15:35:00] <mniip> right
[15:35:10] <mniip> but to figure what subset of coordinates forms a rectangle
[15:35:11] <RazorSharpFang> Maybe I should try making a prototype of this.
[15:35:13] <Stik> and if you don't transform y as well it'll be distorted
[15:35:19] <mniip> you have to use a linear map
[15:35:24] <mniip> yes it /will/ be distorted
[15:35:27] <Stik> so your rectangle will be slightly smaller in one dimension
[15:35:35] <mniip> that is correct
[15:35:49] <RazorSharpFang> Your talk of skew and distort is confusing,
[15:36:20] <Stik> hmm it's kind of necessary for a hex grid though razor
[15:36:51] <mniip> http://i.stack.imgur.com/FloqG.png
[15:36:56] <mniip> this one is 5 wide and 5 tall
[15:37:02] <Stik> i suppose think about a real-world hex game board (like catan) and ask yourself how you'd index each tile
[15:37:11] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, exactly like that.
[15:38:18] <RazorSharpFang> Hang on, that's slightly different to the one I drew.
[15:38:34] <RazorSharpFang> Mine's got up/down going straight
[15:38:53] <mniip> so swap x and y then
[15:39:53] <RazorSharpFang> Would it make any difference to the gameplay?
[15:41:34] <mniip> depends
