[06:25:13] <Compu> and my fingers r ech
[06:25:15] * Valiant massagies Compu 
[06:25:23] <Compu> u guys ever had to deal with like 20 tiny screws?
[06:25:41] <JustAberrant> aka have you guys ever taken a laptop apart? ;p
[06:25:46] <Compu> i had to screw and unscrew them like 4 times each repairing my friend's laptop
[06:25:55] <Compu> but its working now
[06:26:07] <Compu> let me put it this way
[06:26:20] <Compu> he had 2 laptops of the exact same model and specs and such
[06:26:23] <JustAberrant> but yeah, laptops are a pain to work on, they really arn't designed to be taken apart often
[06:26:32] <Compu> 1 was ded cuz the screen was broken on it
[06:26:51] <Compu> the other he used until the charging circuit on it's motherboard short circuited
[06:27:09] <Compu> so i had to take the 2 laptops and make a working laptop out of them
[06:27:11] <JustAberrant> and things that commonly die (like the inverter) are the most difficult to replace and usually involve removing like half the damn components to get at them ;p
[06:27:13] <Compu> but i did it
[06:27:27] <JustAberrant> hehe, nice :)
[06:27:54] <Compu> JustAberrant: oh god this laptop is hell, u have to take the entire frame apart just to remove the cpu fan or the CMOS battery

[06:28:58] <Compu> basically i took the screen and hard drive  and CMOS battery (one in the dead screen laptop was dead) from the dead motherboard and put them into the dead screen laptop
[06:29:47] <Compu> its ok he pays us back by taking us to the grocery store whenever he comes over
[06:30:17] <Compu> how much would one of u guys normally charge for doing something like that tho?
[06:30:51] * JustAberrant shrugs, I don't charge money for that kinda thing
[06:30:56] <Compu> mmm
[06:31:13] <Compu> my guess would be $40-$60
[06:31:43] <Compu> cuz that is honestly a lot of friggin work and took me like 3 hours
[06:32:08] <Compu> i went ahead and ran software updater in ubuntu after i was done
[06:32:16] <JustAberrant> usually friends and family and isn't often, an an hour or so of messing with a laptop isn't exactly horrible
[06:32:25] <Compu> JustAberrant: 3 hours*
[06:32:46] <JustAberrant> hehe, well even still ;p
[06:32:46] <Compu> and oh god i fucking HATE those tiny wifi antenna connectors
[06:32:56] <Compu> just WHY
[06:33:13] <Compu> whoever came up with those was pure evil
[06:33:26] <JustAberrant> any time I do that kinda stuff it's usually a favour, if you were actually doing it on a regular basis, no idea what would be reasonable
[06:33:31] <Compu> i have very dainty hands and those things r still a struggle for me
[06:33:56] <Compu> JustAberrant: im the tech support for that whole family and god do they keep me busy

[19:34:13] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: yeah, add some scare quotes
[19:35:21] <Compu> AppleDash: well by default u can only edit /var/www/ as either root or whatever user apache runs as
[19:35:46] <Moonlightning> Compu: yeah, but either everypony can fetch a file, or nopony can
[19:35:49] <AppleDash> You have no idea what I'm talking about
[19:36:04] <Moonlightning> Also, you're assuming that the httpd is Apache
[19:36:18] <AppleDash> ^
[19:36:34] <Compu> well i've never used another httpd, didnt know they all use /var/www/
[19:36:51] <Unixkitty> root? Apache never runs as root by default
[19:36:59] <Unixkitty> At least nowadays
[19:37:00] <Compu> Unixkitty: didnt say that
[19:37:20] <AppleDash> They use whatever you configure them to use
[19:37:20] <Unixkitty> I know, just the thought baffled me
[19:37:35] * Moonlightning waffles Unixkitty instead
[19:37:37] <AppleDash> My httpd could use /etc/ssh if I wanted it to
[19:37:44] <AppleDash> It would probably be a bad idea, but it would be possible
[19:37:46] * Unixkitty squeaks to Moonlightning 
[19:39:35] <Compu> i mean by default
[19:39:41] * Moonlightning figures Unixkitty is probably qualified to answer his request from earlier
[19:44:03] <Unixkitty> What request?
[19:44:18] * JustAberrant has Moonlightning responded to
[19:44:48] <Compu> *throws the lego movie at Unixkitty* o3o
[19:45:29] <Compu> remove that x and u r now a lego cat unicorn thingy
[19:46:04] <Moonlightning> Nikitty?
[19:46:18] <Moonlightning> More like one of those knights from Monty Python
[19:46:25] <Compu> Moonlightning: ???
[19:46:28] *** Unixkitty is now known as Unikitty
[19:46:31] *** Unikitty is now known as Unixkitty
[19:46:40] <Compu> nya
[19:46:58] <Moonlightning> Unixkitty: check the scrollback from about five hours ago? x3
[19:47:06] <Moonlightning> I'd repost, but I'm on my phone
[19:47:31] <Moonlightning> Compu: if you remove the X /and/ the U, you get Nikitty. :P
[19:47:42] <Compu> Moonlightning: only the x
[19:48:07] * Moonlightning would ask JustAberrant, but he probably prefers solve ancient, obscure language to Python
[19:48:22] <Unixkitty> If it's about the python code, I'm afraid I wouldn't be too much help with that
[19:48:49] <JustAberrant> python sucks but I do use it occasionally
[19:48:56] <AppleDash> Moonlightning: um
[19:49:22] <AppleDash> You know about .readline(), right?
[19:49:25] <JustAberrant> also @ waaayyy earlier, apache runs as root, but the bits that access the file system don't tend to
[19:49:39] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: there's no socket.readline()
[19:49:50] <AppleDash> f = socket.makefile("r")
[19:49:53] <AppleDash> f.readline()
[19:49:56] <Moonlightning> Also, as I said, I need a maximum length on it, because the user is untrusted
[19:50:05] <AppleDash> f.readline(max_len)
[19:50:29] <Moonlightning> …what, really?
[19:51:12] <AppleDash> Yes
[19:52:14] <Moonlightning> Well fuck
[19:52:17] <Moonlightning> Thanks
[19:52:29] <AppleDash> NP :P
[19:52:44] <Moonlightning> I'll be using that for my project instead
[19:53:01] <Moonlightning> But I'll still be using this opportunity to learn about unit testing
