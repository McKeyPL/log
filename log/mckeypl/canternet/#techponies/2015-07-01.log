[01:21:31] <GigaNoms> I have thre 270 OC
[01:21:47] <ShivalWolf> its an interesting system

[01:22:14] <AppleDash> GigaNoms: The 300 series are literally just rebranded 200 series
[01:22:15] <AppleDash> so no
[01:22:43] <Seoson> We don't see much movement in both GPUs and CPUs atm
[01:22:46] <GigaNoms> So I may as well take advantage of tyhe price drops for other cards and snag one of those
[01:22:47] <BabyCloudrunner> So hadoop is a database language?
[01:23:05] <Seoson> And DDR4 is still very expensive
[01:23:21] <AppleDash> DDR4 isn't that expensive
[01:23:21] <GigaNoms> I don't want ddr4 :P
[01:23:31] <GigaNoms> I just got 12gb of ddr3 x.x
[01:23:49] <Seoson> I'd upgrade the GPU if you really need to, but I would wait for better options on the CPU side to be honest
[01:25:37] <ShivalWolf> BabyCloudrunner: its more a platform
[01:25:46] <ShivalWolf> the wiki entry describes it rathe well
[01:25:47] <Seoson> Also most older CPUs work just fine for gaming. I could still use my old Q660.

[01:28:55] <Moonlightning> > Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware.
[01:28:55] <Moonlightning> > All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures (of individual machines, or racks of machines) are commonplace and thus should be automatically handled in software by the framework.

[04:10:07] <Moonlightning> /Thank/ you.
[04:10:11] <Lapsus> sup Colgate
[04:10:13] <Colgate> I was cooking dinner :(
[04:10:17] <tiwake> and Colgate shows up
[04:10:23] <Moonlightning> /always/ when you're gone. X.X
[04:10:26] <tiwake> we love you Colgate \o/
[04:10:29] <frackster> what did you cook Colgate? :O
[04:10:29] <tiwake> or at least I do
[04:10:30] <Fall> It's a dynamic IP Colgate.
[04:10:46] <JustAberrant> <tiwake> why do people not like pulseaudio?
[04:10:47] <Lapsus> My main problem with mode +R is that every time I leave it on, I lose 15-20 people until it goes back off
[04:10:57] <Lapsus> it also stops what little growth this channel has
[04:10:58] <vi[NLR]> because pulseaudio produced more problems and was buggy as hell.. most audio problems i know of where solved by a killall pulseaudio :X
[04:10:58] <JustAberrant> because the guy who made it is a huge tool.. and cause for a very long time it really sucked
[04:10:59] <init3> Yeah
[04:11:01] <JustAberrant> (it's not bad now)
[04:11:19] <tiwake> vi[NLR]: used to? or still does?
[04:11:28] <init3> Yeah, it is one of those things that gains infamy and never loses it.
[04:11:37] <init3> I think it's alright. 
[04:11:40] * JustAberrant jackd fanboy also
[04:11:41] <vi[NLR]> tiwake: afaik it's better now
[04:11:49] <JustAberrant> pulse is mostly usable now
[04:11:52] <Colgate> Fall: I don't think it is that
[04:11:56] <Lapsus> I mean, I guess I can put it on for a couple hours if this guy isn't bored of us yet, but whatever
[04:11:57] <JustAberrant> but yeah.. really rough start
[04:12:08] <tiwake> most arguments I'm seeing against it is how much more latency it adds to audio...
[04:12:08] <Lapsus> init3: Reiserfs will kill your wife?
[04:12:10] <init3> Not that there are any better alternatives. Jackd is cool but I find it more annoying. 
[04:12:21] <init3> lol
[04:12:46] <JustAberrant> even I admit jackd is a bit of a pain.. but it's kinda awesome if you're like me and have a weird audio setup
[04:12:47] <Colgate> then again, these are both from japan
[04:13:12] <init3> I mean, they seem to have gotten bored at this point. 
[04:13:19] <JustAberrant> and it's cool being able to route sound from mplayer into a simulated guitar effects rack ;p
[04:13:23] <tiwake> I ask cause fedora and redhat is talking about a video version of pulseaudio
[04:13:32] <tiwake> Pinos
[04:13:35] <init3> Huh?
[04:13:37] <JustAberrant> oh god

[04:15:04] <tiwake> JustAberrant: it would be nice for splitting video streams... like recording the desktop to hard drive and livestreaming at the same time... or something
[04:15:04] <init3> Well is penis.. err i mean Pinos only for cameras?
[04:15:25] <init3> Because V4L is a disaster. 
[04:15:30] <JustAberrant> yeah I guess, though vlc and others can already kinda do that

[04:16:37] <tiwake> sounds like different people are starting it than did pulseaudio

[04:22:32] <vi[NLR]> dunno.. i really didn't use pulseaudio-features and just had a lot of problems with it so i didn't use it on my current system (just plain alsa) - colleague of mine who experienced similar issues (sound just stopped working, glitchy audio output) reported that with more recent version it became quite stable

[04:24:47] <vi[NLR]> lol, from 2012, archlinux-forum: "Pulseaudio is an additional layer - a man in the middle. Its purpose is to confuse, and half-work, and be yet one more app that needs configuring."

[07:24:15] <Lapsus> I won't be using it seriously until that gets patched out
[07:24:21] <init3> So to fix it, you change your SSID to $SSID_optout?
[07:24:37] <init3> Which means reconfiguring ALL of my wireless devices?
[07:24:44] <init3> Fuck you MS.
[07:24:49] <Moonlightning> ...

[07:26:33] <init3> There is a similar thing to out out of google mapping
[07:26:40] <init3> With a different suffix.
[07:26:41] <Phase> init3, it saves your wifi credentials to their servers, and then on all your contacts machines
[07:26:46] <Lapsus> There is a way to turn it off outright, but that doesn't stop your friends or visitors from sharing the shit anyways
[07:26:54] <Googie> Oh yeah, already a different suffix for Google.
[07:27:09] <Googie> So... you're screwed!
[07:27:14] <init3> Apparently.
[07:27:24] <Phase> so, if you want to break into anyones network
[07:27:28] <init3> I have a public SSID for a reason. 
[07:27:32] <Phase> become their friend on facebook and it'll give you the password

[07:28:12] <init3> FFS
[07:28:52] <Moonlightning> ...
[07:28:55] <Moonlightning> Google does that, too?!
[07:29:07] <init3> Why the fuck is a password hint required?
[07:29:13] <init3> It is for geomapping. 
[07:29:14] <ShivalWolf> theres soo much BS going around about that issue
[07:29:27] <ShivalWolf> the whoel optout is just in the workng builds
[07:29:27] <Moonlightning> ???
[07:29:34] <ShivalWolf> in the real system its a checkbox thats off by default
[07:29:44] <ShivalWolf> also it doesnt send the password
[07:29:49] <ShivalWolf> its sends a config paramater
[07:29:52] <ShivalWolf> that goes into your keyring
[07:30:10] <ShivalWolf> unlike any older version of windows
[07:30:18] <init3> But it has to be in a reversible encryption.
[07:30:19] <ShivalWolf> the wifi passwords are notlonger in a shitty reversable format
[07:30:31] <init3> How could it not be?
[07:30:43] <Moonlightning> You know what
[07:30:48] <Moonlightning> The REAL problem is that we're using shared passwords.
[07:30:51] <init3> You need to pass it to the AP somehow. 
[07:30:57] <Moonlightning> We should just use crypto keypairs.
[07:31:02] <Moonlightning> Problem. Fucking. Solved.
[07:31:10] <init3> Or RADIUS like Googie said. 
[07:31:23] <ShivalWolf> crypto keypairs arnt easy to enter when your setting upa new system
[07:31:26] <ShivalWolf> and also 802.1x
[07:31:30] <Phase> google stores your ssid and bssid

[07:31:52] <Phase> you're already litterally broadcasting that information
[07:32:42] <Googie> The Windows 10 thing, for WPA-PSK, there's no way to securely share the key without it being reversible somehow.
[07:33:21] <init3> It'd have to be. 
[07:34:19] <ShivalWolf> yeah but atleast its not as easy to reverse now as it will be in the system keyring

[07:49:10] <ShivalWolf> i ment converting it properly from phone to desktop
[07:49:21] <Googie> I wonder if it would be possible to to use a botnet to automatically harvest credentials of all the user's contacts.
[07:49:29] <Moonlightning> what the actual fuck are they doing
[07:49:32] <Phase> that's what i mean, half the point of metro was to unify ui's
[07:49:35] <Googie> The hardest part if that it states that it should only share in proximity
[07:49:41] <Moonlightning> nothign in that UI suggests it builds a web
[07:49:43] <ShivalWolf> Phase: yeah they failed abit with that
[07:49:44] <Phase> Googie, absolutely possible

[07:49:51] <ShivalWolf> Moonlightning: it doesnt
[07:50:05] <Phase> Googie, again the only way this works is if all your passwords are sent to, and stored on, all your contacts phones and machines
[07:50:36] <Googie> Phase: Microsoft's FAQ stated that they are stored on Microsoft's server, and only downloaded when the device is in proximity
[07:50:38] <Phase> otherwise you need internet access to get internet access, and even then you could trick the server to allow you to download credentials
[07:50:46] <Googie> Presumably over 3G
[07:50:54] <Moonlightning> And for non-cellular devices?
[07:50:58] <ShivalWolf> its done with GPS and 3g
[07:51:00] <Phase> ^ Moonlightning
[07:51:20] <init3> It'd be useless if it didn't already have it before you went to your friend's house. 
[07:51:20] <ShivalWolf> it doesnt work then
[07:51:31] <Phase> then why are they adding it to windows?
[07:51:34] <Moonlightning> So the point of having this on non-cell devices is...?
[07:51:58] <Moonlightning> > Wi-Fi passwords stored on Microsoft servers
[07:52:08] <init3> So this gets your wi-fi credentials in the wild for no advantage whatsoever.

[07:53:13] <Phase> doesn't WPA have per-station keys?
[07:53:20] <Moonlightning> TL;DR Microsoft having more massive fuckkin' privacy holes, needs to go die in a fire
[07:53:22] <init3> not PSK
[07:53:28] <Googie> WPA-PSK has a single shared key among all devices
[07:53:53] <Phase> for authentication, but it negotiates another key
[07:53:54] <Googie> Standard WPA (with Radius) has proper authentication, but is much much harder to configure for the average user.

[07:56:07] <init3> It might be a type. 
[07:56:12] <init3> I'm not sure though. 
[07:56:13] <Phase> they coexist in some way but i'm not sure how
[07:56:13] <Moonlightning> The point of anonymity is that you don't HAVE an identity
[07:56:30] <Phase> Moonlightning, "i identify as having a lack of identity, don't you repress me"
[07:57:14] <Googie> EAP = Extensible Authentication Protocol. You can use Radius as the backend.
[07:57:30] <init3> Yeah, that
[07:58:37] <Finnfinn> Moonlightning: IEEE 802.1X is a standard for authenticating in networks. EAP is an auth protocol. RADIUS is a client-server protocol.
[07:59:22] <Finnfinn> Because of puns and no creativity, a successor to RADIUS exists and is named Diameter.

[08:06:24] <ShivalWolf> then they upgraded to windows 95 machines and we got to use delphi
[08:06:25] <Googie> Reminds me of learning to program all over again.
[08:06:53] <Googie> First it was loops. Why the hell would anyone need loops. What would they be useful for.
[08:06:55] <Googie> Then it was pointers.

[08:08:02] <Moonlightning> how...do you...
[08:08:06] <Moonlightning> how do you program /without/ loops?
[08:08:15] <Googie> Moonlightning: I was 10!
[08:08:26] <Moonlightning> are you just supposed to write the same thing out again and again and again and again? X.X
[08:08:27] <Googie> It was my first time following some crappy C tutorial on the Internet.
[08:08:42] <Colgate> does using goto a lot count as a loop?
[08:08:52] <Colgate> I mean, it goes backwards...
[08:09:22] <ShivalWolf> if count < 10 goto 5
[08:09:50] <Moonlightning> you can construct a loop using conditionals and jumps, yes
[08:09:58] <Moonlightning> that's how it's done in assembly, yeah?
[08:10:02] <Googie> That is.
[08:10:39] <Colgate> simple programs don't need loops either
[08:10:48] <Colgate> ones that do a single calculation
[08:12:57] <Googie> Just kept banging my head against the wall and starting various terrible projects until I eventually figured out (mostly) what I was doing :P

[08:16:23] <Phase> though i do miss inb/outb
[08:17:34] <Googie> Basically, a function takes values, gives you a value. NOTHING ELSE. If given the same input, it must always return the same output.
[08:17:38] <Finnfinn> Moonlightning: You know how programming is math? Did it never occured to you that it's weird that you're not taking a mathematical approach?

[08:22:20] <Moonlightning> Googie: so...how do you do things like IO? <.<
[08:22:33] <Finnfinn> Moonlightning: Monads.
[08:22:56] <Moonlightning> Aha.
[08:23:14] <Moonlightning> I can't articulate it, but I feel like suddenly I understand why everypony has so much trouble with them.
[08:23:43] <Moonlightning> ...so...what's a monad? >.>
[08:23:45] <Finnfinn> It's difficult to explain. Monads are data types.
[08:24:29] <Finnfinn> Say you have a monad M and a data type t.
[08:25:01] <Finnfinn> Also, M is a monad for t. Then a monad defines the following functions:
[08:25:56] <Finnfinn> First one is to construct M for a given data type t. This so-called injection is usually called the return function.
[08:26:03] *** Quits: Compu (compu@snuggly.filly) (Quit: We'll be back soon for more snuggles!)
[08:26:09] *** Joins: Compu (compu@snuggly.filly)
[08:26:35] <Finnfinn> Formally, return maps t to a monad with t.
[08:26:46] <Finnfinn> return(t) = M t.
[08:27:54] <Finnfinn> Next up is binding. For... weird reasons, that function is called ">>=". Don't ask.
[08:28:24] * Moonlightning will ask later. >.>=
[08:28:26] * Phase asks
[08:29:06] <Finnfinn> The binding operator takes M t (a monad with datatype t) as well as another function producing yet another monad from t.
[08:29:10] *** Joins: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-vvuota.bredband.comhem.se)
[08:31:09] <Finnfinn> Monads seem gimmicky and if you were to ask me what the fuck to do with them, the answer would be "IO and stuff". You see, as states are bad for functional programming, Haskell doesn't support mutable datatypes. That leads to any function always returning the same output for any given input.
[08:31:59] <Finnfinn> You constructed a list of integers? Great! Want to append a new element? That's cool. Construct a new list, because the old one ain't changing.
[08:32:26] <Moonlightning> well, at least I won't ever have to wonder whether I should mutate or copy XP
[08:33:08] <Googie> (It leads to a lot of interesting changes in how you have to solve solutions)
[08:33:25] <Googie> (while i=0;i<10;i++) // Oh sorry, i can't change, it's now 0
[08:33:36] <Googie> Wait... that should be a for loop
[08:33:39] <Googie> Whatever :V
[08:35:01] <Moonlightning> That sounds to me like you're not thinking functionally.
[08:35:11] <Moonlightning> for loops are all about state.
[08:35:18] <Googie> Exactly.
[08:35:30] <Googie> Instead most of what you want to do becomes recursion.
[08:35:39] <Moonlightning> Hah! I knew it!
[08:35:44] <Moonlightning> This reminds me of Lisp.
[08:35:56] <Googie> (Or just using an existing higher order function that is basically recursion anyway)

[09:29:39] <Googie> Honestly though, my advice is just to read up at anandtech.com and look at benchmarks for the CPU
[09:29:44] <Twilightlicious> I currently use an FM2 Mobo :P
[09:30:00] <Googie> Motherboard doesn't matter as much, there's virtually no impact on performance as long as it has the features and the socket that you need.
[09:30:11] <Twilightlicious> Socket is what im refering to
[09:30:22] <Twilightlicious> Thinking about switching to AM3+, Because i think Intel is too expensive
[09:31:21] <Gigabit> I would wait till the new socket drops
[09:31:29] <Googie> Intel's high end is overpriced certainly.
[09:31:34] <Gigabit> Unless you don't want to have to buy new ram too
[09:32:20] <Twilightlicious> I mean, if a new socket type is coming out that will have an impact on performance, i can wait.

[09:42:08] <AppleDash> so there's that
[09:42:28] <Googie> The cost of the i7s is overpriced compared to what you get in my eyes.
[09:42:35] <Twilightlicious> Exactly.
[09:42:42] <Googie> Still much better performance with even the i5s though
[09:42:50] <Twilightlicious> For the Price, AMD Owns Intel :P
[09:42:59] <AppleDash> Well I mean
[09:43:11] <Gigabit> Rumors flying that Microsoft is looking at AMD
[09:43:25] <Twilightlicious> I doubt that'll happen
[09:43:31] <Twilightlicious> perhaps some kind of lame partnership or something
[09:43:32] <Googie> (Also If I wanted to be pedantic, the Xeons... hehehehe)
[09:43:47] <AppleDash> My quad core 4ghz CPU beats AND's 8 core 5ghz CPU
[09:43:52] <Googie> Yeah.
[09:43:52] <AppleDash> both in single core and all cores
[09:43:53] <Dusk> Googie what
[09:44:02] <Gigabit> I dunno.. MS could buy AMD with the change in Bill Gates couch cushiona
[09:44:08] <Googie> Dusk: Huh ?
[09:44:13] <Twilightlicious> but for the price, i could buy 2 or 3 or even 4 of them
[09:44:13] <Twilightlicious> compared to Intel
[09:44:16] <Dusk> The highest end Amd chip can't keep up even close to intel
[09:44:23] <AppleDash> And?
[09:44:27] <Dusk> Because Amd has always focused on threading
[09:44:29] <AppleDash> That doesn't help you with performance
[09:44:35] <AppleDash> you can't just jam more CPUs in to make it go faster
[09:44:38] <Dusk> Instead of performance in single tasks
[09:44:47] <Googie> I was stating that Intel has way better performance in general.
[09:44:48] <Colgate> depends on your use case, /shrug
[09:44:50] <Twilightlicious> Just saying :P
[09:44:57] <Googie> But that the i7s generally are overpriced compared to the i5s
[09:45:01] <Dusk> Whereas Intel had been doing well on both fronts
[09:45:09] <Dusk> That's not true
[09:45:46] <Dusk> I find their i7s well priced within their performance bracket
[09:45:48] <Colgate> if you do things that are heavily threaded, I would go amd personally
[09:45:49] <Googie> For the most part, all you get is hyperthreading, which is okayish under certain workloads.
[09:45:59] <AppleDash> I think that my CPU is reasonably priced

[09:46:31] <Googie> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-6.html for example
[09:46:32] <Dusk> Colgate the problem with that is that the new I7S beat the Amd ones with 8 cores
[09:46:35] * Colgate should have gotten something less powerful
[09:46:47] <Gigabit> I dunno, I do know that for the price I save over going AMD, it can buy me better on other fronts. That's my biggest treason for going AMD. And I like the underdog
[09:46:48] <Twilightlicious> Colgate, Trade me.
[09:46:58] <Colgate> Dusk: sure, but the 8core amds are cheaper
[09:46:58] <Googie> The ratio of price to performance drops off a bit with the i7s
[09:47:09] <Dusk> Sure
[09:47:13] <Googie> (That's for gaming albeit)
[09:47:27] <Googie> (But it's similar in a lot of other benchmarks)
[09:47:29] <Dusk> But you won't beat an i7 in performance
[09:47:32] <Dusk> So yea
[09:47:49] <Colgate> there is a big difference between performance, and performance/$
[09:47:50] <Dusk> It's Amds problem and they're working to fix it
[09:48:11] <Dusk> I think 250 was a fairly reasonable price for my cpu
[09:48:13] <Googie> Intel is king of performance at the high end, but performance/$ really drops off.
[09:48:36] <Twilightlicious> yeah lets say you're capped at 200$
[09:48:41] <Twilightlicious> AMD is going to win
[09:49:04] <Dusk> Eh
[09:49:06] <Googie> I think around $200 Intel still has some reasonable competition.
[09:49:17] <Dusk> I'm never gonna use Amd again for cpus
[09:49:20] <Dusk> I tried
[09:49:22] <Gigabit> I paid 165 for my CPU back in 2011. I well got by monies worth out of it
[09:49:25] <Twilightlicious> I don't think i've ever even seen an Intel CPU under 200
[09:49:26] <Dusk> But it's pointless

[09:50:06] <Colgate> yeah, I had the 965, the 125W version
[09:50:10] <Dusk> For what you're getting its amazing
[09:50:14] <Googie> Nah, I think you can get a quad core for about that much.
[09:50:20] <Colgate> was a good CPU, lasted me for 5-6 years or so
[09:50:21] <Googie> One of the lower cost i5s IIRC.
[09:50:46] <Googie> Might be mistaken.
[09:51:16] <Gigabit> That's why I am so torn to upgrade this fall. It would be cheaper for me but.. Will it last another 5 years

[09:51:28] <tiwake> planeshift does not like me it seems
[09:51:39] <Gigabit> If I go good on the CPU and GPU it should eh?

[09:52:50] <tiwake> <tiwake> yeah not really... screw C++ XD

[10:12:07] <Twilightlicious> people in the Xbox Preview Program have a changelog list they're supposed to update =/
[10:19:41] <Twilightlicious> do they make like.. PCI Express Adapters to move your PCI Express slot?
[10:20:03] <Twilightlicious> my friend says his slot is too close to the CPU to fit the GPU i just sold him >3>
[10:20:13] <Twilightlicious> i guess then it wouldn't sit right in the case
[10:20:15] <Twilightlicious> oh well ._.
[10:21:27] <Twilightlicious> oh, they did update the changelog
[10:21:32] <Twilightlicious> it's rather cryptic though
[10:21:48] <Twilightlicious> "Fixes for developer scenarios"
[10:28:00] <Twilightlicious> Apparently, you'll be able to use Xbox 360 controllers for Xbox One game streaming to windows 10 PCs
[10:29:00] <Phase> Twilightlicious, you can get adapters to let you use pci-e externally
[10:29:16] <Twilightlicious> what are they called?
[10:29:19] <Twilightlicious> lol
[10:30:07] <Twilightlicious> You can turn on an Xbox One by holding the guide button on an Xbox 360 controller
[10:30:21] <Twilightlicious> this makes me feel like the Xbox One supports the controller and it's just disabled :P
