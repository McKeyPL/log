[04:19:27] <Lapsus> they were in an old neon sign I had in the attic

[23:17:02] <Cepheid> About as far as I care is as well as the Canadian dollar does.  And if the US disappears, well, the Canadian dollar might actually DO better, who knows?
[23:17:26] <Cepheid> Of course, if the US is invaded and taken over somehow, we might have an enemy to our south, but then again..
[23:17:32] <Cepheid> We have the entire world at our backs.
[23:17:35] <Cepheid> Unlike the US. :P
[23:18:19] <Cepheid> "How dare you invade Canada, what have they ever done to you?  Besides beat you at hockey, and maybe tell you that you've been a bad country once or twice?"
[23:19:34] <Midnight_Tinker> Cepheid: Canada makes me sad, because they could have had french food and english hospitality, and instead they got English food and French hospitality
[23:20:14] <Cepheid> I won't dispute that.
[23:20:33] <Cepheid> I'm an Anglophone who can't speak French.
[23:20:43] <Cepheid> Because I was hearing impaired SINCE BIRTH.
[23:20:53] <Cepheid> And am thus jobless because of the city I live in.
[23:21:13] <Midnight_Tinker> so lets just agree: fuck the French. The rest of canada is pretty cool though
[23:21:28] <Cepheid> I have nothing against the Frenchment, most of them anyways.  Fuck the Frenchmen who insist on causing all sorts of fuckery regarding the language laws.
[23:22:18] <Cepheid> Most Frenchmen I've met are nice people.  They acknowledge that the people that cause all sorts of trouble with language laws are making them look bad.

[23:22:57] * RainbowHacks introduces you all to some Freedom
[23:23:00] <RainbowHacks> EXCUSE ME
[23:23:05] <RainbowHacks> DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT FREEDOM
[23:23:07] <Cepheid> It's not my bloody fault I don't speak or read French.  My parents were told I wouldn't be able to learn French because I was hearing impaired, 70% in both ears, and were told to pull me out of ALL French classes.
[23:23:11] * RainbowHacks kicks in your door
[23:23:54] * RainbowHacks only speaks english
[23:24:07] <Cepheid> I'd learn French if it wasn't for the fact that at this age, the classes in question cost $600+ a class, and I need to take several classes, and need SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF FLUENCY WORTH OF EXPERIENCE to be useful.
[23:24:15] <RainbowHacks> Which is weird because I grew up speaking spanish for the first 8 years of my lifw
[23:24:30] <Cepheid> Heh.
[23:24:46] <Cepheid> In my case, I need to be reasonably fluent.  Which means at least two to three years fluency.
[23:25:03] <Cepheid> And that's for even simple jobs like doing shelf stocking at a grocery store.
[23:25:21] <Cepheid> I
[23:25:32] <Cepheid> I would much rather move away from this city, but I can't afford it.
[23:25:36] <RainbowHacks> i'm just pissed off i can't speak the language i grew up speaking -.-
[23:26:00] <johnsey> maybe you should move to spain :D
[23:26:01] <Cepheid> I have nothing against the French.  I've come to realize that, unlike my parents, the French are not at fault.
[23:26:20] <Cepheid> It's a small group of people who are self-imporant.  Who put themselves and their beliefs first.
[23:26:25] <RainbowHacks> johnsey, even if I could stil speak it i'd barely be able to understand them
[23:26:33] <RainbowHacks> my family is mexican
[23:26:46] <Cepheid> Problem is, they get so much of the the attention, and work SO WELL at it, it's not even funny.
[23:26:48] <johnsey> it should at least be easier to relearn than a completely new language
[23:26:51] <RainbowHacks> a fair number of the pronunciations are different. it's like someone from boston going to texas
[23:27:03] <Cepheid> If you don't speak French, you can be fired from your position.
[23:27:14] <RainbowHacks> Cepheid, that's fucking stupid.
[23:27:18] <Cepheid> It doesn't matter WHAT you are doing.
[23:27:26] <RainbowHacks> Is that ALL of canada?
[23:27:28] <RainbowHacks> or just Quebec?
[23:27:42] <Cepheid> Quebec, and cities along the border of Quebec.
[23:27:52] <RainbowHacks> oh, that isnt really all that stupid then
[23:27:53] <Cepheid> Which includes where I am, Ottawa.
[23:28:05] <Cepheid> Yeah.  It's fair game, technically.
[23:28:09] <RainbowHacks> didn't quebec wanna become its own country?
[23:28:10] <Cepheid> I mean, I understand why.
[23:28:17] <Cepheid> But then, it's kind of ridiculous but...
[23:28:27] <Cepheid> Then you look at how Quebec handles it's language laws.
[23:28:52] <Cepheid> French is the only language required for employment.  You don't need to know English, even for government positions.
[23:28:56] <RainbowHacks> this shit right here is why america doesn't have any official languages.
[23:29:05] <RainbowHacks> because fuck you, learn english.
[23:29:10] <RainbowHacks> wait...
[23:29:25] <RainbowHacks> that's not.....no, wait, that's pretty much right. fuck you, learn english. murikuh.
[23:29:47] <RainbowHacks> can't legally be fired for not speaking english though
[23:29:49] <Cepheid> Everywhere else in Canada, the languages are English and French.  Though for the most part, Quebec only cares about the provinces next to it.
[23:30:35] * RainbowHacks herps and derps
[23:30:40] <Cepheid> So Ontario, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland/Labrador.
[23:30:51] <Cepheid> In those Provinces, you need to know English *AND* French.
[23:30:58] <Cepheid> If you don't know French, you're screwed.
[23:31:10] <Cepheid> Quebec, it's only French you need to know, which is kind of backwards and fucked up.
[23:31:22] * RainbowHacks is gonna visit vancouver
[23:31:30] <RainbowHacks> which is somewhere on the left side!
[23:31:34] <RainbowHacks> \o/
[23:31:38] * RainbowHacks knows her world geography!
[23:31:44] <Cepheid> English is the primary language there.
[23:31:48] <RainbowHacks> dat murikuh edumacation
[23:31:54] <Cepheid> Maybe Mandarin, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.
[23:32:04] <Cepheid> But those aren't official languages, so..
[23:32:14] * RainbowHacks is visiting a friend
[23:32:21] <Cepheid> Anyways, like I said, I don't have anything against the French.  It's only against those who push the languages.
[23:32:38] <Cepheid> I know quite a few people from Quebec who speak French, French and English, and English only.
[23:32:48] <Cepheid> I'd hate to see them all be inconvenienced by Quebec separating.
[23:33:05] <Cepheid> Among other issues.
[23:33:16] * RainbowHacks relaly hopes the american south leaves the union soon
[23:33:18] <RainbowHacks> *really
[23:33:30] <RainbowHacks> I lived there.
[23:33:32] <RainbowHacks> It's awful
[23:33:33] <Cepheid> Like the fact that it's not all Quebec nationals and Quebec citizens who care about who speaks what language, or who displays what culture, etc.
[23:33:35] <RainbowHacks> too fucking hot
[23:34:25] <Cepheid> All that matters is whether you care about the land you live on.  If you treat it as Canadian, Quebec, North American, Native American, etc..
[23:34:27] <Cepheid> It matters not.
[23:34:37] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[23:34:41] <Cepheid> Do you like where you live?  Fine.
[23:35:22] <Cepheid> Do you have a preferred language to speak in?  Fine.  Just... please, don't push it on others.  Is it the only language you speak?  Very well then, sorry, I can't speak with you.
[23:35:32] <Cepheid> I hope you don't take offense
[23:36:24] <Cepheid> I just want everyone to be happy.  Problem is, there's a few people in your little region of the country I live in who are trying to cause me trouble, trying to prevent me from living my life.
[23:36:44] *** Joins: sleumas2000 (uid91753@my.little.karaoke)

[23:37:06] <Cepheid> Anyways...  CHAOS!  MADNESS!  TECHNOLOGY!
[23:37:26] * Cepheid sends a bipedal mech to attack RainbowHacks.
[23:37:36] <RainbowHacks> D:
[23:39:41] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[23:41:49] <Cepheid> ... What?  I never gave it orders to fire.
[23:41:56] <Cepheid> Oh, right
[23:42:01] <Cepheid> I did give it orders to attack.
[23:42:03] <Cepheid> Nevermind,
[23:42:12] * Cepheid is too tipsy/drunk to even comprehend what they are doing.
