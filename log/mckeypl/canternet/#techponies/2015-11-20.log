[00:22:08] <Gladiolus> someone help me get networking under ms dos to work
[00:22:12] <Gladiolus> ‘cause i’m a nerd
[00:23:24] <Webster> Use FreeDOS and their network drivers.
[00:24:57] <Gladiolus> wouldn’t i be using exactly what i am now under msdos
[00:32:18] <Webster> DOS doesn't have a network stack so a program has to implement it all.
[00:32:35] <Gladiolus> Yeah I get that, I’m just having trouble actually /doing/ it.
[00:32:49] <Gladiolus> I found what seems to be working drivers, and ODIPKT, but ODIPKT gives me a weird error.
[00:36:14] <Gladiolus> “Cannot get MLID control entry” weird
[00:38:48] <Moonlightning> what the hell kind of operating system doesn't have a network stack??
[00:39:16] <JustAberrant> one used primarily before networking was a thing for that platform?
[00:39:43] <JustAberrant> the standard ROM for my dragon32 also lacks networking stack for similar reasons ;p
[00:42:05] <JustAberrant> <Moonlightning> In Perl, is there not just a way to check if a string starts with another string?
[00:42:19] <JustAberrant> you could use the index function or something similar, but the regex for that is so trivial why not just use it?
[00:42:55] <Moonlightning> I feel like a regex is overkill for this.
[00:43:02] <Moonlightning> Also, I'd have to escape a lot.
[00:43:37] <JustAberrant> perl is largely built around regex, it's kinda the default how to get stuff done 
[00:43:44] <Gladiolus> i don’t even know why i want to network in dos
[00:43:45] <Gladiolus> i just do
[00:43:50] <JustAberrant> which is probably why perl code is usually a pile of snakes
[00:43:59] <Moonlightning> Gladiolus: the power of satan compells you?
[00:45:18] <Seoson> The looks when someone discovers an MSDOS device on their network xD
[00:45:30] <JustAberrant> Gladiolus: you probably need some kind of TSR type hack or a program that includes it's own networking stack like some games did
[00:46:07] <Gladiolus> Kinda, what I’m finding out is a need to get the oldass driver to work in netware mode, and then a TSR to translate
[00:46:13] <Gladiolus> The problem is coming up with the TSR
[00:46:22] <JustAberrant> trumpet used to be the shit?
[00:46:34] <JustAberrant> you still then need something that will use the TSR to do something useful
[00:46:47] <Gladiolus> Arachne is what I’m trying to use
[00:47:13] <JustAberrant> never heard of it
[00:47:20] <Gladiolus> dos browser o3o
[00:48:11] <JustAberrant> something like that you'd expect would have it's own stack or at least a recommended setup
[00:48:26] <Gladiolus> it does but said setup won’t recognize my shiz
[00:48:38] <JustAberrant> well then you're screwed ;p
[00:48:40] <Gladiolus> it’s odd like this all seems to work but when I try and get the driver to load into the spot arachne wants, it implodes

[01:24:29] <Gladiolus> I did that once
[01:24:29] <Gladiolus> getting the ping/pong is hard
[01:24:29] * Moonlightning has an unfinished program on his project stack that was inspired by the pingpong thing
[01:24:29] <Colgate> Seoson: probably Shutter
[01:25:03] <Moonlightning> actually, it's gotten pushed out of the stack
[01:25:03] <Moonlightning> but still
[01:26:54] <Moonlightning> If it were finished, you could have it spawn an instance of `gnutls-cli` and `sed`, and connect them such that it would pingpong automatically while still letting you type to the `gnutls-cli` and showing you everything that happened
[01:26:54] <Seoson> Oh and yeah I just checked. It does indeed a 301

[02:01:26] <JustAberrant> wherever filter came from, perl and grep probably came first ;p
[02:01:49] <Moonlightning> but `filter` makes more /sense/
[02:02:02] <Moonlightning> it's not necessarily applying a regular expression, and it's certainly not printing anything
[02:02:14] <Moonlightning> i.e. it's not doing the rep in grep
[02:02:16] *** Quits: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: )
[02:02:25] <Moonlightning> so if anything, it should be called g() -.-
[02:02:30] <JustAberrant> meh
[02:02:53] <JustAberrant> perl is a jumble of stuff from different places, people know what grep means because grep the utility has been around forever

[02:03:53] <JustAberrant> and perl never sought to be intuitive
[02:04:01] <Moonlightning> :/
[02:04:13] <JustAberrant> infact perl is practically famous for not being intuitive
[02:04:27] <JustAberrant> it has a wide and varied set of specific syntax that you just have to know
[02:04:29] <Moonlightning> you know what I need
[02:04:40] <Moonlightning> I need an easy way to invoke external programs in Python
[02:04:44] <JustAberrant> and the mechanics themselves are not exactly obvious with regards to scope

[06:31:31] <Deathpony> could probably run Windows on an Xbox One
[06:31:34] * Moonlightning pings Googie.
[06:32:29] <Googie> Well, older consoles certainly didn't use a proper "operating system". More just a boot loader
[06:33:10] <Googie> The PS3's kernel was also a FreeBSD fork IIRC
[06:33:10] <Phase> if that
[06:33:21] <Phase> depending on how old we're talking
[06:38:02] <Googie> Moonlightning: The biggest thing is just to make sure you're getting a "True Sine Wave" UPS.
[06:38:47] <Moonlightning> As opposed to what? O.o
[06:39:38] <Googie> As opposed to a modified sine wave.
[06:40:04] <Lapsus> Phase: While fo4 might not be a good indicator of a machine's power, someone being happy that their machine will play the games that they want to play is a good indicator that it's a good match for them :3
[06:40:12] <Moonlightning> modified sine wave? o.O
[06:40:23] <Lapsus> if I'm not making sense, I blame pills and tiredness :D
[06:41:08] <Lapsus> Moonlightning: Some UPSes don't generate very "clean" power, and some electronics don't like, or sometimes won't survive a shitty one
[06:41:14] <Googie> Moonlightning: http://www.elinz.com.au/assets/images/pure%20sine%20wave%20inverters.jpg
[06:41:16] <Phase> i meant more that FO4 is a bethesda game and naturally lacking in performance
[06:42:04] <Lapsus> Phase: I don't know about lacking in performance, aside from the 60fps cap, unless you mean that it's just generally unoptimized :v
[06:42:31] <Lapsus> then again it will also run surprisingly nicely on a bunch of older systems, so it's all a tradeoff
[06:42:32] * Phase doesn't actually own FO4
[06:42:59] <Googie> I've seen some pretty bad performance hiccups in Fo4, but I've heard that a lot of that might just be me running it in Windowed mode.
[06:43:02] <Phase> what i've been seeing is stuff like lower detailed terrain still being rendered even though it's obscured by the higher detail
[06:43:06] <Moonlightning> Googie: I dunno much about electric stuff, but that don't look good :P
[06:43:18] <Phase> and... that's actually the worst i've heard

[06:43:37] <Phase> though i've never heard someone say "runs great!" about a modern AAA game
[06:44:08] <Phase> better than oblivions 2k polygon rocks i guess
[06:44:22] <Lapsus> I stopped having LOD issues once I dropped the game onto my ssd, but it might be related to the windowed mode issues also
[06:44:26] <Googie> Basically, a lot of devices are fine with Modified sine wave, but certain ones really don't like it. I know a friend had an issue since his Computer's PSU really didn't like the modified sine wave.
[06:45:03] <Googie> Yeah, the game has issues with caching everything... reminds me a little bit like RAGE at launch.
[06:45:15] <Lapsus> the square-like approximations of modified sine inverters cause all kinds of harmonic noise etc
[06:45:28] <Googie> But nowhere near as bad, especially once moved to an SSD.
[06:46:03] <Lapsus> It'd probably be really annoying to try running radio stuff from modified sine power, but that's almost all 12v anyways so it'd be silly as heck too
[06:50:07] <Moonlightning> So, true sine wave. Anything else to keep in mind?

[14:00:30] <johnsey> doesn't change that placing technical refs and such all around you would be pretty awesome
[14:01:16] <Sour_Sweet> Just turn any surface into a monitor and physically interact with it. That'd be amazing.
[14:01:24] <johnsey> the hololens would be a good compromise, though nothing beats virtually placing yourself in $your_favorite_location
[14:03:40] <Sour_Sweet> Sadly the immersion ends when you run into a wall or trip over something. Hololens solves that by using your actual environment, which seems like a reasonable way to me, even though the potential use cases are way more limited

[16:52:53] <Sour_Sweet> "Firefox has stopped this website from asking you for permission to install software on your computer. Allow?" [My free translation] WTF? How is this going to protect me if you ask me anyway?
[16:54:12] <johnsey> because maybe you want to install that software?
[16:54:40] <Sour_Sweet> But that it could just show me the install addon dialog directly
[16:54:46] <Sour_Sweet> than*
[16:55:23] <Sour_Sweet> I don't see the point in an additional dialog
