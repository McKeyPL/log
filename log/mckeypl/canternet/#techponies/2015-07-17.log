[05:32:32] <Sombra> Or, even better, the total power usage of your computer, on a live scale.
[05:33:41] <Phase> i don't think there's a standardway
[05:33:55] <Phase> Sombra, powertop gives you an aproximation though
[05:34:28] <Moonlightning> Sombra: intuitively, I feel like the most accurate way would be to put a meter between the machine's power supply and the wall socket. :P
[05:34:59] <Moonlightning> I'm sure such meters exist. The question is where you would get one and for how much. And I have no idea about that.
[05:35:12] <Phase> ^ they do exist and don't tend to be that expensive
[05:35:36] <Phase> buy them online though, they're WAY overpriced in stores here
[05:35:45] * Phase assumes it's the same in the states
[05:35:54] <Sombra> Would there be a way to calculate power usage based on CPU TDP and current clock speed?
