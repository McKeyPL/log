[02:10:43] <Sour_Sweet> Continue: DANE will allow you to create your own CA for your domain

[02:11:36] <Moonlightning> That would be /really/ nice.
[02:11:47] <Sour_Sweet> The later case is already adopted by reasonable mail providers
[02:12:26] <Googie> Unfortunately DANE library support sucks at the moment.
[02:13:05] <Divide|TechSupport> gu.  As far as laptops are concerned, Windows 10 is a gigantic bowl of steaming hatred.
[02:13:09] <Sour_Sweet> Yes. Browser's don't even check DNSSEC yet by deault not even mentioing DANE
[02:13:11] <Googie> Got DANE support in a few IRC clients waiting on the fact that DANE in GnuTLS currently has a convoluted dependency on openssl in many distros.
[02:13:34] <Moonlightning> the fuck
[02:14:19] <Sour_Sweet> It will take a couple of years for DANE to become a widespread thing outside of mail transport sadly.

[02:29:30] <Sour_Sweet> Uhh that sounds like a configuration nightmare, since custom root keys are not supposed to be part of DNSSEC
[02:29:44] <Colgate> or just... configure it to ignore dnssec for that zone
[02:30:00] <Sour_Sweet> Would make more sense ;-)
[02:30:44] <Moonlightning> man…I hope they guard that root key properly. ._.
[02:31:11] <Colgate> root zone rarely changes
[02:31:17] <HoneyDrops> I'm sure the CIA and NSA have a copy, should they lose it.
[02:31:21] <Colgate> so that makes it easier
[02:31:34] <Moonlightning> …
[02:31:38] <Moonlightning> well that just breaks everything!
[02:31:39] <Sour_Sweet> The current situation in which I route traffic through an unknown 3rd party service isn't very optimal anyway, so I will probably end up searching for another solution there
[02:31:47] <Colgate> also, fucking with the root zone would be extremely noticeable
[02:32:27] <HoneyDrops> Sour_Sweet: we ban the idiotic practice of treating connections based on physical location differently?
[02:32:50] <Sour_Sweet> That would be an amzing utopia!

[02:34:38] <Googie> There's what, 150 or so trusted root certificates by default :/
[02:34:39] <Colgate> they have Dell's at the very least!
[02:34:43] <Moonlightning> Googie: well, yes! Because that breaks the //entire system!//
[02:35:00] <Colgate> everyone knows the CA system is broken :P
[02:35:15] <Googie> DANE isn't perfect, but at least it's /less/ broken.
[02:35:26] <Moonlightning> It's broken in that critical way, though, apparently :/
[02:35:33] <Moonlightning> So what we NEED is grassroots signing
[02:35:43] <Moonlightning> WoT, not hierarchical CA-based or DNS-root-based
[02:36:30] <Sour_Sweet> DNS root based sounds like the most reasonable solution to me. WoT failed to work for PGP for example
[02:37:35] * Sour_Sweet is currently looking up a few cheap US VPS providers
[02:37:54] <Colgate> buyvm!
[02:38:17] <Sour_Sweet> Could also use it for primary DNS.
[02:38:25] <Googie> Depending on how cheap you are looking, lowendbox.com is decent for finding providers.
[02:39:24] <Moonlightning> Sour_Sweet: if it can be forged by a government, then it's not reasonable.
[02:40:28] <Sour_Sweet> I favor tamper evident than pseudo tamper resistant
[02:40:38] <HoneyDrops> ^
[02:40:44] <Moonlightning> Well, yes, of course.
[02:40:52] <Moonlightning> The systems then have to toss up a warning, though. :P
[02:40:54] <Googie> The problem is that from what we've seen, the WoT model has issues taking off in practice. DANE actually has a /chance/ of taking off.
[02:41:20] <Googie> The choice isn't between DANE and WoT. It's between DANE and PKI
[02:41:34] <Googie> (And really it's not a choice /between/, but the point kinda stands)
[02:41:50] <HoneyDrops> The goal isn't to keep the NSA out, it's to make sure we have a million bells superglued to them so they so much a glace in the direction of something everyone knows.
[02:42:17] <Moonlightning> I don't want to have to check certificates by hoof every time I load a page, though.
[02:42:27] <Moonlightning> that would be vulnerable to MitMs of indirect requets, anyway
[02:42:34] <Googie> The problem is that if you keep working towards "perfect" security, and ignoring everything else, you'll have /no/ security.
[02:43:36] <Googie> Perfect solution fallacy.
[02:43:37] <HoneyDrops> The only perfectly secure computer is off, in locked safe, buried under the slab foundation of your house as long as you never leave.
[02:44:16] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> physical access is /complete/ access
[02:44:19] <Sour_Sweet> It's not like any of us can really protect ourselves from targeted gov. attacks. Just make it more difficult is enough for me

[03:36:10] <Sombra> I've used a 1920x1080 monitor in the past (which I've since lost) and combined with my gtx 750ti, I had no problem playing games... but I recently purchased a 2560x1440 monitor, and I'm wondering how much loss of framerate I'll have...
[03:36:26] <Sour_Sweet> Ola: I use WeeChat as well. Used to have a ZNC instance though ;-)
[03:36:38] <Googie> Significant. But only if you run the game at that native resolution.
[03:36:42] * Ola wants a bigger res
[03:37:00] <Ola> and most games i play are Minecraft and Second Life.

[04:11:18] <Moonlightning> Without exposure, you can't build a resistance
[04:11:19] <HoneyDrops> chicken pox is a virus, it's a bit different

[04:11:25] <Phase> ^ HoneyDrops
[04:11:37] <Moonlightning> My point stands!
[04:11:57] <Phase> but bacteria below some concentration simply can't sustain itself within the body
[04:12:10] <RazorSharpFang> I think if the initial population is too low, it requires time for the population to become threatening, DURING which, the body may work to make itself immune/defend itself.

[04:14:40] <RazorSharpFang> Just because something sounds legit doesn't make it so; Clearly, we need to dispatch a team of researchers and spend millions of dollars on this. XD

[04:19:10] <tiwake> bacteria are cut-throat... its not healthy to try and get rid of them as other bacteria will become the larger population and you get sick
[04:19:33] <Moonlightning> Good hygiene, yes.

[04:33:25] <tiwake> it also means I can more seriously consider building another server
[04:33:26] <Gladitide> itanium_graph.bmp
[04:33:30] <Gladitide> laff.wav
[04:33:35] <Phase> eyup
[04:33:42] <RazorSharpFang> No one uses itanium ?
[04:33:49] <Phase> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Itanium_Sales_Forecasts_edit.png
[04:33:51] <Phase> basically no one
[04:34:15] <Phase> i like there $35 BILLION PER ANUM estimate by 2002
[04:34:18] <RazorSharpFang> They were really optimistic
[04:34:26] <Phase> delusional'
[04:34:32] <RazorSharpFang> Why did it bomb so hard?
[04:35:05] <Gladitide> no x86 compat
[04:35:11] <Gladitide> amd64 came out and it had it
[04:35:19] <Gladitide> so everyone was like lol what does itanium offer
[04:35:20] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, would you buy a chip that's more expensive, available from only one vendor, and not compatible with any of your exising internal and vendor provided software?
[04:35:34] <RazorSharpFang> Phase: No way. Oh...
[04:35:38] <Gladitide> it also requires RDRAM, I think?
[04:35:44] <Gladitide> or is that just the first gens
[04:35:45] <Gladitide> no idea
[04:35:52] <Phase> not a clue
[04:35:53] <tiwake> ARM has a huge amount of software and dev stuff already built for it
[04:36:03] <Phase> ARM has momentum and competition
[04:36:09] <tiwake> so ARM leaking over into the server market is no surprise really
[04:36:38] <Phase> and even things like msvc are getting arm support now
[04:36:44] <Phase> windows too
[04:36:59] <Phase> didn't they drop itanium support from msvc recently?
[04:37:02] <tiwake> I wouldent mind ARM for desktop builds too, but thats going to be more difficult in general
[04:37:27] <RazorSharpFang> Wouldn't like... the majority of desktop software not work on ARM?
[04:37:43] <Phase> windows software? yeah
[04:37:48] <Phase> pretty much all of it
[04:38:03] <Phase> don't buy a windows rt tablet
[04:38:21] <RazorSharpFang> I suppose the Operating System could use an internal emulator but... the speeds would be awful.
[04:38:32] <tiwake> it wouldent be a problem for me, because I'd get an AMD video card and I can just build all the software (X11, drivers, desktop manager) for ARM and it wouldent be a problem
[04:39:02] <RazorSharpFang> tiwake: What if you wanted to run proprietary software without available source?
[04:39:09] <tiwake> then you are screwed
[04:39:32] <RazorSharpFang> Would an x86 emulator be difficult to write?
[04:39:34] <tiwake> but I'm not, cause I don't... uh, except for maybe teamspeak
[04:39:50] <tiwake> teamspeak probably has ARM builds somewhere though
[04:39:52] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, qemu already exists
[04:40:00] <Phase> and will do user mode emulation
[04:40:14] <RazorSharpFang> I swear, everything I think of already xists.
[04:40:23] <tiwake> pretty much
[04:40:28] <Phase> you'd be amazed
[04:40:35] * Phase still manages to find things that don't
[04:40:42] <Phase> or if they do, aren't useful
[04:40:51] <tiwake> Phase: if you count build quality... yeah
[04:41:03] <Phase> it's not even build quality
[04:41:13] <tiwake> donno
[04:41:17] <Phase> what would you use for sensor data/metrics?
[04:41:19] <tiwake> I'm a machinist
[04:41:21] <Phase> on a small to medium scale
[04:41:32] <Phase> because everything i find is lolhuge hbase scale-out
[04:41:33] *** Quits: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21) (Quit: quit)
[04:41:36] <RazorSharpFang> Could you compile ARM code into x86 code? Is that a thing?
[04:41:40] <Phase> or very limited
[04:41:50] <tiwake> so build quality to me means whatever it is not falling apart from a weeks worth of usage :P
[04:41:58] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, static recompilation, it's *possible* but i'm not aware of tools that do it
[04:42:24] <Phase> tiwake, it's that the tools i want, where they do exist, exist in such a way that makes them useless
[04:42:39] <Phase> so i'm using sql by hand mostly for temperature logging
[04:42:43] * Phase cbf to build an interface
[04:43:00] <RazorSharpFang> Not even a CLI?
[04:43:05] <tiwake> RazorSharpFang: how registers and stuff work between ARM and X86, and how different they are, I think it would be rather difficult
[04:43:12] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, psql
[04:43:34] <RazorSharpFang> See, I've never done databases, so I'm unfarmiliar with that acronym.
[04:43:43] <Phase> it's the command line client for postgres
[04:44:02] <RazorSharpFang> tiwake: I'm also unfamiliar with registers. 
[04:44:20] <Phase> it's the cpu's lowest level of working memory
[04:44:39] <Phase> you fetch from memory into registers, instructions operate on and output to them
[04:44:54] <Phase> generally
[04:45:01] <Googie> Phase: It's /kinda/ possible to do recompilation in a limited sense. Theoretically impossible to get working 100% though
[04:45:16] <Phase> i've never seen anyone actually do it though
[04:45:22] <Googie> With human guidance it can be done.
[04:45:34] <Phase> or really put effort into tools for it
[04:45:41] <RazorSharpFang> But it can't be done entirely without human help?
[04:45:48] <Phase> its mostly jit'ing emulators
[04:45:51] <tiwake> Googie: as I would imagine it... like trying to translate written language from something like japinese to english
[04:46:01] <Googie> Phase: I'm talking static recompilation
[04:46:13] <Phase> yeah, i've never seen tools for it
[04:46:24] <tiwake> or rather, from english to japinese
[04:46:29] <Googie> tiwake: It's worse than that even
[04:46:47] <Phase> http://xkcd.com/1605/
[04:46:48] <PinkiePieBot> [ xkcd: DNA ]
[04:46:50] <RazorSharpFang> I imagine the code generated would be VERY slow.
[04:46:52] <tiwake> its easy to go from japinese to english, but not the other way around
[04:47:10] * Phase isn't sure why it'd be harder either way
[04:47:22] <tiwake> maybe between pidgen and japinese
[04:47:28] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, slow is less of an issue than you think
[04:47:31] <tiwake> or something
[04:47:46] <Googie> Static recompiled stuff would be without slowdown
[04:47:58] <RazorSharpFang> I mean, slow as in unoptimized.
[04:48:19] <RazorSharpFang> You'd probably not be taking advantage of the CPU you're compiling to very well, I imagine.
[04:48:22] <Phase> only need something near 1/4 or 1/2 the speed of natively compiled code
[04:48:43] <Googie> People from the OpenPandora project actually statically translated StarCraft to ARM
[04:48:55] <Phase> Googie, that was static?
[04:49:01] <tiwake> http://softiron.co.uk/products/
[04:49:10] <Phase> i do know one of the pandora guys was doing real cool stuff with qemu user mode
[04:49:23] <tiwake> blarg
[04:49:24] <Phase> tranlating api calls for some of the larger libraries so they run in native code
[04:49:27] <Phase> gl for example
[04:49:35] <RazorSharpFang> OpenGL?
[04:49:38] <Googie> It was static
[04:49:40] <tiwake> that is another "we don't want to sell you one unit at a decent price" thing
[04:49:43] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, yeah
[04:49:55] <tiwake> come on, I just want one AMD A1100 system
[04:50:17] <RazorSharpFang> tiwake: Well, when you're catering to big business, you're NOT catering to single buyers.

[04:50:33] <PinkiePieBot> [ Starcraft - Software News - Pyra Handheld Boards ]
[04:50:54] <RazorSharpFang> So... are they using software rendering then?
[04:50:56] <Googie> Reversed back into C, and then compiled for ARM in that case
[04:51:00] <tiwake> RazorSharpFang: I run my own server, I want a server board thats low power with lots of SATA ports
[04:52:09] <Googie> The markup on those sort of systems is too much for people like you and I tiwake
[04:52:41] <RazorSharpFang> tiwake: Maybe get it through a third party?
[04:52:51] <tiwake> Googie: yeah. I just need a board, not support, or software, or much of anything, just the board
[04:52:54] <Googie> R&D costs, marketing costs...
[04:53:12] <Googie> support costs. All this costs them even if you don't use it
[04:53:24] <Googie> A board without a manual at all wouldn't be much use :P
[04:53:48] *** Sour_Sweet is now known as Seoson|BNC
[04:53:51] <tiwake> all boards have documentation somewhere
[04:54:02] <RazorSharpFang> Ah, I really want a raspberi pi. 
[04:54:23] <tiwake> you cant have a project like that without any documentation, even if such information is internal only
[04:54:33] <Googie> For low margin items, a much more significant percentage of the cost goes into One-off setup costs
[04:54:42] <Googie> Like writing said documentation
[04:54:56] <Googie> Hence they have to charge more to the few consumers they have
[04:54:57] <Phase> volume dilutes setup costs
[04:55:16] <RazorSharpFang> I love dilution.
[04:55:42] <Googie> Your best bet is basically always going to be obtaining used hardware
[04:55:43] <RazorSharpFang> Except whe it's my shares that are diluted.
[04:56:03] <Googie> Or more mass market hardware
[04:56:37] <Phase> EFI and ACPI are architecture-agnostic, windows works on ARM and at one point was on MIPS, PowerPC, and ALPHA
[04:56:47] * Phase has an alpha
[04:57:03] <Phase> cool piece of poorly built crap
[04:57:11] <Googie> I keep eying old SUN hardware
[04:57:26] <Phase> if you ever get a digital personal workstation, get a scsi drive
[04:57:33] <Phase> nasty bug on the secondary pci bus breaks ide
[04:57:39] <Phase> i have no idea how that made it into production
[04:58:22] <Phase> fans under spec, crappy custom psu
[04:58:59] <Phase> GPU from a company that no longer makes GPU's
[04:59:02] <Phase> they make planetariums now
[04:59:08] <RazorSharpFang> My pentium 4 is unhappy with me running Win7 on it. 
[04:59:52] <tiwake> I'm kind of hoping supermicro builds a board based on the A1100
[04:59:59] * Googie is idly reminded of his work experience at Sun. Went through the reboot and fault-clearing settings for a server that (at the time) would have been worth $300,000
[05:00:00] <tiwake> <3 supermicro
[05:00:31] <RazorSharpFang> That's a lot of money
[05:00:56] <Googie> Couldn't even reset the "Error" light without giving the code to Sun and getting the response code back
[05:01:23] <Googie> (Though obviously that wasn't an issue for me :P)
[05:01:26] <tiwake> I hate strict control like that
[05:03:18] <Googie> But to be honest, for a lot of that stuff, the overhead of just setting up decent distribution to /sell/ to an individual would probably cost more than it would ever make.
[05:04:13] <tiwake> depends
[05:04:33] <tiwake> on how you optimize work (production) flow
[05:04:51] <Phase> wonder how the mainframe market is doing these days
[05:04:57] <Googie> Which there's not a huge point in doing for low volume items, because optimizing production in itself is expensive.
[05:05:18] <tiwake> it really depends
[05:05:25] <Phase> i know you can still buy these huge sun sparc based things, used for weather modeling
[05:05:40] <Phase> but i imagine those nvidia cards are entering that market
[05:05:47] <tiwake> some shops are more suited to building small quantities, where others are set up to make zillions of the same thing
[05:06:06] <Googie> Yeah, and nobody does the latter for something that'll sell maybe 10,000 units.
[05:06:12] <tiwake> how you set up equipment really depends on the volume market
[05:06:23] <Googie> Over many years
[05:06:32] <tiwake> if I sold 10,000 of the same thing, I'd love it
[05:06:47] <tiwake> my shop is more optimized for smaller runs of stuff
[05:07:01] <tiwake> makes it difficult to switch over to high volume
[05:07:20] <tiwake> the reverse is true too
[05:07:57] <tiwake> a high volume shop is more difficult to make a few of a different thing
[05:08:18] <Googie> The point is, these aren't high volume items compared to stuff that is actually sold to the consumer. There are /huge/ setup costs for production of these things.
[05:08:23] <Phase> when you hit fully automated levels yeah
[05:08:36] <tiwake> I've worked in both kinds of machine shops
[05:08:53] <tiwake> well, larger volume, not ultra all-automated kind of volume
[05:08:56] <Googie> Not just production setup, but R&D, technical writing. Getting support into place to support the product.
[05:09:22] <Googie> Phase: Even for smaller stuff though. A small production run of an ASIC is still expensive.
[05:09:51] <Phase> Googie, yeah, i read about the actual costs at one point, forget the numbers
[05:09:55] <Googie> Especially if you also have to design that ASIC. And design/document the board. And write firmware.
[05:10:22] <Phase> which is why the write-once fpga things sell
[05:10:35] <Googie> IIRC just "template" itself is something like $50,000
[05:12:23] <Googie> And then they have huge costs per unit if you need a decent one.
[05:13:59] <RazorSharpFang> So, ARM is low power-consuming typically, when compared to x86 ?
[05:14:11] <Phase> yeah
[05:14:19] <Phase> in general x86 just takes too much silicon
[05:14:30] <RazorSharpFang> So, this translates to lower operating costs for servers.
[05:14:31] <Googie> ARM has basically always been really strong in the mobile device market.
[05:14:44] <Phase> intel atom's, despite being a generation or two ahead in silicon tech, are about on par with arm
[05:15:07] <Googie> Intel have huge advantages in fabrication technology, but they're struggling.
[05:15:10] <Phase> new amd chip though is on an even playing field
[05:15:20] <RazorSharpFang> Does that make ARM a better instruction set?
[05:15:32] <Phase> it has much less instruction set
[05:15:42] <Googie> No. Just a different instruction set.
[05:15:43] <Phase> and far less legacy
[05:16:01] <Phase> yeah, completely different architecture
[05:16:48] <RazorSharpFang> If it consumes less power for the same performance, does that not make it better?
[05:17:09] <Phase> it wont perform better at all tasks
[05:17:20] <Googie> You can't get anywhere near as much performance at the high end
[05:17:35] <tiwake> Googie: with ARM? why not?
[05:17:39] <RazorSharpFang> what is a high-end task?
[05:17:44] <Phase> completely different architecture and instruction set means completely different performance properties
[05:17:45] <Googie> You can span out to multiple cores/multi-cpu, but then you have to deal with all the multithreading issues.
[05:18:03] <Phase> modern x64 for example has instructions that implement AES
[05:18:15] <Phase> it's straight up better at AES than ARM is because of that
[05:18:16] <Googie> That also. There's stuff that you can do on x86-64 that you just... can't on ARM even.
[05:18:29] <RazorSharpFang> Just can't ?
[05:18:33] <Phase> aren't implemented in hardware on arm'
[05:18:36] * Googie has seen a talk where someone was implementing an instruction tracer using Intel CPU features.
[05:18:43] <tiwake> has to be compiled for those extra instructions though
[05:18:50] <Phase> you can, but atop the existing instruction set
[05:19:05] <Phase> not like a single pipelined instruction
[05:19:08] <RazorSharpFang> I thought ARM was turing-complete...
[05:19:19] <Googie> It is, but turing-complete is kind of a misnomer.
[05:19:27] <RazorSharpFang> How so?
[05:19:29] <Googie> Or at least, a lot of people don't really understand what it implies
[05:19:37] <Phase> it does not imply performance
[05:19:48] <Googie> Nor I/O
[05:19:49] <Phase> and you have to assume infinite memory
[05:19:55] <RazorSharpFang> Phase: I know that. I thought it meant that any problem that is solvable can be solved on it.
[05:20:11] <Googie> It can. But it might not be in a sane way.
[05:20:19] <RazorSharpFang> Who needs sanity?
[05:20:24] <tiwake> heh
[05:20:39] <Googie> The solution to implement an instruction tracer at that level without hardware support is to run a full blown CPU emulator.
[05:20:41] <tiwake> no one thing can be good with all the things
[05:20:50] <Googie> (Or modify the binary)
[05:21:15] <RazorSharpFang> I don't even know what an instruction tracer is. 
[05:21:27] <Phase> i'd assume arm has debugging infrastructure
[05:21:36] <Phase> hardware single-step and all that
[05:22:13] <Googie> Phase: This was for a modified afl-fuzz that didn't need instrumentation.
[05:22:24] <Phase> ah
[05:22:36] <Googie> So basically tracking what code has been executed, without modifying the binary

[05:25:15] <RazorSharpFang> I tried win10, but.... it didn't like it.
[05:25:18] <Compu> :P
[05:25:47] <RazorSharpFang> The graphics card is probably more powerful than the CPU.
[05:26:40] <RazorSharpFang> I got a Nvd GeForce GT 240. Which I assume is good.
[05:26:46] <Compu> use the graphics card as the CPU
[05:26:49] <Googie> tiwake: As of yet, I haven't seen any ARM devices that can compete in single threaded performance with high end x86. A lot of modern x86 CPU design has made tradeoffs for performance at the expense of wattage.
[05:26:56] <RazorSharpFang> Compu: Is that even possible?
[05:27:06] <Compu> maybe
[05:27:12] <Googie> So at the moment, if you need single threaded performance, it isn't really a contest.
[05:27:32] <RazorSharpFang> Googie: I thought a lot of high-end stuff wasn't using single threads.
[05:27:35] * Googie suspects that to get such single threaded performance, an ARM design would probably lose a lot of its power advantages.
[05:27:51] <Googie> Yes, but sometimes you can't get away from it.

[05:28:21] <RazorSharpFang> I'm sure there's a problem out there that just CANNOT have any benefits from multi threading.
[05:28:26] <Googie> There are plenty.
[05:29:31] <tiwake> Googie: sure, there are none made, but as far as I know, nobody has really tried to take ARM all the way up to compete with high end x86... most likely because effort to gain ratio being low, but technically I don't see why not
[05:29:57] <RazorSharpFang> You mean why it couldn't happen?
[05:30:49] <Phase> <RazorSharpFang> The graphics card is probably more powerful than the CPU. < for some tasks
[05:31:14] <Phase> and it may sound strange
[05:31:17] <Phase> but graphics is one of those tasks
[05:31:32] <RazorSharpFang> I'd probably get better performance using FFmpeg if it could use the grahpics card.
[05:31:35] <Googie> Yeah, but that's only really speculation.
[05:31:45] <Googie> In a lot of cases, encoders/decoders already can
[05:31:51] <Googie> I think FFmpeg has some GPU support
[05:31:54] <Phase> i think there's some cuda/opencl backends now
[05:32:25] <Phase> i like how gpu's are becoming big co-processors

[05:33:02] <Googie> Those are GPUs
[05:33:48] <Googie> (Modern CPUs include /some/ SIMD instructions, but for the most part don't operate that way)
[05:33:53] <RazorSharpFang> So it is a thing.
[05:36:01] <RazorSharpFang> If a species is protected, it's illegal to keep and propogate. How does that make sense?
[05:36:05] <Gladitide> modern cpus have so many damn instruction sets

[05:36:49] <Phase> do modern amd chips still support 3dnow?
[05:37:05] <Compu> remember when typwriter? :D
[05:37:05] <Gladitide> I think MMX and 3DNOW were subsumed into SSE2 or something.

[05:37:58] <Compu> tiwake: nope, my typewriter has a crap keyboard
[05:37:58] <Googie> Once you've implementing an instruction set, it's really hard to take it away again for compatibility reasons.
[05:37:58] <Phase> Gladitide, SSE* is probably a superset of what MMX/3DNow provides anyway

[05:45:21] <tiwake> NVIDIA hacks around a lot of things to ink performance on, with how well DirectX12 and vulkan are defined is more inline with how AMD develops their drivers

[05:47:23] <Googie> I mean, ideally, they'd both just stop adding in hacks to their drivers, and get developers to /fix their own damn stuff/, but then the other one would just take the advantage.
[05:47:46] <Phase> their hacks should be per-application

[05:48:56] <Googie> And it all adds complexity to an already huge codebase.
[05:49:24] <tiwake> I really hope Vulkan fixes that
[05:49:39] <Phase> tiwake, vulkan is about removing most of the API layer, since game engines have had to implement a lot of that state internally already
[05:49:53] <tiwake> or rather, would get rid of most of such things
