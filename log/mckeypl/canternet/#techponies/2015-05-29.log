[14:17:26] *** Joins: Rainb (rainb@Pony-cn5.akh.50.181.IP)
[14:18:36] <init3> Well against my better judgement I'll try the git version. 
[14:18:49] <init3> If not I'm downgrading this bitch. 
[14:19:58] <Googie> Needs more Weechat :P
[14:20:49] <init3> I like Konversation tho. Let me check that one out though. I am starting to get annoyed with it. It is just nice to have that level of integration with my DE. 
[14:21:39] <Googie> Weechat is CLI, but it has optional mouse control. Along with irssi it's pretty much the client of choice for power users these days.
[14:22:21] <init3> It looks a bit more usable than irssi. 
[14:23:04] <Googie> It has a lot more stuff built in, as opposed to needing scripts. The only thing really you probably want that's not default is probably buffers.pl (but it has a built in script manager to download it)
[14:23:04] <init3> I mean, it took me a good while to remember like a quarter of the vim shortcuts. 
[14:23:08] <AppleDash> Mouse on weechat is just... ugh
[14:23:24] <Googie> It's not too bad AppleDash :P
[14:23:31] <AppleDash> :(
[14:23:33] <AppleDash> I'm not a fan
[14:23:57] <init3> Well if I went CLI it would be nice to be able to leave it running on my server and just SSH/screen that. 
[14:24:32] <init3> But part of the thing I like about konversation is global keyboard shortcuts. 
[14:24:42] <Googie> Honestly, it's just for being lazy and clicking on buffer names. Scrolling the buffer is okay too.I do most stuff via keyboard these days, but mouse works well enough
[14:25:28] <init3> I don't really mind either. I mean, and IRC client is 99% keyboard. Moreso than more applications. 
[14:25:37] <init3> *an
[14:25:59] <AppleDash> Googie: That takes more effort
[14:26:13] <AppleDash> I can just alt-g and type a buffer name or number or a part of those and hit enter
[14:26:18] <AppleDash> I have now switched buffers
[14:26:46] <Googie> I'm often lazy and within range of my mouse, but not technically at my keyboard :P
[14:27:49] <Googie> Keyboard is faster, unless you're not at it :P
[14:28:02] <AppleDash> but
[14:28:09] <AppleDash> How does that work :P

[14:28:41] <AppleDash> I don't have that problem :P
[14:29:03] <init3> Can weechat do auto spell check? Kind of my issue with konversation atm. I have horrible spelling and noone must know.

[14:31:29] <AppleDash> lol
[14:31:42] <init3> Well, as an IRC paste
[14:32:13] <Googie> There's a command to actually correct the word, but since it also has a nice little display of the correct spelling, I take it upon myself to use it as an opportunity to improve my spelling :P
[14:32:52] <Googie> It's a really nice implementation. The Linux dictionary that I'm using is a bit... eeeh though. Occasional words it really should know, it misses.
[14:35:04] <init3> I don't want to learn how to spell. I just want the computer to do it for me. 
[14:35:37] <init3> Not like I know how to do long division anymore. Some skills are just no longer needed. 
[14:36:49] <Googie> Funny thing about that...
[14:37:15] * Googie was recently implementing some division logic, and needed to consult how to do long division properly again :V
[14:37:27] <Googie> (Recently, as in four days ago)
[14:38:05] <init3> heh
[14:38:52] <init3> We need to focus less on long division teaching and more on logic teaching. 
[14:39:10] <init3> I saw this gem (my paraphase) on FB this morning. 
[14:39:29] <init3> I want to insulate my garage but all the articles I see online are about keeping in heat from the north. Anyone know how to insulate for keeping in the cold from an AC unit?
[14:43:18] *** Joins: DataByteBrony (DataByte@Pony-vgeu1g.hfc.comcastbusiness.net)
[14:45:26] <DataByteBrony> probably similar.. you'll want to seal any drafts, of course.. and normal insulation works
[14:46:03] <DataByteBrony> insulation goes both ways, see - what it does is prevent heat transfer .. in-out or out-in, it doesn't care
[14:47:02] <init3> Well that's what I mean. I was making fun of the absurdity of it. 
[14:47:21] <DataByteBrony> heh
[14:47:24] <init3> Insulation is not one-way. 
[14:48:04] <DataByteBrony> it's what people usually hear it as, though - to insulate from the cold winter
[14:48:05] <DataByteBrony> xD
[14:48:54] * Googie idly reads up on insulation materials.
[14:49:12] <Googie> There are useful differences, but not for housing insulation :P
[14:49:49] <Googie> (Hot insulation materials don't need to worry so much about resistance to condensation :P)

[15:29:09] * AppleDash pokes any ponies who may know about networking and routing and stuff under Linux
[15:29:30] <urioxis> what's your problem AppleDash 
[15:29:43] <AppleDash> I don't have a problem, I need to know how to accomplish something
[15:30:20] <urioxis> oh heh :). Well ask away. If one of us can help, we will
[15:30:28] <AppleDash> I have a box with an Internet connection on eth1 and another machine on eth0, dhcp is being served on eth0 so that client can get an IP and such, and routing is set up so that the client can access the Internet
[15:30:56] <AppleDash> I want to make it so that the client(s) on eth0 (plural if I connect a switch or something) are given Internet access only through a VPN
[15:32:02] <DataByteBrony> i have never done that.. no idea..
[15:35:17] <init3> Just block everything on eth0 except the ports for the VPN
[15:36:07] <init3> Well some exception will need to be made for DHCP as well. Not exactly sure how that works but it should be easy enough to find. 
[15:36:30] <init3> And DNS if needed for the VPN.
[15:36:44] <AppleDash> No, but like
[15:36:50] <AppleDash> The clients aren't running a VPN app
[15:36:57] <AppleDash> The clients think they have a normal Internet connection
[15:37:00] <init3> oh
[15:37:02] <AppleDash> The routing box is running the VPN app
[15:37:09] <init3> okay
[15:37:21] <init3> So that box already has an active VPN connection?
[15:37:25] <AppleDash> Yes
[15:37:34] <init3> Is it its own interface?
[15:37:40] <Rylee> AppleDash
[15:37:42] <AppleDash> Yes
[15:37:44] <Rylee> your solution
[15:37:44] <AppleDash> Rylee
[15:37:52] <init3> route add default tun0
[15:37:55] <Rylee> is to play outside instead of wrorrying about tech
[15:38:02] <AppleDash> no init3, I can't do that
[15:38:04] <AppleDash> I want the box itself
[15:38:09] <AppleDash> to access the Internet normally
[15:38:17] <AppleDash> Only the stuff connected to eth0 goes through the VPN
[15:38:19] <AppleDash> Rylee: no
[15:38:32] <init3> Ahh
[15:38:52] <init3> In that case I think an iptables forward is what you want. 
[15:38:58] <AppleDash> Most likely
[15:39:02] <AppleDash> I don't know iptables
[15:39:18] <AppleDash> I tried messing around with it before
[15:39:37] <AppleDash> I think I corrupted my network stack (I know that's like, not possible, but I've fucked things up pretty bad)

[15:40:03] <init3> Heh
[15:40:07] <init3> Well let me think
[15:40:45] <init3> Is that VPN only expecting one IP address to connect to it or can it route multiple addresses? In other words will you need to make it NAT?
[15:41:03] <AppleDash> Yeah, I'll need to make it NAT I'm fairly certain
[15:41:14] <init3> ok
[15:43:13] <init3> I mean it should be just a standard NAT setup. Something like iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -o $VPN_IFACE -j MASQUERADE
[15:44:03] <init3> You'll also need to make sure you have net.ipv4.ip_forward enabled with the kernel. 
[15:44:19] <init3> How you do that is distro dependent. 
[15:45:06] <Rylee> <AppleDash> I think I corrupted my network stack (I know that's like, not possible, but I've fucked things up pretty bad)
[15:45:06] <AppleDash> Oh yeah, I've got that enabled
[15:45:08] <Rylee> story of your life
[15:45:10] <AppleDash> xD
[15:45:17] <Rylee> anyways peace bitches
[15:45:19] <init3> Though to be honest on my server I hate dealing with all the rules and how long my iptab
[15:45:23] <init3> shots fired
[15:45:52] <init3> how long my iptables script becomes so I just lazy mode it and use shorewall.
[15:46:11] <init3> Makes a nice set of config files and configures iptables for you. 
[15:46:24] <init3> However, I'll say it is a really good thing to learn iptables. 
[15:47:14] <AppleDash> Yeah
[15:47:17] <AppleDash> I've been trying
[15:47:19] <AppleDash> I hate it
[15:47:27] <Googie> iptables + nat is what I would suggest too.
[15:48:00] <AppleDash> I need to like, know the commands, honestly
[15:48:05] <AppleDash> I've researched this for hours
[15:48:10] <AppleDash> All I managed to do was break networking
[15:48:47] <init3> Look, I've been a sysadmin for 6 years now and still look up the iptables syntax for anything not simple. 
[15:49:06] <AppleDash> lol
[15:49:14] <init3> Like a ip block of port forward I can do off the top of my head but that's about it. 
[15:49:54] <Googie> I don't think I could do that, I just look at my existing IPtables rules and copy the one above :V
[15:50:28] <init3> Well after 3 or 4 years some iptables starts to stick lol.
[15:50:53] <init3> You'll get there eventually yound padawan. 
[15:50:53] <Googie> AppleDash: Do you have multiple interfaces on that box ?
[15:51:00] <init3> 3
[15:51:02] <AppleDash> Yes, as I said
[15:51:05] <Googie> Ah, whoops.
[15:51:09] <AppleDash> I have 2 ethernet interfaces and a VPN interface
[15:51:18] <init3> WAN, LAN and public wlan. 
[15:51:48] <init3> But if you mean logical interfaces
[15:51:50] <init3> hmm
[15:51:56] <AppleDash> ?
[15:52:14] <AppleDash> Also, I've been doing this for 3 or 4 years
[15:52:30] <init3> 3 physical interfaces, 7 logical interfaces. 
[15:52:54] <AppleDash> init3: What're you on aboue

[15:53:02] <AppleDash> about*
[15:53:03] <init3> Derpy is a hard worker. 
[15:53:14] <johnsey> that does what you want
[15:53:19] <init3> I just mean there are 3 ethernet connections to the server 
[15:53:36] <init3> but ifconfig says there are 7 connections in total.
[15:53:39] <AppleDash> johnsey: I have no idea how to interpret that
[15:53:42] <AppleDash> init3: Nobody asked you
[15:53:42] <init3> excluding lo
[15:53:51] <init3> oh.
[15:54:02] <AppleDash> I don't mean to be rude by that, but literally nobody asked you :P
[15:54:04] <init3> I got confused
[15:54:12] <Googie> If it's a bog standard "private VPN", then that won't work though
[15:54:16] <Googie> You'd need to do NAT.
[15:54:17] <johnsey> on the road at the moment
[15:54:27] <AppleDash> Googie: Yeah, it is
[15:54:30] <johnsey> you want souce based routing
[15:54:32] <init3> You and Googie happened to get the same color nicks so I thought it was you asking. 
[15:55:02] <AppleDash> The whole point of this is because I'm running a wireless hotspot but I don't want random people using my IP
[15:55:06] <AppleDash> So I'll force them through a VPN
[15:55:09] <johnsey> everything from the NAT ip range should have a default route thru the tunnel on the router
[15:55:46] <johnsey> you cab do it by setting up a routing table for that source range
[15:56:14] <johnsey> that page explains how for a single ip
[15:56:32] <johnsey> just adapt it for the whole net
[15:57:17] <init3> Oh right. I forgot about scope. derp.
[15:57:37] <AppleDash> I am like, in way over my head with this
[15:57:42] <init3> THat'd be the way to do it. 
[15:57:43] <AppleDash> I don't do routing and stuff >.<
[15:57:56] <Googie> Actually, yeah, thinking about it, routing like that would be the correct way.
[15:57:57] <init3> johnsey's method should only be one command though. 
[15:58:51] <init3> The only thing I'm concerned with is if the VPN will have an issue with multiple IPs... oh no it's not even going to care is it?
[15:59:00] <AppleDash> I dunno if it will
[15:59:06] <init3> No, it shouldn't
[15:59:10] <init3> Actually
[16:00:10] <init3> Well, it *might*. I don't think it will care though
[16:00:14] <AppleDash> I should probably actually boot the box
[16:00:23] <AppleDash> And see what state it's in
[16:00:33] <johnsey> you will need NAT for IPv4
[16:01:29] <init3> I would imagine some VPNs wouln't care if they do a NAT for you. 
[16:01:55] <init3> Which they would have to at some point. 
[16:02:17] <init3> Though it may be 1:1
[16:02:35] <init3> And mean only one machine will work.
[16:02:47] <init3> Well I'd try it without NATing it but you might need to.
[16:03:14] <AppleDash> Oh dear got
[16:03:18] <AppleDash> god*
[16:03:24] <AppleDash> I was just going to hook up the machine to network
[16:03:40] <AppleDash> I then found that I have 2 ethernet cables between 2 ports of my main router and 2 ports of one of my switches
[16:03:42] <AppleDash> WTF
[16:04:15] <AppleDash> I'm not certain which one I should remove
[16:04:42] <init3> CUT THE BLUE WIRE!
[16:04:48] <AppleDash> They're both blue!
[16:04:57] <init3> FUUUCK
[16:21:07] <johnsey> just for ze background info: routing is normally destination based, so if you receive a packet on some interface, linux looks at the destination and picks the right rule from the default routing table. the most specific rule is prioritized, so if you have a rule for a /32, it's preferred over a rule for a /24. if something doesn't match anything, the default route is used. that much ...
[16:21:13] <johnsey> ... should be obvious. now, if you want source based routing, you can add a 2nd table and tell linux to you use that routing table for everything coming from a specific IP or network range. that table has its own set of rules and even its own default route. if you set your VPN tunnel as the default route in that table and specify that everything from the network range on eth0 is supposed ...
[16:21:19] <johnsey> ... to use that routing table, you should be set.
[16:26:10] <AppleDash> johnsey: That makes sense
[16:26:17] <AppleDash> But a couple questions...
[16:26:26] <AppleDash> I send the packet to the interface, OK, great
[16:26:30] <AppleDash> Now when packets come back in response
[16:26:38] <AppleDash> How does linux know to route it properly?
[16:26:52] <Googie> They'll be directly addressed to the right system.
[16:27:09] <AppleDash> I'm not sure how
[16:27:16] <Googie> (At least if the VPN on the provider's side is configured correctly)
[16:27:26] <AppleDash> I don't know how it's configured, so yeah :P
[16:27:34] <johnsey> it depends on your VPN. is this an openvpn?
[16:27:47] <AppleDash> Yes
[16:27:59] <AppleDash> PrivateInternetAccess is the provider if it helps
[16:28:43] <johnsey> I don't know it but I assume you receive a private IP range or at least 1 routable IP which is used to direct traffic through the tunnel
[16:29:08] <AppleDash> Yeah
[16:29:12] <AppleDash> I think so
[16:29:17] <AppleDash> At the moment I'm trying to SSH to the box
[16:29:21] <AppleDash> I'm getting a no route to host .-.
[16:30:22] <Googie> If PIA isn't configured to route/NAT a whole subnet, you might need to run NAT (iptables) on your end.
[16:30:29] <AppleDash> Wow, I didn't realize how many decvices I had on just my main router
[16:30:38] <AppleDash> devices*
[16:31:16] <Googie> (Well, actually route all incoming traffic on that interface)
[16:31:45] <AppleDash> So it would seem that this device is just not connected to my network
[16:31:51] <johnsey> so if your network range on the VPN is, say, 10.1.0.0/24 and the IP on the other end of the tunnel is 10.1.0.1, and your network on eth1 is for example 192.168.1.0/24, you have to set up NAT so that packets sent through tun0 use a source address from 10.1.0.0/24. NAT will also make sure that the response packets will be addressed at the the right IP in 192.168.1.0/24
[16:33:48] <johnsey> e.g. iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQUERADE  (the source range is optional in this case)
[16:34:13] <AppleDash> Once this machine is actually online I can tell you what's going on

[17:29:56] <AppleDash> Every time that the VPN reconnects
[17:30:00] <AppleDash> that 10.188 address changes
[17:30:04] <AppleDash> Can I omit it or something?
[17:30:37] <johnsey> no, you need it but you can script it
[17:30:45] <AppleDash> alright
[17:30:49] <AppleDash> Are routes persistent?
[17:30:55] <johnsey> through reboots? no.
[17:31:00] <AppleDash> OK, good
[17:31:06] <AppleDash> So I can just make a script to add it on every boot
[17:31:07] <johnsey> openvpn allows you to run scripts on up and down, too
[17:31:12] <AppleDash> Oh, neat
[17:31:20] <johnsey> so you can tie it all to the openvpn connection coming up and going down
[17:31:48] <AppleDash> Not working
[17:31:52] <AppleDash> can't ping 8.8.8.8 from a client
[17:32:24] <johnsey> you need to update your nat table
[17:32:31] <johnsey> add a rule for tun0
[17:32:38] <AppleDash> Uh
[17:33:05] <johnsey> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE

[17:37:27] <johnsey> may have to add that
[17:37:36] <AppleDash> Nope
[17:37:53] <johnsey> like, ip r a 10.0.0.0/24 dev eth0 table foo
[17:38:39] <AppleDash> Aha, it works!
[17:38:41] <AppleDash> Everything does
[17:38:55] <AppleDash> Thanks a bunch
[17:39:18] <johnsey> np
[17:39:44] <AppleDash> Now I'll just look into that openvpn thing to automatically do this
[17:39:55] <AppleDash> If I replace add with del it'll remove them, right?
[17:40:04] <johnsey> yes
[17:40:09] <AppleDash> Alright

[21:51:58] <AppleDash> Topsie: Thunderbird is good
[21:52:09] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: Gentoo sucks slightly less ever since I gave wolfyshy my root password
[21:52:15] <Topsie> Yeah, I've got that now xD
[21:53:04] <JustAberrant> AppleDash: hah :>
[21:53:14] <AppleDash> :P
[21:53:31] <JustAberrant> and yeah, thunderbird is the only other half decent client I know
[21:53:47] <JustAberrant> but much as I hate microsoft, outlook would still be my preference.. it's like.. one of 4 things they actually do well
[21:54:56] <Seoson> Apart from using strange E-Mail formats that are not compatible with other clients and few other things.
[21:55:04] <AppleDash> So, networking pones who're here... How would you accomplish a captive portal with a Linux router without using prebuilt software? By captive portal I mean like... People connect to my wireless hotspot, and whenever they try to do port 80, they get redirected to a page where they have to read and agree to a TOS/AUP
[21:55:13] <AppleDash> Until they agree to the TOS, they can't access any real website
[21:55:18] <AppleDash> After they do, though, it works as normal
[21:56:16] <JustAberrant> mm
[21:56:26] <JustAberrant> m0n0wall has that built in, no idea what they use for it though
[21:57:23] <AppleDash> Hmm
[21:58:11] <AppleDash> I figure it'd just be a matter of waiting for new clients on the dhcp interface and adding iptables rules for them once they agree to the page (and having a default rule to point 80 at my web server)
[21:58:16] <AppleDash> I don't know how to do those rules though
[21:58:39] <AppleDash> Actually, ignore waiting for new clients, the default rule makes that not needed
[21:59:03] <JustAberrant> nah, cause nothing stopping someone from joining and just ignoring dhcp
[22:01:17] <Seoson> If you want it to be secure this is not an easy task. Even MAC adresses can be faked.
[22:01:52] <Seoson> (which is what I'd use for authentication) 
[22:02:05] <JustAberrant> port security + internal IPs locked down / specifically blocked at the edge.. default for everything else? :>
[22:02:43] <JustAberrant> you can't prevent someone from spoofing an ip/mac.. but you can block specific ones from certain entry points
[22:02:55] <JustAberrant> but yeah, serious overkill ;p
[22:03:06] <AppleDash> I don't need it to be secure
[22:03:18] <AppleDash> I just want to show them a page they need to click "yes" on before they can use the Internet
[22:03:55] <JustAberrant> that all sounds very dubious ;p
[22:04:11] <JustAberrant> I'd seriously wonder if that exposes you to less or more risk
[22:04:12] <Topsie> Oh btw, you click yes and now I own your soul
[22:04:23] <JustAberrant> because if you just have an open AP, you can claim ignorance
[22:04:37] <JustAberrant> but if you specifically are set up for public use, you may have an obligation to monitor it
[22:05:32] <johnsey> *) local laws may apply
[22:05:50] <JustAberrant> putting up a TOS probably does entirely nothing to protect you
[22:06:02] <AppleDash> JustAberrant: Everything is routed through a VPN anyways

[22:06:40] <AppleDash> I don't care about what people DO on the connection
[22:06:50] <johnsey> if you're in the UK or Australia, you're probably facing criminal charges with a life sentence for even thinking about putting up an open AP :P
[22:06:58] <AppleDash> Luckily I'm not
[22:07:28] <AppleDash> I care about them clicking "yes" to something with a line buried in there that says something along the lines of "We may capture, monitor, save, and/or modify any HTTP requests and responses that travel over our network"

[22:08:21] <AppleDash> It doesn't really matter too much anyways
[22:08:55] <AppleDash> Unless they bust out some special equipment along the lines of a spectrum analyzer but geared towards wifi, they won't even know where my AP is let alone who runs it
[22:09:44] <Topsie> You can use a phone to work out the direction of wifi
[22:09:48] <Topsie> I've done it xD
[22:09:58] <AppleDash> "direction", sure
[22:10:01] <AppleDash> "exact position", no
[22:10:09] <JustAberrant> 3 readings = position ;p
[22:10:12] <AppleDash> You need something a lot more sensitive
[22:10:14] <Topsie> Id need a maximum of 3 readings
[22:10:23] <JustAberrant> and yeah, you can totally do that ;p
[22:10:27] <Topsie> I wouldn't need an exact fix.
[22:10:28] <AppleDash> Those readings mean nothing in an area like mine
[22:10:40] <Topsie> Just an area in which is resides.

[22:12:04] <Topsie> Im saying that it wouldn't be impossible to be able to work it out
