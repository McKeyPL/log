[06:22:06] <Colgate> or something
[06:24:10] <Googie> I love how a lot of the regexes that I've got setup for URL detection in various things get murdered by the new gTLDs.
[06:24:32] <Googie> .horse becomes .ho in many cases...
[06:24:53] <Colgate> don't see why, each to just match everything after http:// and the first /
[06:24:56] <Colgate> easy*
[06:25:11] <Googie> I'll have to check what regex it's actually using.
[06:25:44] <Colgate> if it doesn't have the protocol it becomes harder though
[06:25:54] <Googie> (((https?|ftp):\/\/)|www\.)(([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)|localhost|([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.)*[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.(com|net|org|info|biz|gov|name|edu|[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]))(:[0-9]+)?((\/|\?)[^ "]*[^ ,;\.:">)])?
[06:25:56] <Googie> Okay then...
[06:26:24] <Colgate> yeah, that will only match those specified ones and 2 letters ones
[06:26:28] <Googie> Yeah.
[06:26:42] * Googie has been too lazy to look into it until now really :V
[06:26:49] <Colgate> also it wouldn't match all the possible TLDs since it doesn't include numbers or -
[06:27:27] <Colgate> it also doesn't match a single letter tld(will ICANN issue those?)

[06:52:29] <Gladiolus> That shit about the EULA is creepy but it appears they just pasted the onedrive EULA in.
[06:52:37] <Gladiolus> I hope they address this soon.
[06:52:50] <Gladiolus> 'cause yeah Colgate just pointed out why uh, will literally 0 corporations will want it as is.
[06:52:53] <init3> Once they get that sorted I may upgrade
[06:52:56] <Googie> "It's 2015, ISPs should have enough bandwidth for everyone to max out their connections at once"
[06:53:03] <init3> HAHAHA
[06:53:09] <init3> That's not the way it works
[06:53:12] <Gladiolus> lel
[06:53:13] <init3> I wish
[06:53:17] <Colgate> lol, yeah, not happening
[06:53:26] <Gladiolus> as if they don't provide the least possible bandwidth they can get away with
[06:53:42] <Colgate> they oversell bandwidth because they know not everyone will use it all the time, everyone in computing does this for rented resources
[06:53:46] <Gladiolus> edmonton is getting fiber next year o3o
[06:53:50] <Colgate> VPSes do it all the time
[06:53:58] <init3> I worked at a small datacenter and we gave every server (about 300 total) 100mbps and our uplink was only 300mbps. 
[06:54:09] <init3> And it was NEVER saturated
[06:54:37] <Colgate> kind of like how banks loan out more money than they have!
[06:54:49] <Gladiolus> Except here when you go over shit is just slow
[06:54:52] <Gladiolus> instead of imploding Greece
[06:54:56] <Colgate> lol
[06:56:52] <init3> Haha
[06:56:54] <Googie> Most "technical" people would be quite stunned if they realized just what the normal contention ratio for a "good" ISP is.
[06:57:53] <init3> Or how oversold VPSes or shared hosting is. 
[06:57:57] <init3> Comically
[06:58:40] <init3> Over-provisioning by three times roughly is usually fine. 
[06:58:58] <Googie> I've got a really really cheap VPS (well, 6) from these guys: http://lowendspirit.com/
[06:58:58] <init3> So long as the instances have mobility. 
[06:59:06] <Googie> I wonder what their contention ratios are :V
[06:59:22] <Gladiolus> I made my brother do dishes and gave him "50 gigabytes on my server (a core 2 I use as a file server and media server)." I only actually had thirty free.
[06:59:24] <Gladiolus> He forgot about it.
[06:59:25] <Gladiolus> win win
[06:59:27] <Googie> (VPSs for $3 per year :V)
[06:59:29] <Gladiolus> wiiiiin

[07:00:14] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i'm going to tinker with it more tomorrow, 'night
[07:01:07] <init3> Wow that sweet. 
[07:01:08] <Googie> DJ-C0L7[CSS]: Use a regex tester online and play around with it.
[07:01:18] <Googie> In the morning
[07:01:20] <Googie> Should help a lot
[07:01:23] * JustAberrant constructs an elaborate time machine to send Googie back in time to make love to William Bligh :(
[07:01:35] <init3> I might get one of those. 
[07:01:53] <Googie> The individual nodes suck, but you can get them for basically nothing, and they're geographically distributed
[07:01:56] <init3> Just a low end VPS is all kinds of usefyl. 
[07:02:12] <init3> For testing and like a personal email server it should be fine. 
[07:02:21] <Googie> I wouldn't use them for email
[07:02:32] <init3> No? 
[07:02:36] <Googie> (Especially since they're using nat for IPv4)
[07:02:42] <init3> Ooohhh
[07:02:44] <init3> balls
[07:03:11] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> i think thats the route i'll use
[07:03:22] <init3> If you can get a dedicated IPV4 it's be sweet
[07:03:32] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> thx for the help Googie, Colgate and init3
[07:03:39] <Googie> Not at that price sadly.
[07:03:45] <init3> I dodn't do anything though
[07:03:50] <init3> But you're welcome
[07:03:54] <DJ-C0L7[CSS]> lol
[07:04:53] <Googie> But also, the individual servers aren't the most reliable, even compared to most low end VPS providers, and they state that they don't keep backups at all.
[07:06:05] <Googie> It's just cool for experimenting with having your own little geographically distributed network, when using stuff that individual node failures don't really matter.
[07:06:59] <init3> It isn't that uncommon for VPS providers to not do backups. 
[07:07:18] <Googie> Most are starting to get the hang of it now.
[07:07:33] <Googie> Competition is really really high.
[07:08:05] <init3> Yeah. Pretty much why I'm laid off. I need to make a clean break from web/server hosting. 
[07:08:45] <init3> It is just tough because it can be so easy to get a job as a sysadmin at those places because they generally have high turnover. 
[07:09:25] <init3> THough nothing compares to Hostgator. I still can't believe I worked there. Even if it was only for 5 months. 
[07:09:41] <init3> Talk about not giving a shit about the customers. 
[07:10:02] <init3> And I've heard it has gotten way way worse since it got bought out. 
[07:10:08] <Googie> (Oh yeah, those lowendspirit guys, they have it in their terms that if you put in a stupid ticket, your account will be canceled :V)
[07:10:36] <init3> Lord, if we had those terms at HG there would be no customers. 
[07:11:19] <Googie> I remember having a hostgator account /way/ back.
[07:14:36] <Googie> Server costs for lower end stuff are starting to get almost scarily low these days.
[07:15:29] <Googie> I've heard stuff about a lot of VPS providers finding that the most expensive part of their plans is getting the IPv4 addresses from their datacenter.
[07:15:55] <Googie> Then you've got companies like OVH offering dedicated servers for 5 euros/m
[07:18:48] <Googie> Even the cost of hosting in Australia is finally starting to come into reach :P
[07:19:09] <Googie> Hope you find a new job soon though :/
[07:28:31] <init3> Yeah. I did have an interview at a huge bank on THursday but I'm not so sure if it went so well. 
[07:28:32] <init3> I hate phone interviews. Can't gauge people's reactions.
