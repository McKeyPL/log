[06:51:08] <JustAberrant> sounds like you got the wrong adapter
[06:51:18] <HoneyDrops> Non-standard ports are worthless
[06:51:41] <HoneyDrops> De-solder it and put in a proper 4-pin mini-DIN port
[06:51:47] <RazorSharpFang> !!Fark, they look SLIGHTLY different
[06:51:51] <JustAberrant> hehe, pragmatic solution ;p
[06:52:00] <JustAberrant> or buy a $5 adapter ;p
[06:52:20] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: This WAS the adaptor. This was supposed to work.
[06:52:40] <JustAberrant> * buy a $5 adapter that is the right connector ;p
[06:52:45] <RazorSharpFang> Maybe I'll have to use DVI -> VGA. 
[06:53:34] <RazorSharpFang> My monitor can't take DVI...

[06:53:40] <JustAberrant> oh
[06:53:49] <JustAberrant> yeah, do that
[06:53:54] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: My parents have an old Palsonic monitor lying around, and I wanted to utilize that.
[06:54:10] <JustAberrant> DVI to VGA is fine
[06:54:18] <HoneyDrops> make sure the DVI port has analogue out
[06:54:36] <JustAberrant> pretty much any vid card is going to support analog out on DVI I imagine
[06:54:42] <HoneyDrops> analog*
[06:54:44] <JustAberrant> I've never heard of a DVI-D only card
[06:55:08] <RazorSharpFang> I'm  sure the Nvidia GeForce 8500 GT has it
[06:55:11] <JustAberrant> DVI: because connecting a monitor should be complicated
[06:55:13] <RazorSharpFang> I mean it supports VGA
[06:56:07] <RazorSharpFang> But it only has 1 VGA port, whereas I've got 1 monitor that ONLY supports VGA, and another that supports VGA, Composite, 4-pin S-Video and Antenna analog.
[06:56:23] <HoneyDrops> I'd rather have DVI than HDMI.  Though I wish it was a smaller physical port.
[06:56:37] <JustAberrant> why?
[06:56:48] <RazorSharpFang> HoneyDrops: None of my monitors support HDMI OR DVI
[06:56:48] <HoneyDrops> Ports shouldn't have patents/licenses
[06:57:06] <JustAberrant> meh ;p
[06:57:26] <HoneyDrops> It defeats the whole point of a port - to connect things.  There should be no limits on who or what can be made to connect as long as it follows spec.
[06:58:01] <JustAberrant> double meh ;p
[06:58:08] <HoneyDrops> I also take the same stance on codecs and file formats.

[07:00:37] <RazorSharpFang> I was going to use SVideo -> Composite, but whatevs.
[07:00:46] <JustAberrant> don't have any local stores?
[07:00:59] <JustAberrant> seriously, I'm normally not a fan of buying anything tech related at a big box store
[07:01:15] <JustAberrant> but something like that.. find a staples or best buy or walmart and walk out of there with it 
[07:02:15] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: None of those stores exist here.
[07:02:46] <RazorSharpFang> Only computer stores are in the central shopping district of the city.
[07:02:58] <JustAberrant> hehe, I thought it was bad here
[07:02:59] <RazorSharpFang> You won't find them elsewhere.
[07:03:34] <RazorSharpFang> The closest you can find to a computer store is JBHIFI which only sells laptops in terms of computers.
[07:07:35] <RazorSharpFang> Gah
[07:09:42] <wolfyshy> where is 'here'?
[07:09:46] <wolfyshy> I need to make sure I never move there
[07:09:52] <wolfyshy> unless I go through with becoming amish
[07:09:54] <JustAberrant> well, there's very little as far as computer stores here as well
[07:10:13] <JustAberrant> but most of the big box stores have basic stuff like usb cables and dvi->vga adapters
[07:10:36] <wolfyshy> we have a tigerdirect, hhgregg, best buy, staples, apple store, and a few local computer shops that sell parts and cables and specialty stuff... all within an hour of me

[09:57:13] <Moonlightning> Why do I want MFA for GitHub?

[09:57:40] <Moonlightning> MFA for…password managers? root volumes? local /system logins?/
[09:57:49] <Moonlightning> That sounds horrible. I lose the thing, and I'm locked out of everything.
[10:10:15] <nscoots> I have been mildly tempted/curious of yubikey
[10:10:18] <nscoots> have yet to try one
[10:10:25] <nscoots> if you learn more do tell
[10:12:12] <Moonlightning> I…/guess/ it's useful for banking|Coinbase, the things that already require MFA?
[10:12:33] <Moonlightning> actual MFA, as opposed to SMS, which is hardly a good authentication method at all
[10:12:57] <Moonlightning> but…the same thing applies. If I ever lose the thing, I'm just locked out.
[10:12:59] <nscoots> well SMS isn't great but way better than naught?
[10:13:20] <nscoots> although I am rather peeved by the notion that one is their mobile phone #
[10:13:38] <nscoots> oh no you can't have a bullshit account without a mobile phone number
[10:13:40] <nscoots> could be fake
[10:13:54] <Moonlightning> SMS protects against weak thieves, but not strong thieves or government-level attackers
[10:14:01] <nscoots> mmm
[10:14:17] <Moonlightning> A strong thief could also steal my phone, and isolate it from data but not text networks
[10:14:29] <Moonlightning> intercept the text message as it comes in.

[10:16:58] <Moonlightning> Then again, a strong thief could also steal the physical auth token.
[10:18:10] <Moonlightning> Okay…so both protect against weak thieves, the auth token additionally protects against attackers on the network, and none protect against strong thieves or government attackers.

[23:42:14] <wolfyshy> they are currently on a mission to fix up coreutils
[23:42:56] <Moonlightning> Nah, I'm just wanting to know how the --canonicalize* options work.
[23:43:00] <Moonlightning> The ones to readlink.
[23:43:14] * Moonlightning has a need for such functionality, in a Python script. Is double-checking things.

[23:47:46] <Moonlightning> > os.readlink(path, *, dir_fd=None)
[23:47:48] <Moonlightning> > - Return a string representing the path to which the symbolic link points. The result may be either an absolute or relative pathname; if it is relative, it may be converted to an absolute pathname using `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(path), result)`.
[23:48:03] <Moonlightning> Is that…safe? I feel like it might return incorrect results in some edge cases.

[23:54:49] <Moonlightning> …not quite. It's not a complete canonicalization, in any case.
[23:56:53] <Moonlightning> Maybe wrapping it in a call to os.path.realpath()…
