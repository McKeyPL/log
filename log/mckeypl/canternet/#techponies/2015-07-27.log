[05:09:18] <JustAberrant> in what sense :(
[05:11:17] <Moonlightning> ^
[05:13:45] <ButterBean> codeing wise
[05:15:06] * JustAberrant does not
[05:16:15] <Moonlightning> WordPress is terrible. It wraps everything in <p> tags and doesn't support CSS properly.
[05:16:29] <JustAberrant> it's also an exploit poster child :>
[05:16:34] <ButterBean> i need an iframe...yet wordpess hides it
[05:16:35] <JustAberrant> but it's popular and bloated
[05:16:58] <JustAberrant> so at least that's understandable :>
[05:17:28] <JustAberrant> ButterBean: you should really consider all of the decisions in your life that have led you to needing an iframe first
[05:17:32] <ButterBean> any one know how to quickly code a website
[05:18:22] <JustAberrant> ..depends on what it needs to do..
[05:18:22] <ButterBean> JustAberrant this is wordpress.....and the code to embed a station player has the <iframe> tag
[05:19:31] <JustAberrant> wordpress _probably_ kills iframes as a security thing
[05:19:36] <ButterBean> it does
[05:19:47] <ButterBean> fing hate it
[05:19:56] <JustAberrant> with good reason of course ;p
[05:20:03] <ButterBean> ug..
[05:20:08] <JustAberrant> you probably need to jam it into the template itself if you _really_ want one
[05:20:38] <ButterBean> eh ill get some one to code it from scrach 
[05:20:46] <ButterBean> this s sucks
[05:20:54] <JustAberrant> cause that's easier than editing a template file.. well whatever ;p

[05:55:25] <Moonlightning> Don't a lot of tech companies let you, at least for the most part? Perhaps just coming in for a time at the beginning, and then for the occassional meeting?
[05:56:30] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: I know a few devs who work from home, mostly  web stuff
[05:57:25] <JustAberrant> it's certainly a thing one can do
[05:57:30] <Gigabit> I dunno, I do not have dev experience at all :(
[05:58:41] <JustAberrant> if you can find a legitimate job that doesn't really require you to physically be there, then yeah, no reason it can't exist as a work from home gig
[05:58:53] <JustAberrant> whether it does and whether you can land one though is another story
[05:59:42] <JustAberrant> what kinda job are you looking for?
[06:00:31] <Gigabit> Something really, I prefer something tech related honestly. I have my A+ and try to keep up on my knowledge, I /want/ to learn programming but havent yet
[06:01:03] <JustAberrant> well, most non-programming gigs are kinda things you have to physically be there for I imagine
[06:01:04] <Gigabit> Right now my only income until I get my medical card is, Mturk
[06:01:20] <JustAberrant> you might be able to find a tech support type gig
[06:04:18] <Gigabit> Thats why I was hoping for support space but my login info is not working at all, and their site is horrible to avigatre

[20:12:57] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: subnets, kind of printer, connection between printer and network, general topology?
[20:13:46] <Gigabit> Anyways, just wondering again. My pc is on the .1.1 subnet, the printer is on .2.1. ENtwork topology, 2 wireless routers, router 2 is subnet .2.1, the printer is a wireless printer connected to the second router with a connection strength of 46%
[20:14:39] <Lapsus> IIRC windows won't let a 192.168.* talk to any other one for some reason
[20:15:02] <Moonlightning> Ugh, Windows. Can it not routing tables, or what? :/
[20:15:13] <Gigabit> damn.. it gets annoying to have to use other devices to print
[20:15:19] <Lapsus> it just assumes that it's a configuration error IIRC

[20:15:28] <Lapsus> that's why I'm on a 10.0.*
[20:15:43] <Moonlightning> And /only/ subnets of 192.168/16. Not the other two. :\
[20:15:45] <Gigabit> Maybe I should change the subnets then

[20:17:04] <Lapsus> Dualbooting is a massive pain in the ass, man

[20:17:50] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: make sure you put the Windows in a VM.

[20:22:23] <Moonlightning> Which doesn't make much sense to me because the E one was in 2005
