[00:00:15] <Gladiolus> It's not fine, you have corporations that pay 0 and extremely wealthy people that pay extremely little.
[00:00:29] <PinkiePieInsane> There is nothing that you can do
[00:00:32] <LightningCrash> That's the biggest problem. 
[00:00:33] <PinkiePieInsane> or that will be done.
[00:00:33] <Gladiolus> Remember the 1950s boom times? Highest bracket was /80 percent/ then lol.
[00:00:38] <LightningCrash> You just have to eliminate deductions.
[00:00:43] <PinkiePieInsane> There are a few options that can fix this.
[00:00:44] <LightningCrash> Like, just cut 'em out.
[00:00:48] <LightningCrash> Totally. 
[00:00:59] <PinkiePieInsane> Wont work, iirc
[00:01:18] <Gladiolus> You also need to close loopholes and, yes, raise certain brackets.
[00:01:26] <PinkiePieInsane> usa is one of the countries where as long as you still live there or is a citizin, ya gotta tax.
[00:01:33] <Gladiolus> The stupid economic experiment of supply-side and austerity failed utterly.
[00:01:40] <Gladiolus> It's time to go back to keynesism
[00:01:46] <LightningCrash> 4^ I don't think brackets need to be raised
[00:01:49] <LightningCrash> I just think there need to be /more./
[00:01:51] <Gladiolus> All Hail John Maynard Keynes
[00:01:55] <LightningCrash> Like, $250,000+ is too broad.
[00:02:00] <Gladiolus> w/e as long as the super rich get taxed more
[00:02:00] <PinkiePieInsane> so people go away completly. Now, the issue he is completly political in nature, thus the entire govermental structure would have to be changed
[00:02:01] <Gladiolus> either way works
[00:02:38] <PinkiePieInsane> The rich should not be taxed on how much they got, they should be taxed on income. Taxing twice is just silly
[00:02:42] <Gladiolus> I've long argued for a 100% tax above 1 million dollars yearly, income only. The idea is that it would force the rich to invest or spend that money instead of hoarding it.
[00:02:42] <LightningCrash> Everything just needs to be lumped together. 
[00:03:16] <PinkiePieInsane> Gladioulus: That would just have them move everything outta the country. Thus leaving US with less money.
[00:03:24] <Gladiolus> they do that anyway
[00:03:26] <LightningCrash> I honestly believe that's the largest source of economic trouble.
[00:03:31] <PinkiePieInsane> Some do
[00:03:32] <LightningCrash> Rich people not spending their money.
[00:03:34] <PinkiePieInsane> most don't
[00:03:47] <Gladiolus> It is LightningCrash, and there's a betty boop cartoon from the 30s that explains that lol
[00:03:50] <PinkiePieInsane> but they do
[00:04:01] <PinkiePieInsane> Even if they spend more, it won't change anything.

[00:04:02] <HoneyDrops|Half> Fix capital gains tax, very, very few making over 250K are getting it from actual work (ie: wages, salary, bonus).  Those making over 250K are making money off the money they alreay have, tax that income.
[00:04:04] <Gladiolus> i think this is it
[00:04:24] <LightningCrash> 2^ famously, a lot of silicon valley CEOs salaries are $1 a year + stock options. :p
[00:04:40] <Gladiolus> This doesn't appear to be the right one.
[00:04:43] <Gladiolus> still funny
[00:05:15] <PinkiePieInsane> taxing money you already have is stupid
[00:05:40] <Gladiolus> IF you refuse to spend it on something then fuck you get taxed.
[00:05:43] <PinkiePieInsane> oh you have saved up 40k for a new house, let me just take one fourth.
[00:05:59] <PinkiePieInsane> But they spend it, not all.
[00:06:02] <HoneyDrops|Half> PinkiePieInsane:  That is not what I said.  I said tax income from investments more heavily.
[00:06:03] <Gladiolus> No person has a right to have multiple billions of dollars in liquid capital while others starve.
[00:06:15] <Gladiolus> I'm not talking about 40k, I'm talking in much higher terms.
[00:06:29] <Gladiolus> also ban the stock market :)
[00:06:37] <LightningCrash> Eh, that's going too far, IMO
[00:06:46] <PinkiePieInsane> wow, i can see you causing market failure
[00:06:47] <Gladiolus> It muddies the issue and makes corporations non-responsible (see: BP) 
[00:07:04] <Gladiolus> I would totally cause the market to fail because what I'm positing is a totally new system.
[00:07:08] <Gladiolus> and well
[00:07:15] <Gladiolus> you can't do that without tearing the old one apart.
[00:07:19] <Gladiolus> >:)
[00:07:26] <Gladiolus> Companies are good.
[00:07:29] <Gladiolus> Corporations are bad.
[00:07:37] <PinkiePieInsane> Let me tell you a story
[00:07:37] <Gladiolus> Well not good but not openly terrible either.
[00:07:46] <PinkiePieInsane> of the time everyone in a country was billionaries
[00:07:57] <Gladiolus> Investment is fine but the sort of disconnect between stockholders and a company is bad.
[00:08:09] <Shutter> Failing at multitasking so I haven't followed the discussion the past 10 minutes or so, but I just want to throw this out there: One of the big problems in the US is wealth accumulation on the top. For an economy to function the money has to be kept in circulation, and as soon as you allow extreme hoarding you have a problem,
[00:08:10] <Shutter> *.
[00:08:12] <Gladiolus> It also leads to over-investment and stupid crap.
[00:08:25] <PinkiePieInsane> so back many years ago, there was this little country, millions upons millions of this currency was used to buy things as bread. destroying the current economy would make money worthless
[00:08:41] <Gladiolus> If someone wants to invest in a company, they should have to become a partner in the company so they would have to care about the company.
[00:09:00] <Gladiolus> Not a million people owning less than a percent each and ultimately not caring what the company does- they just want their stocks worth more.
[00:09:09] <Gladiolus> It causes an oil spill? Wasn't my fault, says the CEO.
[00:09:17] <Gladiolus> Wasn't our fault, says the board.
[00:09:36] <Gladiolus> And the stockholders get mad while similtaniously demanding year over year profit increases.
[00:10:00] <Gladiolus> is it germany PinkiePieInsane 
[00:10:04] <Gladiolus> or zimbabwe
[00:10:08] <HoneyDrops|Half> Ideally we'd abandon the idea of money and material wealth.
[00:10:22] <LightningCrash> I... yes, I guess that' ideal
[00:10:27] <PinkiePieInsane> Germany in this case
[00:10:40] <LightningCrash> but that's so... idealistic and unrealistic that it's just difficult to consider in a debate like this. 
[00:10:53] <PinkiePieInsane> The economy is delicate, messing with is is always a bad idea, does not matter what you say, but messing with it is bad.
[00:11:11] <Gladiolus> Yeah so in conclusion the stock market is an inherently self destructive thing that shouldn't have existed in the first place. ~crosses arms~
[00:11:23] <PinkiePieInsane> yes and no
[00:11:41] <PinkiePieInsane> originally it was not. But then it grew outta hand.
[00:11:49] <LightningCrash> But what are you going to do? 
[00:11:53] <LightningCrash> /Ban/ the stock market? 
[00:12:02] <LightningCrash> Like, that's just unreasonable. No company is forced to go onto the stock market. 
[00:12:12] <LightningCrash> And some companies need an influx of capital, so they go public.
[00:12:29] <PinkiePieInsane> Why we got the stock market to begin with
[00:12:32] <Shutter> Investment banking is a clusterfuck though
[00:12:36] <LightningCrash> Exactly. 
[00:12:46] <Gladiolus> IT is now, if it was regulated better and stuff like.
[00:12:53] <Shutter> One of the first things you should do is reinstate Glass-Stegall, and separate investment banking from other banking
[00:12:55] <Shutter> Because wtf.
[00:13:02] <Gladiolus> Remember I'm not positing how to change the system and still keep it afloat. I'm taking ideas to the logical conclusion.

[00:14:51] <PinkiePieInsane> We can't change the economy, but a future where it will be forced to change is near.
[00:15:28] <PinkiePieInsane> Imagin a world where you could 3d print anything, and soon you can.... well somethings faster then others.
[00:16:08] <PinkiePieInsane> or a world wide nuclear war, that would 'fix' everything too i guess.
[00:16:15] <tiwake> except you cant 3D print everything
[00:16:33] <PinkiePieInsane> Not quite
[00:16:40] <tiwake> 3D printing does not work very well for steels

[00:17:22] <tiwake> there might be an epoxy of some sort of synthetic stretchy nature that might work for clothing
[00:17:27] <PinkiePieInsane> we need 3d printers at a molecular level for it to be perfect
[00:17:49] <PinkiePieInsane> there is, but it does not do things clothes do.

[00:36:28] <tiwake> smoothbore cannons are technically legal to own
[00:36:30] <Gladiolus> That's not the point though, it costs too much for what it's worth and is a gigantically heavy thing.
[00:36:32] <Shutter> With a German Rheinmetall gun *cough*
[00:36:55] <Gladiolus> The T-80U, which has a 125mm and the ability to fire ATGM, costs 1 third.

[00:42:12] <Gladiolus> Saddam imports a downgraded monkey model T-72 in pieces, builds his own from it that are even worse, and then fits them with training rounds and intead of IR lamps- literal spotlights.

[07:47:57] <HoneyDrops|Half> That is my $TERM, yes.

[07:48:58] * Googie throws cool-retro-term at HoneyDrops|Half
[07:48:59] *** Joins: init_laptopintheotherroom (~WebChat@Pony-j6sb74.mi.comcast.net)
[07:49:03] <One-Trick> uses a lot of real estate
[07:49:07] <Googie> Sure it's not really... well, viable for day to day use
[07:49:15] <Googie> But cool-retro-term is great :V
[07:49:52] <init_laptopintheotherroom> Should I use a password manager? DOes that make more sense? If so, which one?
[07:49:54] <Googie> I slowly found myself moving more towards minimalism. i3wm
[07:49:54] <HoneyDrops|Half> I would love an actual hardware VT terminal.
[07:50:14] <One-Trick> Googie: thats the tile manager, right?
[07:50:38] <HoneyDrops|Half> I settled on dwm, I try others now and then, but keep going back to it.
[07:50:50] <Googie> It's a tiling window manager, yeah.
[07:51:02] <Googie> Once you learn the hotkeys it works really nicely.
[07:51:12] <One-Trick> i was pondering that one, as well
[07:51:24] <One-Trick> especially on my laptop where the screen isnt very big
[07:51:46] <HoneyDrops|Half> A tiling wm works great on smaller screens.
[07:51:53] <One-Trick> i dont need things like fancy frames and a big bar that says what the program im using is xD
[07:51:54] <Googie> If you're not quite ready to make the jump to tiling, openbox/fluxbox/that line of WMs is great too.
[07:52:37] <HoneyDrops|Half> If I even bother with X on my Z2, I have dwm on QVGA...
[07:53:30] <One-Trick> i use things like pentadactyl and vim all the time, im fairly sure i can learn some more keys for window management
[07:53:48] <HoneyDrops|Half> However, I just use tmux on that as 32M means you don't really want to use X unless you really need it.
[07:54:00] * HoneyDrops|Half high-hoofs One-Trick.
[07:54:20] * HoneyDrops|Half can't live w/o pentadactyl.
[07:54:46] <Googie> Of all people, it was posey talking about it that caused me to start using it :P
[07:55:00] * Googie can't live without it either now, but it breaks far too much with Firefox updates :/
[07:55:31] <Googie> Though that's partially my fault right now.
[07:57:21] <Googie> (Messing about with Firefox e10s)
[07:57:35] <One-Trick> i was gonna say, none of the updates have messed mine up
[07:57:37] <One-Trick> and im using nightly
[07:57:47] <One-Trick> err, nightly pendactyl
[07:57:51] <One-Trick> i cant spell
[07:58:20] <Googie> I've not once been able to get stable pentadactyl to install. Incompatible version and all that.
[07:58:55] <One-Trick> ahwell
[07:59:35] <Googie> Pentadactyl + i3 though is really really nice.
[07:59:58] <Googie> (Or just a tiling WM in general)
[08:00:10] <One-Trick> ill give i3 a go after im done this project. i dont wanna mess up my workflow at the moment
[08:02:24] <Googie> Also dmenu, since i3 doesn't come with a build in way to launch applications outside of meta->enter for a new terminal

[14:12:15] <Googie> The problem with learning C and then C++ is that the preferred idiomatic way to do things in C vs C++ is very different

[14:18:56] <Phase> Googie, imo you want to know both anyway
[14:21:32] <Googie> Yeahg
[14:21:41] <Googie> *Yeah
[14:21:49] <Googie> There's not really a correct way to do it.
[14:25:29] <Googie> They're really two separate languages in practice. Modern C++ anyway. (You can always just treat it as C with classes)
[14:49:04] <Phase> Googie, actually i think you'd get far more out of it by treating it as c with templates than c with classes

[22:35:38] <AppleDash> buy the same model of drive, transfer the platters, hope I didn't dirty them, and yeah
[22:36:03] <HoneyDrops|Half> Have a clean room?
[22:36:10] <AppleDash> No
[22:36:13] <AppleDash> Like I said, "hope"

[22:36:44] <AppleDash> It's this drive
[22:36:45] <PinkiePieBot> [ Seagate Barracuda 7200.14 ST3000DM001 3TB 7200 RPM 64MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/s 3.5" Internal Hard Drive Bare Drive - Newegg.ca ]
[22:36:58] <AppleDash> I mean I'll go get a quote from some place and then if that is unsatisfactory I'll just try it myself
[22:45:44] <Cepheid> The problem with platter drives is that if they fall, they usually suffer a head crash.
[22:45:56] <Cepheid> And that usually results in damage to the internals.
[22:47:23] <AppleDash> Mhm
[22:47:34] <AppleDash> I just phoned a local place and they quoted me around 2000$
[22:47:44] <AppleDash> They said I can send it to them for free and have them give me an exact quote
