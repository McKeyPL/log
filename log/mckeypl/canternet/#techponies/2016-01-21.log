[05:20:06] <ShivalWolf> its auth works with krb its local accounts work
[05:20:11] <ShivalWolf> but key auth doesnt
[05:20:22] <ShivalWolf> and the only time ive had that happen is if they bugger up the pam.d config order
[05:20:33] <ShivalWolf> but this has no pam.d config for krb at all
[05:20:40] <ShivalWolf> and yes its running suse is an issue
[05:20:47] <ShivalWolf> but for suse this box is odd
[05:21:02] <ShivalWolf> im compeltly stumped
[05:21:20] <ShivalWolf> its odd when you cant find why something works

[20:08:16] <Colgate> so like, how do I use a tape drive on linux?
[20:08:26] <Colgate> I see /dev/st0, but I ahve no idea how to do anything with it
[20:08:38] <Colgate> it doesn't work like a normal HDD :P
[20:09:48] <Colgate> was looking up some stuff, said to use `mt`, but arch linux doesn't package that apparently
[20:15:45] <mniip> Colgate, does insp have an equivalent of /trace ?
[20:16:01] <Colgate> what is /trace?
[20:16:48] <mniip> well it's kinda like whois but also returns an IP if there's an rDNS that isn't spoofed, and the authclass
[20:16:54] <Colgate> /check
[20:17:07] <mniip> hmm trace isn't oper-only
[20:28:29] <Moonlightning> Colgate: `tar`, obviously. :D
[20:37:23] *** Pony_7290 is now known as Dude
[20:37:53] *** Dude is now known as Pony_63636
[20:47:10] <Colgate> Moonlightning: that works, but it is incredibly slow for what I want to do with it
[20:47:35] <Colgate> I need to wipe these tapes with zeros and I can't tar /dev/zero :P
[20:47:43] <Moonlightning> Colgate: Well, it IS a tape drive :D
[20:47:54] <Colgate> no, as in, the tape drive constantly spins up and down
[20:47:57] <Moonlightning> Oh. Can't you just `dd` them?
[20:48:01] <Colgate> no, I can't
[20:48:03] <Colgate> I tried that
[20:48:05] <Moonlightning> Wat
[20:48:13] <Colgate> it wrote 3TB to the 200GB tape overnight
[20:48:21] <Colgate> so it is doing something
[20:48:25] <Colgate> but not what I want
[20:48:28] <Moonlightning> What kind of disk doesn't let you write sequential blocks of data to it
[20:48:32] <Moonlightning> I mean come on
[20:48:35] <Colgate> it isn't a disk
[20:48:36] <Colgate> :P
[20:48:52] <Moonlightning> I use the term loosely.
[20:50:06] <Colgate> I'll just loop tar with this tar of /dev/zero
[20:50:16] <Colgate> er, dd of /dev/zero
[20:50:17] <Colgate> >.>
[20:51:06] <Colgate> while true; do tar -cf /dev/st0 zero; done
[20:51:36] <Colgate> were zero was just dd if=/dev/zero of=zero bs=4k, until I ran out of disk space on the live CD /root :P
[20:52:28] <Colgate> it is still spinning up and down constantly though
[20:53:42] <Colgate> I hope it throws some sort of out of disk space error when it is done
[21:00:33] <Colgate> mniip: what would the user version of /trace do?
[21:01:01] <Colgate> can't show IPs, we won't show which <connect> block other users are in
[21:01:35] <mniip> well freenode does
[21:01:40] <mniip> [23:01:07] * User v6users Doger[doger@doger.dogecoin.com] (2a00:d880:5:60f:1::) 92 :511
[21:01:47] <mniip> v6users is the authclass
[21:02:53] <Colgate> /shrug, I don't see any particular reason a user needs to know what authclass they are
[21:14:17] <mniip> bleh, charybdis's operhelp sucks
