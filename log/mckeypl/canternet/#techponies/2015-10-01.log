[02:03:30] <RazorSharpFang> This is so much more painful than virtualizing windows, or Ubuntu.

[02:04:33] <PinkiePieBot> [ Fairphone 2 | A seriously cool smartphone. Putting social values first. ]
[02:05:02] <RazorSharpFang> 529 euros? Who has that kind of money to spend on a phone?!
[02:06:00] <Moonlightning> Same kinda people who buy iPhones?
[02:06:12] <RazorSharpFang> So, rich people?
[02:07:20] <RazorSharpFang> Man, I think this phone's CPU is better than my desktop's.
[02:07:23] <Moonlightning> Not just.
[02:07:32] <johnsey> people who buy iphones won't buy this phone
[02:07:37] <johnsey> it's not made by apple
[02:07:44] <Fantasma> I buy andoids .
[02:07:48] <Fantasma> I wouldn't buy this phone.
[02:08:25] <RazorSharpFang> Fantasma: What aspects do you dislike about the phone?
[02:08:26] <johnsey> the iphone 6 is significantly more expensive, too, and it doesn't come with dual sim, micro sd slot and a user replaceable battery. oh, and it's not modular :P
[02:08:57] <Dusk> I got my iPhone 6 for free
[02:08:58] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, the Snapdragon 801 is probably better than my Pentium 4.
[02:09:02] <Dusk> and I don't even use it >.>
[02:09:14] <Moonlightning> > Androidâ„¢ 5.1, Lollipop
[02:09:27] <Dusk> Moonlightning: what about it?
[02:09:32] <RazorSharpFang> Do you dislike lollipop?
[02:09:44] <Gigabit> Is it low carb lollipop?
[02:10:36] <Moonlightning> Fantasma said they buy Androids, and therefore wouldn't buy this phone?
[02:11:01] <Dusk> 'tis expensive
[02:11:10] <Dusk> Go get an Asus Zenfone 2
[02:11:28] <Moonlightning> > Designed for use and service in Europe only
[02:11:30] <Moonlightning> oh, well, pfff
[02:11:42] <Dusk> It's probably faster, is much cheaper and has dual sim as well
[02:11:48] <Dusk> and it's full x86_64
[02:11:52] <Fantasma> RazorSharpFang the older processor, the only 2gigs of ram, the camera quality, and the only usb 2.0 port
[02:11:53] <Dusk> instead of arm :D
[02:12:05] <johnsey> right, because intel is so awesome on mobile ;)
[02:12:10] <AppleDash> RazorSharpFang: Most flagship phones nowadays are like 500-800 bucks...
[02:12:17] <RazorSharpFang> Fantasma: That processor is better than my desktop processor. : /
[02:12:31] <AppleDash> And and the EUR is close enough to the USD that conversions are pretty much irrelevant
[02:12:33] <Fantasma> That doesn't mean it's good, it just means you have a horrible desktop processor.
[02:12:40] <RazorSharpFang> ;-;
[02:12:43] <Dusk> johnsey: Is there something I missed about intel being bad on mobile?
[02:12:45] <Phase> johnsey, it is a tonn easier to get your own code on x86 chips
[02:12:48] <Dusk> I love my Zenfone
[02:13:02] <johnsey> Phase: is it? how so?
[02:13:31] <Phase> johnsey, standard abi's, only two types of boot loader
[02:13:33] <Dusk> I'll recommend anyone considering getting something that's a flagship device to throw the idea out the window and go for a Zenfone any day of the week
[02:13:54] <Phase> johnsey, by far the best supported by toolchains, virt extensions by default
[02:13:55] <Fantasma> I'd recommend not buying Chinese spyware, personally.
[02:14:13] <Dusk> ?
[02:14:19] * Moonlightning wants a /free/ phone.
[02:14:27] <AppleDash> And I want a free gaming rig
[02:14:31] <johnsey> Phase: virt extensions are on all latest arm chips you find in mobile, there's eabi, there's a bunch of good toolchains..i fail to see your point
[02:15:17] <Moonlightning> AppleDash: now /that/ you can do
[02:15:36] <Dusk> johnsey: I fail to see the problem with x86 on mobile
[02:15:38] <Phase> johnsey, i've not tried recent devices with eabi, will have to in the future. the arm virt extensions require bootloader support
[02:15:41] <AppleDash> please show me where to get my hardware for free
[02:15:41] <Moonlightning> â€¦assuming you don't mind not having Windows-only games, of course
[02:15:51] <Moonlightning> â€¦as in speech, AppleDash, not as in beer
[02:15:55] <johnsey> Dusk: apps?
[02:16:03] <Dusk> The battery life is on par with modern flagship devices, and app support is perfectly fine.
[02:16:06] <AppleDash> johnsey: ...
[02:16:13] <AppleDash> Most Android apps are Java
[02:16:19] <johnsey> yes, that's the point
[02:16:26] <Dusk> There haven't been any apps thus far that haven't worked out of the box on my processor
[02:16:30] <AppleDash> Java most definitely runs on x86
[02:16:35] <RazorSharpFang> It doesn't count as java if it's not Oracle.
[02:16:35] <johnsey> nobody _wants_ to port native desktop apps to your phone for a reason
[02:16:42] <Dusk> and they all run fast.
[02:16:44] <johnsey> so the advantage of x86 is nil there
[02:16:52] <Dusk> Oh there's no advantage
[02:16:53] <AppleDash> RazorSharpFang: .
[02:16:54] <Dusk> But
[02:17:11] <AppleDash> It's like a 200$ phone that's better than an 800$ phone
[02:17:12] <johnsey> Phase: get a phone with an unlocked bootloader?
[02:17:13] <AppleDash> is the point here
[02:17:23] <Phase> AppleDash, android == dex, though it vm has an x86 backend now
[02:17:24] <johnsey> (for virtual extensions)
[02:17:30] <RazorSharpFang> So, it's an overpriced device?
[02:17:36] <AppleDash> ,,,,,
[02:17:37] <Dusk> it works well enough and the fact that it's a 300 dollar phone with 4gb of ram and 64gb of onboard memory with a micro sd card slot and dual sim support with a decent GPU and a 2.4GHz quad core?
[02:17:39] <AppleDash> Uhh?

[02:17:59] <AppleDash> I'm gonna go with "no", RazorSharpFang?
[02:18:10] <RazorSharpFang> Aren't we talking aboutthe fairphone?
[02:18:12] <Dusk> and Asus has provided support for unlocking the bootloader and installing other OSes on it out of the box
[02:18:13] <AppleDash> No
[02:18:15] <Dusk> no
[02:18:24] <Dusk> I'm talking about the Zenfone 2
[02:18:25] <RazorSharpFang> I must have missed the transition.
[02:18:26] <Dusk> 2*
[02:18:30] <Gigabit> ewwwww asus
[02:18:33] <Dusk> Gigabit: wat
[02:18:45] <Gigabit> Sorry I have had complete horrible luck with them :P
[02:18:53] <RazorSharpFang> I have an ASUS machine and it runs well. : /
[02:19:01] <Dusk> I've had nothing but greatness from Asus
[02:19:12] <Dusk> I've had two ROG laptops, a phone and a couple of monitors
[02:19:18] <Gigabit> I knw flukes happen but when I needed help, the customer support has been shit, they lost my laptop and would not cover it under lemon law
[02:19:24] <Dusk> and no problems other than stuff I broke on my own
[02:19:40] <RazorSharpFang> Breaking stuff is bad tho.
[02:19:42] <Dusk> Their customer support was great with me and my roomie :o
[02:19:46] <Fantasma> Speaking of $200 phones.
[02:19:53] <Gigabit> Like I said, I know bad experiences happen, but I would be hard pressed to buy them again :P
[02:20:07] <Gigabit> Not unless something amazing happens  XD
[02:20:40] <RazorSharpFang> Me though, I'm on a really low budget, so I've got donated monitors, donated machines, donated speakers, etc...
[02:20:42] <Dusk> the Zenfone 2 also has a 200 dollar variant that is slightly slower
[02:20:49] <AppleDash> I own their monitors and their laptop and everything's pretty good over here. The one time I called their support they were fine
[02:20:52] <Dusk> and has a little bit less ram
[02:20:57] <Dusk> but a lot better battery life
[02:21:02] <RazorSharpFang> I'm still using an old ViewSonic 1280x1020 monitor. 
[02:21:10] <RazorSharpFang> **1024
[02:21:49] <Fantasma> RazorSharpFang
[02:21:55] <Fantasma> You sound like you could use a gaming monitor.
[02:22:11] <RazorSharpFang> I'm not sure my Intel HD Graphics 3000 would work with that.
[02:22:31] <Fantasma> hd3000 will still run 1920x1080 just fine
[02:22:51] <RazorSharpFang> But I doubt i'll get decent framerates at that resolution.
[02:23:06] <Gigabit> Now to play fair.. the laptop I bought was like.. brand new just released. Asus G50VT-X1, and my frend bought the same one, his worked fine and he treated it like shit, mine kept dying
[02:23:08] <Fantasma> It's fine.

[02:23:24] <RazorSharpFang> *fire happens* It's fine.
[02:23:25] <Fantasma> For much less than that, obviously.

[02:23:51] <Fantasma> Oh
[02:23:54] <Fantasma> Nevermind.
[02:23:59] <RazorSharpFang> Also hell, is my internet. Australia's internet is hell.
[02:24:03] <Dusk> I can't load that page
[02:24:07] <Gigabit> I just havent the want or need to go buy an Asus. My Gigabyte Mobo and GPU are fine, My gskill ram and Corsair ram are perfect and my consumer grade Corsair PSU is working great

[02:25:19] <AppleDash> I can load the newegg page
[02:25:35] <Fantasma> It's the same product.
[02:25:42] <Dusk> ah
[02:25:46] <AppleDash> I unintentionally built an almost entirely corsair/EVGA system
[02:25:58] <Dusk> I am using a samsung UHD monitor with two titan xs
[02:26:00] <Dusk> >.>
[02:26:11] <Dusk> I can't really go back to 1080p
[02:26:28] <Gigabit> I have an acer p215H >.>
[02:27:02] <Gigabit> and it is up on 5 2x4's and some OSB wood to be the right height..
[02:27:04] <AppleDash> Dusk: but it looks exactly the same it just costs more
[02:27:14] <AppleDash> as that one person on IRC or BF4 or wherever said
[02:27:15] <Dusk> :V
[02:27:18] <RazorSharpFang> AppleDash: It doesn't support VGA?!
[02:27:22] <AppleDash> RazorSharpFang: ?
[02:27:26] <Dusk> >the human eye can't see 4k
[02:27:29] <Dusk> >.>
[02:27:30] <AppleDash> lol
[02:27:31] <AppleDash> yes
[02:27:42] <RazorSharpFang> There's no VGA input for it?!
[02:27:42] <Fantasma> Yes, it can actually.
[02:27:46] <Dusk> We know
[02:27:50] <Dusk> It's a joke
[02:27:50] <AppleDash> RazorSharpFang: What is "it" and why are you asking me about it
[02:28:02] <RazorSharpFang> Whoops, wrong person. XD
[02:28:09] <RazorSharpFang> Fantasma: It doesn't support VGA?!
[02:28:25] <RazorSharpFang> Sorry, AppleDash.
[02:28:29] <AppleDash> It's fine
[02:28:30] <Fantasma> It does
[02:28:33] <Fantasma> Plug an adapter in there
[02:28:43] <Dusk> Fantasma: There was a person AppleDash and I were playing with said that, and I'm over here like what
[02:28:50] <Dusk> I'm sitting here staring at a 4k panel
[02:28:54] <AppleDash> You can't just do that that's not how this works
[02:29:00] <Dusk> and there's a clear difference between a 4k panel and a 1080p panel
[02:29:03] <Fantasma> You can
[02:29:06] <Fantasma> And that IS how it works.
[02:29:08] <Dusk> literally 4 times the resolution
[02:29:10] <AppleDash> No it's not
[02:29:17] <RazorSharpFang> And I'm here using a 1280x1024 panel.
[02:29:29] <AppleDash> Your monitor doesn't magically start supporting an analog signal on its digital input
[02:29:36] <AppleDash> if you add an adaptor
[02:29:47] <Dusk> oh yea
[02:30:01] <Dusk> monitors that only take digital input will not take VGA at all
[02:30:12] <Dusk> You need an active converter
[02:30:27] <Moonlightning> So character devices and FIFOs have at least one of their three timestamps updated when they're read from and when they're written to
[02:30:48] <Moonlightning> What about block devices and sockets? Haven't really been able to test
[02:31:54] <RazorSharpFang> Is DVI used a lot? I've never actually seen a DVI cable before.
[02:32:42] <Dusk> DVI is used a lot.
[02:32:51] <AppleDash> I'm using it right now
[02:32:56] <AppleDash> But I was the same like a year and a half ago
[02:33:01] <Dusk> DVI is what VGA used to be
[02:33:03] <Dusk> >.>
[02:33:31] <RazorSharpFang> So, the ubiquitous normal output?
[02:33:44] <AppleDash> I don't even know what everybody uses now
[02:33:49] <RazorSharpFang> My machine doesn't have a DVI output.
[02:33:50] <Dusk> HDMI and DisplayPort are far better standards in terms of data throughput and stuff
[02:33:54] <AppleDash> I'm using SBI and DisplayPort
[02:33:57] <AppleDash> err, DVI
[02:34:02] <AppleDash> I don't know what happened
[02:34:14] <RazorSharpFang> It does have 9-pin S-VIDEO though.
[02:34:15] <Dusk> I'm using DVI-I -> VGA and a DP
[02:34:19] <Gigabit> I rather use HDMI over dvi >.<
[02:34:24] <Dusk> RazorSharpFang: are you on a 9800 gt by chance?
[02:34:28] <Gigabit> I hate the screen in connections
[02:34:34] <RazorSharpFang> Dusk: Something like that.
[02:34:46] <Gigabit> 9600 gt RazorSharpFang?
[02:34:57] <Dusk> Prolly the 9600 yea
[02:35:05] <RazorSharpFang> I dunno which exactly
[02:35:23] <Gigabit> if you have the space and want to cover shipping I can send you another for free :P
[02:35:39] <Gigabit> I have a backup card here and it is collecting dust
[02:35:44] <Fantasma> So NEway
[02:35:48] <Fantasma> Does anyone wanna buy that monitor off of me?
[02:36:02] <RazorSharpFang> Gigabit: I wouldn't have any use for another G-Card.
[02:36:04] <AppleDash> I would if I didn't have good monitors :P
[02:36:22] <AppleDash> Well honestly
[02:36:22] <Gigabit> okay, just thought I offer is all RazorSharpFang 
[02:36:23] <AppleDash> Fantasma: how much
[02:36:29] <Fantasma> 160
[02:36:36] <AppleDash> I'll think about it
[02:36:59] <Colgate> Dusk: no way, DVI never hit the popularity of VGA
[02:37:03] <RazorSharpFang> Hang on, which one is the purple one again?
[02:37:04] <Colgate> VGA is still widespread
[02:37:10] <AppleDash> RazorSharpFang: uhh
[02:37:11] <AppleDash> keyboard?
[02:37:11] <Gigabit> Fantasma, would you accept trident layers as payment?
[02:37:26] <AppleDash> I want a 3rd monitor but I should probably just wait a few months until I can get an ultrawide and then yeah
[02:37:29] <Fantasma> nyet
[02:37:34] <ShivalWolf> https://scoreboard.cyberchallenge.com.au/ - Googie from memory is UNSW4

[02:37:37] <PinkiePieBot> [ CySCA 2015 - Scoreboard ]
[02:37:38] <RazorSharpFang> AppleDash: No, the many-pinned really long and thin one.
[02:37:46] <AppleDash> there are a lot of those
[02:37:54] <AppleDash> what shape is the connector?
[02:38:21] <RazorSharpFang> It looks like VGA, but squashed.
[02:38:21] <Colgate> D-sub!
[02:38:26] <AppleDash> HDMI>?
[02:38:31] <Colgate> oh... what?
[02:38:33] <RazorSharpFang> REALLY long
[02:38:38] <Colgate> parallel?
[02:38:39] <AppleDash> Printer
[02:38:42] <AppleDash> AKA parallel
[02:39:15] <Moonlightning> Gigabit: a backup card?
[02:39:26] <AppleDash> RazorSharpFang: http://geekologie.com/2009/07/22/computer-hardware-2.jpg
[02:39:27] <AppleDash> find it here
[02:39:31] <AppleDash> then tell us what it is
[02:39:41] <Gigabit> Ya, in case my 270 OC goes out and I need a card to get by
[02:39:59] <RazorSharpFang> Parallel Port/SCSI
[02:40:24] <AppleDash> Ah, we were right then with our last guess!
[02:41:06] <Colgate> or SCSI? what?
[02:41:27] <RazorSharpFang> That's what it says.
[02:41:39] <Colgate> oh, so it does
[02:41:40] <AppleDash> Colgate: SCSI can use a parallel-port style connector
[02:41:42] <AppleDash> external SCSI
[02:41:47] <Colgate> ah, never seen one that did
[02:42:27] <RazorSharpFang> Ohh, DVI is the white thingy
[02:42:33] <RazorSharpFang> Mine DOES have a DVI.
[02:42:41] <Fantasma> What IS vga anyway? that thing I used back in 2001?
[02:42:52] <RazorSharpFang> Fantasma: It's the blue one
[02:43:04] <Gigabit> The blue connector with 15 pins? I think it is that many
[02:43:21] <Moonlightning> blue connector, 15 pins? Sounds like VGA.
[02:43:25] <Colgate> Fantasma: analog video
[02:43:25] <Fantasma> Back when I only had peasant monitors.
[02:43:32] <Gigabit> A Video Graphics Array (VGA) connector is a three-row 15-pin DE-15 connector. The 15-pin VGA connector is found on many video cards, computer monitors, and high definition television sets. On laptop computers or other small devices, a mini-VGA port is sometimes used in place of the full-sized VGA connector.
[02:43:35] <RazorSharpFang> VGA is analog? Really?
[02:43:48] <Colgate> yeah?
[02:43:56] <RazorSharpFang> I had no idea.
[02:44:06] <RazorSharpFang> And HDMI is digital?
[02:44:17] <Lapsus> yep
[02:44:18] <Gigabit> God.. I love Big Bang Theory XD
[02:44:20] <Colgate> yes, hdmi uses a digital signal, same as DVBI but with audio as well
[02:44:23] <Colgate> DVI
[02:44:34] <Colgate> and added DRM :V
[02:44:34] <Fantasma> I'll give you a big grey ribbion if you brush your teeth
[02:44:38] <RazorSharpFang> How can HDMI be converted to VGA so easily? I've got a converter with me right now.
[02:44:43] <RazorSharpFang> It's a tiny thing
[02:44:44] <Colgate> it can't
[02:44:49] <Lapsus> dvi and hdmi are electrically the same, except hdmi does audio also
[02:44:50] <Colgate> it is an active converter
[02:44:52] <Moonlightning> Shit's tiny, yo
[02:45:00] <Moonlightning> have you seen the size of a Raspberry Pi? :p
[02:45:03] <Moonlightning> that's a /computer/
[02:45:26] <Lapsus> Colgate: dvi can do the DRM too
[02:45:27] <Lapsus> lol
[02:45:44] <Colgate> can it? well then :P
[02:45:57] <Moonlightning> DRM needs to go die in a fire
[02:46:12] <Moonlightning> It doesn't even make sense from a fundamental standpoint
[02:46:26] <RazorSharpFang> So, my HDMI -> VGA converter has this black box, which is an active converter?
[02:46:28] *** Lapsus sets mode: -qo Lapsus Lapsus
[02:46:38] <Lapsus> RazorSharpFang: yep
[02:46:50] <Moonlightning> shouldn't be a black boxâ€¦ :/
[02:47:48] <Gigabit> So.. provided I properly seal a container that can be buried long term, how long do you thing a hard drive would last in said container? :P
[02:48:04] <Lapsus> Gigabit: until the container leaks
[02:48:44] <Gigabit> good, I will make my own version of a time capsule then :P

[02:59:24] <Lapsus> it has something to do with how the data is physically stored on the chip, it can last a while but still needs a periodic refresh

[03:05:45] <Moonlightning> Lapsus: Soâ€¦yes? :P
[03:05:46] <Lapsus> it's because the charges stored in the cells to indicate 0 or 1 will leak over time

[03:06:02] <Phase> would remove the need to split between the two filesystems

[05:18:03] <RazorSharpFang> I've found Windows 10 to be significantly more resource hungry than WinXP
[05:19:07] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: I think that's supposed to be like that
[05:19:33] <Moonlightning> Phase: I mean, I'm completely fine with long-running transfers. I expect there'll be a lot of them.
[05:20:36] <RazorSharpFang> Now I have to restart it.
[05:20:40] <RazorSharpFang> Again.
[05:22:48] <RazorSharpFang> Of course, it'd probably be running better if it wasn't virtualized.
[05:23:44] <Gigabit> Windows 10 supports multiple desktops O3O 
[05:24:03] <RazorSharpFang> Hasn't ubuntu had that for like... multiple versions?
[05:24:18] <Gigabit> yes, exactly my point
[05:24:35] <RazorSharpFang> Of course, I still don't know how to use it.
[05:24:51] <Moonlightning> OS X has also had that for multiple versions
[05:25:05] <Moonlightning> Since Leopard, specifically
[05:29:05] <RazorSharpFang> Virtual Win10 has D3DX9 support, which is good.
[05:32:01] <RazorSharpFang> Is Windows 10 Education any different to what I'd get if I upgraded from Win7 using their offer?
[05:32:19] <RazorSharpFang> You know, that "get windows 10" thing.
[05:33:36] <Dusk> No, but I'd recommend getting it through the upgrade thing regardless as it more than likely already has everything staged for you
[05:33:44] <Dusk> /if/ you're wanting windows 10
[05:34:02] <Dusk> If you're a tinfoil hat person or a person mildly interested in your own security don't use it.
[05:34:35] <RazorSharpFang> Well, the win10 I got was off Dreamspark cos I'm studying compsci.
[05:34:47] <RazorSharpFang> Just wondering if that's different to what other people may be running.

[06:19:13] <Moonlightning> [ ! -e $file ] && touch $file  # is obvious, but non-atomic
[06:20:17] <RazorSharpFang> atomic?
[06:20:21] <RazorSharpFang> as in atoms?
[06:21:29] <Moonlightning> As in either succeeds completely, or fails completely; and cannot be interleaved with instructions from other code.
[06:21:50] <RazorSharpFang> I haven't a clue. : /
[06:21:54] <Moonlightning> It's one operationâ€”create a file, failing if it already exists. There's no potential for race conditions.
[06:22:24] <RazorSharpFang> You could always make your own function for it tho.
[06:23:32] <Moonlightning> I'd have to somehow get it to call C code.
[06:23:40] <Moonlightning> and I'd have to compile that and put it somewhere and meh.
[06:25:02] <Moonlightning> I /suppose/ I could `mv` the file I actually want to use to $file.locked or something, but that's ugly
[06:26:02] <JustAberrant> the requirement for such a thing is kinda worrying ;p
[06:26:18] <JustAberrant> but look into how lock files are done
[06:27:26] <JustAberrant> (basically try to create the file with O_CREATE and/or O_EXCL
[06:27:35] <JustAberrant> it'll fail if the file exists
[06:29:33] <Moonlightning> Yes, but how do you do that from a shell? :P
[06:30:11] <JustAberrant> you don't, using a shell script is a terrible thing ;p
[06:31:24] <JustAberrant> if you insit though, set the noclobber option (which does the same thing, prevents you from overwriting an existing file)
[06:31:27] <Moonlightning> Okayyyyyâ€¦what are the programmatic equivalents of mount, cryptsetup, btrfs-send, btrfs-receive, and umount? :P
[06:31:31] <JustAberrant> then try to create the file by piping something to it

[06:35:34] <Moonlightning> The backup volume is stored in a sparse file which will eventually be synced elsewhere; I want to be sure that there's at most one process accessing said file at a time.
[06:36:11] <JustAberrant> I see
[06:37:00] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[06:37:40] <RazorSharpFang> I keep forgetting that files can be read AND written to at the same time...
[06:38:13] <JustAberrant> usually a bad idea, and why we have file locking
[06:43:09] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: tea biscuits? :)
[06:43:30] <RazorSharpFang> um, what?
[06:43:47] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: opinions, thoughts, etc?
[06:44:09] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: do you like them, can you make them, ever tried them with butter or are you all about sausage gravy?
[06:44:32] <RazorSharpFang> I think it's a tad scary to have data in a file one moment, read that, try to read the next block, to find the file doesn't exist anymore.
[06:45:21] * JustAberrant doesn't let it get to him
[06:45:39] <JustAberrant> I mean it's just one of like a billion things that can go wrong when dealing with files
[06:45:45] <JustAberrant> and usually the handling is the same
[06:46:04] <JustAberrant> throw up an error, maybe do some kind of roll back, dump shit to a log, etc..
[06:46:19] <RazorSharpFang> Also, what happens when 2 seperate threads/processes try to create the same file at the same time?
[06:46:34] <JustAberrant> one succeeds, one fails
[06:47:03] <RazorSharpFang> But which?
[06:47:08] <RazorSharpFang> And why?
[06:47:09] <JustAberrant> whichever was first
[06:47:13] <JustAberrant> no such thing as "at the same time"
[06:47:22] <JustAberrant> it's all time splicing
[06:48:30] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: on *nix systems, the file can't actually stop existing if you have it open.
[06:48:47] <Moonlightning> It can have zero links, but it can't actually /stop existing/ until nothing has it open anymore.
[06:48:57] <RazorSharpFang> Well, it can be emptied, right?
[06:49:02] *** Quits: Webster (Webster@Pony-io0ebs.md.comcast.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:49:06] <RazorSharpFang> fopen(FILE,'w');
[06:49:07] <Moonlightning> Yeah; it can be truncated to zero
[06:49:21] <Moonlightning> then you'll be trying to read past the endâ€¦which should return zero, I think?
[06:49:46] <JustAberrant> at which point you do your generic <something went wrong with da file> handling
[06:49:53] <Moonlightning> ^
[06:49:55] <JustAberrant> it's not a special case you really need to handle ;p

[06:50:13] * Moonlightning giggles.
[06:50:30] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, but is there a possibility that two processes check if a file exists, if not, create it and write into it, and they overwrite eachother?
[06:50:43] <RazorSharpFang> Like, check check, write write ?
[06:50:46] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: see above re: O_CREATE ;p
[06:50:53] <JustAberrant> that's usually how that is prevented
[06:50:55] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> an "if_exist" loop?
[06:51:00] <JustAberrant> both just try to create the file
[06:51:12] <JustAberrant> if the create fails, assume the file already exists
[06:51:17] <JustAberrant> or something is horribly broken anyway
[06:51:29] <JustAberrant> and only write to the file if you could create it
[06:51:35] <RazorSharpFang> A condition you would not be expected to resolve.
[06:51:52] * JustAberrant nods
[06:52:08] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: Would that work with fopen ?
[06:52:31] <JustAberrant> probably
[06:53:06] <JustAberrant> this isn't 1996, I usually use some library that has a whole lockfile feature built in ;p
[06:53:55] <Moonlightning> DJ-C0L7[EIT]: no.
[06:53:57] <JustAberrant> if I was going to do things directly, I'd probably use plain ol` open
[06:54:01] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: this is why O_EXCL is a thing.
[06:54:02] <JustAberrant> because who knows what fopen does
[06:55:07] <RazorSharpFang> Moonlightning: I don't know what those refer to. : /
[06:55:19] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: got a *nix installation?
[06:55:30] <JustAberrant> using O_CREAT | O_EXCL as your mask makes it fail if the file already exists
[06:56:38] <JustAberrant> O_EXCL stands for Option Excalibur, Excalibur of course only being wielded by one person at a time

[07:09:36] <RazorSharpFang> True that.

[07:10:03] *** locodash11[lagout] is now known as locodashie11
[07:10:07] <JustAberrant> all identifiers are constants! *flips desk*
[07:10:24] <Moonlightning> You've got that backwards.

[07:10:57] <RazorSharpFang> It's open though, rite?
[07:11:07] <JustAberrant> probably
[07:11:09] <JustAberrant> makes more sense
[07:11:30] <Moonlightning> Other options have other prefixes.
[07:11:57] <RazorSharpFang> So, O_CREAT is for creating a file, what influence does O_EXCL have?
[07:12:31] *** Quits: Skids (ejd@Pony-fej07d.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[07:12:45] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang, you've got the manual page open, haven't you?
[07:12:51] <RazorSharpFang> Yes
[07:13:08] <RazorSharpFang> It's lagging for some reason.
[07:13:08] <Moonlightning> Use / to search for it
[07:14:42] <RazorSharpFang> So, force failure if file exists.
[07:14:53] <RazorSharpFang> what on earth does EXCL stand for?
[07:15:30] <Moonlightning> I would guess EXCLusive
[07:17:18] <RazorSharpFang> I fail to see how that makes sense.
[07:20:06] <Moonlightning> â€¦hmmmmâ€¦
[07:20:13] <Moonlightning> It kinda makes sense to me, but I can't articulate why
[07:23:21] <RazorSharpFang> I can't think of anything else that would work better though.
[07:23:49] <JustAberrant> how does that not make sense
[07:24:13] <JustAberrant> your basically saying "create this file or fail if you can't or it already exists"
[07:24:19] <JustAberrant> the file system will do this atomically
[07:25:09] <JustAberrant> the only challenge with using this as a lock file is if your program crashes before you delete it
[07:25:44] <RazorSharpFang> I assume with the appropriate privileges, it's not an issue.
[07:25:45] <JustAberrant> usually various hackery like creating a socket rather than a text file, and having some kind of ping/timeout if it already exists
[07:26:01] <Moonlightning> Firefox doesn't want to let me edit the Host: header -/-
[07:26:03] <Moonlightning> -.- *
[07:26:10] <Moonlightning> why the hell /not/
[07:26:33] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: what do you mean, permissions don't come into play
[07:26:58] <Moonlightning> I think there's a mechanism for ensuring a file is deleted on exit
[07:27:10] <JustAberrant> well, obviously if you can't write to the file due to permissions they do, but again, same handling as any file error
[07:27:18] <Moonlightning> then againâ€¦leaving the lockfile there is useful for requiring manual intervention in case of a crash
[07:27:26] * JustAberrant nods
[07:27:37] <Moonlightning> That might be desirable if the resource being locked is, say, a filesystem-on-sparsefile
[07:27:51] <JustAberrant> that's what most programs that arn't things expected to crash and be user restartable do.. ;p
[07:27:54] <Moonlightning> You'll know to do a fsck or whatever
[07:28:20] <JustAberrant> usually they'll provide some kind of --clear-locks argument that an admin can use if they are sure things are cool

[08:06:06] <Phase> at least on linux, windows locks you to one or the other
[08:06:34] <Phase> steam suffers from that under wine. jumps back and forth through the history at the slightest movement
[08:07:01] <RazorSharpFang> Phase: Uhmm, Alt+(left/right) has the EXACT SAME BEHAVIOUR!
[08:07:32] <Phase> ?
[08:07:40] <RazorSharpFang> It also goes forward/back
[08:07:50] <RazorSharpFang> Instead of horizontal scroll, like you suggested.
[08:07:52] <Phase> isn't that what you meant by tab history?
[08:08:07] <Phase> yeah, it's not easy to accidentally hit an alt+ combo
[08:08:15] <Phase> and can still be done with one hand
[08:08:17] <RazorSharpFang> Well, normally shift+scrollwheel is horizontal scroll, instead of foward/back
[08:08:31] <Phase> oooo
[08:08:33] <RazorSharpFang> But firefox has it forward/back for some reason.
[08:08:34] *** Gigabit is now known as Snoarin
[08:08:41] <RazorSharpFang> *WHO KNOWS WHY*
[08:08:49] <Phase> i've never seen shift+scroll as a horizontal scroll
[08:09:12] <Phase> but my laptop has a multitouch pad with a true horizontal scroll
[08:09:12] <RazorSharpFang> It's in chrome, IE, and other applications.
[08:09:17] <Phase> scrollwhels would be a different story
[08:09:30] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, imo you should open a bug about that

[08:10:46] * Moonlightning recruits aji :o
[08:11:15] <aji> hi
[08:11:19] <aji> i'm doing a cool code thing
[08:11:23] <aji> adding comments and then it's inbound
[08:11:25] <Moonlightning> Oh? :D
[08:11:39] * Moonlightning does code things sometimes, but they're rarely good and never cool :(
[08:12:06] <tiwake> aji: so you are saying its going to be 300 lines, and 5 of them are actual code? XD
[08:12:13] <Phase> Moonlightning, my solution: do more code things
[08:12:22] <Phase> teaching yourself is fun
[08:12:29] <RazorSharpFang> SEGFAULT
[08:12:31] <Moonlightning> Phase: but then even fewer of them will get fun!
[08:12:33] <Phase> D:
[08:12:35] <Moonlightning> â€¦
[08:12:37] <Moonlightning> s/fun/done/
[08:12:42] <Moonlightning> look what you made me do
[08:12:43] <Phase> Moonlightning, that's absolutely fine
[08:12:51] <Moonlightning> I know a bunch of languages; I just never FINISH ANYTHING ;-;
[08:12:55] <Phase> not finishing projects i mean
[08:12:56] <Moonlightning> EVER
[08:13:00] <tiwake> my coding things are pretty boring in context of the actual code... but they produce some pretty awesome parts
[08:13:20] <RazorSharpFang> My issue, is that every thing I try to make, HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE BETTER!
[08:13:23] <Phase> Moonlightning, the vast majority of projects are never finished, long as you're learning
[08:13:34] <Moonlightning> Phase: finished not as in finished forever
[08:13:39] <Moonlightning> finished as in /I can release this as a working thing/
[08:13:49] <Phase> yeah, the vast majority of things are never finished :P
[08:13:51] <Moonlightning> I have like one thing I can think of off the top of my head I consider finished, and it's just a few small modifications to someone else's project. :/
[08:13:56] * Phase has a bunch of crap lying around thats unfinished
[08:14:12] <Moonlightning> I need to contribute to a project
[08:14:17] <Moonlightning> one with a low barrier to entry
[08:14:37] <Phase> Moonlightning, and i'm defining finished as "achieved original goal"
[08:14:46] <Phase> i can count those on one hand
[08:14:57] <Moonlightning> but I don't want it to be that way! D:
[08:15:11] <Phase> it's going to be that way unless you make it not that way
[08:15:13] <Phase> learn damnit!
[08:15:14] <Moonlightning> (I can't ever seem to bridge the gap between /I've read the tutorials and messed around with the language some/ and /I can contribute usefully to projects/)
[08:15:26] <Moonlightning> Iâ€¦I just have too many things! @.@
[08:15:36] <Phase> tackle them one by one!
[08:15:38] <Phase> just do it!
[08:15:47] * Phase motivates Moonlightning
[08:16:07] <Moonlightning> ;-;
[08:16:12] <Moonlightning> you know any Rust?
[08:16:35] <Phase> little bit, haven't written any yet
[08:16:39] <Moonlightning> maybe we should make a group where we help each other get things finished
[08:16:44] <Phase> aji, ^ Moonlightning, rust, u know more
[08:16:58] <Moonlightning> I like this idea
[08:17:02] <Moonlightning> does anyone else like this idea?
[08:17:22] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[08:17:37] <Moonlightning> Just likeâ€¦push projects to GitHub and give each other write access and contribute to each other's things
[08:17:56] <Phase> thats... actually a really nice idea
[08:18:09] <aji> would be fun but i am very protective of my repos -w-
[08:18:30] <Moonlightning> Phase: you wanna do it?
[08:18:35] <Moonlightning> Let's fuckkin' do it, you and me.
[08:18:38] <Phase> sure
[08:18:41] <Moonlightning> We can do one of yours first.
[08:18:48] <Moonlightning> Right now, push something to GitHub. Whatever you got.
[08:19:03] <Phase> right now i'm pulling apart a windows ssh thing to figure out how it behaves as a console
[08:19:15] <RazorSharpFang> Putty?
[08:19:28] <Moonlightning> â€¦ooohâ€¦do you need a Windows installation? I haven't got one @.@
[08:19:32] <Phase> http://www.kpym.com/2/kpym/ this thing

[08:19:50] *** Init3-away is now known as init3
[08:19:53] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, it's the only one i've found so far that doesn't suffer a particular bug
[08:19:58] <Moonlightning> Phase: haven't got a copy of Windows either
[08:20:04] <RazorSharpFang> XD
[08:20:27] <Phase> same bug cygwin and mingw ones suffer from
[08:20:41] <Phase> what hae i got that needs doing...
[08:21:12] <RazorSharpFang> Phase: I am unfamiliar with this bug
[08:21:24] * Moonlightning has one of his in mind, one near the top of his stack. It's a Rust thing.
[08:21:48] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, things that accept input break, ie: if i launch cmd from powershell, or powershell from cmd, there's no prompt and the console softlocks
[08:22:10] <Phase> launching windows utilities from a mingw or cygwin prompt often has the same issue
[08:22:11] <RazorSharpFang> Eh? I've done it and it works fine
[08:22:16] <Moonlightning> Phase: what about if you do something non-REPL-y?
[08:22:24] <Moonlightning> Just `cat >$file` or whatever the hell the equivalent is
[08:22:31] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, over an ssh server?
[08:22:42] <RazorSharpFang> Ooh, now THAT I haven't done
[08:22:55] <Phase> Moonlightning, anything that just uses stdout works fine
[08:22:55] <Moonlightning> Phase: are you sshing in and then launching it, or doing `ssh $server $command`?
[08:23:10] <Phase> anything that expects a true windows console, doesn't work so wel
[08:23:27] * Phase isnt' quite sure how that bit of windows fits together
[08:23:29] <Moonlightning> Hmmmmmm.
[08:23:39] <Phase> sshing into a cmd session
[08:23:44] <Phase> then launching powershell
[08:23:59] <Phase> mingw/msys or cygwin based openssh builds break when you do that
[08:24:17] <Moonlightning> (Posted anything on Stack Exchange about it? xD )
[08:24:43] <Phase> that would have been sensible
[08:24:45] <RazorSharpFang> Windows is weird
[08:25:02] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, you haven't even scratched the surface
[08:25:04] <Moonlightning> <face>You don't say?!</face>
[08:35:45] *** zz_CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob
[08:35:53] *** Joins: Gladiolus-3G (uid110916@Pony-qjfks9.brockwell.irccloud.com)
[08:37:23] <Phase> CreateConsoleScreenBuffer apparently?
[08:37:39] <RazorSharpFang> That sounds like a windows-type function
[08:38:05] *** Gladiolus-3G is now known as Gladiolus
[08:38:10] <Moonlightning> nah, it's missing the leading 'W'
[08:38:34] <Phase> trailing' and no actually, doesn't take any strings
[08:38:36] <RazorSharpFang> WinCreateConsoleScreenBuffer()
[08:38:45] <Moonlightning> There we go ^
[08:38:49] <Phase> WriteConsoleInput though does come in an *A and *W variant
[08:39:02] <RazorSharpFang> I have no idea what those are. : /
[08:39:52] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, anything that accepts a string in the windows api comes in two variants, one that ends with A and one with W
[08:40:17] <RazorSharpFang> Why would that be?
[08:40:19] <Phase> A is 'ANSI', accepts ascii <= 127, > 127 depends on the system codepage
[08:40:26] <Phase> W accepts utf-16
[08:40:38] <Moonlightning> forâ€¦Wide?
[08:40:41] <Phase> and you can't pass utf-8 to the ANSI function
[08:40:43] <RazorSharpFang> Oh yeah. I forget that utf is a thing.
[08:40:44] <Phase> yeah, wchar_t
[08:42:17] <RazorSharpFang> Why the end though?
[08:42:56] <Moonlightning> well, makes more sense than the beginning
[08:42:58] <Phase> when you write code, you use (for example) WriteConsole(), which is a macro for one of the two actual implementations
[08:43:15] <Phase> and use TCHAR as your string type
[08:43:29] <Moonlightning> If you put them at the beginning, lexical sort would put AWriteConsole() and WWriteConsole() all the way on opposite sides of the page
[08:43:37] <Phase> unless you're one of the sane people who doesn't use the ansi/unicode macro switch and just uses WriteConsoleW directly
[08:44:01] <Phase> why not the middle
[08:44:05] <RazorSharpFang> Oh, I see.
[08:44:07] <Phase> WriteAConsole, WriteWConsole
[08:44:34] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, don't write windows code if you can avoid it
[08:44:51] <RazorSharpFang> Is the WinAPI that bad?
[08:45:12] <Moonlightning> The Windows EVERYTHING is bad.
[08:45:17] <Moonlightning> And it should feel bad.
[08:45:22] <Phase> sorta? it feels like writing php
[08:46:00] <Phase> where you have a thing called "HANDLE" but there's like 12 different things that sit in HANDLE, some of which are mutually incompatible 
[08:46:23] <RazorSharpFang> I still don't understand handles.
[08:46:44] <Phase> most of the time it's almost equivalent to an fd
[08:46:47] <JustAberrant> it's a thing, usually a number, that means something to something else
[08:46:53] <RazorSharpFang> fd??
[08:46:57] <Phase> file descriptor
[08:47:02] <Phase> the thing you get from open() on linux
[08:47:16] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: if I have, say, a pony washing service
[08:47:27] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: you give me your pony, I give you a number (8)
[08:47:32] <JustAberrant> that number is your handle
[08:47:48] <Phase> unlike linux, where you can put an fd into anything that accepts an fd, and have generic event loop functions like poll(), select(), and epoll
[08:47:51] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: when you come back to retrieve your pony or provide additional instructions
[08:48:01] <Phase> on windows you have, as i said, like 12 different things that fit in HANDLE
[08:48:03] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: you tell me that number (handle) so I know which pony you're talking about
[08:48:16] <JustAberrant> and laos use, the win32 api data types are really annoying
[08:48:25] <RazorSharpFang> That all makes sense to me. I don't understand why some functions take handle* others take handle.
[08:48:31] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: oh, that's a token.
[08:48:33] <Phase> WaitForMultipleObjects() is the closest you have to select but it waits until objects are 'signaled', exactly WHEN that is isn't documented for many kinds of object
[08:48:45] <JustAberrant> Moonlightning: very pedantic ;p
[08:48:50] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, the ones that take HANDLE* or PHANDLE are using it as an out parameter
[08:48:54] <Moonlightning> I feel like tokens are handles, but handles aren't always tokens
[08:49:05] <RazorSharpFang> Phase: Why don't they just return it?
[08:49:16] <Phase> because 0 is a valid handle
[08:49:16] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: it's just a pointer, same as a pointer to any other type of data
[08:49:18] <Phase> don't ask
[08:49:26] <RazorSharpFang> WAT
[08:49:34] <Phase> they're not pointers
[08:49:48] <Moonlightning> No, they're not pointers.
[08:49:48] <Phase> they happen to be pointer-sized but handles aren't pointers, there an index in some kernel-side table
[08:50:00] <JustAberrant> err, misread
[08:50:01] <Moonlightning> Pointers are tokens for memory. /Kinda./
[08:50:01] <RazorSharpFang> Okay, but why is 0 a valid handle?
[08:50:07] <Phase> i said don't ask
[08:50:18] <Phase> INALID_HANDLE_VALE == -1 iirc
[08:50:28] <Phase> RazorSharpFang, tbh i don't know, it just is
[08:50:43] <RazorSharpFang> Also, if the handle is an out, and it's not being returned, what IS being returned?
[08:50:55] <Phase> usually a BOOL, for success or failure
[08:50:58] <Phase> sometimes STATUS
[08:51:06] <Phase> which is like errno but returned
[08:51:10] *** Quits: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: )
[08:51:16] <RazorSharpFang> URGH
[08:51:42] <Phase> and there's a STATUS_SUCCESS macro because there's more than one STATUS value that's considered success
[08:51:53] <RazorSharpFang> Why.
[08:52:04] <Moonlightning> Well, `test` returning 1 isn't exactly failureâ€¦
[08:52:06] * JustAberrant throws an LOWORD and HWORD at Phase 
[08:52:22] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: gtfo, you loword
[08:52:25] <JustAberrant> :>
[08:52:53] <RazorSharpFang> Also, what's the difference between PHANDLE and Handle* ?
[08:53:15] <Phase> they're not, i don't know if PHANDLE is actually defined but that's the convention elsewhere
[08:53:19] <Phase> but it would be defined as HANDLE*
[08:54:05] <Phase> handle itself is a pointer sized integer that's garuenteed to never exceed the lower 32bits on 64bit platforms for compatibility reasons
[08:54:19] <Phase> and the lowest 2 bits are unused, you can store whatever there
[08:54:28] <Phase> except on things that look like HANDLE but aren't really
[08:54:41] <Phase> so it depends on what you're passing it to
[08:54:52] <Moonlightning> Oh boy, two bits!
[08:54:57] <Moonlightning> What should I save first?!
[08:55:06] <Phase> that's also why pid's on windows are a multiple of 4
[08:55:19] <Phase> far as i can tell pids are allocated from a handle table
[08:56:02] <Phase> also pids on windows are a multiple of 4
[08:56:04] <RazorSharpFang> I do like multiples of 2.
[08:56:16] <RazorSharpFang> And by extension, multiples of 4.
[08:56:21] <Moonlightning> If the caller wants to store more things, the caller can use a tuple.
[08:57:00] <Phase> RazorSharpFang likes multiples of 2, and multiples of multiples of 2
[08:57:35] <Moonlightning> what does that second one even mean?
[08:57:47] <Phase> multiples of multiples of 2
[08:58:13] <Phase> like multiples of 4, where 4 is a multiple of 2
[08:58:33] <Moonlightning> Phase: I take it the forum on this thing is defunct?
[08:58:46] <Phase> i'm not sure
[08:58:50] <Phase> there's too much windows in my head now

[09:01:26] <PinkiePieBot> [ count-ages.c Â· GitHub ]
[09:01:31] <RazorSharpFang> I blame the lack of standlone javascript interpreters, or compilers
[09:01:47] <Moonlightning> There was this one interpreterâ€¦
[09:01:51] <Moonlightning> was linked in here I'm pretty sureâ€¦
[09:03:09] <RazorSharpFang> node.js ?
[09:03:41] <Moonlightning> No
[09:03:47] * Moonlightning boops aji with a downto operator
[09:04:03] <RazorSharpFang> Firefox's javascript interpreter? They released it, I think.
[09:04:08] <RazorSharpFang> As a standalone thingy
[09:04:11] * aji drops a 1000 line match statement with 150 arms on Moonlightning
[09:04:24] <Moonlightning> ._.
[09:04:39] * Moonlightning flails his hooves through the match{}. Wonders what it does.
[09:05:00] <aji> i'm writing an instruction interpreter for a bare-bones emulator
[09:05:05] <aji> that's what it does ^-^
[09:05:23] <Moonlightning> 150 opcodes?
[09:05:30] <aji> more or less, yeah
[09:05:54] <Moonlightning> What do you think of the earlier idea, btw?
[09:05:55] <aji> back-o-the-napkin, that's about 10 lines per instruction, i think that's a fair use case for a match{} spanning most of the file
[09:05:59] <aji> earlier idea? which one?
[09:06:02] <aji> the git one?
[09:06:07] <Moonlightning> project sharing
[09:06:28] <aji> i don't think i'd "donate" any of my current projects, but i'd be happy to start some new ones
[09:07:12] <Moonlightning> Sure.
[09:07:25] <Moonlightning> I have a Rust thing I wanna finish, too
[09:07:33] <Moonlightning> You have ideas?
[09:07:36] <aji> what is it?
[09:07:45] <RazorSharpFang> Better finish it soon, or else your skills might get...
[09:07:47] <aji> ideas, hrm
[09:07:48] <RazorSharpFang> Rusty.
[09:07:52] <aji> i think an irc bot would be a fun community project
[09:07:54] <Moonlightning> --RazorSharpFang bonk
[09:07:58] * tiwake facehooves
[09:07:58] <Moonlightning> OOH OOH OOH YES
[09:08:03] <aji> set it up with a CD system
[09:08:06] <Moonlightning> A /Rust/ IRC bot :D
[09:08:11] <Moonlightning> â€¦a what system?
[09:08:14] <aji> and anybody could push changes to see them automatically updated on the bot
[09:08:17] <RazorSharpFang> Why do you like rust so much?
[09:08:17] <aji> continuous deployment
[09:08:24] <aji> there are a number of solutions
[09:08:24] <Moonlightning> I know nothing about htat
[09:08:33] <Moonlightning> I need to learn things, and I like this idea :D
[09:08:36] <aji> basically it listens to changes in a branch on the repo,
[09:08:42] <aji> and builds and deploys your code
[09:08:46] <aji> we could set it up with like heroku or something
[09:08:47] <Moonlightning> Ooh ooh, like the Rust thing?
[09:08:55] <Moonlightning> Rust repo has that, I think
[09:09:03] <aji> i'm sure there are CD tools that can listen to github and deploy to heroku
[09:09:07] <Moonlightning> I've seen it in issues.
[09:09:09] <Phase> "CONCURRENT HASH TABLE"
[09:09:17] <aji> Phase: VERY concurrent
[09:09:19] * Moonlightning hashes Phase's table
[09:09:22] <Phase> apprentlty
[09:09:31] <aji> only holds full-table lock when it needs to resize or insert
[09:09:33] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: I think it's a good language, and I want it to gain popularity and use.
[09:09:44] <RazorSharpFang> Does it have goto ?
[09:09:52] <Moonlightning> No, and it's better for it. :p
[09:09:52] <aji> no :(
[09:09:55] <Moonlightning> goto considered harmful
[09:10:02] <RazorSharpFang> But I love my gotos
[09:10:10] <aji> you will find exactly one (1) goto in count-ages.c
[09:10:13] <Moonlightning> Doesn't JS /not/ have gotos?
[09:10:13] <aji> i dare you to refactor it out
[09:10:19] <aji> >js
[09:10:27] <aji> >an example of a language with ideas worth replicating
[09:10:49] <aji> you see what i did there, i used a meme arrow
[09:11:11] <Moonlightning> <-
[09:11:15] <Moonlightning> a backwards arrow >:O
[09:11:22] <aji> <- backwards meme arrow
[09:11:24] <aji> <- 2015
[09:12:09] <RazorSharpFang> zxzxzxzxzxz

[09:12:35] <aji> i like these little toys i can make to flex my concurrency muscles a bit
[09:12:39] <aji> they get tired
[09:12:55] * Moonlightning would be willing to work on his thing, or one of aji's ideas, or the bot, right away
[09:13:08] <tiwake> do it filly
[09:13:09] <aji> lol yeah i won't be ready to start on the bot tonight
[09:13:21] <aji> i could try to get something started and ready by saturday if you like
[09:13:26] <aji> a basic thing that can connect to the network
[09:13:32] <aji> complete with CD and everything
[09:13:37] <Moonlightning> I'll take it
[09:14:01] <aji> neato, i've always wanted to do something like this
[09:15:32] <RazorSharpFang> Continuous deployment sounds hard
[09:16:20] * Moonlightning has fragments and remnants of several attempts at an IRC bot littering his system :(
[09:17:00] <RazorSharpFang> I haven't ever written an application that requires making a connection to a server not in the intranet
[09:17:07] <Moonlightning> First it was Python, then it was C++, then it was Python again
[09:18:02] * JustAberrant usually writes them as a good/one off thing
[09:18:36] <JustAberrant> http://svn.justaberrant.com/viewvc.cgi/PoniesBot/branches/01__initial/src/  <-- wrote this while quite drunk, and it shows :>

[09:21:22] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[09:23:02] <tiwake> JustAberrant: main.cpp looks fine to me at a glance
[09:23:46] <JustAberrant> I think like most things, I got drunker as I went along.. things get a bit "oh that'll do" when you get into the meat of it :>
[09:24:10] <tiwake> might help if I knew C++
[09:24:31] <JustAberrant> less than you'd think ;p
[09:24:43] <tiwake> dont think I'll ever learn it, as its not a very good language, just used a lot
[09:25:12] <JustAberrant> it's a good language, just old and dated imo
[09:25:25] * JustAberrant has certainly soured to it, but it has its place
[09:26:23] * JustAberrant prefers working with java, which is also much hated, over c++
[09:26:40] <RazorSharpFang> Ha, yeah
[09:26:48] <RazorSharpFang> Java's got... an interesting reputation.
[09:26:54] <tiwake> java, that I have worked with, is worse... lol
[09:27:14] <JustAberrant> can hate on java all you want, but it's insanely popular for a great number of reasons
[09:27:29] <RazorSharpFang> Its lack of operator overloaders
[09:27:32] <JustAberrant> it's not fun or sexy, but it's running a lot of stuff
[09:27:45] <tiwake> I really like Objective-C, but don't like the NS* library
[09:28:05] <tiwake> never did anything with what is being called Objective-C 2.0
[09:28:32] *** Cosmic|sleep is now known as Cosmic
[09:28:58] * JustAberrant never liked obj-c, but at least a chunk of that is due to it's association with apple ;p
[09:29:30] <tiwake> yeah, I'd hate it if I had to use the apple libraries too (re: the NS* stuff)
[09:29:47] <RazorSharpFang> I'd have to own an apple-device before I worked with apple libraries.
[09:30:04] <Moonlightning> Objective-C is deprecated t ome
[09:30:04] <tiwake> no you dont
[09:30:05] <Moonlightning> to me *
[09:30:21] <Moonlightning> Even more so than the other languages I consider deprecated, because as far as I know, only Apple stuff uses it :P
[09:30:24] * JustAberrant knows someone who works at apple.. and hates swift :>
[09:30:38] <Moonlightning> C is deprecated, but Linux uses it heavily
[09:30:42] <tiwake> RazorSharpFang: you can get the GNU library that does the same thing for apple... at least the "important" stuff
[09:30:43] <JustAberrant> so I pretty much make reference to that constantly
[09:31:08] <Moonlightning> C++ is deprecated, but there's still lots of things that use it
[09:31:12] * JustAberrant sees obj-c on non-apple in the same light as .net on non-windows.. yeah you can do it, but bleh ;p
[09:31:16] <tiwake> Moonlightning: its not deprecated... you can hardly program microcontrollers any other way
[09:31:24] <RazorSharpFang> C++ deprecated? Hardly.
[09:31:30] <Moonlightning> Not officially or anything.
[09:31:39] <Moonlightning> Just that I would prefer not to use it for new projects :p
[09:32:03] <tiwake> tell that to microcontrollers around the world :P
[09:32:08] <RazorSharpFang> XD
[09:32:22] <RazorSharpFang> Also, could you imagine programming game-engines NOT in C++?
[09:32:23] <Moonlightning> Rust should add that then
[09:32:36] <tiwake> RazorSharpFang: yeah, Objective-C
[09:33:01] <JustAberrant> bleh, rust is old and tired
[09:33:06] <JustAberrant> err, new and tired I guess
[09:33:10] <JustAberrant> but.. tired none the less
[09:33:16] <JustAberrant> and actually so am I, I'm going to bed ;p
[09:33:40] <tiwake> https://github.com/Midar/objfw
[09:33:41] <PinkiePieBot> [ Midar/objfw Â· GitHub ]
[09:33:57] <tiwake> a fantastic light weight library written in Objective-C
[09:35:41] <RazorSharpFang> lightweight, but what does it do?
[09:35:50] <tiwake> libraries
[09:35:59] <tiwake> such as string objects and such
[09:38:38] <tiwake> the only thing that Objective-C comes with that isnt C is Object.h and a small runtime to support Object.h
[09:38:59] <tiwake> and I guess some extra syntax
[09:40:02] <RazorSharpFang> That's not much
[09:40:10] <RazorSharpFang> xzxzxzxzxzxzxzx
[09:40:13] <RazorSharpFang> Whoops
[09:40:39] * Moonlightning wonders what that is :P
[09:41:01] <RazorSharpFang> RPGMaker game, z to go to next message, x to skip scrolling of current message.
[09:41:23] <RazorSharpFang> Kinda like abababab for a pokemon game
[09:41:27] <tiwake> Moonlightning: its 120 and 122 a bunch
[09:43:01] <Moonlightning> â€¦oh wait, I have plans this weekend :D
[09:43:13] *** CyberJacob is now known as zz_CyberJacob
[09:43:23] <tiwake> I do too
[09:43:27] <Moonlightning> But I'll check in on the thing at least once on Saturday and Sundary
[09:43:28] <tiwake> get drunk with Colgate
[09:43:36] <tiwake> and bed him
[09:43:51] * RazorSharpFang yawnies
[09:44:46] <RazorSharpFang> This is weird, the memory address of the HP value keeps changing each time the game restarts.
[09:44:59] <RazorSharpFang> So I have to search every time it crashes.
[09:46:11] <Moonlightning> Uh.
[09:46:16] <Moonlightning> Things don't generally have the same addressâ€¦
[09:46:34] <Moonlightning> maybe the same offset relative to something, if the allocations always happen in the same order
[09:46:40] <RazorSharpFang> zxzx
[09:46:43] <Moonlightning> but seriously, stuff isn't static
[09:47:02] <RazorSharpFang> Well, it's been the same address for a lot of other games.

[13:13:36] <Googie> Thanks.
[13:14:19] <Googie> I'm pretty happy to be the only person to have done the corp pen testing stuff to the end also. Even if rooting the last box was a bit of a fluke
[13:14:38] <ShivalWolf> yeah that last box was a challenge
[13:15:04] <ShivalWolf> damn aslr
[13:15:29] <ShivalWolf> Googie: so what was your favourite ones
[13:15:37] *** Unixkitty is now known as Awaykitty
[13:15:42] <Googie> Meanwhile the box was just unpatched and vulnerable to a public kernel priv escalation exploit :P
[13:15:54] <ShivalWolf> which box
[13:16:12] <Googie> The DNS server for corp pentesting
[13:16:23] <ShivalWolf> yeah?
[13:16:51] <Googie> Yeah.
[13:17:24] <ShivalWolf> i didnt know that
[13:17:57] <Googie> I don't think anyone did. I was clutching at straws in the last 10 minutes.
[13:18:06] <ShivalWolf> lol
[13:18:40] <ShivalWolf> i had alot of fun working and getting corp built
[13:19:00] <Googie> So you're the bastard who built it ? :P
[13:19:28] <Googie> I'm still surprised that I was the only person to make it to the end of that though.
[13:20:57] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> 'grats
[13:21:02] <Googie> That IPv6 internal network...
[13:21:33] <ShivalWolf> it was a collboration between myself and a guy from defense
[13:22:40] <ShivalWolf> the ipv6 internal we were rather proud of
[13:22:46] <ShivalWolf> it was just evil enough to really trick people up
[13:22:57] <Googie> That it was.
[13:23:59] <ShivalWolf> i also find it interesting to hear from players what the thought of the game
[13:24:08] <ShivalWolf> given it was 4 momnths of developnet
[13:24:11] <ShivalWolf> for a 24 hour event
[13:26:08] <Googie> I really enjoyed it. I spent most of my time on Corp and the two "root this box" style challenges, and just doing the odd stuff towards the end that was mostly free points.
[13:26:40] <ShivalWolf> root the boxes were all my design
[13:27:05] <ShivalWolf> simple generic CTF ones that were designed to get that inital break in mindset
[13:27:45] <ShivalWolf> its amusing how many people were trying to crack the password on hack the box one
[13:29:19] <Googie> One of my teammates was looking at it for a little bit, getting hooked up on NFS before they had a shell.
[13:29:36] <Googie> I just took a look at the challenge name and went "Yup, that's heartbleed" :P
[13:29:51] <ShivalWolf> lol
[13:30:06] <ShivalWolf> spent ages trying to work out how to name that without giving it away
[13:30:15] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[13:30:24] <ShivalWolf> in the end we just went with the name becuase it worked
[13:32:09] <ShivalWolf> i soo wanted to see someone try and write an art reverser for the 2nd part of that
[13:32:50] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i think my protocol analyzer is going to get a workout today @_@
[13:32:52] <ShivalWolf> oh you got my matrix maths one as well
[13:32:55] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> oops, wrong channel, sry
[13:33:18] <Googie> It's funny in that I didn't actually "directly" work on that box, but every time the guy got stuck I looked at it for five minutes "Oh, that's heartbleed" "Oh, those are old Debian keys" "Oh, that file you created on NFS is owned by root"
[13:33:45] <ShivalWolf> Googie: good way of working through it though
[13:34:17] <ShivalWolf> NFS tricked u afew people
[13:34:24] <ShivalWolf> becuase so few people use it day to day or set it up
[13:34:30] <ShivalWolf> dont realise how its pemrisions work
[13:34:57] <ShivalWolf> i really did have alot of fun building that box
[13:36:10] <ShivalWolf> well given i have been awake since yesterday morning 5:30am
[13:36:16] <ShivalWolf> time for me to crash in my hotel room
[13:36:31] <ShivalWolf> nice view over the harbor
[13:36:31] <Googie> Hahaha, I took a three? hour nap and then woke up again.
[13:36:44] <ShivalWolf> lol i didnt nap at all
[13:36:53] <Googie> I only did after it ended and I got home.
[13:36:56] <ShivalWolf> i was at excon the whole time except an hour so i could change when some bigwigs showed up
[13:37:19] <ShivalWolf> we were amused in excon how you guys kept your teams in order almost the whole time
[13:37:50] <Googie> Yeah. Poor UNSW5 though. IIRC one of the guys just walked out part way through.
[13:37:59] <ShivalWolf> awwww
[13:39:13] <ShivalWolf> night nights
[13:39:27] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> sleep well
[13:39:33] <Googie> Sleep well. If you can anyway :P
