[03:23:08] <JustAberrant> I still haven't figured that out yet ;p

[03:23:35] <Googie> Hold the thermal paste.
[03:24:10] * JustAberrant has the chef trim the pins off the proc
[03:24:25] <Sombra> Oh right.
[03:24:43] <Sombra> The motherboard is an Asrock z77 pro4, the CPU is an i5 3570k, and the ram is... let me check that.
[03:25:52] <Sombra> Four, 4GB sticks of G.skill DDR3 1333 PC3 10666
[03:26:08] <Sombra> As well as a cooler master CPU cooler (but also the original stock intel CPU cooler)
[03:28:56] <tiwake> how much you want for it?
[03:33:42] <Sombra> $200

[05:05:15] <Gigabit> hey, so I am choosing between this tv and another
[05:05:16] <Gigabit> https://www.meijer.com/product/electronics/tvs-home-theater/tvs/vizio-40-smart-led-tv-e40-c2/t1/t1-872/t2/t2-10017/t3/t3-459/84522601197.uts
[05:06:02] <Gigabit> the other is  a 40" phillips smart tv
[05:06:10] <Gigabit> Which brand do you think is better
[05:08:22] <JustAberrant> that seems oddly cheap
[05:08:32] <JustAberrant> then I haven't looked at TVs in awhile
[05:09:35] <Gigabit> we are running a sale special on it tomorrow, 1 day only I athink
[05:10:06] <Taloverae> TVs are mostly the same these days. which one has the better warranty and do you have a preference for chassis design?
[05:10:47] <Gigabit> I dont care for the mounts on that one but, I get 20% and I have a 25$ cupon as well that will knock the price down more
[05:11:32] <Gigabit> so.. 85 off that price
[05:11:36] * JustAberrant would mostly just ignore the "smart" features and explicitly look for one that doesn't have a web cam.. but yeah, that's about it
[05:11:48] <Kinsley> JustAberrant: you haven't been following TV prices, then. $400 ish for a 40" 1080p screen is "reasonable"
[05:11:52] <JustAberrant> read reviews I guess
[05:12:06] <JustAberrant> Kinsley: crazy :)
[05:12:26] <JustAberrant> last time I looked you were looking at $800+, and that wasn't that long ago..
[05:12:27] <Gigabit> Meh the smart function doesnt bother me. I prefer not one but I will use it
[05:12:56] <Gigabit> Im also going to be using this as my PC monitor too
[05:13:04] <Kinsley> My take on it, Gigabit, is ... never fucking mind.
[05:13:10] <JustAberrant> hehehe
[05:13:15] <JustAberrant> that's actually really not fun
[05:13:22] <Gigabit> huh? Did I do something wrong?
[05:13:28] <Kinsley> Screw smart TVs, just find something in the 32" range that has RAVE reviews and HDMI inputs out the ass.
[05:13:43] <Gigabit> I want a 40" though XD
[05:14:10] <JustAberrant> using a 40" tv as a computer monitor is probably gonna suck ;p
[05:15:07] *** Quits: Gladiolus (Corey@the.truth.is.out.there) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:15:08] <Gigabit> It will just be for sending videos to it is all. I still have my 21.5" monitor
[05:15:34] <JustAberrant> well yeah, that's fine
[05:15:38] <Gigabit> And we also do not carry any 1080p 32" tv's
[05:16:01] <Gigabit> another reason I am going 40
[05:17:20] <Taloverae> Vizio is popular for being that brand that seemed to offer a fantastic value for the money around 7 or 8 years ago.
[05:18:16] <Taloverae> As long as you don't plug that smart version into the internet, either one will probably be fine, but do your reasearch! Someone somewhere must own one of these things enough to hate on it, or like it enough to fawn over the 'new tv smell'
[05:18:26] <Kinsley> Taloverae: my understanding is that they still deliver good value. Like, I haven't heard that the panels started to suck or prices spiked.
[05:19:20] <Taloverae> Kinsley, yeah, I haven't heard bad things, and they're certainly no HiSense. I haven't been in the market for a TV in many, many years though.
[05:21:24] * Gigabit hasnt owned a tv ever :(
[05:21:59] * JustAberrant needs to get one at some point, but I need to get like.. furniture and stuff.. first :>
[05:22:14] * Taloverae has one, and uses it about once ever fiscal quarter >>
[05:22:48] <JustAberrant> hehe
[05:25:26] <Kinsley> I have one that I bought for under $200 two years ago, almost, and it's spent half that time in its box.
[05:25:58] <Kinsley> And now that I have my beautiful 27" 1440p monitor, I don't think I'm going back.
[05:26:17] * JustAberrant doubts he'd spend much time watching it, but would be nice to be able to have people over and watch a movie 
[05:26:24] <JustAberrant> or whatever
[05:29:18] <Kinsley> I certainly don't regret my purchase.

[09:10:36] <Moonlightning> It seems nontrivial

[09:10:47] <Phase> oh
[09:10:49] <Phase> arbitrary blocks
[09:10:52] <Moonlightning> yeah
[09:10:59] <Moonlightning> I might write this
[09:10:59] <Phase> as in binary or?
[09:11:20] <Moonlightning> â€¦fuckâ€¦did I just push something onto my project stack? >.<
[09:11:28] <Phase> yes
[09:11:35] <Moonlightning> Ffffuuuuuuuuu
[09:11:38] <Moonlightning> welp
[09:11:48] <Moonlightning> let's talk about it, then
[09:11:57] <Moonlightning> It's definitely doable
[09:12:17] <Moonlightning> You'll kinda need access to the internals of the compiled regex, though
[09:12:56] <Moonlightning> something something state machine and being able to read more into the buffer if there /might/ be a match to the regex
[09:13:56] <Moonlightning> the buffer management is going to be rather complex, if it's going to be /really/ efficient (e.g. if reading would block and there's already stuff buffered that we can determine is not a match, write that out and flush output, /then/ try to read more)
[09:14:31] * Moonlightning checks out Rust's regex API
[09:14:44] * Phase thought sed was mostly-constant memory
[09:15:28] <Moonlightning> o3o !

[09:17:10] <Moonlightning> Phase: yeah, but sed has it easy, 'cos it operates on lines. :P

[09:28:50] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[09:30:42] <Moonlightning> yeah, I need a lower-level API than this.
[09:32:10] <Phase> an issue with not matching lines is any .* will match the entire stream
[09:32:27] <Phase> unless you're just using something else as the delimiter
[09:37:58] <Moonlightning> Ooh, yeah.
[09:38:17] <Moonlightning> Could we detect that and optimize for it?
[09:38:35] <Moonlightning> I mean, the obvious thing is s/.*// should exit immediately, printing nothing
[09:39:21] <Phase> but .* is supposed to match everything
[09:39:35] <Phase> would be essentially the same as cat [file]
[09:39:47] <Moonlightning> Right. That matches everything, and replaces it with nothing.
[09:39:58] <Phase> oh, my bad

[09:46:36] <Moonlightning> From what I can tell, this basically boils down to being able to suspend the matching process if the end of available data is reached, and read in more.
[09:49:46] <Moonlightning> Though that does raise questions about how to avoid allocating /too much/ memory. And whether that's a realistic concern for regexes that are likely to actually be used (not e.g. `a{100}{100}{100}`)
[09:50:55] <Moonlightning> Presumably, clients won't be passing in untrusted regexes (though maybe we can also support that through Regex::with_size_limit())
[09:51:29] <Moonlightning> But we should also keep reasonably low levels of surprise
[09:52:02] <Phase> as a cli tool, just do whatever is asked, even if it would need terrabytes of memory
[09:52:29] <Moonlightning> Really?
[09:52:55] <Phase> well, if you were using sed and it exited on you for exceeding a memory limit, how'd you feel?
[09:52:57] <Moonlightning> I can't think of a precedent for that off the top of my head (except maybe stuff like `dd` with large values of `bs`)
[09:53:36] <Moonlightning> Probably surprised, and then I'd probably examine my regex and try to think why it might cause excessive memory consumption
[09:53:41] <Phase> and i mean sed itself presuming a limit as opposed to a failed allocaion or oom killer
[09:53:46] <Moonlightning> I'd be more upset if it started eating RAM, though
[09:54:09] <Phase> then dont' ask it to do something that eats all your ram :P
[09:54:57] <Moonlightning> Is it super unlikely that someone just writing a regex would happen to write something that would cause this to eat RAM, though?
[09:56:02] <Phase> in sed yes since they're bounded by newlines, outside of that i have written search/replace regexes in geany what took a good half hour to complete
[09:56:16] <Phase> a 200MB file or some crap, it made sense at the time
[09:59:04] <Moonlightning> and in mrepl, since they're not bounded by newlines?
[10:02:10] <Moonlightning> I'm tired and I'm just thinking small @.@
[10:02:16] <Moonlightning> very small
[10:02:43] <Moonlightning> this was inspired by frustration trying to strip the control characters from towel.blinkenlights.nl.:666's responses ;P

[10:04:03] <Moonlightning> Try it.
[10:04:19] <Moonlightning> You should get stray '[H' and '[J's.
[10:05:11] <Moonlightning> â€¦okay, I'm actually not sure what that does

[19:30:04] <Moonlightning> `netcat -q 1`, but `cut -d' '`
[19:30:18] <mniip> that's because -q1 is invalid
[19:30:21] <mniip> but okay
[19:30:26] <JockeTF> mniip: Cool! :D
[19:30:35] <Moonlightning> Then use spaces between the flag and its argument!
[19:30:38] <Moonlightning> cut -d ' '

[19:35:23] <Moonlightning> Hay mniip

[19:35:52] <mniip> the what now
[19:35:54] <Moonlightning> //tcp.mniip.com/.man
[19:36:16] <JockeTF> http://tcp.mniip.com/mrm <-- JPEG. :P
[19:36:29] <Moonlightning> Also, I call bullshit. The current / is clearly HTML
[19:36:36] <Moonlightning> also, /needs TLS support/
[19:37:21] <Moonlightning> Also, needs non-layer-seven fetching
[19:37:44] * Moonlightning submits /all/ the enhancement requests!
[19:38:15] <mniip> it is also clearly invalid (fixed now)
[19:38:22] <mniip> hmm
[19:39:10] <Moonlightning> I mean, we got this text/plain thing going on, which obviously has got to go
[19:39:30] <mniip> no
[19:39:33] <mniip> no way
[19:39:55] <Moonlightning> http://tcp.mniip.com/mrm
[19:41:23] <Moonlightning> ^ This is not text. :P
[19:41:39] <Moonlightning> so unless you wanna invoke `file` to get the /proper/ MIME types
[19:41:50] <Moonlightning> or serve everything as application/octet-stream (//ew//)
[19:43:00] <Moonlightning> â€¦hahahahahaha
[19:43:05] <Crimson_Tail> simple
[19:43:08] <Moonlightning> You could portknock out a paste ID
[19:43:11] <Crimson_Tail> you grab the response headers
[19:43:23] <Moonlightning> and then connect toâ€¦Iunno, 8888?
[19:43:23] <Crimson_Tail> and you'll see what kinda file it is
[19:43:39] <Moonlightning> Crimson_Tail: it always serves 'text/plain'
[19:43:46] <mniip> that is intended
[19:43:46] <Moonlightning> [10:39:55] < Moonlightning> http://tcp.mniip.com/mrm
[19:43:53] <mniip> I'm not serving arbitrary files
[19:43:56] <Moonlightning> But often incorrect. :V
[19:44:00] <Moonlightning> You /are/ serving arbitrary files.
[19:44:00] <mniip> this is not a file uploader
[19:44:04] <mniip> right
[19:44:08] <mniip> but I'm serving them as text
[19:44:21] <Moonlightning> You're serving them as bytes.
[19:44:35] <Moonlightning> Now, if you base64ed everything, THEN you would be serving them as text
[19:44:57] <mniip> sigh
[19:46:13] <Moonlightning> But '\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\x00\x10' is not text, by /any/ measure. :P

[20:08:23] <mniip> does anyone happen to want to donate $38 to this thing :)
[20:12:36] * Moonlightning is seriously considering whipping together a competing TLS one. <.<
[20:13:02] <mniip> Moonlightning, if only there was a TLS netcat
[20:13:20] <Moonlightning> `openssl s_client`, `gnutls-cli`
[20:13:20] <mniip> or an IPv6 openssl s_client
[20:13:30] <Moonlightning> gnutls-cli works fine with v6, AFAIK
[20:17:00] <mniip> Moonlightning, it'd be easier to incorporate SSL into tcpaste I believe
[20:17:29] <Moonlightning> Oh, are you actually going to do it? x3
