[09:10:50] <Lapsus> tiwake: what directions do the letters correspond to on a lathe? I'm not too familiar with non-cartesian machines
[09:12:23] <tiwake> Lapsus: the controller looks very close to this http://www.meridianmachinery.com/photos/2488_2.jpg
[09:13:45] <Lapsus> I'm still trying to figure out what direction is what, is all :p
[09:14:06] <Lapsus> I don't imagine z==up as it is on my printer
[09:14:32] <tiwake> oh
[09:15:15] <tiwake> the Z-axis moves the turret closer to the collet, horizontal to the floor
[09:15:34] <tiwake> thats the way all lathes are
[09:16:12] <Lapsus> okay
[09:16:21] <Lapsus> so what are the other two directions called?
[09:16:31] <tiwake> there is only one other direction :P
[09:16:38] <tiwake> X-axis
[09:16:50] <Lapsus> well, there's depth of cut and whatever the rotational axis is called
[09:17:13] <tiwake> as far as the machine is concerned, its not an axis
[09:17:19] <tiwake> most of the time
[09:17:57] <Lapsus> you still need to set a speed for it though
[09:18:00] <tiwake> cause you just tell the spindle to turn on at whatever RPM, it does not care about rotational position
[09:18:23] <Lapsus> or, the speed needs to be controlled based on the surface speed at the tool or something
[09:19:10] <tiwake> (while that is not quite true, its still not considered an axis)
[09:20:39] <tiwake> the collet/chuck is considered an axis if the machine can keep a precise position of it, which some do
[09:20:47] <tiwake> most of them don't
[09:21:03] <tiwake> the ones that do its called the C-axis
[09:21:37] <tiwake> I suppose the turret is technically an axis too, but its never called that... like ever
[09:22:21] *** Quits: Mike_Coltfield (Larscis@colt.in.the.rain) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[09:24:39] <tiwake> C-axis lathes are typically a lot more expensive...

[09:42:24] <JustAberrant> windows on embedded machines is just gross
[09:42:38] <JustAberrant> a lot of stuff from the UK tends to be that for whatever reason
[09:43:06] <JustAberrant> but yeah, usual anti windows stuff aside, windows is just really not designed for that use case and it shows
[09:43:07] <tiwake> JustAberrant: I know a guy who has a huge shop full of custom machines that all run windows

[09:44:22] <JustAberrant> there was some smart safe (by brinks I think), and some researcher was able to by pass it by figuring out that the interface was a flash applet running in like ie6
[09:45:02] <JustAberrant> they also had an exposed USB port with auto-pay enabled, etc.. that kind of incompetence just terrifies me
[09:45:30] <tiwake> it is not a realtime operating system... linux most of the time is not either, but can be compiled to be realtime
[09:45:40] *** Quits: Phase (Phase4@Pony-kk0nqh.internode.on.net) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[09:46:26] <JustAberrant> right, though in fairness the applications where you need a real time system are shrinking, and I've seen a tendency towards isolating those bits and having a non-real time system manage higher level logic

[09:58:04] <mniip> hmm I'm having a trouble defining it as well
[09:59:21] <JustAberrant> I've always understood it to mean you've got exact control over execution timing, but it could of course have more meaning than that
[09:59:47] <JustAberrant> i.e. there's no higher level process randomly slicing up your processing into unpredictable time chunks
[10:00:56] <JustAberrant> so if you get some bit of information you can process it in a consistent chunk of time to account for things like how long it takes for some mechanical process to finish
[10:00:59] <Divide|TechSupport> I've always read 'realtime' as 'the computer uses all clock cycles available to it, instead of being limited by the OS'.  Which I guess is the same thing.

[18:20:54] <tiwake> HoneyDrops: cause its annoying to try to figure out which two/three windows it is when they lose focus and get buried under a bunch of other windows
[18:22:26] <tiwake> just now pulled up the single window mode... this seems like it would be nice
[18:22:54] <HoneyDrops> tag1 = tool windows, etc.  tag2 = file1, tag3 = file2, ... offset tag number based on what other tags are populated.  You can substitute virtual desktops for tags, but it isn't quite as nice.
[18:24:15] <tiwake> tags?
[18:24:19] <HoneyDrops> You shouldn't have enough windows on any given workspace that you could lose track of that, even if you're using a floating WM.
[18:25:27] <tiwake> 12 are open right now
[18:25:52] <tiwake> and have been over night
[18:26:02] <HoneyDrops> http://dwm.suckless.org/ Tags, each window has one or more "tags" set, your WM displays one or more tags.  You can tag a given window with any combination of tags and display any combination of tags at once.  If you only ever tag windows with a single tag at a time and only display one tag at a time, it behaves like virtual desktops.
[18:26:02] <tiwake> no, 13 was, I closed the calculator
[18:26:03] <PinkiePieBot> [ suckless.org dwm - dynamic window manager ]
[18:26:51] <HoneyDrops> I have somewhere in the upper 20 or lower 30' open right now.
[18:27:16] <HoneyDrops> Spread over 12 tags
[18:27:53] <wolfyshy> I have 8 windows open right now, two of them pidgin, three of them firefox, one terminal, one Qt Creator, one zeal
[18:27:55] <tiwake> that sounds like my 70+ tabs open in my web browser
[18:28:09] <wolfyshy> which I highly recommend zeal for any programming ponies http://zealdocs.org/
[18:28:10] <PinkiePieBot> [ Zeal - Offline Documentation Browser ]
[18:28:22] <wolfyshy> I finally don't need 10000 tabs open in firefox to write code
[18:28:46] <wolfyshy> and indeed, I can quit Firefox and focus on writing code with this.  no distractions from facehoof/twitter/etc
[18:29:01] <tiwake> heh
[18:29:04] <tiwake> nice
[18:29:18] <tiwake> though I don't really program much
[18:29:22] <tiwake> wish I did more
[18:29:37] <HoneyDrops> I have 94 tabs in FF, trimmed it recently.  Chromium (sandboxed to hell) has 30.  I have 8 or so tmux sessions, most are 2-5 windows, might have multiple panes in them.
[18:31:28] <wolfyshy> fun window has 30 tabs, reading window has 38 tabs, work window has 26 tabs
[18:31:37] <wolfyshy> and yes I separate firefox into three windows based on what thing I'm doing
[18:31:41] <wolfyshy> it's much more manageable that wauy
[18:31:43] <wolfyshy> way*
[18:31:53] <tiwake> heh
[18:32:13] <wolfyshy> oddly enough
[18:32:17] <wolfyshy> that is also 94 tabs o.o
[18:32:19] <tiwake> well, they are pulling tab grouping from firefox... *shrug*
[18:32:24] <HoneyDrops> GIMP's UI was intended to be used with at least a competent WM, if a WM can't manage to keep 3-5 windows associated…
[18:32:26] * wolfyshy looks at HoneyDrops, wonders if her browser session has been stolen!
[18:33:41] * HoneyDrops mews.
[18:34:31] <wolfyshy> cat stole my food, cat stole my heart, now cat stole my browser!

[19:36:10] <Moonlightning> HoneyDrops: also, IIRC, the non-file windows don't /appear/ unless gimp has focus
[19:36:21] <Moonlightning> So if you click away from the file window trying to get at one of the others, they disappear
[19:36:48] <HoneyDrops> Eh?
[19:37:10] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[19:37:38] <HoneyDrops> Not the case for me (and pretty sure I have default settings)
[19:38:00] <Moonlightning> I haven't used gimp in ages, though, so I dunno
[19:38:02] <HoneyDrops> I have a terminal focused and all of the GIMP windows are shown.
[19:38:12] * HoneyDrops just checked.
[19:43:25] * HoneyDrops blames Moonlightning.
[19:48:25] * Moonlightning has no blame! Has no revision history of any kind, actually.
