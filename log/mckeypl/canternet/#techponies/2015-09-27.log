[11:50:15] <Moonlightning> Revisiting SOPA…
[11:50:30] <Moonlightning> >> https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/114007
[11:50:31] <PinkiePieBot> [ How does SOPA threaten Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange? - Meta Stack Exchange ]
[11:51:43] <Moonlightning> > [The DMCA takedown request requirements] deter[] an awful lot of people who are randomly trying to censor Stack Overflow for hosting answers that they don't find convenient.We respond by notifying the person who posted the material, giving them a chance to make a case for why the material is non-infringing.
[11:51:48] <Moonlightning> > The important thing about DMCA is that if we follow this fairly decent procedure, we, as a website, are /legally protected/ from the claim that we contributed to the copyright violation.
[11:51:57] <Moonlightning> > The SOPA dramatically alters the careful balance in favor of "alleged" copyright holders. It makes it impossible for websites to find a reasonable safe harbor allowing them to continue to host user-generated content. And that is life-threatening for websites like Stack Exchange.
[11:52:41] <Moonlightning> So it basically removes the checks on takedown requests, allowing anyone to issue a takedown -request- command that must be unconditionally honored.
