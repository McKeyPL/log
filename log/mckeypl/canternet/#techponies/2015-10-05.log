[00:35:59] <Lapsus> Moonlightning: If you don't fuck things up, how are you supposed to learn anything?
[00:37:01] <Moonlightning> I don't think that really applies here.
[00:37:50] <Phase> context?
[00:40:16] <Moonlightning> Given a path to a symlink, get the absolute, canonical path to the symlink's target, aaaaaaand, I just realized I don't actually need to do that.
[00:40:49] <Moonlightning> Because what I /actually/ want is the timestamps|filetype of the target, and stat() follows symlinks by default, so yeah
[00:41:42] <Phase> Moonlightning, target = symlink.target_name; if target[0] == '/': target, else dirname(symlink)+target
[00:42:04] <Phase> i'm not sure if there's a function that does that for you
[00:42:56] <Moonlightning> Phase: /usr/local/bin/greadlink -> ../Cellar/coreutils/8.24/bin/greadlink
[00:43:17] <Phase> yeah, that'll give you /usr/local/bin/../Cellar/coreutils/8.24/bin/greadlink
[00:43:23] <Phase> which is an absolute path
[00:43:23] <Moonlightning> Which is not canonical. :P
[00:43:29] <Phase> Ohh, canonical
[00:43:34] <Moonlightning> Yes, canonical.
[00:43:52] <Moonlightning> There could be some funky business if /usr/local is also a symlink or something
[00:43:57] <Phase> is there a function for canonizing paths?
[00:43:57] <Moonlightning> so you can't just take out the bin/../
[00:44:03] <Moonlightning> There /should/ be.
[00:44:10] <Moonlightning> That's why I was looking at what GNU readlink does.
[00:44:23] <Moonlightning> 'cos it's got an -f flag that makes it do exactly what I want.
[00:47:25] <wolfyshy> Moonlightning: https://bpaste.net/show/f4cb333a62ad
[00:47:27] <PinkiePieBot> [ show at bpaste ]
[00:47:29] <wolfyshy> you want os.path.realpath
[00:48:19] <Phase> Moonlightning, there a reason you need canonical paths?
[00:48:51] <Moonlightning> Phase: …I don't think so, actually
[00:48:55] <Moonlightning> but like I said, the whole thing is moot
[00:49:02] * wolfyshy knew her deep knowledge of os.path would pay off some day \o/
[00:49:10] <Moonlightning> :D
[00:49:33] <Phase> Moonlightning, i mean why did you think you needed it :P
[00:50:04] <Moonlightning> …didn't think about it too much, I guess?
[00:50:22] <Moonlightning> I mean, not trying to canonicalize the path at all would've left it meaning The Right File™, yeah?
[00:50:57] <Phase> yeah
[00:51:13] <Moonlightning> So no, it didn't have to be canonical.

[01:42:17] <HoneyDrops> Shutter, johnsey: to me the VW thing just highlights why it is unacceptable to have closed firmware on devices.  There is no possible way what they were doing could be hidden if everyone had full source access.  There should be no blackboxes anywhere in computing (nor in physical devices, but fortunately the capacity to try to hide/obscure the physical is non-trivial and generally easily
[01:42:19] <HoneyDrops> defeated).

[01:54:49] <HoneyDrops> One would hope that the EPA would check the firmware for compliance, though that is part of a broader issue of the failure of self-checking compliance.
[01:55:33] <JustAberrant> people build scams around the situation.. if they knew the code was going to be audited, they would have scammed them some other way
[01:55:42] <JustAberrant> and besides, you can audit a binary
[01:55:55] <JustAberrant> hell something like this, having the source probably wouldn't make a huge difference
[01:56:05] <JustAberrant> it may have actually been written in straight assembly

[16:40:42] <Sour_Sweet> Reading an article about a linux server botnet. It's followed by a few tipps, because the servers were compromised using SSH brute force. One of the tipps: "Change your SSH port!". So I'm bruteforcing a SSH daemon, do I really care if I need to check 65535 ports first? (Probably less). Another tipp: "Deactivate your root login!" No, people, no just use freaking PublicKeyAuth already. If
[16:40:44] <Sour_Sweet> don't know about you, but when I SSH into my server I need root 90% of the time (I wouldn't use SSH if I didn't). Just using sudoers adds little entropy, does not work with targeted attacks and creates entire new attack vectors.
[16:42:36] <roflin> no it's not about targeted attacks, if you are targeted you are in deep trouble, but it just how to stop the random scriptkiddies that want to get access.
[16:43:45] <roflin> targeted attacks are too costly just to add your computer to a botnet. they just go for low hanging fruit.
[16:43:49] <Sour_Sweet> PublicKeyAut prevents brute forcing, no need to change port, root can stay active. And there still is fail2ban.
[16:44:04] <nnnn20430> i just use keys for all logins
[16:44:16] <Sour_Sweet> security by obscurity is no security
[16:44:35] <Sour_Sweet> It delays things if anything

[16:59:13] *** init3 is now known as Init3-away
[17:06:21] <RazorSharpFang> Sour_Sweet: Why does PublicKeyAuth prevent brute force?
[17:08:24] <Sour_Sweet> Good luck brute forcing my key ;-) That being said you need to set PermitRootLogin to without-password. Otherwise this is pointless
[17:09:11] <Sour_Sweet> Or use PublicKeyAuth with all users in which case you need to set PasswordAuthentication to no
[17:10:16] <Sour_Sweet> The later one is obviously better but comes with the risk of locking yourself out (Keep a backup key somewhere safe or use your host's rescue system)
[17:11:30] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[17:11:58] <RazorSharpFang> I mean, I don't even know what PublicKeyAuth is. What is it, and why can't it be brute forced? How is it different to a password?
[17:13:21] <Sour_Sweet> It's like SSL. You have to keys: A public key and a private key. The public (in theory) can be posted publicly - it has no direct value. However it can verify that you have signed a message with your private key
[17:13:44] <RazorSharpFang> And the private key, you keep private.
[17:14:10] <Sour_Sweet> Yes. The private key - if generated correctly - is so complex that any brute forece attack with today's hardware is pointless
[17:14:33] <RazorSharpFang> What kind of ball-park are we talking with time?
[17:14:37] <RazorSharpFang> 10 years?
[17:14:52] <RazorSharpFang> 100 years?
[17:14:52] <Sour_Sweet> More like thousands of years with a super computer :P
[17:15:06] <Sour_Sweet> Probably even a few magnitudes beyond that

[17:23:17] <Sour_Sweet> We are talking about quadrillion of years with desktop computer hardware. If we don't have another breakthrough in cryptography it's basically impossible. IF those keys are ever going to be considred weak in our lifetime you'll hear about it however, because all things secure on the internet rely on it.
[17:24:59] <RainbowHacks> Honestly, you really shouldn't be providing root access via ssh
[17:25:03] *** Home is now known as Finnfinn
[17:25:14] <RainbowHacks> not when other authentication mechanisms exist that you can use once you're logged in with a normal user
[17:25:23] <RainbowHacks> (ie sudo, the wheel group, etc)
[17:25:34] * RainbowHacks totally just used ie incorrectly.
[17:26:22] *** \m is now known as mniip
[17:26:39] <RainbowHacks> and let's be real here
[17:27:30] <RainbowHacks> the real concern with any login (as long as you're not entirely stupid) isn't that it'll be brute forced. It's an exploit (either remote or local) or a targetted attack that compromises, say, your local machine to gain your key or passwords.
[17:28:14] <RainbowHacks> i see lots of people who go I SET UP AN SSH KEY IM SAFE and a week later they're owned by some skiddie, because they didn't harden their box and didn't apply timely updates
[17:29:00] <RazorSharpFang> Where would you typically keep your key? (I'm assuming it's a file)
[17:29:34] <RainbowHacks> either on a volume using FDE, or a separate device (also using FDE) like a USB key you keep on your person at all times.
[17:29:38] <Sour_Sweet> It's encrpyted with a Passphrase somewhere in my ordinary folder structre
[17:30:04] <Sour_Sweet> (That being said my harddrive is encrpyted as well)
[17:32:51] *** Joins: MisterSkids (ejd@Pony-fej07d.res.rr.com)
[17:33:49] <Sour_Sweet> Brute forcing is a real thread. I have for example one server trying on various services to login since about 6 months. Without Fail2ban in this time of timespan it could probably bruteforce even more decent passwords
[17:34:37] <Sour_Sweet> notice: decent - not strong
[17:41:49] *** mniip is now known as \m
[17:54:28] <Moonlightning> I just log in as myself and sudo if I need to.
[17:54:36] <johnsey> RainbowHacks: what exactly is the security gain of using sudo over root login with key authentication (or similarly secure authentication method)?
[17:55:06] <Moonlightning> I like my prompt and things. Don't wanna give that up for a root shell.
[17:55:35] <Moonlightning> I keep the timeout set to 15m, which should be fine 'cos it was the default on Debian and Ubuntu, right?
[17:56:15] <RazorSharpFang> Why not just su as root ?
[17:56:16] <Colgate> johnsey: I guess it requires a 2nd local exploit to gain root? or a bruteforcing of a 2nd password
[17:56:47] <Colgate> but that's just for root acess, they can potentially get plenty from a regular user account :P
[17:58:39] <johnsey> Colgate: this assumes that the authentication method used for the root login can be considered not bruteforceable.
[17:59:44] <RazorSharpFang> I assume that PrivateKeyAuth is unbruteforceable if done right.
[18:00:56] <RazorSharpFang> Sleep time for me, cya
[18:01:03] *** Quits: RazorSharpFang (chatzilla@sharpest.of.all.fangs) (Quit: Zzzzz)
[18:01:27] <Moonlightning> Well, it's still bruteforcable
[18:01:38] <Moonlightning> Just many orders of magnitude harder.
[18:01:51] <Moonlightning> There are wayyyyyyyy more possibilities.
[18:02:53] <johnsey> the point is that it's not bruteforceable in feasible time, which is sufficiently secure. there is no 100% in security, you can only make the attack hard enough to make it too hard for an attacker to do in feasible time with a given amount of resources
[18:04:52] <Colgate> I don't have remote loot login enabled because it just isn't needed for me, I try my best to keep everything I need to do as a regular user
[18:05:34] <johnsey> it only keeps you from shooting yourself in the foot to a certain degree but it does not increase security 
[18:05:49] *** Quits: RainbowHacks (rainbow@Pony-m1cetk.ponix.space) (Quit: Whoops.)
[18:06:58] <johnsey> sudo + secure authentication is equally secure against attacks against your SSH login as a root login with secure authentication
[18:07:04] <johnsey> not more, not less
[18:08:58] *** Joins: RainbowHacks (rainbow@Pony-m1cetk.ponix.space)
[18:16:15] <Googie> It could help in some really odd edgecases. (Private key stolen with password, but password to sudo unknown). But really 99.99% of the time, with a secured system, I don't really think it improves security personally
[18:16:32] <Googie> In a corporate network sudo could be useful for auditing
[18:20:15] <Googie> Securing SSH beyond key auth only has always kinda seemed like a bit of cargo culting to me. Changing the port might help slow down any issues in the event of a major exploit being found I guess
