[04:27:22] <JustAberrant> I present this for your consideration: http://justaberrant.com/images/hoose/octoseeds.jpg :)
[04:45:19] <Moonlightning> >> RFC 6797 §7.2
[04:45:22] <Moonlightning> > An HSTS Host MUST NOT include the STS header field in HTTP responses conveyed over non-secure transport.
[04:45:25] <Moonlightning> Why not?
[04:46:05] <Colgate> because clients might be dumb and respect it?
[04:46:19] <Rylee> mine does
[04:46:24] <Rylee> my nginx does that is
[04:46:46] <Colgate> I just send it on all connections as well
[04:46:51] <Colgate> because eh?
[04:47:02] <Colgate> yes, breaking RFC, sue me
[04:49:08] <Moonlightning> But…
[04:49:13] <Moonlightning> Why's that bad? :p
[04:49:43] <Colgate> I don't see why it would be bad either except for clients potentially being dumb and forcing a conenction to remain insecure?
[04:50:00] <Moonlightning> But HSTS only forces /secure/ connections, not /insecure/ ones.
[04:50:01] <Colgate> but then anyone could inject an HSTS header into any unsecured connection and do that to the client
[04:50:18] <Colgate> I'm assuming that the client implemented HSTS incorrectly here
[04:50:38] <Moonlightning> As a domain owner and server admin, I can “taint” my domain with HSTS
[04:51:13] <Colgate> hsts headers are supposed to be ignored over non-tls anyways
[04:51:40] <Moonlightning> The effect is the same—whoever has the domain after me will have to run a secure webserver that redirects to insecure and serves headers with max-age=0
[04:51:50] <Moonlightning> meh, never mind
[04:52:01] <Moonlightning> I'm gonna switch webservers
[04:52:16] <Moonlightning> What's a good one that does TLS 1.2 and HSTS natively?
[04:52:24] <Rylee> nginx
[04:52:26] <Colgate> uh, all the major ones?
[04:52:34] <Rylee> the answer is always use nginx
[04:52:47] <Colgate> I like lighttpd :(
[04:52:52] <Colgate> but I think it is dying

[04:53:17] <Rylee> lightty is dying as fuck
[04:53:38] <Colgate> yeah :(
[04:53:39] <Moonlightning> lighttpd doesn't do it natively; you have to hack a header in via the configuration
[04:53:42] <Moonlightning> ditto for nginx
[04:53:48] <Colgate> oh, you mean hsts
[04:53:59] <Rylee> i guess?
[04:54:01] <Colgate> then that would be 0 httpds

[04:54:50] <Rylee> uh
[04:54:51] <Rylee> yes you can?

[04:55:00] <Rylee> set the header only in your secure vhost
[04:55:02] <Rylee> obviously

[04:55:07] <Moonlightning> what's a vhost -.-

[04:55:26] <Moonlightning> does lighttpd even have vhosts?

[04:55:36] <Rylee> I can't imagine it doesn't

[11:25:15] <RazorSharpFang> Can someone explain why my quad-core Intel i5 processor (2.5GHz) is more than 4 times faster than my Pentium 4 (3 GHz)
[11:29:18] <Kinsley> 1. Hz aren't a very good measurement of a processor's ability to execute commands. 2. While I don't have exact numbers, the transistors in the i5 are going to vastly outnumber the ones in a P4. All else being equal, more transistors would mean more work could be done.
[11:30:09] <mniip> nowadays less nanometers -> more speed
[11:30:19] <mniip> thanks to the speed of light limit
[11:30:33] <Dusk> Well
[11:30:52] <Kinsley> 3. Since all else isn't equal, the addition of extra cores and better advances in microarchitecture of the underlying chip means that even for "equal" ratings in Hz, you can have significant improvements in actual execution of tasks.
[11:30:54] <Dusk> the smaller the manufacturing process means that more transistors are put into the processor meaning it has more speed
[11:31:24] <Dusk> and better energy efficiency (to a point since heat is still a problem as you get smaller)
[11:34:56] <Dusk> the smallest p4s are still on the 65nm process

[12:33:25] <Dusk> RazorSharpFang: It's instructions per clock.
[12:33:28] <Dusk> its*
[12:34:03] <Dusk> Generally the newer the processor it is and the smaller the manufacturing process the more instructions per clock it can handle due to it aving more transistors
[12:35:42] <RazorSharpFang> Is there a way to find out the instructions per clock of a processor?
[12:35:57] <Dusk> Not from the numbers on the box no.
[12:37:07] <RazorSharpFang> Hmm...
[12:37:13] <Dusk> Your best bet is using the age of a processor to determine it honestly. And you can't compare AMD to Intel either due to them using completely different microarchitectures
[12:37:59] <Dusk> Each new generation of intel's processors is based on a new microarchitecture that brings new features to the table and keeps older useful ones around
[12:38:35] <Dusk> The newer microarchitectures themselves can bring about speed increases without actually having a die shrink due to time spent in development
[12:42:06] <RazorSharpFang> How would I figure out which one of two chips was better if they were made by AMD and Intel respectively? Just run a test and compare?
[12:43:53] <Dusk> Well AMD is going to have less single core performance regardless. They're known for their multicore application efficiency to boot
[12:44:07] <Dusk> but yes running a test would be one way
[12:45:28] <RazorSharpFang> How's a pentium 4 (90nm) compare to today's CPUs?
[12:45:55] <Dusk> They're slower than the lowest end modern day i3 line by a lot.
[12:46:16] <Dusk> I could probably get the atom processor in my phone to beat a p4
[12:46:27] <Dusk> and it's a quad core 2.4GHz
[12:46:44] <Dusk> (If I had an active cooling solution for it that is)
[12:47:19] <RazorSharpFang> That explains why it was transcoding SD video so slowly.
[12:48:56] <Dusk> The P4 was the reason that Intel got their shit together and created the core microarchitecture to boot. NetBurst was bleh and inefficient. I'm not saying that the original core architecture was great but it led to some really good stuff down the line and got Intel where it is today.
[12:54:09] <RazorSharpFang> How do you think it would compare to some of the Amazon EC2's virtual machines? Would it be worse than a t2-micro?
[12:55:43] <Dusk> That's comparing a modern day 2-3GHz Xeon to a p4
[12:55:47] <Dusk> the Xeon is going to win
[12:56:33] <Dusk> I don't know the exact CPU model that they use for their servers obviously, but I can say core for core a modern day Xeon is going to beat a 90nm p4 any day
[12:58:32] <RazorSharpFang> Well, maybe I can use this CPU as a minimum testing environment. How many people would have a processor worse than a p4?
[12:59:01] <Dusk> Do you know what generation your p4 is?
[12:59:11] <Dusk> like have you verified it's a 90mm chip?
[12:59:22] <Dusk> 90nm*
[12:59:34] <RazorSharpFang> Piriform Speccy says o.
[12:59:38] <RazorSharpFang> *so
[12:59:42] <Dusk> Oh
[13:00:23] <RazorSharpFang> Intel Pentium 4 630
[13:01:17] <Dusk> Well tbh there are still people out there running like p3s and stuff so yea there is always worse, but honestly if you're aiming to make a piece of software run well on a processor utilizing only the ability to go up to SSSE3 then I guess that would work
[13:01:29] <Dusk> but like...newer processors have better more streamlined instruction sets
[13:02:00] <Dusk> But yea if you want to use that for a minimum then I guess you'd have near full support for whatever comes afterward
[13:02:29] <RazorSharpFang> Dusk: I didn't think WinVista or Win7 ran on P3.
[13:02:44] <Dusk> My parents still use XP
[13:02:47] <Dusk> :p
[13:02:52] <Dusk> and so do my grandparents
[13:02:56] <RazorSharpFang> This machine is an XP machine, actually.
[13:02:59] <Dusk> Some people don't upgrade until it breaks
[13:03:14] <RazorSharpFang> I tried running win10 on it, but it misbehaved.
[13:03:21] <Dusk> My parents have a really old Celeron in their PC and my grandparents are on a p3 machine
[13:03:31] <Dusk> Misbehaved?
[13:03:53] <RazorSharpFang> It would freeze up randomly.
[13:04:03] <Dusk> Oh
[13:04:10] <Dusk> Does yours have HTT enabled?
[13:04:19] <RazorSharpFang> HyperThreading?
[13:04:20] <Dusk> I forget when that was introduced to the p4 line
[13:04:24] <Dusk> mhm
[13:04:27] <RazorSharpFang> Yes it does
[13:04:30] <Dusk> Ah
[13:04:50] <RazorSharpFang> So now it's a dual-core single-core P4
[13:05:07] <Dusk> it's a dual-thread single-core p4 :p
[13:05:33] <Dusk> Hm
[13:05:39] <Dusk> I'd say it's a decent baseline
[13:05:59] <Dusk> Go ahead and use it I suppose. At least since you have a HTT enabled CPU you can do stuff with HTT in mind.
[13:06:11] <Dusk> (That was my main concern with you using it as a testing environment)
[13:06:22] <RazorSharpFang> It's got 1.5GB of ram, and an NVidia GeForce 8500 GT. How do those match up?
[13:09:29] <Dusk> well you've got the GPU just about equivalent to the performance of an XBOX 360 in there
[13:09:42] <Dusk> and enough ram to make it work well enough to hold everything together
[13:09:47] <Dusk> (in XP)
[13:10:15] <RazorSharpFang> The machine was donated to me. I'm really appreciating it.
[13:10:38] <Dusk> Fair enough
[13:10:47] <Dusk> It'd make a handy little linux box tbh
[13:11:10] <RazorSharpFang> Linux virtualizes REALLY well.
[13:11:23] <Dusk> Why virtualize it when you can just run it?
[13:11:37] <Dusk> Especially on a box that's that low on resources
[13:11:42] <RazorSharpFang> XP doesn't virtualize 3D acceleration very well.
[13:12:04] <RazorSharpFang> And last time I tried dual-booting it, it refused to boot at all.
[13:12:23] <Dusk> How did you try dual booting it?
[13:12:45] <RazorSharpFang> Install XP, install Ubuntu, select options, and then it worked.
[13:12:58] <RazorSharpFang> For a week.. Then it failed to boot.
[13:13:13] <Dusk> Define failed to boot
[13:13:16] <Dusk> like what was it doing?
[13:13:42] <RazorSharpFang> Dusk: GRUB kept encounting an error of some sort.
[13:13:59] <Dusk> No need to ping me :p we're the only two talking at the moment
[13:14:04] <Dusk> Mmm
[13:14:31] <Dusk> What version of ubuntu? and were you using 32 or 64 bit?
[13:14:50] <RazorSharpFang> 32 bit. It's a p4, remember? I don't think it'd support 64-bit
[13:14:56] <Dusk> (Here's one of the few times that I'd tell someone ever to install the 32 bit)
[13:15:06] <Dusk> It does support x86_64
[13:15:17] <Dusk> the models with HTT support 64bit mode
[13:15:22] <RazorSharpFang> Huh.
[13:15:26] <RazorSharpFang> The more you know.
[13:15:29] <Dusk> as well as ssse3
[13:17:11] <RazorSharpFang> Of course, I assume that just because it supports x86_64 doesn't mean it's necessarily a good idea.
[13:17:39] <Dusk> There's no point honestly since it only has 1.5 GB of ram
[13:18:05] * Blackjack virtualizes Dusk on a machine with 256MB of RAM
[13:18:08] <Dusk> I mean maybe it'd be worth a shot to see if the 64 bit one worked but if it's a grub issue then I'd just say check the installer or try another distro of linux
[13:19:39] <RazorSharpFang> I think I do need to check to see if my linux builds work in a virtual environment.
[13:22:07] <Dusk> It's up to you then.
[13:22:51] <RazorSharpFang> I have tried virtualizing winXP, but VirtualBox's D3D emulation is shaky at best.
[13:23:11] <Dusk> My suggestion is to take the time to learn linux and stuff. It'd utilize the system better overall in this case. As far as windows development goes XP is going to be the limiting factor because you're going to be on an unsupported OS
[13:23:35] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[13:24:09] <RazorSharpFang> As much as I'd love to ditch XP support, it's still used. 
[13:24:42] <Dusk> Mmm but Microsoft itself has ditched XP support
[13:24:44] <Dusk> so
[13:25:02] <Dusk> I'm kinda on their side that it's time to let it die.
[13:26:22] <RazorSharpFang> Well, as you said earlier, people are still using it.
[13:26:47] <Dusk> Yes but it's mostly people who aren't power users or people who are current anyway
[13:27:34] <Dusk> Like what software are you trying to give XP support to. Because you need to look at your target audience here.
[13:27:51] <RazorSharpFang> Game software, so that'd be steam users primarily.
[13:27:51] <Dusk> If you think the people using your software are going to be on XP then...sure I guess you could support it.
[13:28:04] <Dusk> Then no
[13:28:08] <Dusk> you shouldn't support XP
[13:28:17] <Dusk> as DX support on XP is not a thing anymore
[13:28:26] <Dusk> and so are GPU drivers
[13:28:30] <Dusk> All of that is going away.
[13:29:38] <RazorSharpFang> You really think so?
[13:29:44] <Dusk> If you're going to focus on game software your minimum should be Linux (Somehere comparable to ubuntu 14.04) and Windows 7
[13:29:46] <Dusk> Yes
[13:30:54] <RazorSharpFang> Not even WinVista?
[13:31:09] <Blackjack> Nobody sane uses Vista
[13:31:46] <Dusk> If you want to support vista, sure. But most people who play games are going to have updated to 7 or bought it originally with 7
[13:32:06] <Blackjack> Indeed
[13:32:14] <RazorSharpFang> Well, my dev machine is 7, so having 7 as a min would be easier.
[13:32:38] <Dusk> 7 has better driver support and better optimization for like everything than both Vista and XP
[13:33:10] <RazorSharpFang> Dusk: Do you think my WinXP machine would run Ubuntu alright?
[13:34:18] <Dusk> Yes. Most definitely. It won't be a magnificent experience above 1080p in the desktop environment, but it's definitely capable of running it.
[13:34:43] <RazorSharpFang> Well, my monitor is 1280x1024
[13:35:29] <RazorSharpFang> It's old enough that it's partially dying, it's lost PnP support.
[13:35:33] <Dusk> Oh
[13:35:44] <Dusk> Well ubuntu will run at that rez fine

[16:48:49] <JustAberrant> imo green tea is never good :(

[17:11:48] <RazorSharpFang> johnsey: My application. I've resolved it, but I can't find the error message it used to give. Something like "can't find shared object libopen.so"

[17:29:15] <RazorSharpFang> Wasn't that like... hours ago?
[17:29:28] <Rylee> yes, irc is an asynchrynous protocol, I can respond to amusingly ridiculous statements anytime appropriate :-P
[17:29:34] <RazorSharpFang> Like, yesterday.
[17:29:37] <Rylee> uh
[17:29:46] <Rylee> no, like, minutes after you joined. like less tahn an hour ago.
[17:30:05] <RazorSharpFang> It's about midnight over here, so. Yesterday. : D
[17:30:16] <Rylee> groaaaaaaaan
[17:30:30] * RazorSharpFang laughs while wheezing and coughing
[17:30:31] <Rylee> like you're on linux already, you've got so many good clients. weechat, hexchat, uhh.... that's about all
[17:30:46] <JustAberrant> to get the kind of polished classic IRC experience that just isn't available on linux :(
[17:30:49] <RazorSharpFang> Don't forget lightIRC.
[17:31:00] <Rylee> i'm not sure in what world lightirc counts as good
[17:31:20] <RazorSharpFang> A world that has flash, but without any bugs.
[17:31:33] <RazorSharpFang> A mysterious world, unknown to all.
[17:31:35] <Rylee> flash is brain damaged by default
[17:33:24] <RazorSharpFang> Well, you could always make your own IRC client.
[17:33:32] <JustAberrant> I mean, there's hexchat which kinda comes close, but while it has some scripting capability, it's not nearly as robust as mIRC :(
[17:33:46] <RazorSharpFang> Does mIRC not have a nix port?
[17:34:52] <Rylee> 10:33:32 <JustAberrant> I mean, there's hexchat which kinda comes close, but while it has some scripting capability, it's not nearly as robust as mIRC :(
[17:34:54] <Rylee> w... what
[17:35:02] <Rylee> mirc requires you to use some brain damaged homebrew language
[17:35:08] <JustAberrant> hexchat doesn't even have a built in editor
[17:35:16] <JustAberrant> nor a real script manager
[17:35:49] <JustAberrant> plus mIRC has a built in permissions systems for writing remote scripts.. with hexchat you have to implement your own :(
[17:36:01] <Rylee> what is a 'remote script'
[17:36:17] <JustAberrant> lets other users trigger commands
[17:36:26] <Rylee> so what you're saying is
[17:36:39] <Rylee> because of its ability to do something utterly half-baked and better handled by a dedicated bot
[17:36:49] <Rylee> and because of its ability to ... do what you already have vim for
[17:36:56] <Rylee> in a terrible scripting language
[17:37:00] <Rylee> you ... somehow consider this a good thing?
[17:37:17] <RazorSharpFang> OpenGL Warning: glFlushVertexArrayRangeNV not found in mesa table
[17:37:20] <JustAberrant> sure, it's all about integration
[17:37:21] <RazorSharpFang> What am I doing wrong?
[17:37:36] <JustAberrant> I mean, yeah there are better ways of doing all those things
[17:37:45] <JustAberrant> but mIRC provides an integrated environment where you can do all of it
[17:38:19] <JustAberrant> plus if you implement your "IRC bot" in your client, it lets you connect as one nick without needing to set up znc/etc
[17:38:22] <RazorSharpFang> Holy poop. So many openGL warnings
[17:39:09] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: sounds like you don't have 3d accel?
[17:39:26] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: old vid card, wrong drivers, or trying to use in a vm?
[17:39:47] <RazorSharpFang> JustAberrant: I AM in a virtual machine. I just turned ON 3D support. NOW it does NOT work.
[17:39:50] <Blackjack> A remote script is slighty more than that
[17:40:10] <Blackjack> A remote script is just "anything that contains event handlers"
[17:40:20] * JustAberrant nods
[17:40:41] <RazorSharpFang> Why would turning ON 3D support make openGL NOT work?
[17:40:48] <JustAberrant> and mIRC had a reasonably comprehensible event handing system.. no "hooks" or anything needed
[17:41:04] <Blackjack> mSL was my first language of any kind
[17:41:11] <Blackjack> I understood it reasonably well
[17:41:23] <RazorSharpFang> My first language was English. : D
[17:41:36] <JustAberrant> RazorSharpFang: this I do not know
[17:42:30] <JustAberrant> Rylee: ultimately it comes down to whether you succeed because of or in spite of your tool stack.. mIRC fosters success :)
[17:42:46] <Rylee> it fosters doing everything in an utterly mediocre way
[17:42:57] <RazorSharpFang> mediocrity is okay.
[17:42:59] <Rylee> you might want to read up on the unix philosophy of doing one thing well
[17:43:07] <Blackjack> Rylee: Someone made a demo in mIRC
[17:43:11] <Blackjack> Try doing that in weechat :P
[17:43:14] <JustAberrant> Rylee: oh now that's just silly
[17:43:20] <Rylee> mirc does a lot of things in a mediocre way
[17:43:40] <Rylee> Blackjack: /shell cacafire
[17:43:41] <Rylee> :D :D :D 
[17:43:44] <Blackjack> no
[17:43:53] <Blackjack> No external programs here :P
[17:44:10] <Rylee> i mean, you can send arbitrary lines in a new buffer.

[17:44:34] <Blackjack> Sure
[17:44:57] <JustAberrant> Rylee: a complete though mediocre solution is better than a amazing solution that doesn't actually solve the problem
[17:45:05] <JustAberrant> Rylee: because if it doesn't solve the problem, it's not a solution
[17:45:07] <Blackjack> I can't find footage of this demo :(
[17:45:17] <Blackjack> I've only seen it actually running in mIRC
[17:45:19] <Rylee> so tell me what problem you have that mirc is solving through its INNOVATIVE BOT-MAKING APPARATUS
[17:45:38] <Rylee> (that somehow isn't being served better by a full-featured irc bot)
[17:45:46] <JustAberrant> I dunno, I use irssi.. just saying, in theory, mIRC is amazing
[17:46:03] <Rylee> because I guarantee that the actual uses for that
[17:46:07] <Rylee> are absurdly miniscule
[17:46:14] <Rylee> to the point of making including it by default silly

[17:50:44] <JustAberrant> Rylee: mIRC scripts allowed significant control over the UI, whereas hexchat does not due in part to the inflexibility of gtk, but in part due to the design of the client.. 
[17:51:06] <JustAberrant> Rylee: it would be quite difficult for instance in hexchat for a script to make the chat area round
[17:51:49] <Rylee> i uhh
[17:51:50] <Rylee> I guess?
[17:51:53] <HoneyDrops> Why would an irc client have a script editor when you have a perfect decent text editor?
[17:52:00] <Rylee> I can't imagine ever wanting to make the chat area round
[17:52:07] <JustAberrant> integration .. we've been through that already!
[17:52:18] <Rylee> that's amusing
[17:52:23] <RazorSharpFang> Mathematicians thought of it first.
[17:52:31] * JustAberrant nods
[17:53:25] <JustAberrant> I mean, say you use vi to edit an mIRC script
[17:53:25] <HoneyDrops> Also config should be file-based as that is the only sane option.  I further propose that plain-text is best format.  There is no reason to manage setting though the program itself.
[17:53:34] <JustAberrant> you're not going to have syntax highlighting out of the box
[17:53:40] <JustAberrant> and certainly not going to have auto-complete
[17:54:05] <RazorSharpFang> Are those really necessary?
[17:54:15] <JustAberrant> nor inline error detection
[17:54:17] <Rylee> they're helpful
[17:54:29] <RazorSharpFang> Yeah, but they're not make-or-break.
[17:54:30] <HoneyDrops> vim will handle, python, perl, ruby, tcl, sh, and lua out of the box.  All of which weechat supports with it's scripting APIs
[17:54:41] <HoneyDrops> s/it's/its/
[17:54:43] <Rylee> (hexchat supports those too!)
[17:54:44] <Rylee> yeah
[17:54:54] <Rylee> but HoneyDrops omg vim isn't in weechat so it's not integrated
[17:54:56] <Rylee> !!!!
[17:54:59] <JustAberrant> sure, but not mIRC script
[17:55:06] <RazorSharpFang> HoneyDrops: What does s/it's/its/ even mean?
[17:55:24] <HoneyDrops> Nothing but mIRC uses mIRC's pet language.
[17:55:39] <JustAberrant> indeed, which is probably why it has an integrated editor
[17:55:45] <JustAberrant> to provide that which no one else will
[17:55:53] <HoneyDrops> RazorSharpFang: ed/ex command: substitute/pattern/replacement/
[17:55:54] <Rylee> i love this presupposition that msl is worth using
[17:56:21] <Blackjack> JustAberrant: The mIRC script editor is literally just like notepad
[17:56:29] <Blackjack> there is no completion or highlighting or anything
[17:56:30] <RazorSharpFang> ah
[17:56:32] <Blackjack> Sorry to disappoint :(
[17:56:38] <JustAberrant> bah
[17:56:44] <Rylee> lol
[17:56:46] <Rylee> i thought so
[17:56:53] <Blackjack> I THINK there is a button you can manually press to match unclosed pairs of { } and MAYBE autoindent?
[17:57:06] <HoneyDrops> an irc client is an irc client, it doesn't need a text editor, syntax highlighter and debugger in it too.  If you want that I have the /perfect/ solution for you: emacs
[17:57:07] <Rylee> it's been a long time since I've used mirc since I like not being insane
[17:57:11] <JustAberrant> well, all silliness aside, things like auto-completion and inline errors/warnings are probably why I stopped using vi for serious development like 5 years ago
[17:57:32] <JustAberrant> you can kinda sorta do those things, but it's not nearly as organic
[17:57:33] <Rylee> i have code completion, syntax highlighting, and inline errors/warnings in vim
[17:57:41] <Rylee> it's completely natural and totally integrated into the editor
[17:58:09] <RazorSharpFang> vi > emacs. 
[17:58:10] <Blackjack> vim will never be as powerful as I want it to be, sadly
[17:58:12] <Rylee> if you give a shit to set up some plugins — YouCompleteMe and Syntastic, and perhaps GitGutter too — it's a straight up IDE
[17:58:15] <JustAberrant> so some say, I've never found this to be the case
[17:58:28] <Blackjack> I use it for quick edits and things from the command line
[17:58:53] <Blackjack> The most customization I've done is indent settings, a better theme, line numbers, and maing it so that pressing right arrow at the end of a line moves to the next line
[17:59:02] <Rylee> arrow keys :-(
[17:59:28] <Blackjack>  I'm sorry but I won't hurt my workflow just to be a l33t hjkl vim hacker
[17:59:42] <RazorSharpFang> emacs > vim?
[17:59:44] <JustAberrant> hehe, years of using vi on a solaris 2.5 box broke my arrow key habit ;p
[17:59:51] <Rylee> it's worth taking the time to get in the habit of doing it tbh
[17:59:59] <Rylee> some day i guess
[18:00:08] <Blackjack> I only use it when I need to do like

[18:09:18] <JustAberrant> just feels like you have to jump through more and more hoops to make vi do what things like qt-creator and eclipse do out of the box, and for the most part, do better

[18:10:21] <Moonlightning> to the point that Linux + emacs could potentially be a working system
[18:10:29] <Blackjack> Because quite honestly Sublime Text does all I need
[18:10:42] * Moonlightning heard that somewhere
[18:10:44] <JustAberrant> vim does text manipulation within the context of a single file really well, but it's easy to clone that to any other editor
[18:10:50] *** Moon_Shadow is now known as Astral_Song
[18:10:51] <Moonlightning> no init or anything…just emacs running on the bare kernel
[18:11:20] <Rylee> ctrlp.vim makes multifile editing super easy too.
[18:11:22] <RazorSharpFang> I still don't know
[18:11:32] <Moonlightning> JustAberrant: wait, the registers are file-specific?
[18:11:35] <RazorSharpFang> /
[18:11:36] <Blackjack> And Sublime is better than anything else I've used because it can load a 10GB text file in like 2 minutes with a nice progress bar and be able to scroll through it quickly with no lag
[18:11:54] <Blackjack> RazorSharpFang: I can tell you how I generally initially set up my weechat to make it more usable
[18:12:00] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: meta-number by default for buffers 1..9
[18:12:17] <Moonlightning> RazorSharpFang: for buffers 1..99, `meta-j, number, number`
[18:12:21] <JustAberrant> sure there's probably a vim script that adds every single feature of every ide, but you have to find and install them all.. I just don't think it's worth it
[18:12:29] <Moonlightning> Or you can use `/buffer <number>`
[18:12:40] <Moonlightning> and /buffer can be abbreviated as /b, I think
[18:12:46] <Rylee> i recommend go.py
[18:12:52] <Blackjack> Me too
[18:12:53] <JustAberrant> I use vim as a basic text editor, and it's great when using remotely, but if I'm actually doing real development, I'll use qt-creator or eclipse
[18:13:05] * Moonlightning is weird, likes meta-j
[18:13:14] <Blackjack> What JustAberrant said except I tend to use Sublime Text or JetBrains products
[18:13:26] <JustAberrant> I also use vim for it's diff capabilities, because that's actually still pretty damn good compared to a lot of ides
[18:13:27] * Moonlightning made a `shift-meta-j, number, number, number` for buffers up to 999
[18:13:46] <RazorSharpFang> Well, how would I remove the userlist? That's taking up a lot of space.
[18:13:59] <Blackjack> /bar hide nicklist 
[18:14:00] <Blackjack> Should do it
[18:14:11] <RazorSharpFang> Blackjack: Much obliged.
[18:14:49] <Blackjack> I'd suggest doing something like /set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 10
[18:14:56] <Blackjack> To make peoples' entire nicks not show up
[18:15:00] <Blackjack> To save more screen width
[18:15:26] * Moonlightning prefers automatic resizing of the nick column to be as wide as it needs to be to display all nicks on the scrollbacks (and their highest prefixes) in their entirety.
[18:15:36] <Moonlightning> I guess using a command for it bothers me because it dirties up the command history
[18:15:55] <Blackjack> (Also, running /save and /layout store after you change settings is probably a good idea if you enjoy keeping your settings)
[18:16:15] <Moonlightning> and I have to press uparrow more to get to an actual line
[18:17:02] * RazorSharpFang shrugs

[22:55:33] <init3> Everything working exactly as you want it on your network/computers kinda blows. I need a project. 
[22:57:03] * Moonlightning thinks he would be happy with that state.
[22:57:13] * init3 sshes into his server looking at the contents og /etc for shit to mess with.
[22:57:23] <Moonlightning> init3: switch something non-critical to btrfs :D
[22:57:41] <init3> If I was working I'd think I would be okay with it.
[22:58:36] <init3> I don't really have the spare drives for backups lying around. Every drive in use is over 50%. Maybe I can figure out something.

[23:05:25] <Moonlightning> :(
[23:07:05] <init3> Well I do technically have a way todo it it seems, but it'dtake fucking forever. My server has this motherboard with this weird hardware flaw where it drops to USB 1.1. Apparently this happens in windows and linux.

[23:08:22] <init3> I have a USB hard drive with the empty space (the server has no SATA ports) but that seems like a pain. 
[23:08:59] <init3> I really wish I had a USB card or a SATA card. 
[23:09:22] <init3> Or a different motherboard. 
[23:11:39] <init3> Though it seems I never set up backups on here after I reinstalled debian. Oops. Could format my backup drive btrfs
[23:12:22] <init3> What do y'all use for automatic backups? I was using backup2l which seems decent. 
[23:14:33] * Moonlightning uses Time Machine for backups. Has no other regular backups.
[23:15:00] <Moonlightning> I just converted Caramel's root filesystem to btrfs, though, and I'm looking into setting up a backup system based around btrfs snapshots
[23:27:24] <JustAberrant> are you happy with these changes? :)
[23:27:35] <JustAberrant> also is btrfs actually stable now?
[23:37:41] <Phase> mostly
