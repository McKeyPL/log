[10:07:41] <Googie> Basically the old "This lan is trusted"
[10:11:35] <Googie> It also looks like a fairly soft deprecation (as pretty much expected), aiming to prevent the use of newer features rather than restrict old ones, so the people hardest hit by it will be the people already working on the cutting edge.
[10:12:23] <Googie> (Who are probably the best able to cope with changes already)

[10:14:09] <Colgate> wait, I thought http2.0 existed at least in rfc format

[10:14:20] <Googie> It does.
[10:14:44] <Colgate> oh I see, it is a different page on wikipedia, zzz

[10:15:25] <Colgate> iunno, that seems strange to me
[10:15:32] <Colgate> merging those layers
[10:17:14] <Googie> I don't think it's a technical thing, I imagine it would probably be really simple to enable with a line or two changed in the source.
[10:17:59] <Googie> It's more political. Force anyone who wants to use HTTP/2 to enable encryption on their website as well.
[10:18:51] <Colgate> https://http2.github.io/faq/#does-http2-require-encryption
[10:18:51] <PinkiePieBot> [ HTTP/2 Frequently Asked Questions ]
[10:19:03] <Colgate> "No. After extensive discussion, the Working Group did not have consensus to require the use of encryption (e.g., TLS) for the new protocol."
[10:19:06] <Googie> But Firefox's (and Chrome)'s implementation does
[10:19:10] <Colgate> yes
[10:19:16] <Colgate> which is... bleh
[10:19:53] <Colgate> I mean, I get why they did it, but I still think it is in poor taste, even if I agree with what they are trying to do
[10:19:57] <Googie> I'm thinking that it's probably a simple toggle for "trusted" domains though. Their FAQs imply that.
[10:20:18] <Googie> Just won't be able to mass deploy on the web.
[10:24:15] <Googie> I just think that it's been a long time coming really. There's probably no way to force websites to switch without being heavy handed :/
[10:26:39] <Colgate> hmm, wonder why they require that tls renegotiation is disabled in http2

[21:40:52] <cyborg_ar> JustAberrant: well i would put them in different circuits
[21:41:23] <cyborg_ar> not necessarily different phases, but a different cable going to the distribution box
[21:41:49] <JustAberrant> yeah, definitely doing that
[21:41:55] <JustAberrant> and I can, because the power panel is really close
[21:42:09] <JustAberrant> and the area is unfinished except for a little section that should be no problem
[21:42:16] <JustAberrant> I'm far more worried about EMI
[21:42:47] <cyborg_ar> well my advice was for conducted EMI
[21:42:57] <cyborg_ar> but if you want to be sure, get a filter for your server rack
[21:43:15] <JustAberrant> I meant through the air
[21:43:25] <cyborg_ar> http://www.ebay.com/itm/115V-250V-50-60Hz-20A-AC-Power-Single-Phase-EMI-Filter-/310762991489?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item485aeaef81
[21:43:26] <PinkiePieBot> [ 115V 250V 50 60Hz 20A AC Power Single Phase EMI Filter | eBay ]
[21:43:28] <JustAberrant> because yeah, I'm planning on getting a decent online UPS which will probably also do some of that
[21:43:29] <cyborg_ar> one of those babies
[21:43:45] <cyborg_ar> i dont think you'd have significant radiated EMI
[21:43:55] <cyborg_ar> specially if your servers have metal cases
[21:43:56] <JustAberrant> hmm, even from a motor?
[21:44:01] <cyborg_ar> make sure they are grounded though
[21:44:18] <JustAberrant> one of the servers is a file server, that would be my biggest concern :(
[21:44:18] <cyborg_ar> most EMI caused by motors is conducted through the power wires
[21:44:24] <JustAberrant> ah
[21:44:29] <JustAberrant> well that's good to know then :)
[21:44:44] <cyborg_ar> though if the power wires are long they can become antennas
[21:44:44] <JustAberrant> wonder if there's any (cheap) measuring device I can use
[21:44:50] <cyborg_ar> just make sure your rack is well grounded
[21:44:59] <cyborg_ar> and dont daisy chain grounds
[21:45:22] <JustAberrant> mm
[21:45:27] <cyborg_ar> either way, computers are not particularly sensitive to EMI IME
[21:45:34] <JustAberrant> also, according to the home inspection, the place is grounded to plumbing :(
[21:45:46] <cyborg_ar> blegh
[21:45:47] <JustAberrant> wonder if it's worth changing that :(
[21:46:12] <cyborg_ar> did the home inspection measure ground impedance?
[21:46:17] <JustAberrant> no
[21:46:54] <JustAberrant> it's only a 125 amp panel, so I might end up upgrading it anyway
[21:47:12] <cyborg_ar> "just" 125 amps?
[21:47:14] <cyborg_ar> lol
[21:47:17] <JustAberrant> hehe
[21:47:31] <JustAberrant> well, the house has an ETS system, air exchanger, all the usual appliances
[21:47:37] <JustAberrant> plus I'm adding a table saw + servers
[21:47:58] <cyborg_ar> also LOL
[21:48:05] <cyborg_ar> just reminded me of something
[21:48:07] <JustAberrant> what? :(
[21:48:15] <cyborg_ar> this place had "ground to plumbing"
[21:48:23] <cyborg_ar> the plumbing was plastic
[21:48:26] <cyborg_ar> hahahahhaah
[21:48:29] <JustAberrant> LOL!
[21:49:04] <JustAberrant> well this place has plastic too, but I assume they grounded to the copper water lines coming in
[21:50:18] <cyborg_ar> yeah in this case it was a strap to a metal fixture
[21:50:29] <cyborg_ar> that was attatched to the plastic tubing
[21:51:13] <cyborg_ar> anyway, with the filtering and the metal cases you should be fine
[21:51:44] <cyborg_ar> a table saw is not particularly high powered
[21:52:03] <cyborg_ar> i've had to deal with computers in a factory environments
[21:52:14] <cyborg_ar> the worst problem was the dust
[21:53:01] <cyborg_ar> JustAberrant: also, are you keeping up with the commodore?

[21:53:41] <JustAberrant> hehe
[21:53:50] <JustAberrant> and that seriously makes me feel better
[21:54:33] <JustAberrant> I really want to have like a server rack in the basement, but I also really want to have a tablesaw / small workshop 
[21:54:38] <cyborg_ar> yeah with a table saw i would be much more worried about sawdust wrecking the fans
[21:54:55] <JustAberrant> I'll definitely be closing it in
[21:54:59] <cyborg_ar> get filters for those too
[21:55:00] <JustAberrant> cause yeah, dust
[21:56:42] <cyborg_ar> god i dunno why but i find the gesture those guys do so hilarious
