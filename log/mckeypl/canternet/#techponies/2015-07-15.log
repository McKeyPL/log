[06:27:14] <Twilightlicious> It's an ANCIENT Belkin G Router from like, 2008. Lol
[06:27:14] <Moonlightning> In waht context, Starry?
[06:27:34] <Moonlightning> There's a $_ in Perl, which is…yeah, I dunno what that is
[06:27:36] <Starry> I'm learning more python in the official
[06:27:48] <Moonlightning> There's also a _ in Swift and Rust which immediately discards anything assigned to it
[06:28:08] <Moonlightning> _ is just an identifier in Python. Convention is that you use it like in Swift and Rust, though it really is just a normal name.

[06:39:39] <Twilightlicious> Online database
[06:39:43] <Twilightlicious> very useful
[06:40:04] <Starry> Does it control your logins etc
[06:40:49] <Moonlightning> SQL is database software.

[06:41:12] <PinkiePieBot> [ SQL Tutorial ]
[06:41:15] <Googie> Well, SQL is a query language used to retrieve data from a database.
[06:41:23] <Googie> It's not a database in and of itself.

[06:55:48] <Twilightlicious> Q~Q
[06:56:07] <Twilightlicious> So my 8 year old router doesn't support IPv6 unless set to Access Only
[06:56:20] <Twilightlicious> which i assume only supports IPv6 because then it just refers everything to my Modem
[06:56:29] <Twilightlicious> but then i think my Modem only allows 4 wireless connections this way?
[06:56:46] <Twilightlicious> Moral of the story is get a new router i guess ._.
