[03:23:08] <PinkiePieBot> [ Linux - Reviews and Price Comparisons from PC Magazine: Exploit Logs You Into Linux Systems After Hitting Backspace 28 Times ]
[03:23:59] <Windsheer> incorrect headline
[03:24:03] <Windsheer> it doesn't log you into linux
[03:24:08] <Windsheer> it logs you into the grub pre-ipl environment.
[03:25:08] <wolfyshy> it gives you a full grub shell
[03:25:16] <wolfyshy> you can do a *lot* with a full grub shell
[03:25:17] <HoneyDrops> From which you can boot into single-user mode, but honestly if they have physical access they are going to get that one way or another.
[03:25:40] <Windsheer> eeyup.
[03:25:46] <Windsheer> ipl from external media, mount the root fs...
[03:26:00] <HoneyDrops> An encrypted rootfs would still be protected, as they wouldn't have the passkey.
[03:27:12] <HoneyDrops> Not to say it's not a serious flaw, but it's only allowing access that can be gained though similarly easy means, and can be mitigated at other stages.
[03:27:28] <Windsheer> indeed.
[03:32:06] <HoneyDrops> Aside from my own personal systems, I can probably count on one hoof the number of passworded grub instances I've encountered >_>
[03:32:15] <Windsheer> i've seen it on servers
[03:32:31] <Windsheer> that being said, if you really need that sort of security, you should be running xts-400 or something else not-linux

[04:03:35] <JustAberrant8> AppleDash: meh, semantics, in practice exceptions are treated as things that may very well happen but arn't what the thing you are calling is supposed to do
[04:03:47] <JustAberrant8> non-checked exceptions are what toy describe
[04:04:06] <JustAberrant8> and are not required to be checked because if they happen, in most cases you are screwed anyway 
[04:04:39] <JustAberrant8> but can be if you want to make something more bullet proof (the software I work on has to catch all exceptions and gracefully handle them)
[04:20:18] <Moonlightning> So I'm playing /Papers, Please/
[04:20:30] <HoneyDrops> Just exit w/ non-zero status, and output to stderr.
[04:20:31] <Moonlightning> I've gotten two /invalid gender/ citations so far.
[04:24:05] <HoneyDrops> Multiplayer in FFT:WotL is so abusable... but also a great way to make some JP w/o level gains :D
[04:24:15] <JustAberrant8> HoneyDrops: have to gracefully handle it..
[04:24:47] * HoneyDrops handles everything gracefully~
[04:24:50] <JustAberrant8> so if a section of code throws an unexpected error (like a null pointer) it need to rollback whatever it was doing and try to re-do it/etc
[04:25:05] <JustAberrant8> it's a whole layered failure model
[04:25:40] <JustAberrant8> everything is encapsulated into atomic actions, which are grouped by work sets, which are grouped into modules, which run on nodes, etc
[04:25:55] <JustAberrant8> and it basically fails down until it can succeed
[04:26:21] <JustAberrant8> simply killing the entire module because someone missed a null pointer isn't really acceptable
[04:26:48] *** Quits: Webster (Webster@Pony-4eid99.fios.verizon.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:27:56] <JustAberrant8> it's actually a nicely complicated but pretty effective systems, and there's various degraded modes where it'll decide that it can't do something, and basically disable that functionality (and everything that depends on it) while keeping everything else going
[04:28:48] <JustAberrant8> one of the few perks of doing software in this industry, stability and operational capability trump pretty much everything else
[04:30:10] <JustAberrant8> no one cares if it's ugly, as long as you can blow up half the system and it keep right on trucking
[04:31:10] <HoneyDrops> Does it at least complain loudly?  So it isn't possible to miss there is something wrong that needs to be fixed?
[04:31:29] <JustAberrant8> of course

[08:57:55] <Dashie> really weird drugs
[08:58:03] <Dashie> that you got from the homeless guy behind k-mart

[09:01:47] <tiwake> like, a lot
[09:01:49] <tiwake> lol
[09:01:56] <tiwake> and thats just the intro
[09:01:56] <Dashie> yes
[09:01:59] <Dashie> very much so
[09:02:03] <Dashie> the whole series is like that
[09:02:18] * DJ-C0L7[EIT] randompounceglomps Dashie
[09:02:22] <Dashie> the awesome factor peaks at 3 but 4 is decent
[09:02:23] <tiwake> is there storyline I'm missing by jumping in on the 4th one?
[09:02:25] <Dashie> OHGODWAT
[09:02:28] <Dashie> tiwake, yes
[09:02:33] <Dashie> a lot
[09:02:36] <tiwake> then what is it?
[09:02:40] <Dashie> you dont have to play 1 but you should play 2, and 3 is a neccesity
[09:02:46] <tiwake> wont happen
[09:02:51] <tiwake> well, unless they port it to linux
[09:02:56] <tiwake> but that likely wont happen
[09:03:01] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> gta?
[09:03:45] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> you could always deploy a virtual box with windows just for playing games that wont work nativly in linux
[09:03:55] <Dashie> tl;dr you're taken in by a gang, you become the gang leader, you get asploded, you wake up in prison, rebuild the gang, you become the biggest gang, then you become a fucking media franchise....and then you get asploded, rebuild the gang, rape all the other gangs in the new city into submission, and then you become president. and thats the start of 4
[09:04:02] <tiwake> virtual machine gaming?
[09:04:27] <Dashie> yeah. GFX card passthrough is decent these days
[09:04:42] <tiwake> I thought nvidia blocked that in their drivers
[09:04:46] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> ^ Dashie beat me to it

[09:05:18] <Dashie> x3
[09:05:22] <tiwake> <3
[09:05:30] <tiwake> but neh
[09:05:31] * Dashie doesnt let Linux anywhere near her hardware
[09:05:35] <Dashie> BSD for life yo
[09:05:45] <tiwake> to have a copy of windows only for computer games is not a reason for me
[09:05:49] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i have a laptop sitting on a shelf at the house that runs openBSD actually
[09:06:00] <Dashie> DJ-C0L7[EIT], <3
[09:06:08] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> xP
[09:06:20] <Dashie> tiwake, i use windows for audio work as well
[09:06:29] <Dashie> kind of a neccesity for me. not exacttly fond of it though
[09:06:33] <Dashie> hence why it's airgapped
[09:06:45] <DJ-C0L7[EIT]> i tried to install FreeBSD but the installer kept fritzing out and throwing codes about no supported propritarry hardware or somthing like that, but OpenBSD runs fine on it
[09:06:57] * tiwake goes back to playing saints row 4
[09:06:57] <Dashie> if i nee dto bring it online (to download a game) i use a separate line for the purpose

[09:13:29] <CrassyPaddles> tiwake, we have the ability to dramatically raise the lowest standards of life for all humans. But sure, let's not do that so we can focus on enriching the uber wealthy.
[09:16:34] <tiwake> the average person in USA spends less than 10% on food, cancer though? thats a much more difficult process to figure out. Cancer isnt picky about who it hops onto

[09:26:54] <CrassyPaddles> anyone here read the latest IDW comic arc?
[09:28:57] <tiwake> enh
[09:29:24] <tiwake> world hunger is from their respective country being turds, cant fix that
[09:30:23] <tiwake> the only reason why cancer is a technical issue is because nobody knows what those technicalities are
[09:30:33] <tiwake> because proteins are so complicated
[09:32:12] <CrassyPaddles> solving cancer would still have to clear that political/bureacratic hurdle as well, tiwake 
[09:32:41] <CrassyPaddles> at least with world hunger, you've got more than enough food to feed the world. Solving each individual case of hunger is trivial
[09:32:53] <tiwake> yeah, when that happens their respective countries become turds
[09:33:29] <tiwake> the problem is you cant really, unless the government allows it
[09:34:04] *** CyberJacob is now known as zz_CyberJacob
[09:34:13] <tiwake> a lot of government wont let that happen, because they have all the guns
[09:34:31] <tiwake> <3 USA for allowing us to have guns (so far)
[09:36:26] <CrassyPaddles> My point is, with cancer, you can't even solve an individual case, or it's exceedingly difficult to, so let's not even think about a global solution yet. With hunger, the individual cases are easy, it's the global case that's hard.
