[00:13:54] <init3> So I have weird tech quandary for y'all. If I tilt my laptop in such a way it will mute the audio. Does this in windows and linux. It isn't so much as irritating as it is amusing but it is also a design flaw of some sort because it does this on two different laptops of the same model. 
[00:15:01] <JustAberrant> speaker wires probably came unsoldered
[00:15:14] <init3> No, it is a software mute
[00:15:25] <init3> Also does it headphones or speakers
[00:15:27] <JustAberrant> well then that's just weird ;p
[00:15:32] <init3> aye
[00:16:41] <init3> it has those weird type of audio buttons where you don't actually press them, just touch them. I assume the mute button is somehow being [TRIGGERED] but it is fucking weird. 
[00:17:21] <init3> and there is a row of these but the vol up or vol down or others are never popped. 
[00:17:43] * JustAberrant shruggles
[00:17:47] <init3> Rite?
[00:17:54] <JustAberrant> run xev, do the tilt, see if it picks up a keypress
[00:17:55] <init3> I so wonder what it is though. 
[00:18:05] <JustAberrant> assuming those touch buttons generate keypresses that is
[00:18:21] <init3> it is pretty random but I can try. I think I did once and it does. 
[00:18:40] <init3> Actually, I know it does because there is an LED under the buttons and I'll see the mute one light up. 
[00:19:27] <init3> wait
[00:19:49] <init3> maybe it isn't tilt so much as ESD of some kind?
[00:20:10] <HoneyDrops> I would assume the headphone jack has a contact to check if something is plugged in, for some reason it's loose enough that tilting the laptop makes it think something is plugged in
[00:20:28] <init3> It'll do this when headphones connected the whole time
[00:20:40] <Gigabit> That reminds me, I need to contact logitech
[00:20:41] <HoneyDrops> might be breaking/remaking the connection
[00:21:24] <init3> I don't think so because plugging headphones does not generate the same behvior. 
[00:21:34] <init3> Also, this is across two laptops of the same model. 
[00:21:36] <HoneyDrops> but first check keypresses, as the headphone jack mute shouldn't generate a keypress
[00:22:05] <init3> It is so hard to reproduce 
[00:22:15] <init3> It does rarely do it. 
[00:22:31] <JustAberrant> try shaking it violently
[00:22:36] <init3> lol
[00:22:49] <init3> If it had a SSD I probably would. 
[00:23:13] <HoneyDrops> if you can verify it's a keypress, should be trivial to just disable or remap it
[00:23:17] <init3> So bizzare
[00:24:04] <init3> I mean, it isn't as annoying as not having a mute button would be. I'm just curious as to the cause.
[00:24:36] <init3> Well, not the actual mute button over the ketboard. 
[00:25:13] <init3> I'm going to have to rub my feet across the carpet with socks and see if maybe that does it. I'm really thinking ESD now. 
[00:25:53] <init3> But then again the frame is plastic
[00:25:55] <init3> hmm
[00:26:00] <JustAberrant> sounds like a plan.. be sure to unplug the laptop so it's not grounded and try to find an exposed metal part ;p

[22:25:38] <Seoson> Poor dicks.
[22:25:45] <Moonlightning> that's a redflag for me
[22:26:29] <Moonlightning> It's IRC. Anyone can see anything posted to public channels; only those invited to +i channels can see what's posted to them; only the two participants can see what goes on in PM.
[22:26:52] <Moonlightning> Clients are responsible for securing their links to the network; you are responsible for securing the network and its links
[22:27:25] <Moonlightning> The former of that means that if one person in a +i channel isn't using TLS or is using TLS badly, it's on them, not you
[22:27:41] <Moonlightning> but if the servers don't use TLS or use bad TLS with each other, that's on you
[22:27:51] <Moonlightning> you don't need a privacy policy.

[22:56:50] <Sakura> Regulations are for good reason most of the time anyway. Civil Rights and Equal Pay & all.
[22:59:11] <Moonlightning> Freedom of speech doesn't mean you get to pay women less. That doesn't make any sense.
[22:59:15] <Moonlightning> They're completely unrelated.
[23:00:49] * JustAberrant nods
[23:00:58] <JustAberrant> in general, I feel like Canadian law is more balanced
[23:01:11] <JustAberrant> `merican law (and honestly opinions in general) are much more binary
[23:01:55] <JustAberrant> we don't have true freedom of speech (though ironically due to various political things, I feel like we have more practically speaking..)
[23:02:43] <JustAberrant> the right to express yourself is weighed by the rights of others to not be hassled by hate groups/etc, and it's more of a middle ground
[23:03:02] <JustAberrant> vice the US where you can have an open air clan meeting
[23:03:33] <JustAberrant> same as things like gun control (everyones favourite topic)
[23:03:57] <JustAberrant> you can own guns, as a collector, for hunting, for recreation, etc
[23:04:39] <JustAberrant> but their are limitations
[23:04:50] <JustAberrant> and honestly I'm kinda ok where they draw the line on that one
[23:06:30] <wolfyshy> straw poll for the pones here, silly question I know..
[23:06:31] <JustAberrant> it doesn't solve all (or even a lot) of the problems with guns, it's still easy enough to get them
[23:06:44] <wolfyshy> is there ever an instance where someone might change the country code of their phone number without changing the rest of the number?
[23:06:46] <JustAberrant> but it solves some of them, raises the barrier to entry, etc
[23:07:09] <JustAberrant> wolfyshy: theoretically, sure
[23:07:23] <JustAberrant> wolfyshy: you could move and by random chance or request get the same number
[23:07:24] <Seoson> wolfyshy: In case they typed in the incorrect country code for example
[23:07:35] <wolfyshy> Seoson: numbers are verified before being saved

[23:07:58] <wolfyshy> JustAberrant: hm, I suppose.
[23:08:00] <wolfyshy> good enough for me
[23:08:07] <Seoson> Than I don't think so
[23:08:42] <Seoson> The risk of that happening is ultra low due to region codes
