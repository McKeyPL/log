[12:26:20] <johnsey> sorry, still waking up
[12:26:25] <Googie> Funny thing also, the PS1 and PS2 also had Linux support.
[12:26:35] <Googie> So what you said is still true :P
[12:26:54] <johnsey> :D
[12:28:12] <Googie> Oh, ps1's "consumer" devkit didn't run Linux, ps2's did though.
[12:28:56] <Kinsley> I heard, and somewhat trust the source (JayzTwoCents) that the AMD Jaguar chip in the PissPoor and the Xbone are basically highly-tuned and modified A4 APUs.
[12:29:21] <Googie> It's well known that they are semi-custom Jaguar cores.
[12:29:40] <johnsey> meanwhile, SteamOS lost steam, sadly
[12:30:10] <Googie> I /think/ Valve is just going dark on it for now. There's still the occasional news popping up.
[12:30:44] <Kinsley> I thought they were gearing up for a late Q3, early Q4 release to get the holiday sales.
[12:30:59] <Googie> The Witcher 3 has had some really weird stuff going on behind the scenes beyond Linux support though.
[12:31:42] <Googie> Multiple (normally perfectly legitimate) retailers were accused of reselling the game through grey market sources.
[12:34:16] <Googie> Also the controversy over just how terribly it runs on AMD GPUs.
[12:34:51] <Googie> (They jacked up the tessellation really really high, which is known to be slow on AMD GPUs, but is even impacting Nvidia ones)
[12:35:32] <Googie> The irony there two, AMD put a tessellation limiter into their Windows drivers, and now it performs better than on Nvidia, despite there being no visual impact.
[12:35:39] <johnsey> prolly paid by nvidia (and maybe MS?)
[12:36:04] <Googie> Well, the code literally is part of Nvidia's Gameworks library.

[12:37:50] <johnsey> it's also funny how they optimize gpu drivers for games and benchmarks to look better, but of course they only do so for big titles, so only those benefit heh
[12:38:16] <Googie> I've heard some really interesting things about just how far GPU developers have gone in that respect.
[12:38:36] <Googie> Including replacing the majority of the shaders at runtime with their optimized ones.

[18:56:11] <Moonlightning> You know how inserts and deletes are O(n) for arrays?
[18:58:41] <Shutter> I'm not entirely sure where you want, but if I understand correctly, and you don't need stuff to be in order, just replace the element you're removing in an std::vector (or similiar) with the last element.
[19:00:43] <Moonlightning> Well, sure, but what if you /do/ need to preserve order?
[19:02:47] <Shutter> Move every element. CPU cache is extremely fast.
[19:03:24] <Shutter> Of course if your vector is insanely huge it might not be ideal, but hey. L3 is pretty huge those days.

[23:14:09] <cyborg_ar> looks like titan power doesnt mean what it used to
[23:24:30] <Lapsus> lol
[23:24:40] <Lapsus> it probably never meant anything
[23:24:47] <Lapsus> I'm glad it didn't catch fire though
[23:25:05] <Lapsus> cheap psus never like running at nearly 100%
[23:25:26] <Lapsus> I need to get a meanwell or something that does just 12v
