[08:28:20] <Twilightlicious> Arkham Knight day 1 patch, 3.5GB
[08:29:58] <Twilightlicious> 3.8GB on Xbox One
[08:30:09] <Starthunder> > patch
[08:30:15] <Starthunder> > multiple gibibytes
[08:30:19] <Starthunder> Wat.
[08:30:28] <Starthunder> What all did they change that it's so big
[08:30:39] <Twilightlicious> Nothing really. Lol
[08:30:47] <Starthunder> :|
[08:30:56] <Twilightlicious> next gen game patches are CRAZY
[08:30:57] <Gigabit> Patch for Armored warfare was gig and half
[08:31:18] <Twilightlicious> Day 1 patch for Dead Rising 3 was 16GB
[08:31:21] <Twilightlicious> added Nothing.
[08:32:08] <Gigabit> That match for AW, increased my fps across the board by 15+ 
[08:33:57] <Twilightlicious> i wonder if Harley Quinn story pack works without Day 1 patch
[08:34:01] <Twilightlicious> all indications say it does, but.
[08:34:35] <Starthunder> //day one patch//
[08:34:46] <Starthunder> why don't they just fix all their crap and release it a day later? -.-
[08:35:19] <Twilightlicious> The process from going gold, to hitting store shelves, is like two weeks or something :P
[08:35:31] <Colgate> because printing a whole bunch of DVDs takes time
[08:35:34] <Colgate> and shipping them
[08:35:35] <Twilightlicious> or longer, depending on how many editions n such you have
[08:35:40] <Colgate> and distributing them..
[08:35:51] <Starthunder> > DVDs
[08:35:56] <Starthunder> Oh, okay. 9.9
[08:36:00] <Colgate> you have a stronger argument for digital delivery only games
[08:36:25] <Colgate> though, I don't mind day 1 patches, /shrug
[08:36:27] <Twilightlicious> I believe digital delivery games have the patches pre-installed
[08:36:36] <Twilightlicious> You would if you were limited to 10GB a month :P
[08:36:44] <Colgate> you can just not install the update
[08:36:57] <Starthunder> ugh
[08:37:06] <Starthunder> stupid ISPs, putting usage caps on people
[08:37:28] <Starthunder> you're already getting money for the service, and you're using it for worse things than maintaining your infrastructure properly
[08:37:31] <Starthunder> what more do you want
[08:38:02] <Colgate> I don't mind reasonable caps based on the speed of the service you are paying for
[08:38:20] *** zz_CyberJacob is now known as CyberJacob
[08:38:24] <Colgate> e.g. a cap that is equal to 50% use of the total connection during the billing period
[08:38:39] <Twilightlicious> that wouldn't be a problem if 1) Game devs wouldn't release broken games, 2) Games don't fit on the disk and require partial online install, and 3) Xbox Live didn't disconnect you for playing non-patched games
[08:38:43] <Twilightlicious> :P
[08:39:37] <Twilightlicious> New GeForce driver is out today, on Arkham Knight launch day, Hmm, wonder what it adds ;P
[08:39:57] <Starthunder> Well, of course not. For example, if the connection speed is 16 MiB/s, then it's okay for it to be capped at 40.87 TiB/month
[08:40:26] <Starthunder> But any less than that, and what exactly is the person paying you for, again...?
[08:40:29] <Twilightlicious> adds SLI Support for Arkham Knight
[08:41:19] <Starthunder> Shame on the users for using the uplink that they pay for!
[08:41:24] <Starthunder> How /dare/ they!
[08:41:41] <Starthunder> That's just /preposterous!/ In fact, it should be /illegal!/

[09:07:49] <Colgate> the internet would die horribly if everyone used all the bandwidth they are paying for 100% of the time
[09:07:50] <Gigabit> Someone on Hardforums, they use around 10tb+ monthly
[09:07:59] <Colgate> networking is oversold everywhere
[09:08:05] <Starthunder> :|
[09:08:30] <Starthunder> Well, it's the ISPs that overcommitted
[09:08:31] <Twilightlicious> We need slower speeds, not data caps.
[09:08:35] <Starthunder> So they can deal with it. :V
[09:08:36] <Twilightlicious> "imo"
[09:08:59] <Starthunder> And not with an OOB killer. That's not what I meant.
[09:10:45] <Googie> Slower speeds isn't what is really needed. If people only got exactly what the ISP had, equally shared... I think you'd probably be looking at sub-megabit speeds TBH, depending on the area.
[09:12:03] <Googie> Most people don't need commited bandwidth, but it's nice for them to be able to download things quickly when need be.
[09:13:24] <Colgate> reserved bandwidth is more of a server thing, and it comes at a premium in most cases
[09:13:31] <Googie> Yeah.
[09:14:34] <Googie> ISPs /need/ to overcommit if they want reasonable pricing.
[09:15:20] <Starthunder> Then they should be upfront about it.
[09:17:09] <Googie> The NBNco here charges $1750 per month for 100mbit dedicated backhaul. ISPs sell (limited) 100mbit access for around $60 a month or so.
[09:23:40] <Phase> good christ that's a lot
[09:23:58] <Googie> Hahaha, I know. I was stunned when I looked at the figures too.
[09:24:50] <Googie> That's just backhaul too, not what the NBN charges for provisioning the actual connection.
[09:25:13] <Starthunder> backhauk?
[09:26:43] <Googie> That's what they charge for an ISP to connect at one of their PoIs
[09:27:18] <Googie> So basically, backhaul from the consumer's premises to the Point of Interconnect
[09:27:30] <Googie> From there the ISP will still need to arrange/pay for their own transit.

[09:37:28] <Colgate> that 404s for me
[09:37:53] <Colgate> well, it does worse than a 404 actually
[09:38:01] <Starthunder> A 410? :o

[12:43:23] <Dusk> Shadow's Elemental+Atheme with tetra
[12:43:28] <Starthunder> Been around since 2011
[12:43:42] <Starthunder> I think. Might've been early 2012.
[12:43:48] <Cydie> I'm OPs with Red Helper
[12:43:53] <Dusk> I'm playing around with my own little insp + anope server
[12:44:36] <Cydie> One person thought me how to ignore people on telling me to use linux
[12:44:55] <Cydie> Named Zed Shaw
[12:46:08] <Dusk> Is that what you were setting up your Unreal server for?
[12:47:04] <Cydie> I'm not using linux
[12:47:10] <Cydie> I use windows
[12:47:15] <Dusk> I don't care
[12:47:26] <Dusk> answer the question asked
[12:47:29] <Dusk> :v
[12:47:51] <Cydie> Yes on that question Dusk
[12:47:54] <Dusk> ok
[12:48:03] <Dusk> Glad it worked then
[12:48:20] <Dusk> I should work on figuring out why I can't link my server with the hub on my own
[12:48:53] <Cydie> I use the documentation on Helper's network
[12:49:07] <Cydie> Just to familiarize
[12:49:13] <Dusk> I'm not running unreal :p
[12:50:00] <Cydie> Unreal is good though
[12:50:13] <Cydie> It's impossible to say it's bad
[12:50:37] <Dusk> I'm sure there are some people that have a differing opinion
[12:50:48] <Dusk> I've never been in a position where I'd judge unreal
[12:50:53] <Dusk> So I won't state an opinion
[12:52:42] <Cydie> It's because unreal is the only ircd that's actually easy to setup
[12:52:51] <Dusk> uh...
[12:52:56] <Dusk> I beg to differ
[12:53:04] <Dusk> 'only'
[12:54:12] <Dusk> Charby and Elemental aren't hard to set up at all as long as you know your server address and what ports you want to open.
[12:57:44] * Googie is still kinda annoyed at how annoying the default InspIRCd configs are out of the box :P
[12:57:56] <Dusk> Yes
[12:58:08] <Dusk> it's why I didn't bring it up as 'easy'
[12:58:32] <Googie> Hehehe, yeah.
[12:59:47] * Dusk raises her fist in the furstration that it was setting up her insp server with a services package she knows next to nothing about :v
[13:00:02] <Googie> I've configured it from scratch about five times now, each time I'm cursing at just how annoying it is.
[13:00:21] <Dusk> lol
[13:00:28] <Googie> It isn't bad if you're willing to put in time, but I experiment a bit, and I also kinda might have lost my configs a few times due to lack of proper organization.
[13:00:40] <Dusk> >.<
[13:04:10] <Starthunder> Googie: you just need a description of what Insp configs look like.
[13:05:02] <Starthunder> https://xkcd.com/1313/
[13:05:04] <PinkiePieBot> [ xkcd: Regex Golf ]
[13:05:23] <Googie> The relevant settings are scattered in between stuff with is purposely broken, including the <die> tags.
[13:05:47] <Googie> Debian has a nice stock config, but they go too far in the other direction, and it lacks a lot of the required examples.
[13:06:21] <Googie> (Also Debian's version tends to be out of date and their configs include tags which literally do nothing because they were removed)
[13:08:24] <Starthunder> TBH, I ditched Debian for Ubuntu because the release cycle was way too slow for me, and switching to unstable sounded scary.
[13:08:58] <Googie> Starthunder: Well, in version in Ubuntu is outdated too :V
[13:09:36] <Googie> I tend to use stable for all my server stuff, and sid for personal use.
[13:10:36] <Starthunder> in my experience, the Ubuntu stuff is outdated, but less so.
[13:10:52] <Googie> Ubuntu pulls from sid each release.
[13:10:58] <Seoson> My server is still on oldstable. I should really consider updating.
[13:11:05] * Dusk starts building insp on her server >.>
[13:11:24] <Starthunder> For example, I would expect Debian stable to be on weechat 0.3 or 0.4
[13:11:50] <Starthunder> With 1.0 slated for inclusion in the next release :p
[13:12:11] <Starthunder> Dusk: what host do you use?
[13:12:17] <Googie> Starthunder: 1.01 is already in Stable :P
[13:12:27] <Dusk> I'm using DO right now
[13:12:29] <Starthunder> >:O
[13:12:34] <Googie> But you're right. Though Weechat is also in backports
[13:12:53] <Dusk> though I've got a couple of OVH dedis and a BudgetVM thing
[13:12:59] <Googie> Ubuntu is basically sid though, but with more frequent proper releases.
[13:13:18] <Googie> (And obviously all the extra Canocial stuff)
[13:13:38] <Starthunder> maybe I should jump back again
[13:14:01] <Starthunder> The major updates, though, geez
[13:14:03] <Phase> i've seen less stability from ubuntu than debian sid
[13:14:15] <Phase> granted my sample size is one laptop
[13:14:22] <Starthunder> Debian 7 was released, and I spent a ton of time reading the thing on how to upgrade
[13:14:31] * Phase is loving fedora though
[13:14:38] <Starthunder> And then got distracted by other stuff and never did

[13:59:07] <Starthunder> Does it tell you which IP it resolved to?
[13:59:16] <CompuDesktop> no

[14:06:39] <CompuDesktop> i have a problem with them closing connection when i try to connect
