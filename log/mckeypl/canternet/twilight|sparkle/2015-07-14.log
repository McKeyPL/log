[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- ChanServ gives normal users the ability to maintain control
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- of a channel, without the need of a bot. Channel takeovers are
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- virtually impossible when a channel is registered with ChanServ.
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- Registration is a quick and painless process. Once registered,
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- the founder can maintain complete and total control over the channel.
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- Please note that channels will expire after 30 days of inactivity,
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- or if there are no eligible channel successors.
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- Activity is defined as a user with one of +FHORafhoqrsv being on the channel.
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- Successors are primarily those who have the +R flag
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- set on their account in the channel, although other
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- people may be chosen depending on their access
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- level and activity.
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle-  
[12:44:38] -Twilight|Sparkle- Commands can also be given on channel by prefixing one of '!'
