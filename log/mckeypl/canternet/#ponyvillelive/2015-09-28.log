[08:45:09] <Electron> Hello hoofed ones.
[08:52:44] * Electron throws a glimpse at Sakura
[08:56:14] <Sakura> Why do you have a crush on me now?
[08:56:47] <Electron> I... what?
[08:57:06] <Sakura> You have crush on me. :)
[08:57:06] <Electron> I don't have a crush on you.
[08:57:31] <Electron> No, I do not.
[08:58:08] <Electron> Who gave you such idea?
[08:58:31] <Sakura> You.
[08:58:34] <Sakura> :P
[08:59:03] <Electron> Me?
[08:59:20] <Sakura> You gave me the traditional marriage proposal glance of Norwayhouse.
[09:00:01] <Electron>  ( 0_0)
[09:00:03] <Sakura> But can it wait until after I finish my supper?
[09:00:35] <Electron> But I don't have such intentions either.
[09:01:10] <Sakura> I'm having fried alpaca for supper & I'm shipping llamas in the mail.
[09:01:18] <Electron> Who gets married at a glance? That's weird.
[09:01:58] <Sakura> No clue
[09:04:30] <Sakura> I don't want marriage anyway
[09:04:49] <Electron> Hey, if you don't want me to pay attention to you, you can just say it.
[09:06:01] <Sakura> You can if you want but I was watching RWBY.
[09:06:55] <Electron> If you say so.
[09:08:53] * Sakura falls asleep on Electron's lap
[09:11:23] * Electron carries Sakura to bed with soft pillow and fluffy blanket
[09:16:30] <Sakura> You. Read to kitty.
[09:17:34] * Electron reads to kitty
[09:18:22] <Sakura> Mew
[09:19:19] <Electron> Goodnight, if you are gonna sleep.
[09:22:43] <Sakura> Not sleeping yet.
[09:23:05] <Sakura> I would be absent for a long time if I was.
[09:24:48] <Electron> Valid point.
[09:25:59] <Electron> I'll give a try to that anime.
[09:28:04] <Electron> If it's an anime.
[09:28:11] <Sakura> Which one?
[09:28:20] <Sakura> RWBY?
[09:28:21] <Electron> Didn't check it yet.
[09:28:23] <Electron> Yes.
[09:28:42] <Sakura> But that's a Rooster Teeth
[09:30:09] <Electron> Google gave me crunchyroll site where I can watch it online.
[09:30:16] <Electron> Let's see.
[09:41:52] <Electron> Do all main characters have to be pretty young girls?
