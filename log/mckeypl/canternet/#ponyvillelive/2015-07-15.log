[09:32:01] <StarStream> ish 
[09:32:28] <StarStream> bored as heck 
[09:36:14] <Electron> what are you doing there, StarStream?
[09:37:18] <JockeTF> My ADSL connection is horrendous.
[09:37:19] <StarStream> hmm ?
[09:37:27] <StarStream> do wat ?
[09:37:35] <JockeTF> I just switched to 3G and it's so much better. :P
[09:38:07] <JockeTF> I'll be getting fiber in October, thankfully. But it's funny that my 3G connection is way better than my wired one.
[09:38:15] <StarStream> cool
[09:39:41] <Electron> I had ADSL for 8 years  ( ._.)
[09:39:48] <StarStream> oh
[09:40:10] <JockeTF> Electron: Well, I just don't have ADSL, I have crappy unstable ADSL.
[09:40:24] <Electron> and changed it to fibre 8 months ago
[09:40:34] <JockeTF> My upload speed using my Nokia N8 as a modem is BETTER than with my ADSL.
[09:40:49] <Electron> yeah, I know that
[09:40:59] <StarStream> man i am bored
[09:41:01] <StarStream> help 
[09:41:01] <Electron> upload speed in ADSL is horrible
[09:41:51] <JockeTF> On top of that the ADSL costs 40€ per month.
[09:42:07] <Electron> start to study anything, you would find yourself busy distracting yourself from studying, StarStream
[09:42:14] <JockeTF> ... The fiber will cost less than 30£ :P
[09:42:18] <JockeTF> Electron speaks the truth.

[09:46:43] <Electron> not working
[09:46:58] <JockeTF> I'm on Linux though.
[09:47:03] <Electron> exactly
[09:47:23] <JockeTF> But my Swedish keyboard even has € on the E key.
[09:47:40] * Electron goes to charmap
[09:48:33] <JockeTF> So maybe that's just on the Swedish layout?
[09:48:57] <Electron> that's odd
[09:49:05] <Electron> £ and ₤
[09:49:38] <JockeTF> £€$¥
[09:49:44] <Electron> found it €
[09:49:51] <Electron> 0128 code
[09:50:58] <Electron> so ADSL is slower and costs more
[09:51:11] <Electron> fibre is faster and costs less
[09:51:36] <StarStream> ADSL is copper
[09:52:09] <Electron> ADSL is simple phone line [:
[09:52:26] <JockeTF> Electron: I get 10/1 Mbps on my ADSL. Will get 100/100 Mbps with fiber. :P
[09:52:44] <Electron> ↑
[09:53:36] <JockeTF> I can get up to 1000/100 Mbps, but that's a bit too expensive for me (~80€ per month). ;P
[09:54:14] <Electron> for me it's like cosmic prices
[09:55:50] <Electron> 40€*63 = 2520, holy buck
[09:57:11] <JockeTF> Electron: The reason it's cheap is because the government built the network, and all ISPs are allowed to sell their services on it.
[09:57:36] <StarStream> hmm

[10:01:15] <Electron> that's right
[10:01:25] <JockeTF> Cool, does it work well?
[10:01:41] <Electron> it works well from december 2014 for now
