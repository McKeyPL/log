[12:46:03] <Electron> good old Quassel
[12:46:35] <Dusk> Ew
[12:46:38] <Dusk> Quassel
[12:47:03] <Electron> what?
[12:47:12] <Dusk> Quassel is awful :<
[12:47:22] <Electron> why?
[12:47:28] <Dusk> The devs of it are like the worst
[12:47:49] <Dusk> Well they don't support common convention of stuff or listening to the server on some things like what modes are supported and such
[12:47:59] <Dusk> Instead it's hardcoded which no client should have done
[12:48:08] <Dusk> The logs are convoluted
[12:48:32] <Dusk> and the bouncer is meh? But weechat can still give a better experience or even ZNC if configured right if you're wanting that
[12:48:35] <Electron> they are ignorant jerks or something?
[12:48:39] <Dusk> Yea
[12:48:48] <Dusk> They're very resistant to change
[12:49:40] * Electron jerks ArchPegasusMichael's wing
[12:50:03] * ArchPegasusMichael eeps
[12:50:06] <Dusk> They client works at least, and is relatively usable. Just ugly by default :(
[14:43:20] <MirSar> Dusk, if you where to suggest a better Client+Bouncer able to runn on both Windows an Linyx with multi user support, what would you suggest? :)
[14:44:09] <Dusk> ZNC
[14:44:37] <Dusk> ZNC has multiuser written all over it, and is openly extensible.
[14:45:00] <Dusk> I've even got a fork running called WeeNC where WeeChat is integrated into ZNC to give the best of both worlds
[14:45:02] <Not-1462> Tune in to #MellowMonday in 15 minutes on @BronydomNetwork! - http://pvlive.me/bronydom_radio
[14:45:38] <Dusk> Personally I'd recommend WeeChat/Colloquy/mIRC/Hexchat depending on what OS/phone you use
[14:46:26] <Dusk> Because WeeChat has one of the best IRC 'clients' for Android, and Colloquy is fully supported by ZNC for notifications on iOS even in the background.
[14:46:48] <Dusk> I use mIRC on windows and WeeChat/Hexchat in linux (Depending on if I want an actual gui client)
[14:46:55] <MirSar> interesting, I'll need to have a closer look at that, Quassel's been a pain in the ass since the begining.. crashing for no reason, no logging why it crashes and so forth..
[14:47:40] <Dusk> If you need help/ would like to use my custom bouncer feel free to ask, I run a medium scale bouncer on my Dedi with about 50 users
[14:47:42] <MirSar> You think it would be able to use Quassel's client to access ZNC's bouncer? (I like the GUI :P)
[14:47:52] <Dusk> Indeed
[14:48:10] <Dusk> You can connect to ZNC with any client that connects to an IRC server
[14:48:28] <Electron> I've noticed odd behaviour of Quassel too
[14:48:43] <Electron> but the interface is nice
[14:48:55] <Dusk> Quassel is a bit of a pain most of the time for me. It's why I stopped using it in general and switched mostly to weechat
[14:49:16] <Dusk> I've done quite a lot of work on my bouncer though to make sure that I can have all of Quassel's good features
[14:49:34] <Electron> and?
[14:49:57] <Electron> the conclusion is "meh"?
[14:50:01] <Dusk> (Like dynamic buffer scrollback, all of the clients having synced buffers for PMs, relatively dynamic buffer syncing (in weechat))
[14:50:20] *** Quits: TecknoJock (TecknoJock@TecknoJock) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[14:50:24] <Dusk> I personally will not recommend Quassel to anyone, at least the core. The client is ok enough to use
[14:50:38] <Electron> or, you mean Quassel client to another core
[14:50:47] <Dusk> What do you mean?
[14:51:16] <Dusk> The Quassel client is capable of talking to an IRC server without a core at all, which means it works fine with ZNC.
[14:51:19] <MirSar> Electron: yes, you use Quassel as client and FX I have ZNC as core on server, that works
[14:51:51] <Electron> I thought you were doing stuff to Quassel core to make it better
[14:51:59] <Electron> but I was wrong
[14:52:08] <MirSar> Can't fix what dev's have bruken...
[14:52:11] <Dusk> Nope

[14:52:54] <Dusk> ZNC?
[14:53:01] <Dusk> or quasselcore
[14:53:09] <MirSar> no Quassel, that's why I'm looking at somthing else

[18:09:32] <Electron> but crashed 
[18:09:43] <Dusk> Well you both have the connect details and stuff that will work in other clients
[18:10:07] <Dusk> if you're gonna use mIRC the port 6009 has to have a + in front of it (+6009)
[18:10:16] <Dusk> because that's how mIRC specifies SSL
[18:10:33] <Dusk> Hexchat just has a box for it
[18:10:43] <Electron> StarStream, first thing go to the site https://znc.ocelot.link/
[18:10:55] <StarStream> i am at the site now 
[18:11:06] <StarStream> doing some channel management 
[18:12:34] <Dusk> It is nice to be able to use the web interface for that :D
[18:13:02] <Dusk> If you need modules explained to you let me know, each module should have documentation available, but some of them simply don't because they're custom and mine
[18:13:11] <StarStream> ok
[18:13:38] <StarStream> hmm.. i feel like just use the common port 
[18:13:44] <StarStream> but then again its not safe right ?
[18:13:57] <Dusk> It's not really safe no :(
[18:14:05] <Dusk> I really recommend using the ssl port if possible

[18:15:44] <Dusk> yes
[18:16:05] <StarStream> nvm i oredi got my answer
[18:16:12] <StarStream> because the bnc is running now :P 
[18:16:42] <Electron> seems like you did on the first try
[18:16:50] <Electron> gratz :)
[18:17:01] <StarStream> well this is here --> StarStream_ (StarStream@Pony-qppoca.dusky.horse) has joined #PonyvilleLIVE
[18:17:08] <StarStream> goes to show at least its running :D 
[18:19:20] <StarStream> but thing is that first thing is to setup all the channels up and running first tho 
[18:19:24] <StarStream> most importantly... 
[18:19:40] <StarStream> ident is the identify right ?
[18:19:56] <Electron> got to be
[18:20:28] <Dusk> No
[18:20:31] <StarStream> the auto identify how would that count then ?
[18:20:45] <Dusk> you can use sasl or nickserv module to do that
[18:20:55] <StarStream> found the module
[18:20:57] <Dusk> to set up sasl you type (while connected to the bouncer)
[18:21:06] <Dusk> ./znc loadmod sasl
[18:21:15] <Dusk> ./msg *sasl mechanism plain
[18:21:25] <StarStream> or found it on the webui 
[18:21:29] <Dusk> ./msg *sasl set yournickservuser yournickservpassword
[18:21:59] <StarStream> wait whats the different between sasl or nickserv module ?
[18:22:55] <Dusk> sasl authenticates upon connection to the server, so you're authed to nickserv before arriving in channels
[18:23:09] <Dusk> the nickserv module auths you after you've already connected to all of your channels
[18:23:21] <Dusk> (Which is why I don'y use it)
[18:23:39] <StarStream> ah
[18:23:48] <StarStream> yea sasl is way more better
[18:24:03] <StarStream> tho how do i input the command at the webui ?
[18:24:15] <Dusk> You can't
[18:24:19] <StarStream> darn 
[18:24:32] <Dusk> that module requires you to be connected to IRC to work because it has to be configured
[18:24:43] <StarStream> oh
[18:25:04] <Dusk> Which is why I told you the exact commands to type
[18:26:26] <StarStream> i havent connect to anything yet.. 
[18:26:40] <Dusk> Well when you do you can set that up :D
[18:26:41] <StarStream> btw dusk did u buy mirc or pirate that software?
[18:26:46] <Dusk> I bought it

[18:27:45] <StarStream> man i hate that there is a lifespan of 10 years
[18:28:57] <Dusk> huh?
[18:33:46] <StarStream> i mean its not a permanent software once u paid for it

[18:35:43] <Dusk> if so you need to have it connect to cadance.canternet.org +6697

[18:36:00] <StarStream> how do u get the fingerprint ?

[18:37:53] <Dusk> canternet just doesn't have a wildcard ssl cert like some networks do
[18:38:08] <StarStream> i am trying to connect to another network thats why
[18:38:13] <Dusk> Then no
[18:38:20] <Dusk> unless they have an invalid cert
[18:38:44] <Dusk> then you'll have to obtain their fingerprint upon connecting and type the command it gives you in the IRC client
[18:39:02] <StarStream> how do u do that ?
[18:39:19] <Dusk> if you were connected to the bouncer it'd be apparent
[18:39:33] <Dusk> because there'd be a window open telling you their cert is invalid
[18:39:42] <Dusk> you'll only find that out when you connect though
[18:40:46] <StarStream> so much headache
[18:41:25] <Dusk> Not really
[18:42:02] <Dusk> Just connect to the bouncer silly
[18:42:09] <Dusk> it's easier to configure it if you're connected to it
[18:42:41] <StarStream> well i havent connect to the bouncer yet
[18:42:51] <Dusk> you don't even know if their cert is invalid so you don't even know if you need their fingerprint
[18:42:57] <Dusk> most servers you won't have to worry about it
[18:43:24] <Dusk> So I'd stop worrying so much if I were you :p
[18:48:07] <StarStream> hmm.. currently i am using hexchat to do experimentation 
[18:48:20] <Dusk> okidoke
[18:50:32] <StarStream> uhm.. how do u connect to the znc ?
[18:52:41] <StarStream> what is the server ?

[19:42:38] <MirSar-> I sense a bit of work to get a "not so square" GUI :P
[19:43:12] <Electron> oh yeah, right
[19:44:41] <MirSar> But looking at the strong web GUI and speed difference, this will be something I'm gonna set upp myself :D
[19:45:08] <MirSar-> Like Quassel can take 1-10 minutes, JUST to load
[19:46:09] <Electron> so... Quassel is dead?
[19:47:13] <MirSar-> Not yet, gonna keep quassel running until ZNC is running as it should, might leave quassel on the server as a backup too
[19:47:39] <Electron> alright
[19:47:44] <Electron> tell me if it's the time
[19:52:19] <Electron> remember me telling you that Quassel became one of the most frequently used program?

[22:02:39] <Sakura> This is good investment advice I found on Motley Fool. Cable TV is indeed dying & making way for streaming TV.
[22:04:43] <Electron> TV? what's a TV?
[22:06:01] <Sakura> TV, that big picture box that streamers stream ponies from
[22:07:20] <Electron> I ain't no see any ponies from TV
[22:07:40] <Sakura> Honestly, Streaming services both free & cheap are good as is OTA Antenna TV, but there's one more thing people are forgetting that's free: Free Satellite OTA TV.
[22:07:47] <Electron> my monitor shows them for me
[22:10:26] <Sakura> TV is better if it's bigger than a monitor. You just need Netflix/YouTube/Hulu for your favorite shows on Cable, An excellent antenna for Network programming & local news, and a free OTA satellite that can give you world programming like Russia Today or Al Jazeera.
[22:10:37] <Sakura> Of course monitors are good too.
[22:12:04] <Electron> it's the question are there Netflix/YouTube/Hulu in my country
[22:12:27] <Electron> YouTube is
[22:13:19] <Sakura> Whichever stream sites are available in your country.
