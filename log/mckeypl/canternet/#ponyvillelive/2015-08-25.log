[10:11:45] <JockeTF> For 28€ per month. :P
[10:11:46] <JockeTF> No caps. :P
[10:11:49] <MorningSong> I'm getting like 135 down and 30 up
[10:12:14] <Electron> so expensive :O
[10:12:29] <MorningSong> Hey that'd be cheap in america
[10:13:01] <MorningSong> Sadly our internet providers all suck
[10:13:13] <Electron> why is that?
[10:13:13] <MorningSong> and want all of the money ever to themselves
[10:13:20] <MorningSong> so they monopolize on areas
[10:13:23] <Cadance> at least comcast gives me IPv6
[10:13:34] <MorningSong> Comcast doesn't give everyone IPv6
[10:13:50] <MorningSong> My area goes through comcast and we don't have IPv6.
[10:14:04] <Cadance> you got a DOCSIS 3 modem?
[10:14:43] <Cadance> aka
[10:14:47] <Cadance> was it made in the last 2 years
[10:14:51] <Electron> the world passes to IPv6?
[10:15:02] <MorningSong> We have one that was made about 6 months ago
[10:17:12] <Electron> hey, MorningSong, how are the things going in Poniverse?
[10:17:29] <MorningSong> They're getting better for sure
[10:18:26] <MorningSong> Right now I'm waiting on the oauth module for atheme to be finished
[10:18:32] <Electron> or more specifically, what side of it do you have in your command?
[10:18:51] <MorningSong> but once that's done I'll be able to finish integrating the irc network into their site
[10:19:28] <MorningSong> I control Poniverse's IRC network, I don't do much else there than that
[10:19:33] <Electron> so there will be build-in IRC client on the site?
[10:19:37] <MorningSong> Yes
[10:19:41] * JockeTF likes alpacas.
[10:19:48] <Electron> okay
[10:20:11] <Electron> do you know anything of pony.fm?
[10:20:12] <MorningSong> It will accept the poniverse oauth token that you get when you log into poniverse's various sites as a nickserv auth
[10:20:14] <MorningSong> Yes
[10:20:28] <MorningSong> They're working on integrating the MLPMA into it currently
[10:20:42] <Electron> who controls and code pony.fm?
[10:20:50] <MorningSong> Poniverse developers
[10:20:54] <Cadance> how deliciously backwards of an implementation
[10:21:09] * Cadance has been designing a forwards implementation
[10:21:09] <Electron> okay, thanks
[10:21:24] <MorningSong> Cadance: It's a stop gap for now
[10:22:42] <MorningSong> There are several other issues to overcome with the network's integration into their sites before we stop being ass backwards about it
[10:22:50] <MorningSong> However right now what we have will work
[10:25:27] <Electron> I want to read about near future of Poniverse
[10:25:48] <Electron> gonna check mlpforum 
[10:27:04] <Electron> "Feedback & Suggestions"?
[10:27:08] <Electron> nope
[10:27:27] <Electron> "Site Questions & Tech Support"?
[10:27:31] <Electron> maybe here
[10:30:21] <MorningSong> Electron: you're not gonna find it there
[10:30:39] <Electron> yeah, I already noticed it :(
[10:31:04] <MorningSong> What do you have questions about?
[10:31:52] <Electron> I want to know news and plans
[10:32:05] <Electron> what if this site is abandoned?
[10:32:09] <MorningSong> Well they usually don't release any of that publicly until it's ready to release
[10:32:16] <MorningSong> Huh?
[10:32:28] <MorningSong> What if what is abandoned?
[10:32:30] <Electron> relese news are finr too
[10:32:37] <MangoBloom> pony.fm is almost unusable for me :/
[10:32:43] <MorningSong> MangoBloom: time
[10:32:45] <MorningSong> give it time
[10:32:48] <MorningSong> they're working on it
[10:32:50] <Electron> :/
[10:32:56] <MangoBloom> keeps freezing
[10:33:13] <Electron> I asked a question about it, but got no answer
[10:33:15] <Electron> at all
[10:33:20] <MangoBloom> ^
[10:33:23] <Electron> as if it is abandoned
[10:33:24] <MorningSong> What do you mean?
[10:33:33] <MorningSong> I just told you what they're doing with it
[10:33:46] <MorningSong> And obviously you don't believe me so I might as well just not talk
[10:34:07] <Electron> I believe you
[10:34:49] <Electron> but you said that you are on the IRC side of Poniverse
[10:34:50] <MangoBloom> latest news post for ponyfm is from 2013 xD
[10:35:08] <MorningSong> Then why think it's dead? I've told you the exact thing they're doing moving forward. There's optimization on disk to do with the music itself, and their front end is gonna be worked on in the mean time
[10:35:17] <Electron> that's why I am looking for something related to my interest
[10:35:45] <Electron> it's just... so quiet
[10:35:57] <MorningSong> As I said give it time, they've paused work on it due to their acquisition of PonyMC
[10:36:34] <MorningSong> They've got a few more pressing things to get working before they resume full blown work on it
[10:36:57] <Electron> but what if I could help somehow? not from the tech side but some other way?
[10:38:26] <MorningSong> All they need help from with pony.fm right now is the tech side and as I said that's only because they've got other projects that are pressing right now
[10:38:54] * MangoBloom cant wait for that new api
[10:41:34] <MorningSong> I can't wait until it's open source!
[10:41:34] * Electron sighs
[10:41:46] <MangoBloom> yup
[10:42:00] <MorningSong> Electron: Be patient
[10:42:01] <Electron> okay, just wait

[10:42:08] <MangoBloom> Soon™
[10:42:12] <Electron> I have to wait
[10:42:21] <MorningSong> They're making progress, and I think it'll be worth it
[10:43:04] <MangoBloom> i dont even know who "they" are
[10:43:08] <MangoBloom> :D
[10:43:18] <Electron> I really will appreciate a small news though

[14:19:28] <StarStream> hows it going 
[14:19:39] <StarStream> using znc now tho 
[14:19:51] <Electron> yo yo
[14:20:06] <StarStream> using hexchat also 
[14:21:21] <StarStream> btw dusk i wanna ask how do u connect to multiple network under one username
[14:22:01] <Dusk> You can just add a new network
[14:22:01] <Dusk> oh
[14:22:01] <Dusk> you mean on one connection?
[14:22:01] <StarStream> yea
[14:22:26] <StarStream> also is there a way to change the colour of the send text ? 
[14:22:38] <StarStream> for hexchat cause its gray which is hard
[14:23:38] <Dusk> You can just grab a theme for hexchat
[14:24:34] <StarStream> yea
[14:24:35] <Dusk> and there's no way to connect to multiple IRC servers under one nickname on one single connection
[14:24:52] <StarStream> oh so basically have to make multiple connection ?
[14:24:53] <Electron> darn it
[14:25:09] <Electron> launch two hexchats
[14:25:12] <Dusk> No
[14:25:17] <Dusk> don't launch two hexchat
[14:25:20] <Dusk> s
[14:25:45] <Electron> two different clients then
[14:25:50] <Dusk> You can have more than one server connection within hexchat
[14:26:04] <StarStream> how ?
[14:26:04] <Dusk> You can connect to as many IRC servers as you like within one IRC clients
[14:26:20] <StarStream> ok 
[14:27:40] <Dusk> You tell it to connect to a new server
[14:27:41] <Dusk> Just add a new server
[14:27:41] <StarStream> ok
[14:27:41] <Dusk> You can add servers you want it to autoconnect to on start up too
[14:27:41] <StarStream> but sad problem is that u cant use the same username tho 
[14:27:41] <StarStream> for the other server
[14:27:41] <Dusk> it's a little checkbox in the advanced settings
[14:27:41] <Dusk> You can as long as the nickname is free
[14:27:41] <Electron> yes, but I can't see messages from two servers simultaneously
[14:27:41] <Dusk> Electron: Why not?
[14:27:41] <Electron> you have to switch between them all the time
[14:27:41] <StarStream> ah ok 
[14:27:41] <Dusk> You have to do the same on any IRC client >.>
[14:27:49] <StarStream> nvm the quassel still connect to the other server
[14:28:21] <Dusk> Hexchat can even have detached windows
[14:29:06] <StarStream> yea
[14:29:06] <Electron> I know, and that's why I said to launch two different clients to be connected to two networks at the same time and see all the messages
[14:29:06] <Dusk> so that you can have chats separated from the main client
[14:29:06] <Dusk> Electron: just detach the window
[14:29:06] <Dusk> No need to launch more than one client
[14:29:06] <Dusk> that's extremely silly
[14:29:08] <Electron> okay, I'll dig into it more :)
[14:30:56] <StarStream> http://i.imgur.com/V0fo7gz.png
[14:31:07] <StarStream> this is the problem

[17:58:19] <Colgate> Dusk: "and they still don't have individual server certs or a wildcard" -- not true, the certs are wildcard, you just simply don't trust our CA(which is cacert)
[17:58:37] <Dusk> Googie explained
[17:58:43] <Dusk> Still a bad reason.
[17:59:17] <Dusk> Because neither my windows install nor linux trusts it.
[17:59:33] <Dusk> And a CA that's not trusted by default is annoying and might as well be self signed :v

[18:07:37] <Colgate> /shrug, it used to be trusted by default in debian
[18:09:05] <Dusk> well ubuntu and arch don't trust it
[18:09:10] <Dusk> So it's annoying :/
[18:11:41] <Googie> You can easily install the certificate if you want.
[18:12:02] <Googie> IIRC there's a package for it in Arch, and I'm not sure about Debian still, but there's probably a good way to do it there as well.
[18:12:31] <Dusk> It's still an inconvenience
[18:12:46] <Dusk> Whereas there are better ways to have something that's already trusted by default for free.
[18:12:51] <Dusk> Which I've already mentioned

[18:15:06] <Colgate> I can't control who you trust
[18:15:13] <Colgate> if you trust cacert, add them as a CA
[18:16:17] *** Joins: nerdzephyr (nerdzephyr@Pony-d6085p.range86-181.btcentralplus.com)
[18:16:22] <Dusk> I'm not saying not to. It's a matter of convenience.
[18:16:31] <Dusk> Not a matter of what am I trusting.
[18:17:55] <Colgate> it is a matter of whom you are trusting though
[18:18:10] <Colgate> every CA in that CA list you are trusting
[18:18:24] <Colgate> whether it is in the "default" list of CAs of the OS or not
[18:19:28] <Dusk> Adding it isn't something that's convenient for the everyday user.
[18:19:56] <Dusk> And promoting ssl to the everyday user shouldn't require them to learn how to do all of that. Intuitiveness is kinda important if you want a userbase to stay around.
[18:28:48] <Colgate> /shrug, there's a de facto standard in irc networks to use self-signed anyways, so this isn't any worse
[18:29:46] <Colgate> plus, getting a wildcard certificate that is trusted by default in every OS costs money that I personally don't want to give to CAs
[18:32:48] <Dusk> You don't need to.
[18:32:56] <Dusk> You already know how wosign works.
[18:33:01] <Dusk> :T
[18:33:28] <Dusk> It's not even that hard to list off the names of any future servers you'd wanna name too.
[18:37:43] <Colgate> wosign doesn't do wildcards
[18:38:01] <Dusk> No, but you can list what all subdomains it will work for.
[18:38:06] <Dusk> Which isn't a hard thing to do
[18:38:07] <Colgate> at this point, it is the principle of the matter
[18:38:22] <Colgate> there shouldn't be a cost involved with a wildcard cert, there is no reason for it
[18:38:31] *** Joins: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-iveufh.priv.bahnhof.se)
[18:38:33] <Colgate> and so I refuse to support that system
[18:38:42] <Dusk> Wosign's solution might not be elegant but it works nicely.
[18:38:54] <Dusk> And since it's free it's convenient and lasts for 3 years.
[18:39:08] <Colgate> I know what wosign is
[18:39:20] <Dusk> I stated that you did.
[18:39:26] <Dusk> Because I already know you do.
[18:39:43] <Dusk> So, since you're going to argue a point you already know would work what's your point?
[18:39:52] <Colgate> because they don't do wildcards
[18:39:58] <Dusk> You don't need one.
[18:40:05] <Colgate> nobody needs one
[18:40:14] <Colgate> but they are very convenient
[18:40:15] <Dusk> Then what's your point?
[18:40:24] <Dusk> I'm still not seeing it
[18:40:44] <Dusk> your reluctance to use something clearly easy and convenient for the mass of people is troubling.
[18:40:50] <Colgate> my point is that I want a wildcard cert, but I don't want to support the CA system by putting money into it
[18:41:59] <Colgate> and let's be frank here, most people when they see the warning that the cert is invalid would just click that checkbox that says "ignore cert errors" anyways, even if it originally worked in the past
[18:42:59] <Dusk> That is true, but why make it necessary to inconvenience people like that to start with?
[18:43:33] <Dusk> Most of the bigger networks aim for convenience, and even plenty of smaller ones do (Contrary to what you said)
[18:43:43] <Dusk> SInce I've seen plenty of small servers with proper certs.
[18:44:55] <Colgate> "proper" certs
[18:45:09] <Colgate> please don't use that word to describe those certs
[18:45:33] <Dusk> What will you describe them as?
[18:45:52] <Dusk> Because proper to me means that they are accepted by default and not inconveniencing the everyday user.
[18:45:54] <Colgate> certs signed by a default trusted CA in a major OS
[18:46:02] * JockeTF is also having problems connecting now.
[18:46:36] <Colgate> let's encrypt is coming out in a few months, so whatever
[18:46:46] <Cadance> they also dont have wildcards
[18:47:13] <Colgate> oh? have a source for that? I must have missed that
[18:47:14] <JockeTF> I was Z-lined since I some servers work for me, while other don't.
[18:47:37] <Dusk> But using a cert signed by a trusted CA that works in several major OSes is more important.
[18:47:50] <Dusk> Having it be trusted by default in ONE major OS is nothing
[18:47:57] <Googie> They will have support for SNI though, so not having wildcards isn't really an issue
[18:48:37] <Dusk> Especially if it isn't windows or some other popular distro that has a lot of users makes it pointless to state that it works.
[18:49:22] <Dusk> If it doesn't work for the masses by default what on earth would make you say it's convenient, something makes me thing you wanna argue with me because you simply wanna go against this point for no reason. What I suggested doesn't cost anything and works.
[18:49:37] <Dusk> It isn't even something stop gap, it just works.
[18:49:39] <Googie> It works fine at present. I did a survey of networks using default trusted certs a few months back. It's a really tiny minority
[18:49:41] <Dusk> And you alreay know it.
[18:50:00] <Googie> It's also fairly pointless to change at the moment considering that LetsEncrypt is on track.
[18:50:33] <Dusk> smh
[18:50:43] * Dusk continues on to be a joke
[18:51:13] <Dusk> Either way, had a great time reconfiguring all of my ZNC guys. Thanks for the inconvenience.
[18:51:43] <AppleDash> You could have, you know, added CACert to your server's cert store
[18:52:14] <Dusk> I could yea.
[18:52:25] <Dusk> But they're switching again anyway
[18:52:27] <Dusk> so it'd be pointless.
[18:52:28] <AppleDash> But you chose not to, so the inconvenience is your own
[18:53:26] <Dusk> Only kinda? The solution I proposed is more convenient on both fronts.
[19:00:30] <Googie> Actually, not SNI (though it'll have support for that too) it looks like it supports SubjectAltNames, which should be fine. SNI will need implementation in IRC clients/via IRCv3, though it looks like there might be plans for that (though TLS certificates over IRC is a fairly heated discussion for various reasons)
[19:00:44] * Googie should go to bed.
[19:00:53] <Colgate> SNI on irc is kind of pointless
[19:01:08] <Googie> As long as SubjectAltNames works, yeah
[19:01:17] <Googie> Got the two confused
[19:01:20] <Colgate> unless an ircd is hosting multiple networks on the same IP/port? that would be really weird
[19:08:13] <Googie> Actually, reading the IRCv3 discussion back, it looks like a couple of people might have gotten confused .
[19:11:13] * Googie shrugs and flops over. Time for sleeps
[19:12:38] <JockeTF> Well, I'm happy as long as I can talk to people about the awesomeness of alpacas.
