[19:51:03] <Electron> Hello, my favourite dane.
[19:51:09] * TheFlutt1rGuy beams
[19:51:14] <Electron> I just wanted to say something to you.

[19:52:41] <Electron> :O
[19:52:51] <Electron> So high!
[19:53:02] <TheFlutt1rGuy> yeah, indeed
[19:53:06] * TheFlutt1rGuy passes the blunt to Electron 
[19:54:09] <Electron> Did you have fun celebrating this New Year?
[19:55:27] <TheFlutt1rGuy> *meh*. was ok. 
[19:55:36] <TheFlutt1rGuy> i got to spend it with Lunia, so, it was awesome ;)
[19:55:59] <TheFlutt1rGuy> but new years is always a let down. never that awesome of a party as everyone makes it out to be
[19:56:22] <TheFlutt1rGuy> how was yours?
[19:57:38] <Electron> Mine was freaking awesome.
[19:58:10] <Electron> Much fun celebrating with my friends.
[19:58:16] <TheFlutt1rGuy> as it should be :)
[19:58:28] <TheFlutt1rGuy> we were like 10 peeps. good close friends of mine.
[19:59:54] <Electron> Wow, so many close friends.
[20:00:01] <Electron> That's good.
[20:00:25] <TheFlutt1rGuy> well. ok. 2 very very close friends. and 8 of their friends that i have known for 6+ years.
[20:00:41] <Electron> :>
[20:01:09] <TheFlutt1rGuy> soo, are you gonna try a pony con this year?
[20:02:48] <Electron> I guess not. Economics fell down even more.
[20:03:02] <Electron> Ruble lost its value twice.
[20:03:04] <TheFlutt1rGuy> yeah :(
[20:03:22] <Electron> So I need like twice much money as I needed before.
[20:03:24] <TheFlutt1rGuy> feeling it too in denmark, but not to the same degree.
[20:03:30] <TheFlutt1rGuy> :/
[20:03:33] <Electron> And earning them became harder.
[20:03:37] <TheFlutt1rGuy> how are you making that work?
[20:04:01] <Electron> I'm working on myself.
[20:04:13] * TheFlutt1rGuy hugs Electron 
[20:04:40] <Electron> We are small entrepreneurs with my sister.
[20:04:53] * Electron ruffles TheFlutt1rGuy's mane
