[13:06:22] <StarStream> sup el
[13:06:49] <Electron> wazzup StarStream
[13:06:55] <StarStream> aint much 
[13:07:01] <StarStream> had fun with my bears and what not 
[13:07:02] <Electron> I'm working sorta
[13:07:20] <StarStream> ok 
[13:07:20] <Electron> how are your plushies doing?
[13:07:37] <Electron> and how are you doing?
[13:08:26] <StarStream> they are fune 
[13:08:28] <StarStream> fine*
[13:08:32] <StarStream> as for me thinking 
[13:10:32] <Electron> what? what are you thinking about?
[13:11:57] <StarStream> arcade stuff
[13:12:16] <Electron> by the way
[13:12:23] <Electron> you can congatulate me
[13:12:30] <StarStream> oh ?
[13:12:42] <Electron> I got rid of one loan yesterday
[13:12:59] <StarStream> how many loan do u have ?
[13:13:14] <Electron> one for now
[13:13:47] <StarStream> wat was that loan previously ?
[13:15:11] <Electron> it was money loan
[13:16:48] <StarStream> ah 
[13:16:53] <StarStream> i am hunting for spring XD 
[13:22:40] <StarStream> funny right
[13:23:57] <Electron> catch it
[13:24:28] <Electron> you mean spring as engineering part?
[13:24:40] <Electron> or as weather season?
[13:24:48] <StarStream> neither
[13:24:55] <StarStream> its for gaming usage
[13:31:17] <StarStream> but ur wondering right ?
[13:31:31] <Electron> yeah
[13:31:56] <StarStream> what does spring have to do with gaming right 
[13:32:14] <StarStream> have u ever heard of arcade style controller ?
[13:32:40] <Electron> well, I know joystick
[13:32:46] <Electron> I know gamepad
[13:33:04] <Electron> I know different dance pads
[13:33:35] <StarStream> but never heard of arcade style controller ?
[13:34:28] <Electron> nope
[13:35:09] <StarStream> arcade style controller is basically a controller 
[13:35:17] <StarStream> but u see them in an arcade
[13:35:40] <StarStream> so basically they are like clunky 
[13:35:51] <StarStream> heck when u said dance pads 
[13:36:19] <Electron> clunky controller?
[13:36:25] <StarStream> if ur referring to the ddr arcade style controller it would basically be metal pad which is the same dimension as an arcade 
[13:36:34] <StarStream> yea
[13:37:22] <StarStream> bought this http://www.gamo2.com/en/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=244
[13:37:26] <StarStream> waiting for it to arrive
[13:37:36] <StarStream> basically i am buying spare parts for later use
[13:37:39] <Electron> let's see
[13:38:09] <StarStream> and those things are like more than 100 
[13:38:12] <StarStream> usd
[13:38:27] <StarStream> but dont think about it in short term 
[13:38:29] <Electron> it is clunky :D
[13:38:35] <StarStream> think of it as long term 
[13:38:42] <StarStream> yea and that controller weigh 7kg
[13:38:50] <Electron> oh my god
[13:39:14] <StarStream> yea
[13:39:16] <StarStream> about that weight
[13:39:25] <StarStream> i have one now actually and it weigh about 2.5kg
[13:39:37] <StarStream> http://angelicorexx.deviantart.com/art/Virgoo-Turbocharger-541072682
[13:39:55] <StarStream> and that controller cost me 250 usd
[13:40:15] <Electron> oh my, that's expensive
[13:40:43] <StarStream> next month i may get this http://www.gamo2.com/en/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=249
[13:40:51] <StarStream> that one is basically 9.7kg
[13:41:13] <Electron> the weight is getting bigger and bigger
[13:41:30] <StarStream> its ok anyway
[13:41:35] <StarStream> some of them u put on surface
[13:41:49] <StarStream> as i said 
[13:41:53] <StarStream> long term investment
[13:42:41] <StarStream> i cant wait to get it tho 
[13:43:26] <Electron> what will you play with it to?
[13:43:38] <StarStream> rhythm game bro 
[13:43:52] <StarStream> by konami 
[13:43:56] <Electron> I had a guess about that :)
[13:44:01] <StarStream> yup 
[13:44:13] <Electron> to press buttons in time
[13:44:26] <StarStream> i oredi somewhat get back the money worth in the current controller that i have
[13:44:26] <Electron> according to the music
[13:44:31] <StarStream> yup 
[13:45:06] <StarStream> some of them are easy to play but hard to master
[13:45:17] <StarStream> some take months other take years
[13:45:51] <StarStream> and also benefit of owning these is self maintenance
[13:46:10] <StarStream> u can buy parts and self repair and one of them is spring 
[13:46:20] <StarStream> another is the switch and the microswitch 
[13:46:29] <Electron> here we have spring 
[13:46:31] <Electron> :P
[13:46:42] <StarStream> the spring they use is very specific 
[13:46:50] <StarStream> the one i am gonna get is 100g 
[13:47:53] <StarStream> oh btw.. the game is also on ps2
[13:49:43] <Electron> I played ps1 like 10 years ago
[13:52:21] <StarStream> ok 
[13:56:18] <StarStream> still tho theres many great game there 
[13:56:22] <StarStream> unlike the newer gen 
[14:05:27] <StarStream> so anyway el how long does the other loan take?
[14:06:13] <Electron> I pay it monthly as I should
[14:08:00] <StarStream> i know 
[14:08:05] <StarStream> but how many months left ?
[14:08:39] <Electron> oh, that
[14:08:51] <Electron> about half a year
[14:11:45] <StarStream> ah ok 
[14:11:48] <StarStream> good luck then 
[14:11:55] <StarStream> what is that loan anyway?
[14:11:58] <StarStream> car loan ?
[14:13:54] <Electron> nope
[14:14:27] <Electron> it was used to develop business
[14:14:53] <StarStream> ok
[14:15:18] <Electron> win10 will be released on the 29th of July
[14:15:25] <StarStream> yup
[14:15:28] <Electron> "just the same Windows only better"
[14:15:33] <Electron> :D
[14:17:31] <Electron> purple horse is smart
[14:17:44] <StarStream> ?
[14:17:58] <Electron> what is the meaning of smart?
