[22:19:19] <Electron> You are late today, JockeTF.
[22:19:38] <JockeTF> Electron: Huh? I've been here all day. :P
[22:20:06] <Electron> I mean it's late and you are still here.
[22:20:13] <JockeTF> Electron: Preparing for the destruction of my bathroom/bedroom door. :P
[22:20:23] <JockeTF> Err
[22:20:24] <JockeTF> *wall
[22:20:26] <JockeTF> Not door.
[22:20:43] <Electron> Cool.
[22:20:54] <Electron> Who will do it?
[22:21:06] <JockeTF> Electron: My landlord. For a very uncool reason.
[22:21:24] <Electron> Um...
[22:21:34] <Electron> Bad color?
[22:21:38] <JockeTF> Electron: http://jocketf.se/files/.mold/IMG_20160114_095148.jpg
[22:21:53] <JockeTF> Electron: No, a pipe has been leaking inside of the wall.
[22:22:07] <JockeTF> Causing water damage.
[22:22:13] <Electron> Mmm, that's nasty.
[22:22:29] <Electron> I had the same problem, actually.
[22:22:32] <JockeTF> So, my closet filled up with mold.
[22:22:56] <JockeTF> Which happened to contain all my clothing amongst other things.
[22:23:22] <Electron> There are special bags for clothing.
[22:23:45] <Electron> Big ones with zippers.
[22:23:56] <JockeTF> Yeah, well. Now I'm washing them with a pre-wash of vinegar essence (ättika).
[22:24:11] <JockeTF> Then I'll pack it away in boxes.
[22:24:12] <Electron> What's ättika?
[22:25:02] <Electron> Sweden name of a washing powder?
[22:25:07] <JockeTF> Electron: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar#Distilled
[22:26:31] <Electron> White vinegar, yup.
[22:26:55] <JockeTF> It kills things. :D
[22:28:03] <JockeTF> I use this one: http://i.imgur.com/eJv0jQg.jpg
[22:30:24] <JockeTF> Either way, I'll be living with my parents for a few weeks. Need to be careful not to get my clothes and ponies all dusty before that.
[22:30:54] <JockeTF> Pack them down for the construction work.
[22:31:23] <JockeTF> Lots of work. :P
[22:32:02] <JockeTF> Also doctors appointments since I've pretty much been living in moldy apartments for the last seven years.
[22:43:30] <Electron> :O
[22:43:44] <Electron> That damn mold.
[22:45:15] <JockeTF> Yeah, I found out that the previous apartment I lived in for five years had to have both batrooms completely redone after I moved out.
[22:45:28] <JockeTF> Could explain a lot of the health issues I've had recently. :P
[22:46:37] <JockeTF> (Recently as in ~3 years back until now.)
[22:47:27] <JockeTF> It's knowing where those might have come from.
