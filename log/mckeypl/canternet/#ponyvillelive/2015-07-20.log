[10:12:19] <StarStream> the largest one
[10:18:18] <StarStream> anyway u got something u wanna ask the ponies ?
[10:20:10] <Electron> I wanna ask Discovery Family â€” When?
[10:21:26] <StarStream> no idea
[10:21:57] <StarStream> anyway i dont mind the wait 
[10:22:09] <StarStream> cause i am full of taking care of ponies
[11:12:05] <StarStream> hmm.. el and jocke not here 
[11:12:26] <Electron> what?
[11:14:38] <StarStream> oh i thought ur busy 
[11:14:48] <StarStream> i mean not here 
[11:14:59] <Electron> well kinda
[11:15:05] <Electron> depends on clients
[11:15:15] <StarStream> what job are u again ?
[11:15:35] <Electron> sew and sell medical clothes
[11:15:44] <StarStream> wait u do sewing ?
[11:15:50] <Electron> eeyup
[11:15:58] <StarStream> teach me senpai!!! 
[11:16:15] <StarStream> wait el so ur a male doing sewing ? 
[11:16:32] <Electron> um... you mean sewing machine, right?
[11:16:37] <Electron> yes
[11:16:58] <StarStream> well sewing in general 
[11:17:04] <StarStream> plus maybe with sewing machine also 
[11:17:33] <StarStream> cause yea being a plushophile without sewing knowledge basically look like an idiot
[11:17:34] <Electron> well, for sewing you need sewing machine obviously :)
[11:18:00] <Electron> overstitching mschine too actually
[11:18:37] <StarStream> wat about just basic stitching ?
[11:19:08] <Electron> what do you want to sew in the first place?
[11:19:51] <StarStream> basicayly plush maintenance 
[11:20:04] <StarStream> like closing stitch and what not 
[11:20:10] <StarStream> basically*
[11:20:45] <Electron> what's so hard about that? you need the same color threads and a needle
[11:20:53] <StarStream> yea
[11:21:00] <StarStream> but well it tend to become ugly
[11:21:08] <StarStream> terrible in ladder stitching 
[11:21:14] <StarStream> need a way to practice tho 
[11:21:19] <Electron> thimble will be helpful too
[11:21:57] <StarStream> ok
[11:22:39] <Electron> if the plushie allows it you can place a usual bulb inside of it and stitch on its surface
[11:23:09] <StarStream> bulb ?
[11:23:21] <Electron> yeah, electrical bulb
[11:23:42] <StarStream> huh 
[11:23:51] <StarStream> how big are u talking about the bulb ?
[11:24:01] <StarStream> cause the maintenance is basically a build a bear plush 
[11:24:14] <StarStream> well anyway the trouble of my stitch is basically doing an inside stitching 
[11:24:23] <Electron> make sure to tension clothes over bulb to avoid wrinlkes
[11:25:36] <StarStream> huh 
[11:27:56] <Electron> a patch is good too
[11:28:28] <StarStream> ok
[11:28:52] <StarStream> well technically build a bear has a hole in the back if u buy it unstuffed
[11:29:15] <StarStream> in which then once done they stitch that one up 
[11:29:33] <StarStream> but thing is if wanna do maintenance like washing and what not basically have to tear of that stitch 
[11:30:01] <Electron> oh
[11:30:28] <StarStream> yea just to do stuffing and unstuffing
[11:31:22] <Electron> you may sew a plastic zip-fastener on the inside of the plushie
[11:32:02] <Electron> maybe it could help to easy things a bit
[11:32:16] <StarStream> true
[11:32:30] <StarStream> but i do worry about it tho cause u still need to stitch it 
[11:32:35] <StarStream> to hold the zip in place
[11:32:44] <StarStream> and not sure what kind of stitch is the best
[11:33:12] <StarStream> not to mention blind stitching 
[11:35:29] <Electron> the main thing is do not hurry
[11:35:36] <Electron> do the work carefully
[11:35:42] <StarStream> yea
[11:35:47] <StarStream> i need to learn how to be more patient
[11:36:03] <Electron> is it a problem?
[11:36:11] <StarStream> in a sense somewhat
[11:36:16] <StarStream> i do tend to get impatient
[11:36:19] <StarStream> if i got bored
[11:37:07] <Electron> I guess I have this issue too  ( ._.)
[11:37:20] <StarStream> dang man 
[11:37:24] <StarStream> yea its a problem 
[11:37:52] <StarStream> i really wanna fix this and do a legit sewing so in the end they dont complain about me doing a shitty job
