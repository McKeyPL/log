[21:47:43] <TheFlutterGuy> how you doin?

[21:48:06] <Electron> And you?
[21:48:17] <TheFlutterGuy> *meh*
[21:48:25] <Electron> What's wrong?
[21:50:35] <TheFlutterGuy> Lunia been suffering from Crohns for the last week
[21:50:39] <TheFlutterGuy> not been easy on her
[21:51:49] <Electron> Damn it...
[21:52:07] <Electron> The world strikes again.
[21:52:38] <TheFlutterGuy> had nearly a months of normalcy(ish). but then it hits again. 
[21:52:47] <TheFlutterGuy> Still, doing better than it has since it started 9 months ago.
[21:52:59] <TheFlutterGuy> but this is status quo
[21:53:29] <Electron> I hope she will get well soon.
[21:53:49] <TheFlutterGuy> this is for life, the best we can do is try and manage it.
[21:54:11] <Electron> I'll bake a healing muffin.
