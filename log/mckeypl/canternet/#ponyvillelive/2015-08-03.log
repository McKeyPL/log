[20:33:44] <Electron> when did it come out?
[20:40:40] <MirSar> Whoa... that must have happened sometime the past 3 hrs
[20:40:54] <MirSar> it was not like that 3 hrs ago
[20:41:11] <Electron> well yeah
[20:41:16] <Electron> that's why I'm asking :)
[20:41:35] <Electron> I was taking a nap and then discover this

[20:41:56] <Electron> me too for now
[20:42:07] <Electron> let's see how it will behave in the future
[20:42:48] <MirSar> heh, we all know how Youtube's updates can be horrible xD
[20:42:57] <Electron> it's like, went home with old version and woke up with the new one
[20:43:06] <Electron> true dat
[20:43:20] <Electron> I remember that moment with comment system
[20:43:37] <Electron> with airing Google Circles or something
[20:44:00] <Electron> they connected their comments and everything went wrong

[20:45:14] <Electron> can't say what was home page like or suscriptions
[20:45:53] <MirSar> Before you got all video uploads from everyone you subscribed to on one page, instad of like now, where you have to navigate to their page, click videos and make sure you sort by date released..
[20:46:39] <Electron> mm, now I get it
[20:46:45] <MirSar> now, a simmular page, shows all activity of all subscribers.. liked videos, comments, video upleads and stuff
[20:46:52] <Electron> all videos in one place sounds better
[20:47:53] <Electron> by the way
[20:48:07] <MirSar> lol, I checked a bit and it looks like they've updated that too (or I've not been checking)
[20:48:25] <Electron> our local brony ru communty site has crashed tonight
[20:48:28] <MirSar> You can select All activity or Just uploads
[20:48:42] <Electron> someone broke it and had access to it for like 2 hours

[20:49:47] <Electron> everything is offline
[20:51:08] <Electron> when is will be up no one can tell
[20:51:35] <Electron> I wonder if my page would survive it
[20:51:54] <MirSar> Depends on how much damage was done and if they have backup
[20:52:48] <Electron> should I change my connected e-mail password?
