[00:07:03] *** Creeps|AFK is now known as RedHelper
[00:22:42] <Sakura> Look at the ducks, Electron. :3
[00:23:24] <Electron> they are elegant, Sakura
[00:24:11] * Sakura chases the ducks with Electron handcuffed to her & they start pecking at us
[00:24:40] * Electron gasps :O
[00:25:43] * Electron throws bread crisps at ducks to calm them down
[00:32:25] <Brat_B_2094> Yes, its super effective!
[00:40:30] <Sakura> I"m so glad they kept the show crew onboard for the movie.
[00:50:46] <Electron> that's nice indeed
[00:53:01] *** Quits: Lunia (ellen@ChumPony.Enterprises) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[00:53:08] *** Joins: Lunia (ellen@ChumPony.Enterprises)
[01:17:22] <Electron> I really disliked splitting up of this season though
[01:17:46] <Electron> we have been waiting for almost a yeah
[01:17:52] <Electron> and now this
[01:18:39] <MirSar> I'm glad I've been waiting patiently 
[01:18:57] <Electron> and the worst part of it that they didn't say the day when the season will resume :(
[01:19:03] <Electron> are they mocking us?
[01:19:39] <Electron> oh my god, it's MirSar himself!
[01:19:43] * Electron faints
[01:20:00] * MirSar 's been lurking in the shadows 
[01:21:43] * MirSar boops Electron
[01:21:49] <MirSar> How's stuff and shit?
[01:25:59] <Sakura> Are they trying to kill the fandom?
[01:26:22] <MirSar> or are they creating an intense suspence?
[01:34:55] <Electron> it's okay for the summer, I guess, MirSar
[01:35:15] <Electron> I got order at my first job
[01:35:54] <Electron> and we finished equipping a big storage too today
[01:35:59] <Electron> at my second job
[01:36:18] <Electron> so I got some money :3
[01:37:27] <Electron> on the other hoof, the currency exchange rate is rising every day
[01:37:36] <Electron> and our country depends on it greatly
[01:37:47] <Electron> so the prices will jump up again soon
[01:38:10] <Sakura> Guys, SUMMER IS OVERS1 :'(
[01:38:13] * Sakura cries
[01:38:28] <Electron> yeah, finally it's coming to an end
[01:38:32] <Sakura> They are pushing pumpkin spiced everything again.
[01:38:54] <Electron> I hope summer stagnation will move away
[01:39:07] <JockeTF> Sakura: Summer is just starting here. At least when it comes to the weather. :D
[01:39:31] <JockeTF> ... Maybe I'll take my vacation soon.
[01:39:53] <Electron> oh my god, what alpacas I see
[01:40:02] * Electron is looking at JockeTF
[01:40:11] <JockeTF> I like alpacas.
[01:40:23] <Electron> um... I like ponies
[01:40:28] <JockeTF> Me too.
[01:40:40] <Electron> how about your stuff and shit, MirSar :D
[01:41:03] <Electron> have you launched your site, JockeTF?
[01:41:33] <MirSar> I've been dealing with my entire family breaking upp
[01:41:36] <MirSar> Funn times!
[01:41:52] <Electron> oh... um...
[01:42:06] <Electron> is it bad thing for you? or kinda okay?
[01:42:17] <MirSar> Well, I'm buying the house, so everything is not just bad :P
[01:42:27] <Electron> sounds great
[01:42:30] <MirSar> (yes, I'm serious)
[01:42:37] <Electron> wish you all the success with that
[01:42:58] <Electron> I remember you were saying that
[01:43:11] <MirSar> Gonna be another few months of shit, but hopefully it wil calm down a little
[01:43:15] <Electron> so it's not that surprising for me
[01:43:53] * MirSar hugs Electron "it's just life, it's ment to be hard at times" ^^
[01:43:57] <Electron> don't you worry, everything will turn out well
[01:44:09] <Electron> hugtiem!
[01:44:22] * Electron embraces MirSar
[01:44:37] <JockeTF> Electron: The company has opened it up to the public. Not the site though, just the smartpone applications.

[01:45:08] <Electron> are you coding it yet, JockeTF?
[01:45:40] <JockeTF> Electron: Been for a year now. Much server administration too though.
[01:46:01] <Not-534> Tune in to Social Night in 15 minutes on @TVBrony! - http://pvlive.me/bronytv
[01:46:23] <Electron> software upgrades, configuering and such, JockeTF?

[01:47:15] <JockeTF> Electron: Yeah, via Ansible. We're running it on several machines, after all. :)
[01:48:00] <Not-534> Tune in to Sugar cube corner in 15 minutes on @mlp_la! - http://pvlive.me/bronies_radio_la
[01:48:09] <JockeTF> I take care of development tools and stuff like that too.
[01:48:20] * Electron googles what Ansible is
[01:48:24] <JockeTF> So I'm a paca of many trades in the company.
[01:49:06] <Electron> it's a tool for automatic configuring all machines at once I guess
[01:50:08] <JockeTF> Not really automatic, you need to write the rules. But yes. :P
[01:50:56] <Electron> I remember there are similar progs around
[01:51:07] <Electron> for Win7
[01:51:08] <MirSar> JockeTF: Group Policy for Windows clients in domain, kinda thing?
[01:52:30] <JockeTF> MirSar: The development tools? Just Git, Syncthing and Redmine at the moment.
[01:52:49] <JockeTF> There's only one person using Windows in our office. :P
[01:53:26] * MirSar slaps himself
[01:53:26] <MirSar> Ohh, right, a "coding together" tool thingie
[01:53:33] <JockeTF> Yeah.
[01:53:40] <MirSar> *badly explained*
[01:54:03] <Electron> one screen, many cursors
[01:54:06] <Electron> :Ь
[01:54:50] <MirSar> Electron:  more like google docs, where multiple people can write code at once
[01:54:53] * Electron imagines coders fighting for the line prioritizes
[01:55:46] <Electron> "don't use my var, it's mine" lol
[01:56:28] <MirSar> well, a program can consist of 1-999999999999~ diffrent "files", so it's not that hard to deligate :P
[01:56:30] <Electron> "what jerk changed global directive?" hehe
[01:56:35] <JockeTF> Electron: Not a problem. You just merge and then it's fine. :P
[01:57:48] <Electron> like layers in vector picture, then you can combine them together, MirSar?
[01:58:28] <MirSar> uhm.....well....uhm... hmmmmmm.. that's actually a good way of explaining it :P
[01:59:56] <Electron> okay then
[02:01:10] <Electron> how do you think, will there be big bronycons next or two years later, MirSar? I want to go there if I would be able to
[02:01:27] <Electron> at least I'm planning to do it
[02:01:43] <Electron> and hoping
[02:01:56] <JockeTF> Electron: http://nvie.com/img/git-model@2x.png <-- You work in different "lanes" at the same time and "merge" them together every now and then. Git is very smart when it comes to merging. If there are any conflicts they're usually pretty easy to solve.
[02:02:08] <MirSar> There are stil pokecon's (pokemon), so I kina assume MLP will continue for at least another 3-10 years ^^
[02:02:10] <JockeTF> But while you work no one else is disturbing you.
[02:03:28] <JockeTF> You can work on the same file at the same time, even on the same lines without any issues. :P
[02:03:33] <Electron> never tried it but it looks cool, JockeTF
[02:04:21] <Electron> I'm happy to hear that, MirSar, maybe I could visit one and get some experience
[02:04:25] <JockeTF> Electron: Also, Git will keep a complete history of all changes, so you can go back to or compare any changes since the start of the project. :)
[02:05:02] <Electron> well, logging isn't that innovative thing
[02:05:09] <Electron> I'd say it's must have thing
[02:05:58] * MirSar uses Notepad++ and always overrides when saving
[02:06:05] <MirSar> not the best when scripting..
[02:06:25] <MirSar> trust me, I've lost a lot of code :P
[02:06:27] <Electron> mmm, you like to live dangerously
[02:06:37] * Electron snickers
[02:09:54] <JockeTF> Anyway, time for me to hit the fluff. Nightpaca!
[02:10:26] <Electron> g'night
[02:10:26] <MirSar> nighty JockeTF ^_^
[02:11:45] <Electron> I've been hitting the fluff all evening
[02:12:03] <Electron> and now it's dawn
[02:12:19] <MirSar> Lucky you... 
[02:12:19] * MirSar 've been working 
[02:12:26] *** Quits: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-14s8b6.siw.siwnet.net) (Quit: Leaving.)
[02:12:52] <Electron> hey! I've been working for 12 hours too
[02:13:13] <Electron> was sleeping like a log
[02:13:13] <MirSar> and "hitting the fluff" ?
[02:14:10] <Electron> oh... I thought it means fluff pillow or go to bed
[02:14:13] * Electron derps
[02:14:14] <MirSar> it's EXACTLY what it means...
[02:14:36] <MirSar> you've been finding your pillow andsleeping as worl Electron?
[02:14:38] <Electron> English has like 7 meaning for every word, don't blame me
[02:15:06] <Electron> :D
[02:15:17] * MirSar assumes Electron understands typo's
[02:16:00] * Electron has founded his pillow and been sleeping as work
[02:16:12] * MirSar post random facts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_ciLoN87Pg
[02:16:57] <MirSar> "founded" = created/first to create/inventor
[02:17:16] <MirSar> you created pillows?
[02:17:57] <Electron> damn :D
[02:18:07] <Electron> *found
[02:18:22] <Electron> let's see the link of yours
[02:19:15] * MirSar waits 10 min
[02:20:38] * Sakura is still depressed summer is over
[02:21:37] * MirSar hugs Sakura "it'll just be another ~300 days until the next one"
[02:21:48] * Electron gives Sakura cheering-up muffin
[02:22:16] <Sakura> I'm not looking forward to Pumpkin SPice obsessions
[02:22:55] <Sakura> Well, let's see what autumn has in store for me...
[02:24:19] <Electron> Pumpkin Spice?
[02:25:50] <Electron> "you can't feel pain by your brain" alright
[02:27:02] <MirSar> it's true Electron http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jun/04/man-plays-guitar-conscious-brain-surgery-video
[02:27:22] <MirSar> he play's a guitar while people are messing with his brain
[02:27:38] <MirSar> (SFW)
[02:28:58] <Electron> wow
[02:29:02] <Electron> dude, that's creepy
[02:30:24] <Electron> "pregnancy changes women's brain" alright
[02:31:11] <MirSar> that's kinda obvious :P
[02:31:20] <MirSar> She's becoming a mother
[02:32:06] <MirSar> (the father's brain also changes, though not as much as th female has to go though the pain of delivering, therefor becoming more protective due to pain)
[02:32:22] <Electron> "brain's creativity is higher when it's tired" all my yeses to this
[02:32:56] <MirSar> Warning - But not too tired
[02:33:07] <MirSar> then you just fall asleep :P
[02:34:11] <Electron> "women's brain is more efficient" alright
[02:34:39] <MirSar> more efficient, but not more logical :P
[02:37:33] <Electron> "yawing is not only forcing you to breathe, but to cool your brain" .....wut?
[02:38:07] <MirSar> the most facinating thing (i find) is that you think diffrently on wich nostral on your nose you breath through
[02:39:06] <MirSar> Logical on right, creative on left (or oppositr, don't remember in the speed)
[02:39:29] <Electron> :D
[02:39:33] <Electron> that's so weird
[02:41:55] <MirSar> it is, but there are enough articles on the subject to make it beleavable/trouth
[02:43:24] <Electron> so, if my right nostril is always blocked
[02:43:36] <Electron> then I'm pretty one-sided?

[02:45:47] <MirSar> well, kinda, but also kinda not. logical means you can easily draw a line from A-Z and imagine what B-Y is
[02:46:18] <MirSar> *badly explained* .....
[02:47:05] <Electron> the question is how strong is the change
[02:47:25] <MirSar> true! (and I have no idea) :P
[02:48:29] <Electron> open left nostril make the brain be more evil, the right is to be kinder
[02:48:38] <Electron> just kidding
[02:55:34] * MirSar promotes Elite Dangerous - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ-4c7Q4JUA
[02:59:58] <Electron> nice graphics
[03:01:34] <MirSar> it's a real nice game, if you can afford it and have time to play, I highly reccomend buing it! ^_^
[03:02:56] <MirSar> search a bit around on Elite Dangerous, and you'll see:3
