[20:23:13] <MirSar_> Long time no see mate! :)
[20:23:20] <Electron> Welcome back, MirSar_. :D
[20:23:29] <Electron> Really welcome.
[20:24:48] <Electron> Do you still watch ponies, MirSar_?
[20:25:13] <MirSar_> I haven't in a while, I gues I got to watch the latest season or so :P
[20:25:30] <MirSar_> Right now I'm watching InuYasha 
[20:25:33] <Electron> That was so nice season.
[20:25:48] <Electron> I advice you to watch it.

[20:27:34] <MirSar_> Dosen't sound like something to smile at :P
[20:27:44] <MirSar_> got a little discord in ya? :D
[20:28:12] <Electron> It's my defensive reaction to the world, don't mind me.
[20:28:25] <Electron> Also, ponies save me.
[20:28:56] <MirSar_> Just giggle at the ghostly ^^ 
[20:29:02] <Electron> Have you finished Fallout 4, MirSar_?
[20:29:14] <MirSar_> Not finished, not nearly xD
[20:29:44] <MirSar_> been messing around too much with settlements, haven't had the time for the quests :P
[20:29:45] <Electron> Oh?
[20:30:05] <MirSar_> or well, I have OFC done some, but I tend to be stuck building
[20:30:16] <Electron> You drive away easily, don't you?
[20:30:35] <MirSar_> and the side quest's does really not help the focus...
[20:30:47] <MirSar_> maybe..... :P
[20:31:21] * ArchPegasusMichael snuggles MirSar_ ^3^
[20:31:29] <MirSar_> HIIIIIII ArchPegasusMichael :D

[20:32:38] <ArchPegasusMichael> Browsing interwebz
[20:32:47] <Electron> I thought you wil not come back here, speaking honestly, MirSar_.

[20:43:23] <ArchPegasusMichael> MirSar_: is winter still not available where you live?
[20:44:55] <MirSar_> The first snow actually settled yesterday, though I don't think it will last until next year..

[20:46:27] <ArchPegasusMichael> Damn sanctions
[20:47:56] <MirSar_> Doesn't really bother me, xmas is over so the snow is just more bothersome than anything now. 
[20:48:53] <MirSar_> Busses, trains, subways, boats, everything buggs out if it snows, and the cold doesn't make it more pleassant waiting for them :P
[20:49:04] <Electron> I got a lot of snow and I like it. :D
[20:50:07] <MirSar_> I like a lot of snow too, but not the slurpy middle ground between much and no snow
[20:50:18] <ArchPegasusMichael> I don't mind winter without winter, but only if summer temperatures don't hold above 28ºC for too long
[20:50:56] <ArchPegasusMichael> And by too long, I mean five days in a row
[20:51:40] <ArchPegasusMichael> My mom barely survived this year's summer
[20:51:59] <MirSar_> heat stroke..? :/
