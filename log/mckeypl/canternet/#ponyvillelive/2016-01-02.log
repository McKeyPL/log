[13:43:09] <StarStream> <StarStream> today i see the new cabinet that my parents bought for me a few days ago without my consultation 
[13:43:09] <StarStream> <StarStream> and the next thing i know is i am not satisfy at all 
[13:44:12] <StarStream> <StarStream> i cant even put my build a bear in it due to small spaces in between racks
[13:44:13] <StarStream> <StarStream> not to mention the rack cant be removed
[13:44:43] <Electron> Aww, shucks.
[13:44:50] <Electron> That's unfortunate.
[14:02:24] <Electron> That feeling when you don't know what to do with your present.
