[13:38:03] <McKey> Ohhh Yeaah :3
[13:50:15] <TheFlutterGuy> ok, that picture is way bigger than what i found
[13:53:21] <JockeTF> TheFlutterGuy, ArchPegasusMichael: You can get to the source for deviantart images by going to fav.me and appending the image id: http://fav.me/d950f9w
[13:54:14] <ArchPegasusMichael> JockeTF: I used reverse search on TFG's earlier link from blogspot
[13:57:18] <TheFlutterGuy> Lunia: when you make a movie, you’d better spend plenty of time to get a good cast. And good casting, that’s what saved ‘Birdemic’ and helped make it a hit movie.
[13:57:41] <Lunia> yes
[13:57:45] <TheFlutterGuy> Despite all its imperfections, ‘Birdemic: Shock and Terror’ became a hit because of good casting. 60% of a good movie, a successful film, is in good casting. That’s what I had with ‘Birdemic’. 
[13:58:12] <Lunia> hi

[14:00:21] <Lunia> they did it Aperture Science way

[14:02:18] <TheFlutterGuy> BD: Your film has been compared to Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘The Birds’, which I actually think is selling it short because in ‘The Birds’ there is not a single exploding eagle, awkward sex scene, or interminable opening shot through a car windshield. So I guess, how do you feel about the comparisons between your film and Alfred Hitchcock’s film?
