[10:11:43] <Reio> all this Ponyville live. My native language isn't English, that's why I also make some mistakes
[10:12:27] <Electron> I'm not Englishman too
[10:15:21] <Reio> When did you find Ponyville live? I found it today.
[10:16:33] <Electron> I found it in October of 2013 or so
[10:17:12] <Electron> I remember when I came here I asked "are there any Europeans or Asians here"
[10:17:38] <Electron> and only a couple of users replied
[10:17:45] <Reio> xD
[10:18:30] <Electron> and the best part of it that they are still here

[10:24:44] <Electron> 	:I

[10:37:37] <ArchPegasusMichael> Reio: lightirc just doesn't show the images of emots for you for some reason
[10:38:40] <ArchPegasusMichael> But the actual symbols are being sent
[10:40:01] <Reio> ok. Emotion box is also empty. I can't even choose what emotion I send
