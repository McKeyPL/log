[13:17:06] <StarStream> well in a sense
[13:18:52] <StarStream> whelp el GG

[13:18:58] <StarStream> https://torrentfreak.com/youtube-faces-russia-web-block-over-pirate-content-150723/
[13:20:03] <MirSar> StarStream, set static DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
[13:20:10] <StarStream> why mir ?
[13:20:20] <MirSar> then you won't be blocked :P
[13:20:24] <StarStream> oh ceh 
[13:20:28] <StarStream> well its not for me 
[13:20:30] <MirSar> they usually only block the DNS :P
[13:20:31] <StarStream> i live in brunei 
[13:20:43] <MirSar> well, for Electron then xD
[13:21:53] <StarStream> k
[13:22:07] <StarStream> well mir do u have ur own server ?
[13:22:21] <MirSar> yeah, mirsar.com
[13:22:25] <StarStream> oh ok 
[13:22:30] <StarStream> well i am using seedbox anyway
[13:22:39] <StarStream> from feral hosting
[13:22:58] <MirSar> ohh, you ment a seedbox, no I don't have that
[13:23:14] <StarStream> oh
[13:23:24] <MirSar> don't have the need since I got my computer+NAS on 24/7/365 anyways
[13:23:41] <StarStream> NAS ?
[13:24:14] <MirSar> A "box" with a lot of storage disks accessable through the network
[13:24:22] <StarStream> ah
[13:24:24] <MirSar> Network Attached Storage
[13:24:29] <MirSar> or something
[13:24:33] <StarStream> thats nice
[13:24:52] <MirSar> yeah, got 8 * 3 TB disks in RAID 5 ^^
[13:24:54] <StarStream> yea i am using feral hosting for seedbox 
[13:24:56] <StarStream> holy
[13:25:07] <StarStream> cause private tracker and such 
[13:25:41] <StarStream> not sure if willing to pay monthly or not for the service
[13:25:59] <MirSar> I feel a seedbox is not worth it, you got to download the stuff from the seedbox anyways, why not just DL directly?
[13:26:13] <StarStream> private tracker is the reason 
[13:26:33] <MirSar> I got like 5 private trackers, it's never been a problem
[13:26:47] <MirSar> IPTorrents, NorBits, TorrentDay and such
[13:26:48] <StarStream> oh wat site ?
[13:26:52] <StarStream> ah 
[13:27:01] <StarStream> well my problem is internet 
[13:27:08] <StarStream> and also well stupidly implement quota
[13:27:13] <StarStream> which is pointless with the terrible internet
[13:27:37] <MirSar> ... you're stil having a quota?
[13:27:50] <MirSar> normally that's only for mobile nettwork
[13:27:55] <StarStream> recently implement it 
[13:28:03] <StarStream> dumb eh 
[13:28:11] <MirSar> extreamely!
[13:28:18] <StarStream> not to mention we never even get the speed that we paid for
[13:28:29] <StarStream> how bad is my internet 
[13:28:31] <StarStream> very simple
[13:28:35] <MirSar> Then I'd get a new ISP if possible
[13:28:37] <StarStream> just basically 3.5mbps
[13:28:48] <StarStream> the isp is operated by government
[13:28:54] <StarStream> and monopoly
[13:29:14] <MirSar> ... then I'd find the closest plain and escape xD
[13:29:21] <StarStream> lol
[13:29:36] <StarStream> thats why i use seedbox
[13:29:48] <StarStream> how much u get btw ?
[13:29:56] <MirSar> ok, then very understandable ^^
[13:30:16] <MirSar> 50 mbit/s / 25 mbit/s
[13:30:25] <StarStream> i used to have iptorrents
[13:30:29] <StarStream> then my account got banned
[13:30:38] <StarStream> for not seeding back and too much download
[13:31:12] <MirSar> early "noob times" when you didn't quite get how private trackers work? :P
[13:31:13] <StarStream> currently my private is jpopsuki , animebytes and sows
[13:31:19] <StarStream> yea
[13:31:25] <StarStream> now is different 
[13:31:30] <StarStream> cause i really wanna keep the tracker
[13:31:48] <MirSar> I got 2 invites, if you'd like one? :)
[13:31:54] <StarStream> well not so much for animebytes
[13:32:03] <StarStream> but yea the other 2 is like really important for me 
[13:32:41] <StarStream> which tracker mir ?
[13:33:19] <MirSar> I got for Torrentday and IPTorrents
[13:33:41] <StarStream> iptorrents got registration nowadays
[13:33:57] <StarStream> wat so special about torrent day ?
[13:34:00] <StarStream> what do they offer ?
[13:34:03] <MirSar> it does? ohh, I didn't realize :P
[13:34:28] <StarStream> yea
[13:34:41] <StarStream> i mean what so special about torrentday ?
[13:34:44] <StarStream> what do they offer ?
[13:34:58] <MirSar> Well, right now most my torrents are from IPTorrents, it's the one I use the most, though the bonus point system sucks there
[13:35:34] <StarStream> ah ok torrentday offer general stuff... 
[13:35:38] <StarStream> nothing important 
[13:35:46] <MirSar> TD got a way better point system so it's way easy just to have 10-20 low cost torrents seeding at all times to get points
[13:36:17] <MirSar> then spend points to highten your upload "credit"
[13:36:37] <StarStream> yea i know 
[13:36:52] <StarStream> well both jpopsuki and animebytes also use that 
[13:37:14] <StarStream> tho animebytes is very broad in terms of how u earn points
[13:37:53] <MirSar> Users are given 0.3 bonus points per torrent per hour.
[13:37:53] <MirSar> 0.3 * 20 = 6 points / hrs
[13:37:53] <MirSar> 1 GB = 75 points - 75/6 = 12,5 days with 20 torrents seeding to get 1 GB extra
[13:38:18] <StarStream> jpopsuki = Bonus points are awarded for seeding completed torrents. Every hour you are awarded 0.075 points for each completed torrent you're seeding.
[13:38:19] <MirSar> I usually have around 40-100
[13:38:33] <StarStream> ah dang
[13:38:46] <StarStream> well for me i didnt even need to do that ... 
[13:39:00] <StarStream> cause yea mostly browsing
[13:39:04] <MirSar> well, you could test Ratiomaster xD
[13:39:06] <StarStream> and not sure what to download
[13:39:11] <StarStream> ratiomaster ?
[13:39:33] <MirSar> it's basicly a tool to cheat upload credit to your private tracker xD
[13:39:39] <StarStream> nah i dont 
[13:39:42] <StarStream> dangerous
[13:39:52] <StarStream> i like my tracker
[13:39:58] <MirSar> not really if you use it silently
[13:40:05] <MirSar> I've been doing it myself :P
[13:40:06] <StarStream> the funny thing is that the jpopsuki is cheating tho 
[13:40:15] <StarStream> in terms of how much my ratio is 
[13:40:41] <MirSar> how's your ratio?
[13:41:01] <StarStream> upload is 24.51gb and download is 606.1mb
[13:41:17] <MirSar> My TD: UP: 1.754 TB DOWN: 618.203 GB
[13:41:23] <StarStream> nice
[13:41:37] <MirSar> been downloading a lot of freeleach stuff too
[13:42:16] <StarStream> yea one of my freeleech stuff is like well..... 12 gb uploaded
[13:42:25] <StarStream> mind u my account is like only 1.5week only
[13:42:46] <MirSar> That's actually pretty good for a fresh account!
[13:43:26] <StarStream> yea
[13:43:35] <StarStream> cause frankly speaking i dont know what to get 
[13:43:46] <StarStream> jpopsuki is all about j music
[13:45:01] <MirSar> As I said, you can have an invite to TD if you want?
[13:45:01] <MirSar> They got movies, tv shows, software, anime, porn, books, games and music
[13:45:16] <StarStream> i know 
[13:45:22] <StarStream> but maybe next time 
[13:45:34] <StarStream> cause well general torrent tho .. 
[13:45:47] <MirSar> Scream out if you change your mind ^^
[13:46:01] <StarStream> yea
[13:46:14] <StarStream> what version of ratiomaster u use ?
[13:50:33] <MirSar> I probbobly got an old version now, but it's 0.42
[13:50:49] <StarStream> oh 
[13:58:00] <StarStream> i feel like wanna try it but yea 
[13:58:01] <StarStream> risky
[14:05:42] <MirSar> StarStream: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2fuapdghztv319s/23-07-2015%2014-03-17.png?dl=0
[14:06:03] <MirSar> Those should be the only things u need to worry about
[14:06:24] <MirSar> upload speed should be realistic, between 1-2000 is normal
[14:06:40] <MirSar> Random value must be rather high compared to upload speed
[14:06:56] <MirSar> make sure you have the torrent downloaded to 100% first
[14:07:01] <StarStream> like how much in terms of high ?
[14:07:08] <MirSar> and set Finished % to 100
[14:07:25] <StarStream> do they detect seedbox ?
[14:07:56] <MirSar> if speed is 1000 and random is 1-200 it will randomply select a new value between 1000-1200
[14:08:02] <MirSar> every few secound
[14:08:29] <StarStream> i think i will do 500kbps then for upload
[14:08:35] <MirSar> they don't care if it's a seedbox
[14:08:42] <StarStream> yea i think i might wanna spoof it for one tracker
[14:08:59] <MirSar> you can't spoof using this method..
[14:09:21] <MirSar> it will use your unique ID in the torrent file to give you upload credit
[14:09:42] <MirSar> (henche why not to give out torrent files from a private tracker)
[14:09:44] <StarStream> u mean the seedbox spoof ?
[14:09:49] <StarStream> ah 
[14:10:03] <StarStream> yea the hash right ?
[14:10:09] <MirSar> yeah
[14:10:56] <StarStream> btw wanna see animebytes point system ?
[14:11:08] <MirSar> is it diffrent?
[14:11:16] <StarStream> its very broad
[14:11:25] <StarStream> in terms of what u can exchange
[14:11:32] <StarStream> heck u can even give urself personal freeleech 
[14:11:48] <MirSar> Cool, screenshot might be easiest?
[14:12:47] <StarStream> http://i.imgur.com/CHRlGEo.png
[14:13:00] <StarStream> their point system is yen
[14:13:37] <MirSar> wait, you can sell upload credit and then buy it back?
[14:13:47] <MirSar> what's the point of selling upload credit?
[14:13:54] <TheFlutterGuy> http://m.imgur.com/kuS38S1

[14:14:26] <StarStream> wat u mean by sell uppload credit ?
[14:14:31] <StarStream> upload*
[14:14:56] <StarStream> well u basically use the yen to buy the upload credit
[14:15:05] <StarStream> oh wait now i notice
[14:15:17] <StarStream> yea in a sense those who have tons of upload credit can use to trade for money
