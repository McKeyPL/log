[12:55:23] <TheFlutterGuy> dang it is hard to keep up iwth all the pony.
[12:55:35] <TheFlutterGuy> must have been so much harder in the beginning than now though.
[12:58:17] <Electron> I know, right? I once had ~70 motd missed.
[12:58:27] <Electron> But I managed.
[12:58:51] <TheFlutterGuy> so what did you do? skip them, or catch up?
[12:59:20] <TheFlutterGuy> within the last 2 weeks i've been at 300 or 400 unread pony items
[12:59:48] <Electron> I caught up.
[13:01:04] <TheFlutterGuy> good :D
[13:28:19] <ArchPegasusMichael> I had a huge gap in browsing pony content after my pc died 3 years ago
[13:29:04] <ArchPegasusMichael> Tried to catch up, and kinda did
[13:30:18] <ArchPegasusMichael> But some time later I just stopped caring, it was too much :I
[13:30:51] <TheFlutterGuy> *gasP*
