[07:58:18] <Electron> hi guys
[08:15:58] <JockeTF> Hellopaca!
[08:16:41] * Electron spins JockeTF
[08:17:05] <Electron> whatcha doing in this grey morning?
[08:17:21] <JockeTF> Electron: Staring at server load graphs. :P
[08:17:35] <Electron> oh...
[08:17:43] <Electron> sounds not so fun
[08:18:52] <JockeTF> Actually, it is. We're going to (hopefully) get our first real load. :P
[08:19:54] <Electron> it is?
[08:19:59] <Electron> that's odd
[08:20:25] <Electron> what are you loading there?
[08:20:40] <JockeTF> Well, users.
[08:21:07] <JockeTF> Our system will be used at a sports event at a school.
[08:21:37] <JockeTF> I want to see that CPU usage graph go up for once. :P
[08:22:10] <Electron> sport with using server? :)
[08:22:38] <Electron> well, I don't know your whole system though
[08:25:27] <JockeTF> Either way, I don't have to stare that hard on the graph considering I have notifications for high CPU load. I'll do other things inbetween glancing at the graphs and looking at the log.
[08:26:49] <Electron> why do you work on Saturday?
[08:26:59] <Lunia> hello
[08:28:03] <JockeTF> Electron: Because the event is today. :)
[08:28:05] <Electron> helllo
[08:28:29] <JockeTF> Also, I'm responsible for keeping the system running. :P
[08:28:35] <Electron> so on other Saturdays you won't work?
[08:28:41] <JockeTF> Correct.
[08:29:01] <JockeTF> I'll be having a five-week vacation soon too.
[08:29:09] <JockeTF> Just one week left of work.
[08:31:25] <JockeTF> Also, there's no need for me to be at the office today.
[08:31:32] <JockeTF> So it's not much of an effort working today. :P
[08:31:38] <Electron> oh, you chose autumn vacation
[08:31:51] <JockeTF> Yeah.
[11:12:55] <StarStream> hmm
[12:24:51] <JockeTF> Well, it seems we didn't get any load at all. Oh well.
[12:25:47] <Electron> that happens
[12:39:45] <Electron> do you know what Raspberry Pi is, JockeTF?
[12:40:00] <JockeTF> Electron: Yes, I have a Model B.
[12:40:10] <Electron> what for?
[12:40:12] <JockeTF> Old version.
[12:40:14] <JockeTF> Nothing. :P
[12:40:18] <Electron> :)
[12:40:24] <JockeTF> Got it for Christmas.
[12:40:32] <JockeTF> Haven't used it much.
[12:40:40] <Electron> it has all modern connectors, right?
[12:41:34] <Electron> I mean ports and plugs
[12:41:48] <JockeTF> It has a mix of modern ports such as USB, and then many simple on the board itself.
[12:42:30] <JockeTF> https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/ <-- Model 2.
[12:43:22] <Electron> where it could be used?
[12:43:34] <Electron> or rather for what?
[12:45:29] <JockeTF> For anything really. Console emulators, smart home stuff, own electronics projects, media centers, etc.
[12:46:05] <JockeTF> Anything you can do with a "regular computer", except you don't have the same performance.
[12:46:55] <Electron> can I use it for sound recording?
[12:46:56] <JockeTF> (It does not have an x86 CPU though, so don't expect it to run PC applications unless they have support for ARM CPUs.)
[12:47:05] <Electron> oh wait, there is no sound card
[12:47:13] <JockeTF> There is.
[12:47:30] <JockeTF> No standard input ports though.
[12:47:35] <Electron> I mean good one
[12:47:49] <JockeTF> You could always use a USB soundcard. :)
[12:48:22] <Electron> I have PCI one
[12:48:33] <JockeTF> http://www.hifiberry.com/
[12:49:05] <Electron> heh
[12:49:26] <JockeTF> Looks like output only though.
[12:51:05] <JockeTF> Raspberry Pi is very popular though, so I'd be surprised if there was nothing for sound input.
[12:51:18] <Dusk> I'd only suggest getting a pi if you're ready to handle the fact that not everything has arm support
[12:52:23] <Dusk> the rpi wouldn't be all that desirable for sound recording as it has enough issues with video
[12:52:34] <Dusk> at least in the older rendition
[12:52:55] <Dusk> I don't know how well the newer quad core one holds up, but the original rpi wasn't very good for anything media related.
[12:52:58] <Electron> aww :(
[12:53:34] <JockeTF> The newer one is much better when it comes to everything. I haven't tried it myself but a friend has one. :P
[12:53:40] <Electron> I hoped it could solve my static white noise issue
[12:53:41] <Dusk> It is better yes
[12:53:47] <Electron> but nope
[12:54:15] <Dusk> And no Electron you're probably looking at something a bit beefier than a rpi
[12:54:47] <Electron> yeah, I got that

[13:32:41] <StarStream> ponies?
[13:33:18] <StarStream> oh raspberry pi 
[13:33:23] <StarStream> its basically a portable pc 
[13:33:29] <StarStream> used to basically anything 
[13:34:34] <Dusk> No
[13:34:54] <Dusk> It's a small computing device used for DIY projects
[13:35:16] <Dusk> It's not really all that portable (as it's not really meant to be in use on the go)
[13:35:27] <Dusk> Very useful for projects!
[13:35:29] <StarStream> ok
[13:35:35] <StarStream> yea i kind of wanna get one 
[13:35:47] <StarStream> either pi or arduino 
[13:35:53] <Dusk> mmm
[13:36:09] <Dusk> My one annoyance with the pi is arm is so bleh with support of applications that I use
[13:36:24] <Dusk> It's why I made sure to get a phone with x68_64 instead of arm
[13:36:34] <Dusk> x86*
[13:38:15] <StarStream> ah 
[13:43:50] <StarStream> well for me arduino is used for the arcade thingy
