[09:10:16] <MirSar> T- 8 hrs 50 minutes ＼(≧▽≦)／
[09:11:52] <StarStream> nice
[09:12:01] <StarStream> frankly speaking idk if i should get fallout 4
[09:12:06] <StarStream> how big does the game take ?
[09:12:22] <MirSar> I'll check
[09:12:41] <MirSar> just got to remote home first :P
[09:13:22] <StarStream> what program do u use for the remote ?
[09:14:13] <MirSar> TeamViewer and RDP for server
[09:14:25] <MirSar> It's around 31 GB
[09:14:35] <MirSar> that is with a few mods
[09:14:41] <StarStream> dang
[09:14:44] <StarStream> cant get it then 
[09:14:51] <MirSar> also a graphics mod wich might be around 4 GB
[09:15:14] <MirSar> ohh, low disk space?
[09:16:13] <StarStream> i only have 26.5 gb worth of free space for one of my drive
[09:16:26] <StarStream> that is the D drive for games
[09:16:35] <StarStream> my other drive only 18.3gb left
[09:16:48] <MirSar> uninstall 1 game you don't really play anymore
[09:17:07] <StarStream> my rhythm games took up 128 gb of my D drive 
[09:17:11] <MirSar> You can always download it back with Steam
[09:17:21] <StarStream> true
[09:18:33] <MirSar> I'd say Fallout is well worth it, but be aware that it requires quite much from the machine to runn smooth
[09:19:14] <MirSar> I still have some lagg issues in the main City where there are a lot to render
[09:25:52] <Electron> Good afternoon, folks.
[09:26:03] <Lunia> hihi
[09:26:12] <Electron> And congrants on NY's eve.
[09:26:15] <Electron> Wheeee~
[09:26:25] <StarStream> ok
[09:26:37] * Electron raises his hooves in the air awkwardly
[09:28:10] <StarStream> hmm... bored
[09:29:36] <StarStream> what graphic setting ur pc run at ? 
[09:30:15] <MirSar> Ultra with antianalizing and shadows turned down a little
[09:30:23] <StarStream> dang
[09:30:37] <StarStream> at most i know i can only run at very low 
[09:30:44] <StarStream> because i am playing on my lappie 
[09:31:57] <StarStream> but yea i wanna trying out the mods is one reason why i am feeling of wanting to play the game
[09:32:36] <StarStream> not sure if the price is worth it now or should just wait longer
[09:33:07] <Electron> Fallout 4 is best Call of Duty.
[09:33:12] <StarStream> true
[09:33:19] <StarStream> a lot of killing now rather than roleplaying
[09:33:27] <MirSar> If you're waiting the the price to dropp segnificantly, you probbobly have to wait until the summer sale
[09:33:34] <StarStream> yea
[09:35:35] <StarStream> so mir u use nexus mods ? 
[09:35:52] <MirSar> yeah
[09:36:28] <StarStream> huh ok 
[09:36:44] <StarStream> i am also waiting to wanna play the darius burst chronicles saviour
[09:41:21] <MirSar> the longer you look, the better it gets xD https://xkcd.com/1116/
[09:41:39] <StarStream> ?
[09:41:56] <StarStream> i dont get it 
[09:42:09] <MirSar> it's a gif, wait for it
[09:42:20] <StarStream> lol
