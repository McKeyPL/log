[10:22:28] <Electron> have you ever had a dream with ponies, JockeTF?
[10:22:44] <JockeTF> Electron: Yes. :P
[10:22:54] <Electron> what was it about?
[10:26:25] <JockeTF> All sorts of things. I've had a few, but I don't really remember them too well. Usually there were just ponies sometimes in my regular dreams.
[10:26:59] <JockeTF> As if it's completely normal that part of the population are ponies.
[10:27:02] <Electron> but I thought you would tell me the details :(
[10:27:11] <JockeTF> I do remember Pinkie singing once.
[10:28:07] <Electron> so your dreams had no plots
[10:28:12] <Electron> I mean
[10:28:18] <JockeTF> Electron: Also, I have a Fluttershy figurine signed by Lauren Faust now. :D
[10:28:20] <Electron> the script
[10:28:23] <JockeTF> Electron: They do. :)
[10:28:37] <JockeTF> But it wasn't really related to ponies.
[10:28:39] <Electron> :)
[10:29:35] <Electron> your dreams have humans 
[10:29:44] <Electron> and ponies may appear from nowhere
