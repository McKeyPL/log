[13:46:38] * Lunia takes a lot of baloons and rubs each of them against the wraping. Then stucks them to the gift via accumulated static energy
[13:46:55] <Lunia> I made art C:
[13:53:38] <El> You are an artist, Lunia.

[14:01:38] <El> Well, I presented you a wrapped gift.
[14:01:49] <El> Will you unwrap it?
[14:02:50] <Lunia> and I made this single accumulation of curiosity and uncertainity into something more
[14:03:02] <El> To look what's inside.
[14:03:13] <Lunia> Why should I destroy it? Who am I to commit such a crime?
[14:03:36] <El> You are an artist.
