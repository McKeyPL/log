[08:59:55] <Electron> hello my little Sugarcubes
[09:00:01] <Electron> how are you doing?
[09:03:45] <Lunia> Im doing fabulous, how are you my dear dear friend in this fine day? :3
[09:04:14] <Electron> oh :3
[09:04:25] <Electron> I'm glad you are fabulous
[09:05:24] <Electron> I'm okay, I guess
[09:06:07] <Lunia>  ^3^
[09:13:09] <Lunia> Electron: https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/12049225_10207362072030923_8358409831292816765_n.jpg?oh=61e3f799b6da426f75ba49d6b355e75d&oe=56A624AF
[09:15:11] <Electron> I had a barbecue on weekend
[09:16:20] <Lunia> Awesome :D What was on the grill? :3
[09:16:44] <Electron> when I was eating it I was thinking about 
[09:16:51] <Electron> er... animals
[09:17:12] <Lunia> why animals?
[09:17:32] <Electron> or "meat bearers"
[09:17:53] <Lunia> animeals
[09:19:25] <Electron> I had spiced pork on a grill
[09:19:54] <Electron> also, I was thinking, could I destinguish meat if it wasn't pork?
[09:20:06] <Lunia> sweet :3 last week I was in sweeden and we did bbq as well. 
[09:20:20] <Electron> oh, cool :)
[09:20:23] <Lunia> Beef tastes diffrent then pork
[09:20:49] <Electron> I can differ beef and pork, that's right
[09:20:56] <Electron> but else?
[09:21:05] <Lunia> chicken?
[09:21:29] <Lunia> its lighter then pork or beef
[09:22:27] <Electron> that too
[09:22:35] <Lunia> fish?
[09:22:53] <Electron> is fish meat?
[09:23:06] <Lunia> why wouldnt it be meat?
[09:23:19] <Electron> okay, let it be meat too
[09:23:44] <Lunia> what else there is? Human ? Horse?
[09:24:09] <Electron> well, yeah... :|
[09:24:41] <Lunia> human meat has to be well done or salted and dried. Serve cut in small stripes
[09:25:20] * Lunia read article about famous cannibals some years ago
[09:25:25] <Electron> would it be different depending on skin color?
[09:26:24] <Lunia> I dont think level of melanine matters. People from china would propably taste diffrent then europeans or africans. Like with normal herding animals. 
[09:26:33] <Lunia> Humans are animals after all
[09:26:42] <Lunia> melatonine?
[09:27:02] <Lunia> diffrent diets etc
[09:27:24] <Electron> animals, that is correct
[09:27:38] <Electron> mammal animals
[09:28:14] <Lunia> yep yep ^^
[09:30:44] <Electron> what if a human could eat..... his own meat? D:
[09:32:45] <Lunia> well nothing really stops you (besides law and morality). Self cannibalism was prooven inefficient. Trauma induced due to pain and body damage would make you burn much more energy then you would gain
[09:33:20] <Lunia> also eating humans can give you prion deaseases and other nasty deadly things
[09:33:32] <Electron> yuk
[09:33:35] <Lunia> yep

[10:02:17] <ArchPegasusMichael> Lunia: what about "cloning" own tissues in laboratory and making a sandwich?
[10:02:49] <Lunia> its still a long process
[10:06:58] * Electron looks at MirSar_
[10:07:25] <Electron> I think we lost him
[10:07:40] * Lunia puts a brick of butter on MirSar_ head
[10:07:55] <Lunia> if he wont move it will melt
