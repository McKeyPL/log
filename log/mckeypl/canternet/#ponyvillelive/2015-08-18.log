[01:59:47] <Pony_24993> btw any radios here with a female admin??
[01:59:59] <Pony_24993> Just asking...
[02:00:18] <Sleepypony> we have a female admin in pvfm
[02:00:29] <Sleepypony> but curiously odd question
[02:01:24] <Pony_24993> Hehe.. :-P
[02:02:19] <Pony_24993> I got my reasons..
[02:02:32] <Sleepypony> creepy much.
[02:03:03] <Pony_24993> I thought all admins here are male.. 
[02:03:54] <Pony_24993> Thats all.. honest.
[02:04:19] <Pony_24993> Can we change the subject.. 
[02:05:37] <Pony_24993> For you.. whats the least listened radio here in pvl??
[02:06:16] <Sleepypony> i'm not sure
[02:06:23] <Sleepypony> i focus on running pvfm, thats what i do
[02:08:51] <Pony_24993> Ok..
[02:09:23] <Pony_24993>  Out of curiosity.. will the fandom die??
[02:09:51] <Pony_24993> I mean Im a brony for life but will the fandom be forever??4
[02:10:28] <Sleepypony> i have been a fan of MLP for 30 years.
[02:10:35] <Sleepypony> way before G4 existed.
[02:10:45] <Sleepypony> the fandom is what you make it.
[02:12:37] <Pony_24993> Huh.. I forgot to ask are you a girl??
[02:13:11] <Pony_24993> Before G4, majority of the fans are females..
[02:13:25] <Pony_24993> (@_@)
[02:13:56] <Sleepypony> i am not.
[02:15:15] <Pony_24993> U said u have a female admin in pvfm.. ur working in pvfm..
[02:15:43] <Pony_24993> Did u mean the female admin is you??
[02:16:03] <Sleepypony> no.
[02:17:40] <Pony_24993> Haha.. Plus pvfm's mascot is a mare..
[02:18:51] <Pony_24993> Coincidens??
[02:19:15] <Pony_24993> I think not.. Haha. :-D

[09:00:12] <Electron> good morning pones
[09:00:36] <Dusk> Morning
[09:02:25] <Electron> do you know what "telegram" is?
[09:02:37] <Electron> some new internet messenger I guess?
[09:12:08] <StarStream> yo
[09:12:14] <StarStream> oh dang 
[09:12:16] <StarStream> telegram 
[09:12:19] <StarStream> man such classic
[09:12:47] <Electron> I've been told to try it
[09:12:54] <StarStream> https://telegram.org/
[09:12:55] <Electron> so I'm doing it right now
[09:13:01] <StarStream> apparently its a messenger
[09:13:11] <Electron> yes, I've installed it oready
[09:13:23] <Electron> apparently :)
[09:13:48] <StarStream> so whats it do ?
[09:16:15] <Electron> very simple interface
[09:16:39] <Electron> instant messanger without registration
[09:17:08] <Electron> you only get identity by your phone number
[09:17:23] <StarStream> nwo i know 
[09:17:30] <StarStream> its basically a whatsapp 
[09:17:54] <Electron> probably, I dunno what whatsapp is
[09:19:00] <StarStream> well its also another messenger
[09:23:48] <Electron> phone based too?
[09:24:11] <StarStream> yup
[09:24:14] <StarStream> i use whatsapp 
[09:37:39] <Dusk> I think I'll like Discord better than Telegram
[09:39:04] <Electron> Discord?

[10:32:53] <Electron> hej JockeTF, do you what HexChat is?
[10:33:05] <JockeTF> Pacaloha!
[10:33:11] <JockeTF> Electron: Yes, an IRC client.
[10:33:18] <Electron> do you use it?
[10:33:25] <JockeTF> Electron: Nope!
[10:33:29] <Electron> why?
[10:33:30] <JockeTF> Electron: I use Pidgin.
[10:33:36] <Electron> Pidgin?
[10:33:41] <Electron> Linux based?
[10:34:05] <JockeTF> Mainly Linux, but works everywhere.
[10:34:18] <JockeTF> http://pidgin.im/
[10:34:19] <Electron> can I use it on Win7?
[10:34:24] <Electron> let's see
[10:34:32] <JockeTF> Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it for IRC only.
[10:34:49] <JockeTF> It's an multi-protocol messenger.
[10:35:03] <JockeTF> I use it since I prefer to use one application for all my chatting.
[10:35:29] <JockeTF> It works well, but isn't super-awesome for IRC.
[10:35:40] <JockeTF> If you're just looking for an IRC client I recommend HexChat.
[10:36:29] <Electron> isn't super awesome for IRC?
[10:36:38] <Electron> what's so special about IRC clients anyway?
[10:37:07] <JockeTF> Well, for once you need a bunch of plug-ins to make IRC nice with Pidgin.
[10:38:00] <JockeTF> Many people dislike Pidgin for IRC since it's a bit awkward when it comes to server messages and having a lot of open channels.
[10:38:11] <JockeTF> Electron: Are you on Windows?
[10:38:21] <JockeTF> Right, you said you were.
[10:38:28] <Electron> yes
[10:38:42] <JockeTF> In that case Pidgin may also feel a bit awkward when it comes to window management.
[10:38:59] <JockeTF> Still, I like it, but it definitely is not for everyone.
[10:39:09] <JockeTF> If you're looking for just an IRC client, use HexChat.
[10:39:15] <TheFlutterGuy> Good møvning everypony
[10:39:20] * TheFlutterGuy does the dance of joy
[10:39:43] * Electron raises his eyebrow towards TheFlutterGuy
[10:39:45] <JockeTF> If you want a multi-protocol messenger (for IRC, XMPP, steam, ICQ, etc...) then Pidgin is great.
[10:39:48] <Electron> good morning
[10:40:02] <Electron> thanks for the info, JockeTF
[10:40:14] <Electron> I'll stick to HexChat for now
[10:40:20] <TheFlutterGuy> JockeTF: irssi + bitlbee
[10:41:00] <JockeTF> Morningpaca, TheFlutterGuy.
[10:52:13] <TheFlutterGuy> Morning :3
[10:52:16] * TheFlutterGuy bounces around
[10:52:36] <Electron> seems like you are full of something
[10:54:04] <TheFlutterGuy> it's butters goo
[10:56:26] <Electron> butterfly's
[10:58:55] * JockeTF gives Electron some of Butters' creamy goo.
[10:59:13] <Electron> what should I do with a goo?
[10:59:50] <Electron> glue something together?
[11:00:17] <JockeTF> It's for playing Sarcastoball.
[11:02:58] <TheFlutterGuy> indeedy so
[11:03:39] <Electron> is it some sort of pegasi game?
[11:08:31] <MangoBloom> hey JockeTF  :)

[12:49:57] <Electron> two numbers?
[12:49:57] <AppleDash> yeah
[12:50:06] <AppleDash> I dunno what's up with that :P
[12:50:11] <AppleDash> I think one is GiB and the other is GB
[12:50:39] <JockeTF> Dusk: Hardware is just my dockable laptop with an Ivy Bridge CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The main monitor is 32" at 2560x1440, the second monitor is a regular HD monitor. I'm running Ubuntu Linux with GNOME 3.14, the second monitor is running i3. I use two window managers via ZaphodHeads. This is at work, but I use my own laptop.
[12:51:03] <Dusk> That's pretty neat :D
[12:51:04] <JockeTF> Dusk: I'm a backend developer and systems administrator here.

[13:48:14] <Lunia> hello
[13:49:38] <El> howdy
[13:50:42] <JockeTF> Paca paca, Luniapaca!
[13:51:22] <Lunia> I have question
[13:51:43] <El> shoot
[13:52:08] <JockeTF> Fire!
[13:52:09] <Lunia> What gives you guys satisfaction?
[13:52:20] <Lunia> I dont mean anything dirty
[13:52:22] <MangoBloom> mangoes
[13:52:27] <JockeTF> Alpacas.
[13:52:35] <El> good music for me
[13:52:45] <MangoBloom> :I
[13:52:47] <Lunia> thanks El ^^
[13:53:00] <MangoBloom> yeah, moosik
[13:53:02] <Lunia> for taking it seriously too
[13:53:16] <El> yay
[13:53:41] <El>  ( v¯v)
[13:54:46] <Lunia> I once plugged soundblaster to my rig, Jacklleapp song was feeling very nice
[13:55:15] <Lunia> I wonder if this box is just as good
[13:55:20] <JockeTF> I can agree with music, but only if the sound is good.
[13:55:34] <JockeTF> As in, both quality and equipment.
[13:55:45] * MangoBloom stream only 320k+
[13:55:50] <Lunia> I have good equipment now 
[13:56:00] <Lunia> But not soundblaster
[13:56:51] <Lunia> nope, nothing :/
[13:57:43] <JockeTF> Doesn't have to be super-awesome, but if it sounds bad it just ruins it for me. :P
[13:57:54] <JockeTF> For example, crappy YouTube rips in mixes.
[13:58:02] <MangoBloom> yep
[13:58:02] <Lunia> eyea
[13:58:11] <MangoBloom> bandcamp <3
[14:01:32] <JockeTF> Lunia: Reading a good book, seeing some good fan art, watching a good Star Trek episode, looking at the stars, taking a walk in the forest, or just having a quiet moment to myself can also give satisfaction though. :P
[14:01:46] <El> never ever set the music you love as a ringtone or as alarm clock
[14:01:46] <TheFlutterGuy> Lunia: you have soundblaster
[14:01:49] <TheFlutterGuy> with gold connectors
[14:02:05] <Lunia> JockeTF:  sounds easy when you say it :P
[14:02:05] <JockeTF> I'm having a bit of a hard time defining satisfaction though.
[14:02:37] <Lunia> TheFlutterGuy:  it doesnt sound good to me
[14:02:38] <JockeTF> Lunia: It is easy when you appreciate the small things. :)
[14:02:42] <MangoBloom> https://getsatisfaction.com
[14:02:52] <El> the big feeling of satisfaction comes to me when I finished something that I was doing for months
[14:03:00] <Lunia> I do but they dont satisfy me
[14:03:32] <MangoBloom> ice cream on a hot summers day <3
[14:04:28] <JockeTF> I'd say music is one of the more powerful ways though.
[14:05:22] <MangoBloom> been listening to a lot of Evening Star's songs this summer. perfect summer songs <3
[14:05:24] <Lunia> Im not so sure

[14:12:24] <Lunia> http://zenhabits.net/10-ways-to-beat-the-cant-get-no-satisfaction-syndrome/
[14:12:50] <Lunia> according to this I have to destroy the world
[14:13:00] <El> do you have issues with satisfaction?
[14:13:15] <Lunia> nothing seems satisfying anymore
[14:13:26] <El> or otherwise, you get satidfaction very easily?
[14:14:49] <El> I could advice you to get tired, like a lot
[14:15:13] <Lunia> why does this face cream has to be black? it will look stopid.. and apparently rascist
[14:15:21] <Lunia> tired?
[14:15:55] <El> run until you fall or do exercises until your muscles sore
[14:16:06] <Lunia> HA
[14:16:11] <El> feel really tired and then take a shower
[14:16:23] <El> that's what I call satisfaction
[14:16:41] <El> then take a rest and relax
[14:17:02] <Lunia> I cant really run
[14:17:12] <Lunia> Im still a bit crippled
[14:17:27] <El> no, you can
[14:17:27] <Lunia> my muscles are sore all the time
[14:17:43] <Lunia> you dont understand
[14:17:46] <Lunia> my leg is fucked
