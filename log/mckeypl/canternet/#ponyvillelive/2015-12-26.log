[19:51:07] <Electron> Say hi to her too. :]
[19:52:59] <ArchPegasusMichael> Electron: we decorated the tree just today~ Officially starting celebrating with Gregorian New Year and ending with Julian one
[19:53:03] <ArchPegasusMichael> :3
[19:53:26] <Electron> Well done, Michael. [:
[19:54:02] <Electron> I think you'll have a beautiful christmas tree.
[19:54:49] <ArchPegasusMichael> It turned out to be cheaply made
[19:55:00] <ArchPegasusMichael> but whateva xD
[19:55:23] <ArchPegasusMichael> Mom learned something about the prices ;p
[19:55:33] <Electron> The mood is the goal.
[19:55:39] <ArchPegasusMichael> Yup.
[19:56:36] <ArchPegasusMichael> And we're not having fizzy alcohol this year because of mom's health
[19:57:12] <ArchPegasusMichael> I'm not a fan of cheap spumante either, so we'll have Schweppes instead
[20:01:21] <ArchPegasusMichael> I've found a website with nice looking non-alcoholic wine etc., but comparing these (30-40PLN / 750ml standard bottle) to Schweppes (3PLN / 2l)...
[20:02:03] <Electron> What to drink and what to eat.
[20:02:14] <ArchPegasusMichael> Hehehe
[20:02:14] <Electron> I got funny HNY this time.
[20:02:25] <Electron> The prices are twice as high.
