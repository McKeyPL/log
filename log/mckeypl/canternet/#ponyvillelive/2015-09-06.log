[06:20:41] <PVL_4159> The Party with Pinkie Remix on Best Pony Radio. That isn't Alex S's original remix. I've tried asking about it before and looking it up but can't find anything and still haven't. Can anyone provide info on that remix?

[07:59:31] <SilverEagle> nyah~
[08:04:35] <Sakura> Nyu
[08:04:57] <Sakura> Have I shown you a pony music mashup I did last year?
[08:06:16] *** ama is now known as ama|sleep
[08:06:26] <Sakura> https://soundcloud.com/dj_sakura/ive-got-to-find-a-way-robin-schulz-waves-mashup
[08:09:25] <Sakura> I'm thinking of making my own dubstep & selling the non-pony original work.
[08:09:39] <Sakura> I really need the money anyway.
[08:12:57] <Sakura> What do you think, SilverEagle? Is selling original music just to make a living a good idea?
[08:14:11] * SilverEagle shrug
[08:14:31] <SilverEagle> depends a lot on the music
[08:14:39] <SilverEagle> and your promotion, and luck
[08:14:42] <SilverEagle> it's probably not a living for a long time
[08:16:17] <Sakura> Probably. I mean, we don't know if the music would take off itself.
[08:27:51] <Sakura> I've had success in the past up until my online identity change. If I didn't do that, I wouldn't have to start almost from scratch but then again that identity is just a painful memory of the past I never wanna see again.

[09:07:39] <Electron> let's hear it
[09:09:47] <Electron> I think the vocals should be quieter\
[09:19:32] <Sakura> It's my first pony music thingy so yeah. It's not perfect.
[09:23:23] <Sakura> I haven't shown my final form
[09:24:41] *** Quits: Cameron_D (cameron@cam.mylittle.horse) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[09:24:42] <Electron> there is steady beat and several sound effects
[09:25:47] <Electron> too many repeats of the same vocals though
[09:25:49] <Sakura> Yes. The minute I heard this song, my instinct told me to do a mashup so I did.
[09:26:36] <Electron> some transitions I really like, they are so smooth
[09:27:53] <Sakura> Thanks.
[09:30:56] <Sakura> I really should start making some original instrumental compositions for pony & other remixes. I just got an idea inspired my Alex S. & McJuggernuggets' dad & I really want to make a remix of him with my own wubs.
[09:31:22] <Electron> that would be cool
[09:32:09] *** Joins: Cameron_D (cameron@Pony-be0im7.mylittle.horse)
[09:33:51] <Sakura> It really would. Plus, if he likes it I may end up seeing a lot of promotion from him to his followers. I'm going to get to work on it starting Sunday or today, first thing in the morning, get FL Studio reinstalled & simply let the wub composition begin.
[09:34:54] <Electron> um... Sunday? but it is Sunday
[09:35:09] <Sakura> I know
[09:35:52] <Sakura> That's why I said that because it's Saturday somewhere still for at least 2 more hours.
[09:36:21] <Sakura> Plus it's still night where I live.
[09:39:21] <Electron> alright
[09:39:48] <Electron> I asked because half of Sunday is passed here
