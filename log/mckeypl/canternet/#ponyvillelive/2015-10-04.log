[23:50:17] <Sakura> I feel sorry for the stallion who also loved her.
[23:51:14] <Electron> I am not.
[23:51:34] <Electron> He is old enough to know how to deal with his feelings.
[23:52:07] <Sakura> Elderly ponies need romance no matter what.
[23:52:50] <Sakura> I had an elderly man hit on me in front of his wife once.
[23:53:34] <Electron> That's... weird.
[23:53:40] <Sakura> Yep.
[23:57:22] <Sakura> The first time I ever had a man flirt with me. :D
[23:58:29] <Sakura> It was actually interesting & flattering I might say.
