[12:29:09] <Electron> Hi, guys.
[12:29:14] <Electron> And gals.
[12:30:39] <ArchPegasusMichael> Hi Electron 
[12:32:31] <ArchPegasusMichael> My Windows' clock is delayed about 1s per day :/
[12:34:22] <ArchPegasusMichael> Nor the built-in time sync, nor NTP works
[12:35:04] <ArchPegasusMichael> NTP on Linux can't connect to any servers too
[12:35:49] <TheFlutt1rGuy> the great firewall of russia?
[12:36:18] <TheFlutt1rGuy> seriously. if pool.ntp.org isn't working from linux, then the issue is most certainly the pipe(ie, your network, or your ISP, etc)

[12:49:40] <Electron> How well did you sleep, TheFlutt1rGuy?
[13:43:46] <StarStream> ArchPegasusMichael, have u check the CMOS battery ? 
[13:44:00] <StarStream> if it is getting slower it means the CMOS battery might be dying
[13:44:17] <Electron> And do the bad block seeking to your HDD too, ArchPegasusMichael.
[13:45:20] <ArchPegasusMichael> HDD is still holding together, 11 reallocated sectors and tired head, but otherwise good
[13:45:55] <ArchPegasusMichael> CMOS battery - very likely ._.
[13:46:07] <StarStream> yea
[13:46:11] <ArchPegasusMichael> It's a pretty old lappy
[13:46:42] <Electron> You use your laptop but don't feed the energy to it.
[13:46:46] <Electron> How could you?
[13:46:54] * Electron gives ArchPegasusMichael a look
[13:47:19] <ArchPegasusMichael> It has no battery though
[13:47:30] <StarStream> oh 
[13:47:34] <ArchPegasusMichael> 24/7 on AC
[13:47:49] <StarStream> how re u sure that it got no battery
[13:48:14] <ArchPegasusMichael> I mean the big one XD not the CMOS
[13:48:27] <StarStream> ok
