[11:47:56] <Lunia> Electron:  JockeTF
[11:58:18] <Electron> Lunia, 
[12:41:30] <Electron> Lunia, TheFlutterGuy, JockeTF
[12:41:43] * JockeTF hugs Electron and Lunia.
[12:41:51] <Lunia> ^^
[12:42:04] <Electron> hehe
[12:42:09] * Electron pats JockeTF
[12:46:20] * TheFlutterGuy hugs Electron 
[12:47:01] <Electron> whoa
[12:47:23] * Electron hugs TheFlutterGuy carefully
[12:48:09] * Lunia hugs TheFlutterGuy carehalffully
[13:26:17] <Electron> what is love, Lunia?
[13:27:16] <Lunia> a feeling
[13:28:13] <ArchPegasusMichael> Baby don't hurt me
[13:28:19] <ArchPegasusMichael> don't hurt me
[13:28:25] <ArchPegasusMichael> no more ~
[13:28:26] <Lunia> I wont
[13:28:51] * Electron is looking at ArchPegasusMichael and Lunia
[13:29:12] * Lunia watches Electron
[13:29:39] <Electron> what kind of feeling, Lunia?
[13:30:01] <Lunia> Emocional
[13:30:09] <Lunia> emotional*
[13:30:36] <ArchPegasusMichael> Lunia is speaking in fancy~!
[13:31:38] <Electron> love is emotional feeling
[13:31:46] <Electron> I don't get it :\
[13:33:03] <ArchPegasusMichael> Because you can't think positive
[13:33:07] <Lunia> what if everyone expiriences love diffrently, but we assume its the same so it can have one name. Who said the way we see or feel is the right one
[13:33:42] <ArchPegasusMichael> Umm, good point
[13:34:05] <Electron> that could be said about every aspect of life
[13:34:17] <Lunia> Unless one  can feel exactly the same feeling another person does
[13:34:27] <Electron> we both see "green" paper, but you may see it differently
[13:34:40] <Lunia> like TheFlutterGuy
[13:34:54] * Electron likes TheFlutterGuy
[13:35:05] <Electron> like that?
[13:35:43] <Lunia> he sees colours diffrently then mundanes
[13:36:27] <Lunia> is concept of colour universal? I think not, even on our planet
[13:37:59] * ArchPegasusMichael paints Electron in pink... um, in a certain visible EM radiation spectrums.
[13:39:50] <ArchPegasusMichael> (Right now both of you are purple in my Andchat, while Electron has more pink-ish nick.)
[13:40:00] <Lunia> an armor made of reflective material could be a good cloak in deep space
[13:40:59] * Lunia stops reflecting light
[13:42:08] <ArchPegasusMichael> Aand you're perfectly black now~
[13:42:18] <Lunia> or am I? ;3
[13:42:29] <Electron> I'm.... pink?
[13:42:29] <Lunia> maybe its not a colour at all
[13:42:46] <ArchPegasusMichael> RGB 0.0.0
[13:43:18] <Lunia> its a lack of colour
[13:44:09] <ArchPegasusMichael> Lunia: you would appear 2-dimensional for sure
[13:44:28] <ArchPegasusMichael> As a silhouette
[13:44:48] <Lunia> and most likely die because if photons are not being reflected they unload all energy into me. Am I right?
[13:45:04] <Lunia> ArchPegasusMichael: kinda yeah :D
[13:45:24] <Lunia> I would 'look' like a black hole
[13:46:04] <Lunia> no
[13:46:08] <Lunia> no
[13:47:08] <ArchPegasusMichael> Lunia: do we need help of a cute German tatzlpone?
[13:47:19] <Lunia> if the photons are not being reflected then can only get discharged. That would create a lot of energy and I would rather look like a star then black hole
[13:47:30] <Lunia> ArchPegasusMichael: what are you talking abooy?
[13:47:39] <ArchPegasusMichael> Zuthal
[13:47:45] <Lunia> reason?
[13:48:10] <ArchPegasusMichael> This topic could stretch for hours xD
[13:48:23] <Lunia> I dont have much time now
[13:48:32] <Lunia> sorry
[13:48:37] <ArchPegasusMichael> Just kidding :3
[13:48:38] <Lunia> I just got energy
[13:48:45] <Lunia> so time to do stuff
[13:49:00] <Lunia> brb some time
[13:49:28] <Electron> oh...
[13:49:36] <Electron> black holes and such
[14:06:02] <Not-1462> Ponyville Live!: "Midwest Brony Fest 2015 - Show VA Panel" - http://ponyvillelive.com/show/episode/id/5/episode/46421/origin/twitter
[14:16:34] <Lunia> bakc
[14:17:00] <Electron> how were the things?
[14:17:21] <Lunia> as they should be
[14:19:58] <Lunia> .
[14:21:00] <Electron> like?
[14:21:36] <Lunia> Shower is an every day activity I dont really like that much
[14:30:58] <Lunia> I came to realisation not knowing is a key to happiness on earth. Humanity along with planet are on a course to self destruction. Situation on the borders and inside are getting worse. 
[14:31:14] <Lunia> if you know there is no future what is present for?
[14:33:07] <TheFlutterGuy> Lunia . now just extrapolate that to the galaxy and the universe. 
[14:33:13] <Electron> to wallow in your pity of course
[14:33:14] <TheFlutterGuy> humanity is doomed
[14:33:25] <Lunia> yea
[14:33:32] <TheFlutterGuy> the uniservese is dying. and taking us with it.
[14:33:45] <Lunia> Past is to learn from it, present to lay foundation for the future, and future is to dream
[14:33:53] <TheFlutterGuy> I will be naked. kicking and screaming.
[14:33:58] <TheFlutterGuy> just like when I was born.
[14:34:17] <Lunia> 'humanity will not die in blast but a whimper'
[14:34:22] <TheFlutterGuy> indeed.
[14:34:28] <Electron> what do you mean "the universee is dying"?
[14:34:31] <Lunia> it is
[14:34:45] <Lunia> its getting to the point where it could be as well dead
[14:34:45] <TheFlutterGuy> it is!
[14:34:54] <Lunia> soonish
[14:34:58] <TheFlutterGuy> well. it is mostly dead. just leftover fumes
[14:35:04] <Lunia> but not for us anyway, we will all be past
[14:35:06] <TheFlutterGuy> the universe is running on fumes.
[14:35:27] <Electron> but there is 99.99% of emptiness in the universe
[14:35:36] <Electron> emptiness can not die
[14:35:42] <Lunia> it can sweetie
[14:35:51] <Electron> :|
[14:36:00] <Lunia> in strange neons even death may die
[14:36:02] <Electron> are you saying that emptiness is alive now?
[14:36:09] <TheFlutterGuy> neon. .. haha haha
[14:36:14] <Lunia> what is life?
[14:36:18] <Lunia> xD
[14:36:26] <TheFlutterGuy> my bus stop.  :D
[14:36:52] <Lunia> everything in universe is made of more and less complicated structures. WE are one of those
[14:36:57] <Electron> they say movement is live
[14:37:04] <Lunia> atoms move
[14:37:17] <Electron> universe moves every moment
[14:37:17] <Lunia> yes
[14:37:53] <Electron> except emptiness
[14:38:00] <Electron> you can't move nothing
[14:38:30] <Lunia> what is emptiness without time? Its irrelevant
[14:39:12] <Lunia> As I remmember even time will stop matter.
[14:39:12] <Electron> time is irrelevant too
[14:41:20] <Lunia> at the very end there will be just atoms floating in emptiness, being milions of lightyears apart.
[14:41:28] <TheFlutterGuy> tile is what keeps everything from happening right now.
[14:41:31] <Lunia> and then they will fall apart 
[14:41:34] <TheFlutterGuy> time. 
[14:42:39] <Electron> you are talking about those things that we know about
[14:42:56] <Electron> but there are tons of other things we haven't discovered yet
[14:43:03] <Lunia> true
[14:43:22] <Lunia> I heard a theory that before big bang time didnt exist 
[14:43:27] <Electron> thus our talk is useless
[14:43:37] <Lunia> universe was tiny
[14:43:49] <Lunia> then something extraordinary happen
[14:44:03] <Lunia> somehoww and bum
