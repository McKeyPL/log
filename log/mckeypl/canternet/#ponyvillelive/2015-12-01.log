[17:16:51] <ArchPegasusMichael> She's a poor lost pony, very intelligent and with remarkable magic talent
[17:18:55] <ArchPegasusMichael> I felt stupid after watching the finale when I realized that not everything can be solved by force
[17:20:27] <ArchPegasusMichael> I wouldn't know what to do with someone who seemingly had nothing to lose, like Starlight
[17:20:55] <Electron> I have a feeling that she was ignored and there was no adult nearby to guide her mind and energy.
