[10:40:13] <Electron> paca-al
[10:46:52] <Lunia>        hi
[11:09:28] <JockeTF> So... I'm going to move Redmine from Apache to Nginx today...
[11:10:34] <JockeTF> Getting Redmine working rocket science.
[11:10:41] <JockeTF> http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/HowTos
[11:10:51] <JockeTF> 90% of those tutorials don't work anymore. ;P
[11:11:25] <JockeTF> Also, the libraries it's using break compatibility on minor versions.
[11:13:39] <JockeTF> Think you could run Redmine with ruby-rack 1.5 when it depends on ruby-rack 1.4? Nope. Not possible.
[11:14:02] <JockeTF> Think you can run the libraries in Ruby 1.9 when they were made for Ruby 1.8? Nope. Not possible.
[11:15:35] <Electron> compatibility has lost?
[11:17:03] <Electron> that reminds me that thing when a delevoper wants to make a big profit and releases new non-compatible version
[11:17:33] <Electron> then all users have to buy the new version
