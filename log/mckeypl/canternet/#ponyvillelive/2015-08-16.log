[23:27:09] <Sakura> Thanks, COlgate z-lining him & Sleepypony for banning him from PVFM.
[23:27:13] <Colgate> was seeing if they did anything besides just say channels weren't channels and repeat names of people who kicked them
[23:27:23] <Colgate> but that didn't happen
[23:27:35] * Electron derps to Lunia_Stark
[23:27:36] <Lunia_Stark> what a r-tard
[23:27:40] <Sleepypony> though he didn't like being kicked lol
[23:27:47] <Lunia_Stark> ^3^
[23:28:18] <Sakura> If you're going to IRC, don't act like an idiot like that. Learn to IRC first.
[23:28:23] <Lunia_Stark> I dont see any spam tbh, just some gibberish
[23:28:39] <Colgate> Lunia_Stark: same stuff in ~5 different channels
[23:28:53] <Sakura> He seemed too young to IRC properly without parental or sibling supervision anyway.
[23:29:22] * Lunia_Stark shrugs
[23:29:29] <Lunia_Stark> confusing
[23:31:16] <Electron> IRC with parents? heh
[23:31:28] <Electron> that sounds very odd
[23:31:59] <Sakura> I can imagine that actually. "Don't type this, don't post this, type this, type that, don't tell them where we live"
[23:32:39] <Electron> "you posted my picture?? oh you little... >:|"
[23:33:19] <Sakura> "Jacob! No! Ugh, now strangers know where we live & they're going to want to kidnap you!"
[23:34:03] <Lunia_Stark> "dont send videos from daddies secret shelf"
[23:34:36] <Lunia_Stark> or better
[23:34:39] <Sakura> "Don't film me in the shower & post it!"
[23:35:24] <Lunia_Stark> "Dont post daddies and mommies wrestling videos online"
[23:35:37] <Sakura> I REMEMBER THAT COMMERCIAL!
[23:36:04] <Lunia_Stark> what?
[23:36:08] <Electron> "on second thought, get out of this computer!"
[23:36:20] <Electron> "go play ball or something"
