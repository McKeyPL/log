[09:46:12] <JockeTF> I like alpacas!
[10:46:58] <StarStream> hey
[10:47:03] <JockeTF> Hellopaca!
[10:49:09] <StarStream> how is it ? 
[10:53:44] <JockeTF> It is fine!
[10:54:33] <JockeTF> I'm at work thinking about bundled software libraries.
[10:55:35] <JockeTF> There's probably tons of software bundling libpng.
[10:56:16] <JockeTF> Now consider a vulnerability like http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2861-1/
[10:57:18] <JockeTF> I wonder how many applications that bundle that library will actually bother to update it.
[11:00:14] <ArchPegasusMichael> :/
[11:08:43] <JockeTF> steam-runtime/amd64/installed/libpng12-0_1.2.46-3ubuntu4+srt4_amd64
[11:08:55] <JockeTF> I thought so. ;P
[11:09:37] <JockeTF> "The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version: libpng12-0    1.2.46-3ubuntu4.2"
[11:09:44] <JockeTF> There's no .2 there. ;)
[11:11:07] <JockeTF> There isn't even a .1 which fixed other security issues back in November: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libpng/1.2.46-3ubuntu4.1
