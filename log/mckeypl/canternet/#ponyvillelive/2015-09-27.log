[04:16:50] <RimeTM> So, I'm somewhat of a novice with APIs in general
[04:17:17] <RimeTM> and I just noticed how very useful this unified song ID system is for multiple stations
[04:17:51] <RimeTM> Is there a way for one to check on a specific song and see total plays for it across all associated stations?
[04:18:08] <RimeTM> or, even less likely, across a time period, like a week?
[04:41:26] <RimeTM> SilverEagle (or should I be asking WeAreBorg?), is there a way to find song IDs by artist or song title search?

[17:39:27] <JockeTF> Hellopaca!
[18:19:24] <Electron> Hello
[18:19:29] <Electron> You are late today
[18:49:08] <JockeTF> Sorry.
[18:51:27] * Electron Super Dupa beams are gonna blind me But I won't feel blue
[18:51:27] * Electron Like I always do
[18:51:27] * Electron 'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
[18:53:18] <Sakura> Which one of yous is running around pretending to be me? And how do you people know I fell off my roof trying to fix my satellite dish?
[18:59:23] <Electron> Hard questions.
[18:59:49] * Electron feels sorry for Sakura
[19:02:21] <Sakura> Was it you? Because I got permission from my brother to run around & pretend to be me. :D
[19:02:58] <Electron> Why would I pretend to be you?
[19:03:22] <Electron> I don't have such intentions.
[19:12:50] <Sakura> https://youtu.be/tvsiaau-8bs
[19:15:07] <Sakura> Why are you not running around pretending to be me? All you had to do is ask permission from my brother. I got permission from my brother to run around the front yard pretending to be me.
[19:18:55] <Sakura> I actually would love for you to run around the neighborhood dressed like me & pretending to be me :P
[19:23:09] <Electron> Depends on what you wear.
[19:23:26] <Electron> I don't want to walk around in a dress. :|
[19:24:29] <Sakura> I'm running around in my undies covered entirely in blanket as if it was a Jedi hood & robe.
[19:25:25] <Electron> Oh my...
[19:25:36] <Sakura> People looking at me funny & think I'm some nut named Ezekiel who broke out of the nuthouse.
[19:27:26] <Electron> I would give you a confused look as well, in all honesty
[19:28:09] <Sakura> :D
[19:30:34] <Sakura> But really, did you see EQG3 or just skip it?
[19:31:23] <Electron> I wan
[19:31:27] <Electron> I wasn
[19:31:33] <Electron> Darn it!
[19:31:42] <Sakura> No EQG for you?
[19:31:45] <Electron> I wasn't at home yesterday.
[19:31:49] <Sakura> Oh
[19:32:14] <Electron> And I've been sleeping the whole day today.
[19:32:28] <Electron> So I'm watching Ep16 right now.
[19:32:35] <Electron> And then the movie.
[19:36:14] <Sakura> Why was there hardly any cutie map eps? :/
[19:36:29] <Sakura> Dammit Hasbro

[20:45:52] <Electron> I'm watching the movie.
[20:46:05] <Electron> And here is the 3d song.
[21:25:21] <Electron> I did it.
[21:25:43] <Electron> The movie is the wrong.
[21:25:54] <Electron> Animation is good though.
[21:27:02] <Electron> P.S.: Need more she-demons.

[22:00:31] <Sakura> Not as good as EQG2.
[22:03:31] <Electron> All EqG movies are "meh".
[22:03:38] <Electron> If you ask me.
[22:11:43] <Sakura> Yeah. FiM is better thought I did like EQG2 a little better.
[22:11:59] <Sakura> But FiM is always superior.
[22:12:24] <Sakura> I was kinda disappointed in EQG3 for only one thing.
[22:16:11] <Electron> What thing?
[22:21:00] <Sakura> I was expected both worlds to merge briefly.
