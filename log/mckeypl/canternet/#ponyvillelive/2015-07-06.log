[12:14:52] <Electron> revealing part
[12:51:27] <StarStream> yea i know what is patreon 
[12:51:39] <StarStream> i think anyone who is involve in doing art or livestreaming know about it 
[12:53:13] <Electron> is it some sort of slavery for money?
[12:54:00] <StarStream> nope 
[12:54:22] <StarStream> its something of basically its a monthly thing
[12:54:35] <StarStream> patreon basically is like crowfunding job
[12:54:54] <ArchPegasusMichael> ^
[12:55:19] <StarStream> so say u love an artist and u want to keep supporting him non stop and he has a patreon and u paid for him monthly in return for his services
[12:55:33] <StarStream> like access to his livestream or even unpublish art
[12:55:56] <JockeTF> You may also get some rewards: https://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=2179891
[12:55:58] <JockeTF> :P
[12:56:13] <StarStream> basically how much they pay per month is ur monthly fluctuating basic salary
[12:56:29] <StarStream> so if say incentive reach up to 1k per month and every month u receive 1k 
[12:58:41] <StarStream> O_O 
[12:58:50] <StarStream> i didnt know that u got patreon jocke
