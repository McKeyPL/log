[09:45:57] <El> Helloooo~
[10:20:54] <Lunia> hi El <3
[10:21:42] <El> Lunia, ♥
[10:40:08] <Lunia> how are you El?
[10:40:27] <El> I'm still feeling blue.
[10:40:34] <El> And you, Lunia?
[10:41:10] <Lunia> dont feel blue sugar cube :( feel pink! :D
[10:41:22] <Lunia> Im feeling fine fine
[10:42:58] <El> Awww, you called me "sugarcube". :3
[10:43:05] <El> That's so sweet of you.
[10:43:11] <Lunia> with a space :D
[10:43:18] <Lunia> ^3^ 
[10:58:23] <El> Lunia, please, tell me one thing as a girl.
[10:58:55] <El> Is it important for you if a guy tall or not?
[10:58:56] <Lunia> sure. 
[10:59:08] <Lunia> ^that wasnt the answer to question
[10:59:15] <El> A-ha.
[10:59:39] <Lunia> well I like taller guys then me
[11:00:10] <El> Hm...
[11:00:28] <Lunia> some girls like shorter guys
[11:00:36] <Lunia> its all about preference
[11:01:46] <El> Does that mean that you automatically dislike a guy if you are taller than him?
[11:11:21] <Lunia> Noo offcourse not. It doesnt matter to me. 
[11:12:39] <Lunia> but I know girls who are so shallow that they would ditch a guy for that. Same goes for guys. Butt too small, tits not big enough
[11:12:45] <El> But you said you like taller guys.
[11:12:48] <Lunia> you know this type of people
[11:13:11] <El> Probably.
[11:13:12] <Lunia> yeah, but it doesnt mean that I dislike every shorter guy then me
[11:13:20] <El> Alright.
[11:13:40] <Lunia> Im only slightly shorter then TheFlutterGuy
[12:03:06] <El> It's vice versa.
[12:03:14] <El> He is taller than you.
[12:03:27] <Lunia> yes :3
[12:03:41] <Lunia> Indeed he is ^^
[12:03:47] <El> And beardy.
[12:05:21] <Lunia> vewwy :3
[12:05:35] <El> What?
[12:05:51] <El> Oh, "very".
