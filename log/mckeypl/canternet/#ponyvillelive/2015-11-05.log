[15:52:34] <Electron> Yeah, I have the same thoughts, StarStream.
[15:53:15] <StarStream> or if ur lucky
[15:53:18] <StarStream> then u dont have
[15:53:28] <StarStream> but then again everyone has a dormant cancer cell 
[15:53:33] <StarStream> its all about the food that you eat
[15:53:46] <StarStream> remember carbon is carcinogenic to the body
[15:54:01] <Electron> Or the food I do not eat, but should.
