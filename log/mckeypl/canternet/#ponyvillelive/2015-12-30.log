[13:21:29] <MirSar> Bored at work watching a Fallout letsplay 
[13:21:35] <StarStream> h 
[13:21:37] <StarStream> oh*
[13:21:45] <MirSar> How 'bout you?
[13:21:49] <StarStream> played the game yet ?
[13:21:51] <StarStream> not much 
[13:21:54] <MirSar> "the game"?
[13:21:56] <StarStream> watching someone play SMT x FE 
[13:21:59] <MirSar> Fallout you mean?
[13:22:00] <StarStream> yea fallout 4 
[13:22:18] <MirSar> yeah, almost got 120 hrs :P
[13:22:23] <StarStream> dang
[13:22:31] <StarStream> have u tried any mods any weapon ?
[13:23:01] <MirSar> Tried a few from the Nexus, but intil the GECK comes out, the supply is not mipressive
[13:25:46] <MirSar> But there are a lot of handy ones, like making turrets make less noise, graphic improvements and other smaller modifications
[13:25:48] <Lunia> hewwwooo
[13:26:02] <MirSar> Harrrrrooo :3
[13:41:52] <StarStream> ah
[13:43:30] <StarStream> wait so u havent try the any mods any weapon MirSar  /
[13:45:28] <MirSar> nahh, for now I enjoy how the weapons are, probbobly gonna wait with that for the GECK
[13:45:42] <StarStream> awww 
[13:45:55] <StarStream> any mods any weapon is the reason i wanna buy fallout 4 
[13:47:03] <StarStream> what make that mod unique is basically u can install any mods on any weapons
[13:47:15] <StarStream> so u can make like a fat man revolver
[13:47:27] <StarStream> or a electric minigun 
[13:47:45] <StarStream> or a minigun magazine rifle which can shoot electricity 
[13:47:47] <StarStream> etc etc
[13:50:27] <MirSar> haha :D
[13:51:02] <MirSar> You have a mod to make any weapon a legendary weapon
[13:51:08] <StarStream> yup
[13:51:19] <MirSar> so fx a Fat Man who shoots 2 projectiles for each "bullet"
[13:51:23] <StarStream> http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4515/
[13:51:27] <StarStream> what u mean 
[13:51:58] <StarStream> u can do something of a revolver shooting a 6 shot homing fatman 
[13:52:12] <StarStream> as in one shot 6 ammo come out of the barrel 
[13:53:18] <MirSar> "Attach the rocket launcher lock-on sights on any weapon!" 
[13:53:18] <MirSar> Auto targeting Minigun with mini nukes o.O
[13:53:28] <StarStream> yup
[13:53:32] <StarStream> the choices are endless
[13:54:18] <StarStream> yea apparently i just watched a video showing someone do a MIRV mini gun 
[13:55:25] <StarStream> not to mention the update also include any melee mods any melee weapons
[13:56:45] <MirSar> interesting, thoug I'm not gonna install it myself, sounds funn but storybreaking
[13:56:56] <StarStream> yea it can be 
[14:03:11] <StarStream> i remember there is this armor mod that is very good 
[14:24:09] <MirSar> I struk gold! http://kaomoji.ru/en/  ＼(＾▽＾)／
[14:25:01] <StarStream> ?
[14:25:29] <StarStream> oh those kind of emote

[18:52:42] <Electron> Hey, MirSar, do you keep your diary?
[18:53:02] <MirSar> nope, none what so ever :P
[18:54:08] <MirSar> why?
[18:54:12] <Electron> All great famous persons had diaries.
[18:55:58] <MirSar> I may be great, but I'm not famous, and I don't plan to be....
[18:56:17] <MirSar> way too much stress, and I'm antisocial most times :P
[18:56:53] <Electron> Wow...
[18:57:03] <Electron> It's just a harmless diary.
[18:58:39] <MirSar> haha, and I'm just beeing honest :)
[18:58:47] <Electron> I appreciate that.
[18:59:06] <Electron> Also, I'm glad that you are back.
[18:59:35] <MirSar> And I'm glad to be back
[19:07:14] <Electron> And I'm still advice you to watch Season 5.
[19:07:23] <Electron> It's really worth it.
[19:07:37] <Electron> There are some filler episodes but still.
[19:08:06] <MirSar> Gonna finnish InuYasha first, now that I'm in the middle 
[19:09:01] <Electron> What's this?
[19:09:22] <MirSar> An old timer from 2000 :3
[19:10:23] <MirSar> Foud a few clipps of it one day, and decided to DL it 
[19:10:28] <Electron> Boobies and butts or some philosophic stuff?
[19:11:43] <MirSar> Nahh, it's more a classic Jepanese in the old ages with deamons and swordfight
[19:12:41] <MirSar> http://myanimelist.net/anime/249/InuYasha
[19:14:18] <Electron> Who's the demon on the pictures?
[19:15:31] <MirSar> it's the "good guy" and main character
[19:18:09] <Electron> Why in commas?
[19:18:47] <MirSar> Weeeeell, he's not the most kind mouthed half deamon xD
[19:20:43] <Electron> He curses like a.... er....
[19:20:44] <MirSar> Mind you, it's a PG13 anime, so nothing to bad 
[19:21:14] <Electron> What do you call a person who curses constantly in your language?
[19:21:24] <MirSar> Rappkjefta
[19:22:48] <Electron> "Fast-talking"? :|
[19:23:19] <MirSar> no.. don't think google handles it. it's more a slang word
[19:23:39] <Electron> O'rite.
[19:23:46] <MirSar> best translation would be bad-mouthed
[19:24:04] <Electron> That seems more legit.
[19:43:37] <Electron> Old poiss.
[19:43:52] <Electron> Young poiss.
