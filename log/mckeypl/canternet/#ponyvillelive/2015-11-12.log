[10:40:41] <StarStream> MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!! http://www.equestriadaily.com/2015/11/build-bear-derpy-muffins-returning-in.html
[10:41:34] <StarStream> i oredi got mine !!! :D 
[10:44:40] <ArchPegasusMichael> Meanwhile: "Autumn depression is returning" "Haha, I already got mine!"
[10:45:02] <StarStream> ? 
[10:48:36] <ArchPegasusMichael> I just thought that my complaining would sound funny this way xD
[10:50:45] * JockeTF loves the autumn.
[10:52:32] <ArchPegasusMichael> It kills people.
[10:53:39] <JockeTF> NO U
[10:55:42] <StarStream> ?
[10:55:49] <StarStream> true tho 
[10:55:54] <StarStream> since the oil crash 
[10:56:00] <StarStream> everywhere is hit by the depression 
[11:36:53] <Lunia> oil crash wha?
[11:51:36] <StarStream> oh u didnt know ?
[11:51:43] <StarStream> what is the price of 1 barrel of oil now ?
[12:09:47] <Lunia> a bucket of blood?
[12:10:01] <Lunia> I dont own a car
[12:14:22] <StarStream> ok
[12:15:08] <StarStream> used to be like 100+ usd per barrel 
[12:15:17] <StarStream> to now like 40+ usd
[12:17:11] <Lunia> so the price went down?
[12:17:29] <Lunia> from over 100 to round' 40
[12:17:32] <StarStream> yup
[12:17:32] <StarStream> everyone suffer
[12:17:32] <StarStream> a lot of oil company shut down 
[12:17:40] <Lunia> good :)
[12:17:48] <StarStream> because those oil company need like 80 usd per barrel to survive
[12:18:04] <StarStream> yea because of that unemployment surface
[12:18:10] <Lunia> you made my day
[12:18:12] <StarStream> and also currency drop 
[12:18:17] <StarStream> how so lunia ?
[12:18:27] <Lunia> I dont  care about peole. We need to stop burning coal and oil
[12:18:30] <Lunia> we really do
[12:18:42] <StarStream> well easy to say
[12:18:47] <Lunia> or we will die or suffer consquences
[12:18:48] <Lunia> no
[12:18:49] <StarStream> when we have way too much surplus of oil 
[12:19:00] <StarStream> overproduction lead to the price drop actually
[12:19:10] <Lunia> StarStream:  its about money
[12:19:16] <Lunia> not what is easier
[12:19:16] <StarStream> yea
[12:19:28] <StarStream> because of oil crash 
[12:19:28] <Lunia> solarfarms are better, nuclear ower is
[12:19:31] <StarStream> depression occur
[12:19:36] <Lunia> but they wont get money
[12:19:55] <StarStream> solar farm is expensive
[12:19:57] <Lunia> I want all those oil rig companies to crash
[12:20:06] <StarStream> so what 
[12:20:22] <Lunia> so we start with green energy that wont kill as so fast
[12:20:54] <StarStream> true
[12:20:57] <StarStream> but also everyone suffer
[12:21:12] <Lunia> tough nookie
[12:21:24] <Lunia> we need to rogress our power solutions
[12:21:29] <StarStream> yea not to mention you also lunia
[12:21:31] <Lunia> because it is just sad
[12:21:36] <StarStream> the oil crash affect everyone 
[12:21:50] <StarStream> all sorts of financial problem surface
[12:21:50] <Lunia> StarStream:  I know about it and I still hold my argument
[12:21:56] <StarStream> ok 
[12:22:38] <StarStream> in any case my country completely depend on oil and gas
[12:22:46] <Lunia> we could always switch to renewal energy sources gradually
[12:22:54] <Lunia> sorry to hear that
[12:22:58] <StarStream> easy to say for u 
[12:23:18] <StarStream> i know its good 
[12:23:43] <Lunia> I would love to spend my resources and stop oil roduction and replace it with whatever better, But im no one important
[12:23:47] <Lunia> alone at least
[12:24:34] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: go nuclear
[12:24:54] <StarStream> very restrictive
[12:25:08] <Lunia> what do you mean?
[12:25:09] <StarStream> and the consequences is more harsher
[12:25:19] <Lunia> yah
[12:25:22] <Lunia> lts boil planet instead
[12:25:34] <Lunia> thats nothing in comparison to radiation
[12:25:35] <StarStream> frankly speaking tho nuclear is not really renewable
[12:25:36] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: i disagree
[12:25:43] <StarStream> because ur mining uranium 
[12:25:45] <StarStream> which is limited 
[12:25:48] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: agreed. but stil far superiour to coal and oil
[12:26:38] <TheFlutterGuy> nuclear wins out in "waste material per watt/hours". but it ALSO wins out in "radioactive waste material per watt/hour" (over coal anyways)
[12:27:56] <StarStream> yea
[12:28:10] <StarStream> and damage to the environment is insane
[12:28:24] <TheFlutterGuy> with coal and oil, yes. far more insane than with nuclear
[12:31:02] <StarStream> hmm..
[12:31:56] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html
[12:32:35] <StarStream> yea
[12:32:42] <StarStream> unless if manage to get into fusion somehow
[12:32:49] <TheFlutterGuy> yes, indeed
[12:32:52] <StarStream> then no energy waste
[12:32:55] <TheFlutterGuy> but lets use nuclear as a stop gap
[12:33:01] <StarStream> but the amount is insane tho 
[12:33:08] <StarStream> in terms of temperature needed
[12:33:08] <TheFlutterGuy> till we get proper fusion(in you know. 50 years. HAH), or renewale
[12:33:12] <TheFlutterGuy> +b
[12:33:20] <StarStream> or ..... if u ever heard of cold fusion 
[12:33:32] <TheFlutterGuy> *snort*
[12:37:02] <TheFlutterGuy> fusion has been 50 years away, for the last 50 years
[12:37:12] <TheFlutterGuy> cold fusion isn't doing much better
[12:37:16] <TheFlutterGuy> and isnt really hot
[12:37:35] <StarStream> it is done at room temperature
[12:37:40] <StarStream> but not easy thats the thing
[13:39:18] *** Joins: Electron (Miranda@Pony-bibsnk.is74.ru)
[13:40:48] <StarStream> yo
[13:41:13] <Electron> Hey.
[13:41:22] <StarStream> hows life ?
[13:41:59] <Electron> Pretty terrible for now.
[13:42:11] <Electron> And yours?
[13:54:43] <ArchPegasusMichael> D:
[13:58:01] <StarStream> not that bad
[14:00:05] <Electron> That's it, guys. The neurosurgeon said two hours ago that the tumor in brain must be removed. Or else my mom will lose her hormal brain activity.
[14:00:34] <StarStream> oh 
[14:01:01] <Electron> But the surgery might be fatal.
[14:01:54] <Electron> So either death in pain or death on the surgical table.
[14:02:19] <Electron> Wheee~
[14:02:25] <StarStream> how bad is the tumor ?
[14:02:42] <Electron> The situation is going derper and derper.
[14:03:11] <Electron> The tumor is rather big.
[14:03:26] <Electron> In the temple part.
[14:03:46] <ArchPegasusMichael> Electron: if I were to make such choice, I'd take a risk of surgery.
[14:04:07] <Electron> I said exactly the same thing to her.
[14:04:15] <Electron> She agreed.
[14:04:25] <ArchPegasusMichael> :]
[14:04:37] <Electron> Yeah, at least something. :]
