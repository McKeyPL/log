[10:22:16] <ArchPegasusMichael> HDDs give more hope for recovering overwritten files
[10:22:34] <ArchPegasusMichael> than cards and SSDs
[10:22:38] <Lunia> most likely
[10:22:56] <ArchPegasusMichael> I've lost many photos :/
[10:22:58] <Lunia> blackholes are hard

[10:26:06] <ArchPegasusMichael> What sucks is that photos marked as "not overwritten" in Recuva, seem corrupted and won't open

[10:29:11] <TheFlutterGuy> ddrescue is the best, imo. though no clue if it will do anything usable on SSD
[10:29:21] <TheFlutterGuy> for spinning rust though. ddrescue is very nice
[10:29:29] <TheFlutterGuy> spinrite too(though that does hurt the drive)
[10:29:42] <Lunia> Ctrl + Z is the most used recovery tool
[10:30:00] <ArchPegasusMichael> Or sell a kidney and pay Kroll Ontrack.
