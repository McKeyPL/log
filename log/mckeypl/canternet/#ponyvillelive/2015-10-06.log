[00:12:31] * Electron takes a photo of Sakura
[00:15:03] <Sakura> Why?
[00:19:22] <Electron> Because I needed to test my camera.
[00:19:27] <Electron> It works.
[00:22:14] <Sakura> Pervert
[00:22:33] <Electron> Why is that?
[00:23:05] <Electron> Since when taking a photo considers as an act of perverse?
[00:30:45] <Sakura> Because you took a picture of me in my sleep in my undies.
[00:33:23] <Electron> ...what?
[00:33:33] <Electron> How do you type then if you are sleeping?
