[00:50:09] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[00:50:09] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about IM-A-HOERS
[00:51:02] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Poni

[00:51:31] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Heyo backwards rainbow
[00:51:37] <wobniaR> How you been?
[00:52:09] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Summer classes suck, the temps are 100 degrees, humidity 100%, why isn't it winter
[00:52:13] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> *end rant
[00:52:21] <MikeM> Go south, young man.
[00:53:41] <wobniaR> Fun
[00:53:48] <wobniaR> Are you close to graduating yet?
[00:54:16] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Spring next year
[00:54:20] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Not soon enough
[00:54:27] <wobniaR> I know that feel
[00:55:22] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Vig is trying to get me to go to NMND, and I might try to get there
[00:55:33] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> TrotCon is going to be hard due to summer classes
[00:55:48] <wobniaR> Yeah it's coming up soon
[00:56:00] <Snap_Shot> Meh im not going to trotcon

[00:56:38] <MikeM> I'd sit in them.
[00:56:46] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> The drive isn't bad, I can find work easily, and I could probably split hotel with someone or do what I did last year and just not sleep
[00:57:18] <Snap_Shot> Well I personally live like 5min from the hotel where Trotcon is this year
[00:57:42] <Snap_Shot> only thing is outside the hotel there is literally only like office buildings around
[00:57:54] <wobniaR> Cool I'll convince Eywind to stop by your house Snap_Shot

[00:58:14] <MikeM> It could be an "Expeditionary Panel"
[00:58:21] <wobniaR> It's a different area than last years
[00:59:34] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> If I can get there I will
[01:00:04] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> But it really depends on class schedules, since I will have class Thursday and Monday and the drive is 8ish hours
[01:00:07] <wobniaR> Yeah only reason I can go is cause I'm still working part time
[01:00:43] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> I love my car
[01:00:50] <Snap_Shot> Well im not going since i put a staff app for them back in like Dec and i never heard back from them
[01:00:53] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> 35 mpg makes long trips so much more feasible

[01:12:17] <keekle> how about con attendance though, is it still growing?
[01:12:25] <keekle> if so, it was probably no longer needed
[01:12:28] <MikeM> The concerts are still interesting, but there are only so many VA panels a person can watch.
[01:12:51] <keekle> yeah i think i have had every va question answered i ever want to hear

[12:08:08] <RandomNinja> well I mean the yeast will settle to the bottom if there's no sugar to eat
[12:08:17] <RandomNinja> so technically?
[12:08:21] * RandomNinja applies math to Zuthal 
[12:08:30] <Zuthal> wouldn't it naturally settle anyways, since yeast is non-motile?

[12:09:41] <RandomNinja> haven't thought about it too much, but I guess the CO2 production is enough to move it around a bit?
[12:10:01] <Zuthal> probably, yeah. Also, possibly heat-related effects
[12:10:07] *** Joins: Pi (Pi@Pony-e4b.lgb.206.112.IP)
[12:10:13] <Zuthal> what temp is brewing beer usually kept at, and where is it heated from?
[12:10:23] <RandomNinja> depends
[12:10:28] <Zuthal> If the heating elemts are at the bottom, just thermal convection will be enough
[12:10:31] <RandomNinja> lager ~10, ale ~17-18
[12:10:39] <Zuthal> I mean, for fast fermementation, I'd choose ~37 C
[12:10:52] <RandomNinja> that would end up awful though
[12:11:12] <Zuthal> couldn't you just not ferment it as long?
[12:11:17] <RandomNinja> brewers yeast produces more off flavors at higher temperatures
[12:11:21] <Zuthal> ahhh
[12:11:40] <RandomNinja> generally 15-22 is ideal for ale and wine yeasts
[12:11:52] <Zuthal> Yeah, for incubation in microbiology lab, we just put it at the biological optimum temp
[12:12:10] <Zuthal> for which 37 C is often a good bet
[12:12:37] <RandomNinja> and fermentation is exothermic, so assume 2-3 degrees warmer than ambient at homebrew scales
[12:12:43] <RandomNinja> more at industrial scales
[12:12:50] <Zuthal> probably yeah.
[12:13:03] <RandomNinja> less for lagers, since they ferment slower and at lower temperature
[12:13:04] <Zuthal> Well, life in general is exothermic
[12:13:16] <Zuthal> but there are still temperature gradients
[12:13:23] * Thunderbolt crys OMG He's so cute https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/11295881_662311950575459_9176293409794908076_n.jpg?oh=2771432383a3b375b515cb6a07ae10f0&oe=5634B2EA&__gda__=1441607918_250017b9f73241c69c18d19c2c610f29

[12:13:48] <Zuthal> not a doge-doge, but still a doge
[12:15:08] <RandomNinja> some exceptions exist tho, you generally want saison yeast at ~25 degrees since there's style desirable flavors produced there
[12:16:08] * Zuthal is confuse
[12:16:31] <RandomNinja> slightly peppery, mainly
[12:16:50] <RandomNinja> basically colder = less yeast character, warmer = more yeast character
[12:17:19] <Zuthal> very warm=vegimite?
[12:17:34] <RandomNinja> dunno, probably?
[12:17:52] * Thunderbolt has a 3rd Beer
[12:17:54] <RandomNinja> isn't vegemite basically yeast?

[12:18:35] <RandomNinja> nu :P
[12:18:44] <RandomNinja> embrace the darkness :P
[12:18:49] <Zuthal> RandomNinja: Yup, yeast extract
[12:19:08] <Zuthal> basically you take a highly concentrated solution of yeast cells and kill them off
[12:19:12] * Thunderbolt is drinking HomeBru
[12:19:17] <Zuthal> then internal enzymes break them down
[12:20:00] <RandomNinja> I seem to remember a homebrewing thread about if you could take the yeast cake from a lighter beer and heat it to make vegemite
[12:20:15] <Thunderbolt> wat
[12:20:17] <RandomNinja> the reached consensus was pretty much that it would be a waste of time
[12:20:31] <RandomNinja> Thunderbolt: what brewing setup?
[12:20:42] <Thunderbolt> i drink a mate from works home bru its awesome
[12:20:49] <Zuthal> RandomNinja: What they use is usually first add salt to dry up the cells and thus kill them off
[12:20:50] <Thunderbolt> i dont bru
[12:20:54] <RandomNinja> ah k
[12:20:58] <Zuthal> then heat it to finish autolysis
[12:21:04] <RandomNinja> you should, it's fun
[12:21:09] <RandomNinja> also a money sink <.<
[12:21:12] <Zuthal> and then filter out the cell walls, since the cellulose dilutes the flavour
[12:21:40] <RandomNinja> yeah it takes some equipment you don't really have at home I guess
[12:21:42] <Thunderbolt> RandomNinja, unless you sell it
[12:21:50] <RandomNinja> that's unlegal tho
[12:21:52] <Zuthal> eh, you don't HAVE to filter out the cell walls
[12:22:03] <Zuthal> that's just cellulose, pretty much. Just a bit of dietary fiber
[12:22:03] <Thunderbolt> my mate from work is in a brewing Club
[12:22:13] <Thunderbolt> so they extange ans stuff
[12:22:19] <Zuthal> and adding salt and heating it doesn't require fancy equipment
[12:22:55] <RandomNinja> so it might work, then
[12:23:02] <Thunderbolt> lol i remember my firsr beer
[12:23:11] <RandomNinja> Thunderbolt: yeah exchanging is fine, you just can't sell for money
[12:23:17] <Thunderbolt> my first turned into 10
[12:23:20] <Zuthal> one way to remove the cell walls is centrifuging it
[12:23:22] <Thunderbolt> 10 beers*
[12:23:30] <Zuthal> which yeah, it does need special equipment

[12:42:45] <Thunderbolt> when i was drinking my 1st beer (2014 christmas party) i was still drinking it when it kicked in, i felt a little dizy for about 10 seconds, almost fell of the balcony
[12:43:01] <RandomNinja> The End of History - 55% Eisbock
[12:43:22] <RandomNinja> dat newbie lightweight :P
[12:43:41] <Zuthal> Is that even still a beer at that point?
[12:44:09] <Thunderbolt> well im off
[12:44:09] <Zuthal> I bet you have to distill it pretty heavily to get to that concentration
[12:44:18] <RandomNinja> arguable, since it's freeze distilled 3 times I think
[12:44:20] <Zuthal> no way yeast can survive to make that much just by brewing
[12:44:39] <RandomNinja> Eisbock is freeze distilled once, usually, and is 10-14%
[12:44:41] <Thunderbolt> time to be sober for the next 22 hours
[12:44:48] <Thunderbolt> Bye
[12:44:57] <Zuthal> I think actual beer has to be non-distilled, no?

[12:53:16] <DinkyBot> What a silly song, momma!
[12:54:32] <RandomNinja> distiller's yeast easily hits 20+, often 25%, for instance, but they'll make your beer disgusting if used on their own. If you start them at 15% though, they won't make a lot of impact flavorwise
[12:55:13] <RandomNinja> add ideal conditions (temperature, oxygen, nutrients etc), you can easily get a few more percentage points out if it

[13:03:03] <Zuthal> RandomNinja: I thought you wanted no oxygen for fermentation?
[13:03:57] <RandomNinja> nah, you want plenty of oxygen for the yeast to be happy and minimize unwanted off flavors
[13:04:05] <RandomNinja> you don't want any afterwards though
[13:07:05] *** Unixkitty is now known as Awaykitty
[13:08:37] <Zuthal> isn't yeast also capable of oxygenic metabolism?
[13:08:38] *** Eventide|Sleepies is now known as Eventide
[13:08:41] <Zuthal> Or am I remembering it wrong
[13:09:31] <RandomNinja> maybe
[13:10:38] <RandomNinja> all I know is that lack of oxygen during the first phase of fermentation (when the yeast is multiplying rapidly because they found delicious things) causes less tasty drinks
[13:10:54] <Zuthal> yeast are facultative anaerobes
[13:11:04] <Zuthal> meaning that oxygen=less alcohol, but more yeast growth
[13:11:17] <RandomNinja> sounds reasonable
[13:11:31] <RandomNinja> you want as much yeast as possible
[13:11:40] <Zuthal> also, aerobic metabolism is much more efficient
[13:11:55] <Zuthal> for the same energy yield, it uses 1/16th of the amount of glucose used in fermentation
[13:12:10] <RandomNinja> huh.
[13:12:57] <Zuthal> actually, it is even more efficient than that.
[13:13:09] <Zuthal> Glycolysis alone produces 2 ATP
[13:13:15] <RandomNinja> ATP?
[13:14:24] <Zuthal> whereas citric acid cycle+electron transport chain in mitochondria generates 34 ATP and 2 GTP, iirc. So in total, you get 36 ATP and 2 GTP
[13:14:45] <Zuthal> ATP is adenosine triphospate, which is the universal energy carrier used by all living cells
[13:16:12] <RandomNinja> ok

[13:23:21] <Zuthal> or biofuel
[13:23:37] <RandomNinja> methane?
[13:23:39] <Zuthal> for yeast-based biofuel prodcution, you do want it at the biological optimum temp and pH, I think
[13:23:42] <Zuthal> biogas is methane, yes
[13:24:02] <RandomNinja> what yeast are used for that?
[13:24:54] <Zuthal> I don't know, am just a second-semester student
[13:25:12] <Zuthal> but I'd assume ones with high productivity, fast reproduction and high alcohol tolerance
[13:25:30] <Zuthal> for making ethanol, that is
[13:25:39] <Zuthal> for making biogas, you use methanogenic bacteria
[13:26:12] <RandomNinja> brewer's yeast is saccharomyces
[13:26:58] <RandomNinja> I'd assume that's what's used for ethanol as well

[19:02:47] <LunaticHell> And that's the short version.
[19:03:19] <Vigilant_Watch> At my university, everyone who goes into a 'LAB' has to take 4 lab safety courses because the Chemistry department keeps blowing up their labs. Yes, we'll REALLY have to worry about a chemical spill in a Computer Engineering lab. Like solder. Oh gosh it's gonna kill everyone.

[21:12:12] <LunaticHell> Either your memory is better (which probably actually is the case, too.) or you are reffering to the other Lunatic, even though he does not show up this often, nowerdays.
[21:12:36] <wobniaR> He shows up sometimes
[21:12:54] <LunaticHell> Mostly when I'm not here. :/
[21:12:56] <wobniaR> You can poke him on the twitters and he responds
[21:13:23] <LunaticHell> That actually sounds like a good idea that doesn't end up in e an explosion.

[21:14:48] <LunaticHell> Well in the way that I do know that I have a horrible memory, so your memory would be better in any case.
