[01:27:08] <Snapai> Maybe a little earlier if you haven't passed the bossflight into the next section

[01:28:38] <wobniaR> I'm a sucker for RPG's
[01:28:45] <Eywind> lol only 7g for the spiders though?  you're a monster
[01:28:55] <wobniaR> Which is why I liked barkley shut up and jam gaiden so much

[05:23:48] <Muffin_Spectacles> That was always a strange part of childhood - I was often on the outside of Mad Libs games.
[05:24:20] <Muffin_Spectacles> Maybe it was how I was raised, or that I didn't really asociate with many that did it (I think even my cousins were big Mad Lib fans in their youth

[22:53:30] <thereallynewmop12100> It's Fallout 4

[22:54:04] <RandomNinja> what about swords that explode into smaller swords
[22:54:12] <Eywind> no
[22:54:15] <Eywind> that's too many swords

[23:03:04] <FN> There is a training insert for RPG7 RandomNinja: it has a bullet in it with a same trajectory as a rocket
[23:03:33] <RandomNinja> is it just a regular missile without the explosive load?
[23:03:56] <FN> We shot that and then we were allowed to shoot a rocket without any load, just a milled metal spike that stuck in a wood wall
[23:04:49] <FN> No no no, the first one was a rocket-shaped insert, that is actually a gun, shooting a bullet with a same trajectory as the real RPG rocket
[23:05:15] <RandomNinja> that sounds needlessly complicated

[23:06:04] <RandomNinja> true
[23:06:40] <FN> And it is waay cheaper to shoot a ballistically similar bullet than even a dummy rockets
[23:07:28] <RandomNinja> yeah that's fair
[23:07:42] <FN> Dummy rockets btw were produced by that local gun range as a "tourist attraction", it is not a widely produced thing, but a thing that can be made none the less
[23:08:09] <Hamtramck> wow dang is Minecraft Sweden's greatest cultural export now
[23:08:10] <FN> The RPG rockets are composite, so you can buy the rocket and primer charge separately

[23:34:56] <RandomNinja> are those single shot?
[23:35:10] <FN> This also adds up with a history of these guns: they were seized by the russian customs and then given to internal forces
[23:35:16] <RandomNinja> lul
[23:35:24] <FN> It is a semi-auto pistol
[23:35:45] <FN> They were bought by revolutionaries, but they never received them
[23:35:57] <RandomNinja> there is a magazine slide in the handle?
[23:37:21] <FN> Yes it has a magazine
[23:37:30] <FN> But it is with a heel release tab
[23:38:04] <FN> Early semi-automatic that was overlooked by whatever reasons
[23:39:27] * RandomNinja applies a slice of applie pie to FN 
[23:40:53] <FN> It is a very cleverly made gun
[23:41:03] <FN> It has only 2 springs in total
[23:41:22] <RandomNinja> yay, less moving parts
[23:41:25] <FN> One is a buffer spring that is not strictly necessary
[23:41:44] <FN> So there is only one spring that matters and operates everything
[23:42:21] <FN> Schwarzlose was very smart, but alas born in a wrong time and didn't have people who would appreciate his designs
[23:43:11] <FN> Fewer parts is always nice
[23:44:21] <FN> Like russian PM only has 27 parts in total (13 separate functional groups)
[23:45:24] <FN> For comparison Colt 1911 has 47-55 parts depending on the trigger and safety arrangement
[23:46:03] <RandomNinja> yeah that's quite a difference
[23:46:17] <FN> And sporting pistols can have upwards of 100 with all the adjusting screws in them
[23:47:39] <RandomNinja> I'd argue it doesn't really matter for sporting guns since your life doesn't depend on them

[23:52:05] <RandomNinja> what about south korea?

[23:53:30] <FN> And I also do not understand why "tryhard" is used as an insult
[23:53:51] <FN> I would think trying hard even if you fail is something formiddable
[23:54:16] <FN> Because these types of people get things done and achieve results
[23:54:51] <FN> So having "tryhard" as an insult would make the one using it a "lazyjelly"
[23:55:15] <RandomNinja> if you're doing something with your friends and just messing around having fun, like say playing football and going for tactically poor, but fun things, and some dude comes and long and tries his hardest just to score goals, would that be fun?
[23:55:29] <Eywind> oh are we trying about tryhards?
[23:55:35] <RandomNinja> so meta
[23:55:56] <Eywind> The point is if you're trying to be casual you just shouldn't put yourself in a position where you're playing in a different mood than others
[23:55:59] <FN> So what
[23:56:24] <FN> One tryhard can't ruin your fun if it's a genuine fun
[23:56:53] <RandomNinja> !t tryhard

[23:57:09] <One-Trick> just one
[23:57:11] <One-Trick> two, maybe
[23:57:18] <Eywind> yeah but isn't two tryhards just two instances of one tryhard?
[23:57:43] <One-Trick> quality > quantity
[23:58:05] <FN> If you are the only one trying to have fun and all the others are trying hard, are you a tryfun or a funhard then?
[23:58:20] <Eywind> tell that to my friend that loves ordering crave cases from white castle OT
[23:59:01] <FN> Most of the time I do operate in tryhard mode
[23:59:07] <wobniaR> White castle is delicious but it's not worth the next day pain, and smell
[23:59:16] <FN> But I prefer to make it look like I am not trying
[23:59:25] <Eywind> I think there's a difference in trying to play your best and win and being a 'tryhard'
[23:59:46] <FN> Doesn't look like you tried if you fail, and does look cooler if you succeed
[23:59:58] <FN> Tactics!
