[02:54:23] <RandomNinja> turns out I was very wrong
[02:54:37] <MikeM> I hope you caught it before it got too messy
[02:55:00] <RandomNinja> yeah it put a blowoff when it was less than an inch from the opening
[02:55:27] <RandomNinja> it's pretty silly since my 1.072 stout with a similar fill level didn't overflow
[02:57:09] <MikeM> Yeast type and condition at pitch has a lot to do with it.
[02:57:25] <RandomNinja> are you familiar with Nottingham?
[02:57:57] <MikeM> I might have used it once.

[05:47:41] <Eywind> and yes Hamtramck
[05:47:44] <Hamtramck> I avoided the downtown todayso probably super good I did that.
[05:48:03] <Eywind> good call
[05:48:10] <Regulus> RandomNinja, I will accept that blame
[05:48:22] <Regulus> Fox kits are adorable.

[05:49:19] *** LadyAubernon is now known as LadyCameron
[05:49:22] <Eywind> and people come to your home
[05:49:26] <Eywind> homecoming
[05:49:27] <Hamtramck> Homecoming's this thing when you have a bunch of really like, imagine the most gangly and awkward teenagers you can think of.
[05:49:30] <RandomNinja> I just celebrate with nachos
[05:49:33] <Hamtramck> And they're like dressing up in suits
[05:49:41] <Hamtramck> and crowding into every single restaurant.
[05:49:45] <RandomNinja> oh so a comedy show
[05:49:47] <Eywind> just the sizzler
[05:49:56] <LadyCameron> And they're paraded around the track at the high school in convertibles
[05:49:57] <Hamtramck> So you got like a million 20 year olds that look like they're 12.
[05:50:20] <LadyCameron> And then, one is crowned the homecoming king, the other the homecoming queen
[05:50:21] <Hamtramck> Also the guys dress up in tuxedos invariably and look way overdressed and awful. The girls dress up like, uh, /ladies of the night/ and look equally awful.
[05:50:42] <Kelazi5> So typical highschool stuff
[05:50:51] <Hamtramck> Yes except it extends into colleg for some reason
[05:50:52] <Faith> That's highschool homecoming. College Homecoming - You watch a football game and then get drunk.
[05:50:54] <Eywind> collegeeee
[05:50:58] <Eywind> drinking hype
[05:51:03] <Eywind> well Faith
[05:51:04] <LadyCameron> America!
[05:51:05] <Eywind> you drink before the game too
[05:51:09] <RandomNinja> !t bud light
[05:51:10] <DinkyBot> >Artificial blue light emitted from electronic devices
[05:51:11] <Hamtramck> Right, in college the only difference is everyone is way more drunk
[05:51:15] <RandomNinja> confirmed
[05:51:19] <Faith> Or in my case, Watch a football game and then watch Naruto with my roommate
[05:51:25] <RandomNinja> sounds pretty great
[05:51:26] <Eywind> XD
[05:51:29] <Eywind> gross weebs
[05:51:32] <RandomNinja> ew
[05:51:37] <RandomNinja> also ew bronies
[05:51:51] <Eywind> ^
[05:51:55] <Eywind> so yeah okay
[05:51:59] <Eywind> real talk
[05:52:03] <Eywind> has everyone seen the episode today?
[05:52:07] <RandomNinja> aye
[05:52:07] <LadyCameron> Yes!
[05:52:09] <Hamtramck> Yeah just saw it.
[05:52:10] <Faith> He was like "Yooo, they got Naruto on Netflix?". So we're watching all of Shippuden.
[05:52:11] <Eywind> Faith
[05:52:14] <Faith> yessir
[05:52:15] <Eywind> did you watch the episode?
[05:52:17] <Eywind> ok
[05:52:18] <Faith> yes
[05:52:20] <Kelazi5> yup it was great
[05:52:27] <Eywind> cuz I was gonna say if someone hadn't seen it I'd totally take half an hour to watch it again
[05:52:38] <Eywind> cuz I know someone's gonna spoil stuff like we always do
[05:52:41] <Eywind> not that today is from the ep but ya kno
[05:52:49] <Hamtramck> I like the part where Sweetie Belle finally unleashed the shaningan but it was kind of sad when the Triple Stork Demon ate Applebloom's soul.
[05:52:51] <RandomNinja> so buttstamps confirmed
[05:52:54] <Snap_Shot> Scrub spoiler ban is lifted its cool to talk about todays ep
[05:52:57] <Faith> As much as we wish it was from todays episode
[05:53:07] <Faith> knowing our benchmarks
[05:53:14] <Hamtramck> Also what's with all the arancar flooding ponyville looking for the dragonball gundam!
[05:53:20] <Hamtramck> (What's anime?)
[05:53:21] <Eywind> Snap_Shot yeah, but doesn't mean that it's really one of the eps you wanna spoil
[05:53:26] <Eywind> This is a payoff ep
[05:53:30] <Faith> Anime is those dern chinese cartoons
[05:53:35] <LadyCameron> five years of waiting
[05:53:37] <RandomNinja> the ones for nerds?
[05:53:50] <Eywind> I had to explain to my friend today why my skype was blowing up while him and I were talking
[05:53:53] <Faith> only with the neckbeards that make Andrew Luck jealous
[05:53:57] <Eywind> at least he watches anime
[05:54:11] * LadyCameron  watches RWBY and Moonbeam City
[05:54:15] <Eywind> so I could be like "You know like episode 2 where you know the main character has a crush on another one but they don't actually get together until the last few episodes?  It's pretty much that."
[05:54:25] * Muffin_Spectacles is a rather babbling mental mess after seeing today's episode 2 hours ago...and watching it for the third time again.
[05:54:29] <Eywind> hah
[05:54:36] <Eywind> yeah wobniaR has seen it like 5 times already
[05:54:41] <wobniaR> 6
[05:54:42] <LadyCameron> I've seen it once.
[05:54:56] <Snap_Shot> Lol im watching it again as we speak
[05:55:00] <Eywind> Nice
[05:55:03] <Hamtramck> Eywind, like with Zuko and Aang in avatar????
[05:55:04] <Faith> I watch it dubbed and subbed because I'm hardcore like that
[05:55:04] * Muffin_Spectacles was considering reviewing the episode for this week's Blog post...but may just finally use the opportunity to review the Funko CMC figures.
[05:55:04] <Kelazi5> only once for me too
[05:55:06] <Eywind> lol
[05:55:09] <Eywind> Hamtramck nice
[05:55:18] <Eywind> Muffin_Spectacles review: "Not show accurate 0/10"?
[05:55:20] <Muffin_Spectacles> I keep saying, it was like Oprah came and just made an episode happen.
[05:55:26] <LadyCameron> then, I watched Louisville City FC be shutout by the Rochester Rhinos for the USL Eastern Conference Championship 1-0.
[05:55:35] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: I don't get it.
[05:55:45] <Eywind> the figure review
[05:55:46] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: Oh, you mean the figures of the CMC's.
[05:55:55] <Eywind> was always something that Twilight figures got after s3 finale
[05:55:56] <RandomNinja> Faith, subbed is only acceptable option
[05:55:56] <Faith> Rochester Rhinos, the Team we almost lost to in the LHOC lead-up
[05:56:01] <RandomNinja> dubs are 4 skrubs
[05:56:07] <Eywind> you wouldn't dub a car
[05:56:08] <Faith> Subbed Ponies = Best Ponies
[05:56:20] <Faith> Gotta watch the Italian dub for the sick intro
[05:56:21] <LadyCameron> Vinyl could dub a car, though.
[05:56:26] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: I'd say they are about a 9/10. Applebloom to me is perfection, in being a 3D representation of her 2D character. Scootaloo is 2nd best, though the one I had high hopes for, Sweetie Belle, is the last one.
[05:56:32] <Eywind> ah nice
[05:56:39] <Eywind> I was just kinda kidding btw
[05:57:02] <Faith> 3/10 not enough Hugh Jelly

[05:57:44] <Muffin_Spectacles> LadyCameron: Obviously, the marketing peopel are vegetarians ("no bacon hair for the kids! Bacon is pigs, and that's evil!")
[05:57:51] <LadyCameron> boooooo
[05:58:02] <Eywind> sunset shimmer is a 25 year old biker or something
[05:58:12] <LadyCameron> i was thinking 40, but we'll go with that
[05:58:17] <Eywind> not sure she's that old
[05:58:28] <Faith> Sunset has a leather jacket and that makes her immediately cool
[05:58:30] <Eywind> she's only a few years older than Twilight
[05:58:31] <Hamtramck> Sunset Shimmer's way old, idk why she keeps hanging around in a highschool. That's weird.
[05:58:34] <Muffin_Spectacles> What if in the human world, she doesn't actually age...and everyone around her just gets older.
[05:58:36] <Eywind> way older? idk
[05:58:38] <Eywind> But yeah that's kinda weird
[05:58:47] <Eywind> well okay probably a handful of years older, you're right
[05:58:50] <Muffin_Spectacles> Hamtramck: It's obvious: so noone finds...the body.
[05:58:50] <Hamtramck> Well I mean she's like probably five years older than twilight at least.

[05:59:01] <Eywind> I mean you're not wrong
[05:59:04] <Faith> How many times did she fail highschool?
[05:59:15] <Eywind> she dum
[05:59:16] <LadyCameron> but since she brought in the magic, Sunset's world may be everlasting soon enough
[05:59:18] <Eywind> Celestia worst teacher
[05:59:22] <Hamtramck> The EQG ages are weird anyway.
[05:59:27] <Eywind> yea everyone is high school
[05:59:33] <Muffin_Spectacles> I'm still trying to figure out how much time Twilight will have at Canterlot...since I believe they should be going off to college soon?
[05:59:44] <RandomNinja> something something time travel
[05:59:45] <Faith> She's like that kid that's like "I swear I was held back". Uh huh, tell that to your 1.2 GPA
