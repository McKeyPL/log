[02:15:38] <Hamtramck> 1. Bleach is not a food
[02:15:43] <Flurshy> if only my wit were so sharp, Regulus
[02:15:46] <Hamtramck> 2. Seriously don't eat it, I know it looks delicious but don't.
[02:15:53] <Flurshy> I'm the sort that thinks of the perfect thing to say -after- the fact
[02:15:55] <Hamtramck> 3. It'snever okay to be late
[02:16:28] <Hamtramck> My first job interview was like <Me> I don't really want to be here :( <Manager> GREAT! You're hired!
[02:16:31] <Hamtramck> Four years later.
[02:16:36] <Flurshy> really? how
[02:16:39] <Regulus> yea
[02:16:41] <Flurshy> like wat
[02:16:49] <Hamtramck> OKay not literally but still
[02:16:54] <Regulus> How old are you, ball park?
[02:16:55] <StrykerVylon> 4. It's okay to be late as long as it's a very good reason. So basically you or a loved one has to be dieing. 
[02:17:00] <Regulus> 18ish?
[02:17:26] <Regulus> High school or college?
[02:17:58] <Hamtramck> It's more like I gave my resume to some recruiter at a job fair for a Java developer positione that didn't actually exist.
[02:18:15] <Hamtramck> Sometime later I got a phone interview, which I just kind of did with minimal effort.
[02:18:51] <Hamtramck> *THEN* I applied for the job and got an interview for the VB.NET? Database? position that was being offered, and I was like, wow this office is in the middle of nowhere and gross, I'm just going to half BS, half throw inteview intentionally.
[02:19:06] <Hamtramck> Then I got called back for a testing position I never applied to.
[02:19:25] <MikeM> Tripped and fell into a job.
[02:19:33] <Hamtramck> So basically to get the job you don't want, apply for another job you don't want and hen they try to interview you for yet ANOTHER job you don't want, don't want that one.
[02:19:58] <Regulus> Just be personable
[02:20:16] <Regulus> If you sit there mumbling, you won't get hired
[02:20:38] <Hamtramck> Unless you're applying for a nonexistant job that you don't want, of couse. Then you WILL get hired. For something else.
[02:20:40] <Regulus> A bit of hot air and BS works wonders.
[02:21:13] <Regulus> You obviously didn't try to fail hard enough.
[02:21:45] <Regulus> Moar outlandish crackpot theories and tinfoil!
[02:21:54] <Hamtramck> You know, I got hired as a tester, and finding creative ways to make stuff fail is pretty much all that is, so
