[04:12:25] <Phoenix> Taker vs Lesnar II finished bad.
[04:13:10] <Phoenix> Basically Lesnar had him in a submission hold and suddenly the bell was rung thinking it was another screwjob from 1997.
[04:13:41] <Phoenix> The ref chews out the time keeper saying what the heck are you doing and then Taker low blows Lesnar locking in his submission winning the match.
[04:13:58] <Phoenix> You see in a video replay Taker did tap.
[04:14:26] <Phoenix> It made him look like a bitter old man and just..i'm really upset with the finish.

[15:44:49] <Flurshy> there's not a simple mixer for your computer like there is with stage sound >.<
[15:44:52] <RandomNinja> also Flurshy this is where punctuation is important :P
[15:45:23] <FruitNibbler> I wish winders had more comprehensive mixer for all the programs though
[15:45:31] <Flurshy> you can't just adjust each program's volume separately in the main volume mixer, since it only controls output volume
[15:45:37] <Flurshy> indeed
[15:45:40] <RandomNinja> yes you can
[15:45:51] <Flurshy> a separate channel to control each program that is providing sound would be nice
[15:45:59] <Flurshy> like, a master console you can open up

[15:48:17] <RandomNinja> gg
[15:48:19] <FruitNibbler> And many youtubers don't know how to fix audio in compilers, so oftentimes their audio is skewed to one side
[15:48:27] <RandomNinja> I'm just too lazy to use it
[15:48:46] <Flurshy> FN has a point, where is the mono button >.< there should be one
[15:49:19] <RandomNinja> I'm pretty sure you can force it somewhere, but it's not easy and accessible
[15:49:22] <FruitNibbler> That mixer doesn't "notice" crtain rocesses RandomNinja , so you have to workaround them, by lowerig overall volume and jacking up your player (or the other way around
[15:49:41] <RandomNinja> true
[15:49:46] <RandomNinja> it's a decent start though
[15:50:43] <FruitNibbler> The worrying thing that even mixers from Razer, Logitech, BOSE and Senheiserb do not have mono button...

[16:03:38] <FruitNibbler> I have always wrongly assumed that nothern countries have it worse with climate
[16:04:02] <FruitNibbler> But as it turns out having too much heat is a bigger problem than cold weather
[16:04:17] <RandomNinja> this is true
[16:04:44] <RandomNinja> moderate cold can be handled by warm clothes and generous amounts of mead
[16:04:52] <FruitNibbler> Insulation helps with keeping warmth inside no problem without any additional heaters
