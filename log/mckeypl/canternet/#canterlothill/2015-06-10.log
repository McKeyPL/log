[10:44:28] <Zuthal> Why, RandomNinja?
[10:44:31] <Zuthal> You should stop that
[10:44:54] <Araxnus> That is not good. Might wanna fix that. You need blood to live.
[10:45:13] <RandomNinja> probably at a slower rate than my body can recover, but still :P
[10:46:00] <Zuthal> you need to wait about eight weeks between blood donations, and they take, iirc, 500 mL
[10:46:17] * Araxnus sends a Velvet Remedy pony to fix RandomNinja 
[10:46:31] <RandomNinja> Zuthal it's a skin tear that's barely leaking :P
[10:46:48] <RandomNinja> what's more concering is that there's blood in my alcohol system
[10:47:08] <Zuthal> so the human body regenerates blood at about 1.033*10^-7 L/s
[10:47:36] <RandomNinja> is it linear though?
[10:48:03] <Zuthal> I think so, yeah
[10:48:13] <Zuthal> it would then take abotu 560 days to replace all your blood

[15:26:29] <RandomNinja> I have this in my fridge, it seems awesome http://prairieales.com/beer/bomb/
[15:27:23] <Unixkitty> Ooh sounds like it must be an interesting taste
[15:27:40] <RandomNinja> those are all flavors that go well in a stout :3
[15:28:29] <RandomNinja> I've had Pirate Bomb!, which is basically the same beer except aged on different things, it was great
[15:28:46] <Unixkitty> Aged in rum casks?
[15:28:54] <RandomNinja> yeah that one
[15:29:11] *** Joins: Flurshy (Flttrshy@TightRope.is.best.pony)

[15:32:54] <Unixkitty> That's partially true at the moment... I have no clue if they even sell those around here
[15:33:08] <Unixkitty> My dad might know I think
[15:33:31] <Unixkitty> Certainly going to be an odd question to ask him

[15:35:22] <RandomNinja> it's a shame, the US is wonderful nowadays, but most of it never leaves the country
[15:35:33] <Unixkitty> Oh not that kind of odd, more like he would never imagine me being interested in these kinds of drinks
[15:35:38] <RandomNinja> :P
[15:35:48] <Flurshy> I mean, we have wonderful stuff, yeah. but the laws are awful

[16:09:10] <NormanSanzo> hey there guys =D
[16:09:31] <Unixkitty> I think that one was an ale and had a bottle looking similar to shampagne? Also I'm pretty sure it had an electric indigo-ish coloured sticker, kind of like a blueberry
[16:10:28] <RandomNinja> http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/mikkeller-spontandoubleblueberry/172935/

[16:13:38] <RandomNinja> like $30-40 a 75cl bottle

[16:14:15] <RandomNinja> yeah
[16:14:27] <RandomNinja> a sampling flight would be sweet though
