[00:13:03] <Cloud_Zephyr> mathing done
[00:13:15] <Cloud_Zephyr> i learned about the magic of compound interest
[00:13:23] <Eywind> yay
[00:13:41] <Cloud_Zephyr> its not very interesting
[00:13:43] <RandomNinja> A = A(0)*(interest rate)^(time unit)? :P
[00:14:06] <Cloud_Zephyr> nah i used the long winded but easier to remember method
[00:14:18] <Inucroft[NLR]> Cloud_Zephyr so X gains Y& per year
[00:14:28] <Inucroft[NLR]> * Y%
[00:14:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> something like that
[00:15:04] <Inucroft[NLR]> Cloud_Zephyr if i have £315.85 and i get a fixxed rate of interest at 0.25% per annum, how much do i earn in 4 years?
[00:15:24] <Trixie_Lulamoon> ONEE WISHH
[00:15:29] <Cloud_Zephyr> idk already mathed enough for one night :P

[00:16:20] <Eywind> Inucroft[NLR] so it's compounded yearly?
[00:16:27] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Nuuu Robots

[00:16:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> u and your fast methods. maybe i should learn the quick method as i will have limited time in the exam
[00:17:02] <Cloud_Zephyr> but that can wait until tomorrow
[00:17:07] <RandomNinja> it is easy Cloud_Zephyr 
[00:17:37] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh yus
[00:17:43] <Eywind> Compounded just use excel
[00:17:44] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja tis easy for some and hard for others. Do not belittle other peoples weaknesses dude ;)
[00:18:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind i think you no get MS Excel in a exam paper :P
[00:18:07] <RandomNinja> If you have 1% interest in 5 years, you get (1.01)*(1.01)*... = (1.01)^5 :P
[00:18:20] <Eywind> Inucroft[NLR] idk why not
[00:18:21] <RandomNinja> multiply with your original number
[00:18:34] <Eywind> http://gyazo.com/48bc46ed4a62f071ea6a23f174722058 compounded interest is easy :P
[00:18:46] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind cause UK no like people being intelligent and doing things as they would in an actual job
[00:19:24] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja 1% interest is a huge amount for savings! Average in UK is 0.25-0.5 per annum
[00:19:39] <RandomNinja> Inucroft[NLR] yeah it is, but that was just an example
[00:19:44] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t NightmareMoon
[00:19:44] <Eywind> let's see what my interest rate is
[00:19:45] <DinkyBot> NightmareMoon is made of cosmic goldfish scales
[00:19:50] <Eywind> Checking: 0.01% lol
[00:19:51] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> :O
[00:19:52] <NightmareMoon> Lies
[00:19:52] <Trixie_Lulamoon> GLITCH
[00:19:59] <Eywind> Savings: 0.03% 
[00:20:01] <RandomNinja> also I didn't specify savings interest :P
[00:20:16] <Eywind> I currently make about 35c per month in interest
[00:20:19] <MikeM> At least you aren't paying to keep it in the bank.
[00:20:23] <Trixie_Lulamoon> NightmareMoon: Shh. Don't tell Larscis
[00:20:30] <Eywind> MikeM that's cuz I work at Chase lol
[00:20:39] <Eywind> we get premiere checking and savings
[00:21:09] <MikeM> That, and none of the negative interest rate shenanigans.
[00:21:40] <Cloud_Zephyr> JockeTF a question about llamas, not alpacas :O https://i.imgur.com/y0mKlP5.jpg
[00:21:59] <Inucroft[NLR]> MikeM they may do that for debit accounts, but with saving accounts they (in UK) have to pay you for the prillerage of them saving your money in other people's pockets
[00:22:09] <Toothie> Toccata
[00:22:12] <RandomNinja> that's not compound interest though

[01:28:00] <Eywind> Thanks NightmareMoon :)
[01:28:10] <Sombra> I'm not covered in metal you silly billy.
[01:28:20] <Sombra> But ya know, unicorn horns and such probably hurt.

[01:32:53] <Sombra> Oh
[01:33:23] <Eywind> Functionally, Araxnus is probably pretty close to Glimmer Aura, as he handles the radio and the music database
[01:33:27] <Eywind> That's why he has the name

[01:34:27] <Sombra> Functionally I'm probably closer to Sombra because I secretly want everpony to love me, and I hate love.
[01:34:46] <Glimmer_Aura> Pretty much
[01:34:46] <Sombra> Also because I dream about kidnapping princesses.
[01:34:54] <Glimmer_Aura> Also Parchy let it slip.
[01:34:55] <RandomNinja> madness
[01:34:55] <MikeM> What about the whole enslavement thing?
[01:35:08] <Glimmer_Aura> I kinda have it so no one grabs it
[01:35:11] <Sombra> Well, tehy weren't loving me, so I had to enslave them.
[01:35:22] <MikeM> Sounds reasonable.
[01:35:39] <Glimmer_Aura> I could totes like give her a personality
[01:35:50] <Sombra> Or maybe because one of the princesses didn't love me so I became emo, idk.
[01:35:53] <Sombra> One of those things.
[01:36:40] <Sombra> Or maybe the writers didn't feel like putting in an interesting villian for season 3 so they just worked up a no-name sally dark swirly fart cloud of a bad guy.

[02:03:49] <MikeM> Wait. But if we bring beer back from long ago, it won't have aged.
[02:04:06] <RandomNinja> no, we take beer from now and hide it somewhere in 2005
[02:04:21] <MikeM> Ohhh, Yeah. That's it.
[02:04:27] <RandomNinja> also, I found the most Freedom-y of beer https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/09/01/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe
[02:04:57] <MikeM> Neat. Are you gonna make some?
[02:05:01] <Cloud_Zephyr> i should learn wut all this graphics card nonsense means
[02:05:19] <RandomNinja> nah, probably not
[02:05:26] <RandomNinja> got a Dubbel next :P
[02:05:51] <MikeM> Ohh, a lager. I suppose lagering will be pretty easy for you.
[02:06:02] <RandomNinja> no, Belgian Abbey Dubbel :P

[02:06:40] <Cloud_Zephyr> but im guessing the more numbers the better]
[02:06:41] <MikeM> Cooler temperatures, of course. 
[02:06:58] <RandomNinja> I still have to ferment indoors though
[02:07:19] <RandomNinja> not gonna hit 10 C without a fridge
[02:07:52] <RandomNinja> I do have a basement storage room from june though, the mead's going in there
[02:08:06] <RandomNinja> but yeah I'd love to make a Bock
[02:08:35] <MikeM> I did a doppel, and then a small with the second runnings. 
[02:08:46] <RandomNinja> doppelbock?
[02:08:55] <RandomNinja> how did you manage fermentation temperatures?
[02:08:58] <MikeM> Then they sat in bottles in a storage unit in El Paso for 7 months, and tasted funny.
[02:09:08] <RandomNinja> too hot?
[02:09:17] <MikeM> I had an extra fridge for brewing.
[02:09:33] <Cloud_Zephyr> according to the internet this is good for me

[02:09:39] <RandomNinja> yeah I'll probably get a fermentation chamber of some sort eventually
[02:09:53] <RandomNinja> It's pretty good yeah
[02:10:10] <RandomNinja> also tiny enough to fit in a mITX case, I think

[02:16:15] <RandomNinja> I'd have to be drunk every night :P

[02:22:37] <RandomNinja> I've only heard good about it, should try some day
[02:22:42] <RandomNinja> also, fast
[02:22:43] <MikeM> Super easy.
[02:23:08] <RandomNinja> yeah I know, I'm just a bit suspicious about bread yeast
[02:23:22] <RandomNinja> unknown factors
[02:23:25] <MikeM> It's yeast, and a pretty robust strain, too. 
[02:23:37] <RandomNinja> depends on the yeast, doesn't it?
[02:23:39] <MikeM> Won't give you a high alcohol, but it works.
[02:24:00] <RandomNinja> remember we don't have access to the same productsin that market
[02:24:29] <MikeM> Yeah, but no yeast company wants to make bad bread yeast.
[02:24:48] <RandomNinja> I made a cyser with cinnamon and brown sugar last autumn, it's slowly becoming amazing
[02:25:13] <MikeM> I did one with apple cider as the liquid, and 3 or 4 pounds of honey.
[02:25:22] <MikeM> It came out super dry.
[02:25:31] <RandomNinja> sounds like you needed more honey
[02:25:43] <MikeM> I should have back-sweetened more.
[02:25:50] <RandomNinja> yeah also works
[02:26:10] <MikeM> And the last was a pear melomel
[02:26:17] <RandomNinja> also, my dangeously drinkable 17% abv raspberry/blueberry mead
[02:26:27] <RandomNinja> It's running out way too fast :/
[02:26:39] <RandomNinja> how does pear compare to apples?
[02:26:41] <MikeM> It was delicious, and came from a homebrew kit.
[02:26:55] <MikeM> The pear was not nearly as dry as the apples.
[02:27:03] <Regulus> !t Eywind the Slacker
[02:27:13] <RandomNinja> tbh that was probably mostly about the honey amounts
[02:27:19] <DinkyBot> ahem.. i liked the salmon sushi and the vegetable sushi XP
[02:27:22] <RandomNinja> also yeast obviously
[02:27:51] <MikeM> Definitely. I think I used champagne with the cider, and a red wine yeast with the pear.
[02:28:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> dumb pre loudness war music. not loud enough :P
[02:28:23] <RandomNinja> yeah champagne yeast usually hits 16-18% and ferments really dry
[02:28:34] <RandomNinja> I recommend Lalvin 71b-1122 for fruit meads :P
[02:28:47] <MikeM> But so well balanced, Cloud_Zephyr. You as the dj have control over the loudness, as opposed to some board-monkey.
[02:28:56] <Cloud_Zephyr> huehue

[02:29:44] <Regulus> I don't drink 
[02:30:10] <MikeM> Making the drink is so much fun. It's like baking bread, or cooking.
[02:30:29] <RandomNinja> except it takes a month instead of a few hours, and gets you drunk
[02:30:57] <RandomNinja> also beer is liquid bread, so it's kinda like that anyway

[02:34:15] <RandomNinja> or something like that
[02:34:28] <MikeM> Maybe. I would be hesitant to brew with meat.
