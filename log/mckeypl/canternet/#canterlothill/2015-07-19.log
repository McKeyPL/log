[04:02:17] <SilentHoofsteps> alliance or horde everyone?
[04:02:44] <RandomNinja> horde
[04:02:49] <RandomNinja> they have bigger pauldrons
[04:03:11] <RandomNinja> also Varian is a skrub
[04:03:39] <SilentHoofsteps> the bigger the pauldrons the better

[04:49:37] <RandomNinja> with the right perks, 365 critical damage(+damage modifiers), 3 attacks per second, about 50% crit chance

[04:51:40] <RandomNinja> ofc
[04:51:48] <Hamtramck> oh yeah the tactical takedown
[04:51:55] <Regulus> Best weapon in the pre-sequel is the ghost busters laser
[04:51:57] <Hamtramck> but I heard a gep gun was best for a silent takedown

[04:53:43] <SilentHoofsteps> NV is the best in my opinion
[04:53:47] <RandomNinja> yeah
[04:53:59] <SilentHoofsteps> 3 had a better story tho
[04:54:06] <Hamtramck> I like Fo1 and NV a lot. Never played 3. I can rant about why 2 gets on my nerves so much
[04:54:15] <RandomNinja> also, if you get 33% base critical change, which is very doable with light armor
[04:54:27] <RandomNinja> you can get 100% with Embrace of the Mantis King!, which is absurd
[04:54:59] <SilentHoofsteps> indeed

[05:00:18] <Hamtramck> Once you get your weapon skill up to 50ishh you hit pretty frequently

[05:03:09] <RandomNinja> Lil' Mac is pretty good yeah
[05:03:23] <RandomNinja> on the other hand, Lucky exists, and actually has ammo at that stage :P
[05:03:36] <SilentHoofsteps> Lucky's awesome
[05:03:47] <RandomNinja> sweet sweet crit rate
[05:03:50] <SilentHoofsteps> lockpicking tho
[05:04:02] <One-Trick> woa, netflix plays on linux using chrome
[05:04:02] <Regulus> Slaughter all the NPCs
[05:04:04] <SilentHoofsteps> I take that back
[05:04:08] <RandomNinja> ya but lockpicking should be top priority skill
[05:04:15] <SilentHoofsteps> you need lockpicking for lil mac
[05:04:17] <SilentHoofsteps> too
[05:04:22] <Sombra> I really hope fo4 is actually good, and doesn't do the big weapon crafting thing as just an excuse to cut down on the number of weapons
[05:04:30] <MikeM> One-Trick, Netflix and google maps are the only uses for chrome on linux.
[05:04:38] <SilentHoofsteps> Sombra: mhm
[05:04:38] <Hamtramck> I've been working on a translation hack for this old Japanese sandbox RPG called Lunatic Dawn.
[05:04:42] <Hamtramck> Need to actually play that
[05:04:43] <RandomNinja> if you don't have 75 lockpick by the time you leave Primm you're doing it wrong
[05:04:58] <Playstation> Oh it's 10pm
[05:05:06] <Playstation> another hour or so I guess
[05:05:11] <RandomNinja> also interesting thing: play 1 intelligence warmonger with no secondary skills
[05:05:21] <One-Trick> yeah, i hate chrome
[05:05:42] <RandomNinja> it's interesting seeing how much you can't do because you can't pick locks and lack a silver tongue
[05:05:44] <Hamtramck> I liked chrome until it started sucking, then I switched to firefox

[05:05:50] <RandomNinja> yeah...
[05:05:51] <Opera_Pone> How about Opera?
[05:05:53] <Hamtramck> Eventually firefox will be terrible and Chrome or Opera will get good
[05:05:55] <Hamtramck> and so it goes
[05:06:00] <SilentHoofsteps> RandomNinja: I hope they include the low-int dialoges
[05:06:12] <RandomNinja> PC will probably fix that pretty soon, because yay mods
[05:06:57] *** Opera_Pone is now known as Edge_Pone
[05:06:59] <SilentHoofsteps> also hoped to get the pip-boy edition
[05:07:01] <Edge_Pone> yas
[05:07:16] <SilentHoofsteps> sold out
[05:07:17] <RandomNinja> I want to see exactly what my character is going to say, basically to avoid L.A.Noire syndrome
[05:07:22] <Hamtramck> I don't like mods as much as I used to
[05:07:38] <Hamtramck> Like I'm not even using graphic replacers with morrowind right now.
[05:07:57] <Hamtramck> Better Bodies/Better Heads make everyone /too/ pretty.
[05:08:09] <SilentHoofsteps> alright everypony, need some sleep

[05:08:31] <RandomNinja> Character Overhaul is great, basically higher quality faces/hair
[05:08:36] <Hamtramck> Higher-res textures and better models would be great but they deviate too much fromthe source -- Vvardenfell's this nightmarish volcanic wasteland, people are probably going to look rough.

[05:09:59] <Hamtramck> Oh I think so.
[05:10:06] <Hamtramck> I didn't like it because it makes the game exceedingly dark
[05:10:28] <Hamtramck> also I think it still uses better heads/better bodies
[05:10:42] <RandomNinja> it's a massive graphics and sound upgrade that's pretty close to vanilla
[05:11:01] <RandomNinja> it might do, can't remember
[05:12:17] <PinkieShy> Hamtramck i doubt firefox will get terrible its open source, and its always improving based on its user's feedback! 
[05:12:46] <PinkieShy> If it gets terrible for a short time? Maybe. But users will complain, Mozilla will listen and fix :)

[05:19:59] <One-Trick> i dont have flash installed
[05:20:17] <PinkieShy> One-trick so the plugin does make html5 work on netflix in firefox
[05:20:27] <One-Trick> netflix has its own html5 support
[05:20:42] <PinkieShy> also this is kinda funny and sad.. I mean IE used to be my favorite browser but then i learned of firefox<3 http://prntscr.com/7uci4t
[05:21:50] <Hamtramck> I started using Opera when I was younger cause like
[05:21:50] <One-Trick> firefox is getting more and more terrible already, and has been
[05:21:59] <Hamtramck> my parents used IE, and Opera's history was separate..
[05:22:12] <One-Trick> i use a fork of firefox that has a lot of that fluff crap removed
[05:22:37] <PinkieShy> One-trick how is it getting terrible?
[05:22:47] <One-Trick> #1: Sync
[05:22:49] <PinkieShy> I mean Chrome isn't that much better.
[05:22:55] <One-Trick> i dont use chrome either
[05:23:03] <One-Trick> just using it for netflix
[05:24:31] <PinkieShy> Chrome's problems: #1 they spy on you!!, #2 it crashes, #3 its not as customizeable as firefox, #4 when i used it, i remember it kept old versions of the browser in the program files folder (security issue much?) i mean you probably could Open RUN and type old_chrome.exe and it'll open the old chrome version
[05:25:05] <PinkieShy> plus they have flash player built into the browser and flash has security issues gone to bed lol
[05:25:05] <RandomNinja> #2 it crashes
[05:25:14] <PinkieShy> RandomNinja crashes wayy to much
[05:25:14] <RandomNinja> I had this problem with Firefox, never with Chrome

[05:25:47] <Edge_Pone> ah
[05:25:55] <Hamtramck> gosh, when DOESN'T windows 10 come out?
[05:26:02] <keekle> windows 10 is yet another attempt to make us think windows 7 never existed
[05:26:03] <Edge_Pone> shaddup
[05:26:15] <Edge_Pone> But Edge will be cool.
[05:26:17] <Edge_Pone> or is cool

[05:26:35] <Hamtramck> keekly why would they want to do that? 7 was the successful one.
[05:26:41] <Hamtramck> 8's the one I think they'd want people to forget.
[05:26:41] <One-Trick> firefox with pentadactyl+listview tabs is wonderful, though
[05:26:44] <PinkieShy> Edge is using the Trident engine which internet explorer was based on.. So Edge is theory is Internet Explorer just more polished and has extra features.
[05:26:57] <keekle> oh hmm good point
[05:27:16] <keekle> thats right odd numbers is where it is at
[05:27:18] <PinkieShy> I wonder how Edge will handle other browser's extensions that they said it could handle LOL
[05:27:22] <keekle> they wanted to break the curse
[05:27:30] <PinkieShy> I bet i could put a extension on Edge and it crashes the same day.
[05:27:43] <Hamtramck> Man, watching House Hunters on HGTV
[05:27:49] <keekle> so Edge is the new Explorer?

[20:37:38] <FruitNibbler> Welp, aside from sugar residue inside the cooling radiator, it has a good heat conductivity to do the jerb
[20:37:57] <RandomNinja> also no risk of mold and other gunk because alcohol
[20:38:02] <DinkyBot> absolutely adored your cover of this Gypsy bard version
[20:38:16] <FruitNibbler> I would bet the hot points and heat sink are already clogged with some sugar residue
[20:38:26] <One-Trick> should use a clear alcohol
[20:38:31] <FruitNibbler> Yup
[20:38:38] <FruitNibbler> And distilled water

[20:39:04] <One-Trick> i clean my vape parts in vodka. works really well
[20:39:04] <RandomNinja> vodka cooling for next build
[20:39:13] <FruitNibbler> Alcohol is an additive to change water properties, the main heat transporting substance is water
[20:40:23] <FruitNibbler> Vodka has additives too that can ruin your system, after all they add butter and honey to it
[20:40:38] <RandomNinja> why would you add that?
[20:40:46] <FruitNibbler> Distilled water, ethanol, methanol is the best mixture
[20:41:10] <FruitNibbler> RandomNinja, to have it go "smoother" down your throat 
[20:41:44] <FruitNibbler> Some brands of russian vodka have that and it really works: it doesn't burn your throat like other brands
[20:43:35] *** ShowerSymphony is now known as OctaveSymphony
[20:43:46] <One-Trick> you dont really want vaporous
[20:43:58] <Flurshy> One-Trick: I got my first microphone today
[20:44:09] <One-Trick> woo
[20:44:20] <Flurshy> it came in a padded carrying case
[20:44:21] <RandomNinja> now you can insult people over the airwaves
[20:44:25] <Flurshy> not yet
[20:44:27] <One-Trick> ugh, i hate this wireless dongle
[20:44:28] <Flurshy> need muh speaker
[20:45:58] <One-Trick> ive had the same shure sm58 for a long time
[20:46:40] <Sombra> I feel like we should block the word dongle
[20:47:02] <RandomNinja> nu
[20:47:27] <Flurshy> I got the Behringer XM8500
[20:47:46] <FruitNibbler> One-Trick, the ethanol-methanol is in the water to prevent any bacterial/fungal growth in it and to shift the physical properties of the water itself (it can be run faster through the radiatos with spirits added to it)
[20:48:06] <FruitNibbler> Distilled water is perfectly fine on its own
[20:48:19] *** Cloud_Zephyr|Away is now known as Cloud_Zephyr
[20:48:51] <Sombra> I preffer the XM25
[20:48:52] <One-Trick> im just sayin, you dont wanna get that into a situation of high temps like a gpu playing games for hours
[20:49:23] <RandomNinja> delicious gas?
[20:49:35] <One-Trick> wonder what the flash point would be in that situation
[20:49:42] <One-Trick> if you can boil that in the tube
[20:50:02] <One-Trick> sounds like somthing i may wanna try in the lab
[20:51:27] <RandomNinja> the vaporization increases pressure, raising the vape temp?
[20:51:55] <FruitNibbler> There are mixtures for different situations
[20:52:14] <FruitNibbler> If you are running hot it makes sense to use mineral oil instead
[20:52:22] <FruitNibbler> That thing doesn't boil
[20:52:41] <RandomNinja> I mean, ethanol boils at what, 70-something?
[20:52:41] <FruitNibbler> Although a specific heat of oil is way less than water
[20:52:49] <One-Trick> http://i.imgur.com/X9MYw.jpg
[20:52:53] <One-Trick> just use vegetable oil
[20:52:58] <One-Trick> then you can eat and play games
[20:53:08] <FruitNibbler> So you'd need a faster and stronger pump for oil
[20:53:19] <RandomNinja> One-Trick, there's also this http://images.pcworld.com/images/article/2011/01/nvidia_keg_computer-5133804.jpg
[20:53:33] <FruitNibbler> Oil is both more viscous and needs to be run at twice the speed the water circulated
[20:53:38] <FruitNibbler> circulates*
[20:53:58] <One-Trick> why a keg
[20:54:08] <RandomNinja> because it's also an actual beer keg
[20:54:15] <RandomNinja> with beer in it
[20:54:15] <One-Trick> but.. why
[20:54:26] <FruitNibbler> Because they can
[20:54:27] <One-Trick> heat and beer are to things i dont want together
[20:54:30] <RandomNinja> because you never know when you want a beer
[20:54:32] <One-Trick> err two
[20:54:35] <FruitNibbler> Au contrair
[20:54:45] <RandomNinja> apparently it's pretty well isolated, the beer is kept at drinking temp
[20:55:04] <FruitNibbler> In bavaria itself there is a brand of beer that is meant to be consumed in warm condition
[20:55:16] <One-Trick> yes, but thats bavaria. we dont care about that
[20:55:16] <RandomNinja> gluhwein?
[20:55:31] <FruitNibbler> Glühwein is not beer
[20:55:40] <RandomNinja> right, I was thinking of something else
[20:55:44] * One-Trick is technically from down there, but forget about that
[20:56:21] <RandomNinja> right, Glühkriek, that's belgian tho
[20:57:50] <One-Trick> and because one exists doesnt  mean it should exist
