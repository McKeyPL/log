[22:59:28] <EM-C> Hey thereallynewmop12100.  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear the ping.  The volume was too low.
[23:00:05] <EM-C> And RandomNinja: I just got back from taking my mother to a dental specialist up in Jackson for a consultation.
[23:00:19] <RandomNinja> that's good though, right?
[23:00:25] <EM-C> I don't know how much longer I'm going be able to chauffeur her around.
[23:00:36] <EM-C> Yeah.  It's good.  Though it was only a consultation.
[23:00:44] <EM-C> Her blood pressure was pretty high, though.
[23:01:00] <EM-C> The extraction is scheduled for 10am next Tuesday.

[23:01:07] <RandomNinja> who ever said bloodletting was a useless procedure?
[23:01:20] <EM-C> Then the next day she and I both have to see our cardiologist.
[23:01:49] <EM-C> She's on Pradaxa and will have to stop taking it for five days prior to the procedure.
[23:02:26] <EM-C> I'm just too sore and worn out and crippled to do this any more.  I should just be allowed to sit at my computer and read pony fics.
[23:02:59] <EM-C> So tired...knees and right shoulder are so sore.
[23:03:26] <EM-C> Oh, I reinstalled AVG on Sunday and it's working now.
