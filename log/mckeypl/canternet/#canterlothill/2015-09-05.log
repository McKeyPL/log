[05:55:37] <Eywind> ah nice dude
[05:55:47] <Smitty> you from canada 
[05:55:53] <Smitty> ?
[05:56:06] <ynoP> Western New York
[05:56:18] <ynoP> Sooo no
[05:56:44] <Smitty> oh, do you mean the theme park ?
[05:57:00] <ynoP> Ye
[05:57:18] <ynoP> They recently installed "The Brain Drain" in the waterpark, and for some reason somebody decided it'd be a good idea to go on that first
[05:57:48] <ynoP> It's that one with the cylindrical capsule at the top that locks you in
[05:58:32] <Smitty> that sounds wicked, only water perk i got is the cliff jump spots near my home 
[05:58:52] <ynoP> There's a big green button, and the operator tells you to get in position, presses the button, and then there's a 3 second countdown and the floor drops out from under you and you fall straight down
[05:59:27] <ynoP> The slide drops and then levels out quickly to almost flat, and then goes in a wide spiral down
[05:59:53] <ynoP> The result is quite crushing, gravity-wise
[05:59:53] <Smitty> thats amazing 
[06:00:22] <Smitty> canada dosent have enough of that stuff 
[06:01:15] <ynoP> It sucks all the air out of you, and then the water in the slide sprays your face the whole time. It's closed all the way and non-translucent so pitch black.
[06:01:32] <ynoP> I was gasping for air the whole time. Couldn't really breathe
[06:02:10] <ynoP> All my friends said the same thing. They could not get a full breath in the whole 10 seconds

[06:06:32] <ynoP> That's the tallest one I've ever been on, and I will say, you really are falling. It's not flying.
[06:06:44] <ynoP> And it's not really sliding either
[06:07:21] <ynoP> Then I go to my aunt's house or whatever and I see these kiddy slides and they just look like chairs

[06:10:01] <ynoP> My friends went on the giant 180ft cable swing thing today
[06:10:41] <Eywind> wow
[06:10:45] <ynoP> The first 60ft is low tension dead drop weight
[06:11:08] <ynoP> Then the cable pull starts to kick in and you start swinging
[06:11:08] <Hamtramck> nnnnnnnnnope
[06:11:14] <ynoP> I didn't do that one
[06:12:23] <ynoP> I'd be to afraid to detach the cable at the top and start falling
[06:13:21] <ynoP> But if it were that or the slingshot, which catapults you at near twice the height, I'd probably pick the swing

[07:03:40] <ynoP> Cliff side bungee jumping, falling 100ft into a net back first... You really have to be a certain kind of person to operate that stuff.
[07:04:04] <ynoP> I wonder what qualifies as a fear of heights
[07:04:20] <ynoP> Because there are heights, and then there are extreme heights
[07:04:58] <ynoP> I probably couldn't handle being a construction worker without a harness or anything
[07:05:10] <ynoP> But does that make me afraid of heights? 
[07:06:11] <ynoP> Like, is that fear or is that just caution or a line of defense because I'm conscious of the fatal and immediate danger?

[18:17:37] <FruitNibbler> Did you know that Rasputin wasn't the sexeh devil as the west paints him?
[18:18:16] <RandomNinja> you mean he wasn't Russia's greatest love machine?
[18:18:34] <FruitNibbler> It's just that priests in the west are associated with celebacy, and in orthodox church that applies only to highest ranks

[18:18:55] <DinkyBot> http://twitter.com/VeryLycan/status/640197418240245760
[18:18:58] <FruitNibbler> The low-rank priests (which Rasputin was btw) have no restrictions like that
[18:19:14] <FruitNibbler> They can love and marry like normal human beings
[18:20:09] <thereallynewmop12100> No LDB today
[18:20:30] <RandomNinja> durn
[18:20:36] <FruitNibbler> I guess that it just looked outrageous for foreign counscils, misters and ambassadors that were in the same circles as Rasputin, hence the origin of this myth

[18:21:31] <RandomNinja> this is the exact reason Dredd and Mad Max were great
[18:21:54] * FruitNibbler steals RandomNinja's romance subplots
[18:21:57] <RandomNinja> yay
[18:22:45] <RandomNinja> srsly tho why does every movie have to have stupid romance subplots that aren't relevant to the main one?
[18:24:08] <thereallynewmop12100> Cloud_Zephyr: We have a emergency!!  Can you play your set during LDB's timeslot?
[18:25:16] * RandomNinja applies 100% a-plot focused action movies to FruitNibbler 
[18:25:30] <FruitNibbler> I like those
[18:25:45] <FruitNibbler> like Jackie Chan movies
[18:26:08] <FruitNibbler> Light-hearted, not too serious and action packed to the brim
[18:26:33] <RandomNinja> yeah
[18:26:36] <FruitNibbler> Any sub-plot in those seem like a joke
[18:26:39] *** Joins: Crimson_Tail (Bluepon@Pony-mfh7oq.md.comcast.net)
[18:27:26] <FruitNibbler> Though Bourne may be considered an action packed serious movie
[18:27:40] <FruitNibbler> though aruibly not without a subplot too
[18:27:54] <RandomNinja> did you see Dredd tho?
[18:28:36] <FruitNibbler> Which one?
[18:28:41] <RandomNinja> the new one
[18:28:58] <FruitNibbler> I saw the old one, the animated series, the voiced comic and the new one
[18:29:03] <RandomNinja> it has a second female lead
[18:29:17] <RandomNinja> but it's all lolnope, veteran-rookie cop movie
[18:29:31] <FruitNibbler> I find both old and new to be good
[18:29:42] <RandomNinja> I AM THE LAUUUW
[18:30:04] <FruitNibbler> Although animated and comic are far more shaped up and have deeper characters overall
[18:30:24] <RandomNinja> well yeah the movies are pretty much one-shots
[18:30:28] <FruitNibbler> Heck they even explain and motivate the reasoning of the bad guy
[18:30:38] <RandomNinja> no room for that kind of character development 
[18:30:46] <FruitNibbler> The villain in the las Dredd was especially 2-bit
[18:31:24] <RandomNinja> 2-bit?
[18:31:59] <FruitNibbler> She was bad, psychotic and extremely misanthropic out of the blue, it just happened to be so
[18:32:35] <FruitNibbler> Not reasoning or story, not even much of good acting IMO
[18:33:12] <FruitNibbler> Although I must admit that villains are harder roles to play for actors than good guys
[18:33:51] <RandomNinja> yeah
[18:34:03] <RandomNinja> probably way more fun tho

[18:36:22] <RandomNinja> to be fair batman was incredibly uninterestingly portayed
[18:36:47] <RandomNinja> and Ledger was fantastic, if unorthodox
[18:37:48] <RandomNinja> either way, Mark Hamill is the one true Joker :P
[18:39:17] <FruitNibbler> I liked the penguin villain played by Nicholson
[18:39:29] <FruitNibbler> Or however you spell Jack's last name
[18:39:29] <RandomNinja> that was the 80's movies?
[18:39:33] <FruitNibbler> YUp
[18:39:37] <RandomNinja> indeed
[18:39:53] <FruitNibbler> Despite the movie being utterly silly and childish
[18:40:03] <FruitNibbler> That one actor saved the grace of it
[18:40:34] <RandomNinja> yeah the 80's batman movies were pretty campy
[18:40:42] <RandomNinja> Fries tho
[18:41:12] <FruitNibbler> I wonder if producers did one too many LSD with those batman movies?
