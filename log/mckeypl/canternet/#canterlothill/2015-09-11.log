[00:24:19] <StrykerVylon> The Synchron one?
[00:24:20] <StrykerVylon> Yup.
[00:24:22] <StrykerVylon> Mostly.
[00:24:29] <StrykerVylon> Just need a few Extra Deck cards.
[00:24:35] <Eywind> yea I saw your tweeters
[00:24:43] <StrykerVylon> One of which wont be coming out for like a month ;A;
[00:24:48] <Eywind> oh japanese cards
[00:24:55] <StrykerVylon> Yeah...
[00:25:07] <StrykerVylon> So to fill in im using a Black Rose Dragon.
[00:25:24] <StrykerVylon> Might take something else out though and keep Black Rose in.

[00:27:27] <Eywind> I remember when BRD was a trade throw-in
[00:27:34] <Eywind> like it wasn't worth buying the BRD tins generally
[00:27:40] <StrykerVylon> I go into Black Rose about as often as most other things. xD
[00:27:52] <Eywind> I mean I remember driving around and buying TUS out of Goyo Guardian tins though
[00:28:09] <StrykerVylon> Was actually able to go into Shooting Star Dragon and Stardust Warrior today.
[00:28:14] <StrykerVylon> So that was cool~
[00:28:28] <Eywind> cool IDK what either of those do
[00:28:33] <StrykerVylon> I have like... 4 BRD's?
[00:28:35] <Eywind> cuz they're newer than plaguespreader zombie :P
[00:28:38] <StrykerVylon> :P
[00:28:52] <Eywind> last event I ever played in Magic was the first regionals that Plaguespreader Zombie was legal in
[00:29:24] <Eywind> My friend and I had built a deck that broke open the format, I went 4-4, and realized that I had no fun at the event because everyone there was horrible and I wasn't enjoying playing
[00:29:33] <StrykerVylon> Shooting Star Dragon is an evolution of Stardust Dragon and Stardust Warrior is basically a free Solemn Judgement and it lets you summon a Warrior monster for free once it's destroyed.
[00:29:41] <Eywind> cool
[00:29:44] <Eywind> sounds powerful
[00:30:03] <Eywind> I remember when I won a tournament because of Skull Archfiend of Lightning beats
[00:30:10] <Eywind> that card's amazing, just sayin
[00:30:24] <StrykerVylon> old man :P
[00:30:28] <Eywind> and I was ripping myself off to get a twin-headed behemoth before the event
[00:30:48] <Eywind> it was a local tournament of like 30 people and the prize was like 50 in booster packs or something
[00:30:53] <Eywind> with 5 entrance fee
[00:31:04] <Eywind> and I cast Gilford the Lightning to win I think
[00:31:08] <StrykerVylon> Ah.
[00:31:15] <Eywind> was right after that came out
[00:31:32] <Eywind> 9/1/05 lol
[00:31:39] <StrykerVylon> Only reason I lost the duel today is cause i made some bad late game plays.
[00:31:40] <Eywind> man my early decks were so good
[00:31:46] <Eywind> "good" :P
[00:31:50] <Eywind> ah misplays are bad
[00:31:59] <StrykerVylon> Yeah.
[00:32:10] <Eywind> You shoulda played when Metamorphosis was legal
[00:32:13] <Eywind> then you could see misplays :P
[00:32:18] <StrykerVylon> This deck also has the ability to brick hard but it's very rare.
[00:32:33] <Eywind> ouch
[00:32:50] <StrykerVylon> When it does happen I can usually work around it though.

[02:27:19] <ynoP> Yeah, I took an Advil and I've been sitting down for a while
[02:28:02] <ynoP> Doesn't hurt... Just a constant dull ache
[02:28:51] <MikeM> More water, more ibuprofen. You'll be ok.
[02:29:46] <ynoP> What puzzles me is that he went out of his way to run to the ball when he was going to send it in the opposite direction.
[02:30:39] <ynoP> It wasn't his position
[02:31:06] <ynoP> And then I told him that and he said it was my fault for not calling it
[02:31:54] * Flurshy boops someone
[02:31:59] <Eywind> was your fault for having such a hard head
[02:32:33] <MikeM> So, what happened with the ball?
[02:32:45] <ynoP> Well, I wanted to believe it went ovee
[02:32:59] <ynoP> But my dad told me it only went like, 3 feet.
[02:33:13] <ynoP> Because crash.

[02:35:06] <ynoP> I've never liked that kid in the first place, because he's obstinate and prideful, but what really aggravates me is that one of the seniors is friends with him and will side with him no matter who's fault, so he was also nagging on me
[02:35:40] <ynoP> And if you're wondering where the coach was the whole time... Well so am I

[04:10:00] <Flurshy> no I'm srs
[04:13:14] <Flurshy> also yay, you can drag tracks directly from foobar into serato dj intro
[04:13:17] <PowerPlay> I'd say around 3-5 minutes, depending on overall crowd interest.
[04:13:46] <Eywind> I think it also depends on what atmosphere
[04:13:58] <Flurshy> hmm
[04:14:08] <Eywind> If you're the focus, you're looking at like radio length for a solid song that's not repetitive, or 1-2 if it's not as diverse
[04:14:14] <thereallynewmop12100> PowerPlay: or maybe radio edits
