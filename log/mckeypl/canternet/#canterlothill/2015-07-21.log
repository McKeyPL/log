[04:30:19] <Eywind> You can turn it off
[04:30:48] <Playstation> I mean like, I don't see the "Get Windows 10" icon there, and it should be there

[04:31:29] <Hamtramck> google for how to uninstall the update in question
[04:31:31] <Eywind>  you can turn the little update thing off
[04:31:38] <Hamtramck> o
[04:31:47] <Playstation> Oh okay
[04:32:21] <Eywind> you can go in "installed updates" and remove the KB3035583 update apparently
[04:32:56] <MikeM> If you don't want the update reminder.
[04:32:58] <Eywind> "Update for Microsoft Windows (KB3035583)"
[04:33:04] <Eywind> it'll remove that whole thing, then you can go and install in a couple weeks
[04:33:11] <SilentHoofsteps> or just remove the executable from startup, there must be one
[04:33:12] <Eywind> or whenever you're good to update
[04:33:45] <Eywind> but you have tor jump through a couple other hoops to make sure it STAYS deleted

[17:48:22] <RandomNinja> this is somehow Camerons fault
[17:48:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> indeed
[17:48:54] <UniteThePinkies> Went to the fair a couple of days ago and most of the rides were playing electrohouse music quite loudly... carnival rides already pretty much turn me into Pinkie Pie for a whole week afterward (idk why lol... usually I'm more of a Twilight Sparkle type) but this combo was like macaroni and cheese... or pickle barrels and kumquats! 
[17:49:29] <Cloud_Zephyr> sounds like RandomNinja would like it
[17:49:49] <RandomNinja> but electrohouse
[17:49:55] <RandomNinja> also ew going outside

[17:50:48] <Cloud_Zephyr> heresy
[17:50:59] <UniteThePinkies> (btw just in case we have different definitions, think Archie for an example)
[17:51:27] <RandomNinja> not an EDM person
[17:51:44] <UniteThePinkies> Ah. Gotcha.
[17:52:00] <UniteThePinkies> Thought you were since Cloud said you'd like it
[17:52:06] <JockeTF> I like alpacas.
[17:52:09] <RandomNinja> ^
[17:52:23] <RandomNinja> nah it's a running joke kinda
[17:52:35] <UniteThePinkies> Explain?
[17:52:46] <UniteThePinkies> Even the element of laughter needs a joke explained occasionally :p
[17:53:09] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr and I try to convert each other

[17:53:29] * JockeTF doesn't need to convert anypony since everypony likes alpacas already.
[17:53:41] <RandomNinja> JockeTF, except danskj√§vlar
[17:53:41] <UniteThePinkies> Ah. Actually metal is in my top 5 too
[17:54:14] <RandomNinja> what kinds of metal
[17:54:47] <UniteThePinkies> EDM >>>>>> alt/indie > metal >>> basically everything else (that first part had a couple extra > signs added a couple of days ago lol)
[17:54:58] <UniteThePinkies> Melodic/symphonic mostly
[17:55:00] <RandomNinja> lul
[17:55:36] <RandomNinja> so Rhapsody
[17:56:50] <UniteThePinkies> Yeah... oh also power metal... Dragonforce is pretty high up there
[17:57:08] <RandomNinja> have you tried Gloryhammer?
[17:57:20] <UniteThePinkies> Though (heresy I know) I like nightcore mixes of it :P
[17:57:46] <UniteThePinkies> Metal sounds way better when everyone sounds like Pinkie Pie
[17:58:09] <RandomNinja> that is indeed heresy
[17:58:33] <UniteThePinkies> Not sure I'd say that in that exact way usually, but I'm feeling the Pinkie in my soul so I'll just go with it :P
[17:59:13] <UniteThePinkies> Oh and when I'm Pinkie I'm a League of Legends god... hopefully I don't have a huge losing streak next week

[19:36:20] <UniteAllPinkies> (which actually would be a great name for a ride owned by Pinkie)
[19:36:32] <UniteAllPinkies> it breaks the fourth wall AND is pony-relevant!
[19:36:46] <RandomNinja> the plot twist is that it explodes
[19:37:05] <UniteAllPinkies> My headcanon is that Pinkie and Rainbow Dash would both love those kinds of rides
[19:37:37] <UniteAllPinkies> though come to think of it it's not just a headcanon given that Pinkie seemed to enjoy flying on Twilight and Dashie obviously likes the Sonic Rainboom
