[06:10:52] <Eywind> Hamtramck you can like what you want I guess
[06:11:03] <Ali> Eywind, does this mean pre releases are gonna be nuts?
[06:11:10] <Eywind> Nah, there'll be at most 1 in an entire prerelease
[06:11:21] <Ali> Hmmm?
[06:11:28] <Ali> Just how bucking rare are they?
[06:11:32] <Eywind> It's slightly less rare than a foil mythic
[06:11:40] <Eywind> since there's 25 and there's 15 foil mythics normally
[06:11:49] <Ali> The hell
[06:11:54] <Eywind> so in total they're a bit less rare
[06:12:00] <Hamtramck> Eywind I don't like anything really :(
[06:12:02] <Hamtramck> help :(
[06:12:03] <Eywind> hah
[06:12:03] <Ali> Yeah but they're gonna gost a ton.
[06:12:06] <Eywind> They are
[06:12:09] <Eywind> Early thoughts are like
[06:12:12] <Eywind> Fetches: 100-200
[06:12:14] <Eywind> Shocks: 75-100
[06:12:17] <Eywind> Tango: 50
[06:12:21] <Ali> Tango?
[06:12:26] <Hamtramck> no seriously though the block with art that actually bugged me was like
[06:12:32] <Eywind> the new come into play tapped uless you control two basic lands duals
[06:12:32] <Hamtramck> Whatever before Torment was?
[06:12:41] <Eywind> block before? Masques?
[06:12:42] <Ali> Ah, is that their nickname now?
[06:12:46] <Eywind> that's the early nickname
[06:12:56] <Eywind> we're still waiting on Graham and the LRR group to make up the real ones lol
[06:13:11] <Eywind> oh sorry invasion block
[06:13:16] <Eywind> invasion block was before odyssey block
[06:13:48] <Hamtramck> Apocalypse and Planeshift
[06:14:12] * Ali was in magic in the Alara block, then stopped at M12/13  Then back in again in M15-Khans...work hosed her of a long run there.
[06:15:20] * Ali isn't even sure how she got all her Stormbreath Dragons.
[06:15:35] <Eywind> cuz they're awesome
[06:15:45] <Ali> They were only $11 Eywind 
[06:16:03] <Ali> I got a set of them cause I thought there was NO WAY they would be that cheap
[06:16:04] <Eywind> well they're $4 now ;/
[06:16:11] <Ali> Not surprised, about to rotate
[06:16:13] <Eywind> cuz of rotation out yeah
[06:16:28] <Ali> They don't shine in modern like they did in standard to me
[06:16:40] <Eywind> if it costs 4 or more in red it better win you the game
[06:16:51] <Ali> Eywind, you know why I ran it :P
[06:16:54] <Eywind> yep
[06:16:58] <Chaotic_Harmony> Magic?
[06:17:00] <Ali> Gen servant
[06:17:00] <Eywind> yes
[06:17:03] <Eywind> Chaotic_Harmony want to talk magic?
[06:17:03] <Chaotic_Harmony> Oh oh we talking Magic?
[06:17:07] <Ali> Most under rated card in a way
[06:17:13] <Eywind> you should come play my cube
[06:17:17] <Hamtramck> When I played it a million years ago I think it was Invasion block, and I was like, in eighth grade
[06:17:21] <Chaotic_Harmony> I just got a card called "Exquisite firecraft" :3
[06:17:22] * Ali whines to Eywind 
[06:17:25] <Eywind> yea firecraft is sweet
[06:17:27] <Chaotic_Harmony> Worth 10$ :3
[06:17:27] <Hamtramck> idk how long i was into magic
[06:17:35] <Eywind> yea it's just hard to get rid of unless there's a lot of standard players around
[06:17:36] <Ali> Firecraft is a good kill spell
[06:17:45] <Chaotic_Harmony> I play commander myself
[06:17:46] <Eywind> It's a slightly worse Urza's Rage
[06:17:49] <Eywind> ah what's your general?
[06:17:53] <Ali> But more cost friendly
[06:17:54] <Hamtramck> I didn't have any friends growing up to play games with
[06:18:01] <Chaotic_Harmony> Yisen, something bard
[06:18:04] <Chaotic_Harmony> 3 mana green
[06:18:05] <Eywind> ah yisan the wanderer bard
[06:18:05] * Ali pulls out Sliver Lord

[06:18:42] <Ali> The good ones I mean
[06:18:44] <Eywind> we all play noob tribes :P
[06:18:50] <Ali> Not those crappy M14 ones
[06:18:55] <Ali> Well other than the mythic one
[06:18:57] <Eywind> 'crappy' lol
[06:18:59] <Eywind> they're better than the other ones
[06:19:07] <Ali> Some are maybe
[06:19:10] <Eywind> well like... predatory sliver > muscle sliver
[06:19:15] <Chaotic_Harmony> I had one game Eywind
[06:19:17] <Eywind> cuz it doesn't affect their changelings
[06:19:23] <Ali> I got all the big slivers
[06:19:28] <Chaotic_Harmony> I used solring to get a green medalion out
[06:19:33] <Eywind> winged sliver < galerider sliver
[06:19:34] <Eywind> seems good lol
[06:19:40] <Chaotic_Harmony> And I turn 2 freylase'd
[06:19:43] <Chaotic_Harmony> Planswalker
[06:19:43] <Eywind> ah nice
[06:19:48] <Eywind> yeah Freyalise is underrated
[06:19:52] <Chaotic_Harmony> Against an artifact deck
[06:19:57] <Eywind> haha
[06:19:58] <Chaotic_Harmony> They scooped
[06:20:03] <Eywind> well yeah
[06:20:11] <Ali> What is the card Eywind that reduces costs of activated abilities you control by 2?
[06:20:16] <Eywind> training ground

[06:20:32] <Ali> Slivers abuse it so well
[06:20:41] <Ali> Heartstone isn't needed with training grounds
[06:20:44] <Eywind> I was watching a stream
[06:20:44] <Chaotic_Harmony> Another game I had a planeswalker that made all my forests in my deck come to the field as 4/4 elementals
[06:20:51] <Ali> One you get Queen out with the mana gen on a sac
[06:20:58] <Ali> And gemstone and haste
[06:21:06] <Chaotic_Harmony> And I had an elf with the tap ability "sacrifice this elf to untap all forests"
[06:21:06] <Eywind> yeah
[06:21:07] <Ali> Its GG all, infinite mana
[06:21:15] <thereallynewmop12100> I pull out RandomNinja (9999999HP - Nerd), miss (25HP - Best friend of thereallynewmop12100) and JockeTF (60HP - Alpaca Fan)
[06:21:16] <Eywind> Someone was on stream and had hammer of purphoros for all haste and gemstone and sliver queen
[06:21:20] <Chaotic_Harmony> Killed both opponents in same turn :3
[06:21:27] <Eywind> and an opponent plays Primal Vigor, which is when a player would make a token make two instead
[06:21:32] <Eywind> so the sliver dude's like "alright cool I make infinite tokens"
[06:21:52] <Ali> Eywind, I would use the sac a sliver for 2 damage
[06:22:01] <Eywind> Chaotic_Harmony: Nissa?
[06:22:37] <Eywind> but yeah that's pretty sweet, still need to give them haste
[06:22:56] <Ali> Yeah, I put 2 haste slivers in the deck just in case.
[06:23:09] <Eywind> yeah all the haste ones are worth it
[06:23:10] <Ali> Tap for 1 mana of any color, sac for 2 black
[06:23:11] <Chaotic_Harmony> Eywind: yeah her
[06:23:22] <Ali> Make 3 tokens cause they cost 1 mana now
[06:23:26] <Eywind> yup
[06:23:36] <Chaotic_Harmony> Oh Eywind I have a sick enchant to put on Yisan too
[06:23:42] <Chaotic_Harmony> Instill energy
[06:23:43] <Ali> Then start the sac for damage till everyone is dead
[06:23:47] * Snapai howdy
[06:23:52] <Eywind> hah yeah Instill Energy is totally underrated
[06:23:54] <Eywind> hey Snapai
[06:24:00] <Chaotic_Harmony> I can untap the enchanted creature an additional time per turn
[06:24:03] <Eywind> mmhmm
[06:24:08] <Chaotic_Harmony> Get out bigger drops even faster
[06:24:16] <Eywind> yeah definitely a good card in there
[06:24:21] <Chaotic_Harmony> Then put boots on him
[06:24:23] <Ali> You have Omnath Chaotic_Harmony?
[06:24:33] <Chaotic_Harmony> Ali: not sure who that is so no

[06:24:42] <Snapai> wassup
[06:24:50] <Eywind> 2G 1/1 that green mana doesn't go away from your mana pool and gets stronger for all the green mana in your mana pool
[06:24:52] <Ali> He's a green guy that gets bigger the more green mana you have floating
[06:25:00] <Chaotic_Harmony> Oooooh?

[23:36:35] <johnsey> haven't had that one yet but doppelbocks are good
[23:36:44] <RandomNinja> yeah
[23:36:48] <RandomNinja> so much malty goodness
[23:38:38] <RandomNinja> you should get one, you get a neat plastic goat statuette with it :P
[23:39:56] <johnsey> neat
[23:40:00] <johnsey> i'll see if i can find it

[23:41:55] <johnsey> think i know just the place to look for it
[23:42:09] <RandomNinja> it doesn't seem bery hard to find
[23:42:56] <johnsey> haven't seen it at a regular super market at least
[23:43:22] <RandomNinja> aren't their sortiments pretty poor in general?
[23:44:22] <johnsey> yeah, though some have a corner for less common stuff
[23:45:55] <RandomNinja> my local store is shockingly diverse
[23:46:06] <johnsey> like the welternburger kloster one, first time i saw it. might disappear again in a few weeks from the shelves there, who knows
[23:46:27] <RandomNinja> only <3.5% because sweden, but still easily 50 different beers, possibly 100
[23:46:52] <johnsey> <3.5% because taxes?
[23:47:06] <RandomNinja> >3.5% is only sold in government run stores
[23:47:15] <RandomNinja> below in regular grocery stores
[23:47:18] <johnsey> ah huh
[23:47:46] <johnsey> is <3.5% without age restrictions then?
[23:47:49] <johnsey> or lower?
[23:47:56] <RandomNinja> yeah it's weird and the only arguments for keeping it that way seem to be moralism
[23:48:14] <RandomNinja> <2.25% is legally considered non-alcoholic
[23:48:21] <johnsey> makes sense
[23:48:25] <Inucroft[NLR]> <1%
[23:48:27] <johnsey> good luck getting drunk on that!
[23:48:35] <Inucroft[NLR]> in the UL
[23:48:37] <RandomNinja> try drinking a case in a few hours
[23:48:48] <RandomNinja> you won't get blackout drunk, but you'll definitely feel it
[23:49:12] <RandomNinja> 2.25-3.5% is 18, government stores are 20
[23:49:51] <johnsey> so it's percentage based? i guess it makes more sense than our system, in a way
[23:50:10] <RandomNinja> what's that, original gravity?
[23:50:18] <Regulus> Definitely more sense than ours
[23:50:23] <johnsey> beer and wine are 16+, everything else is 18+
[23:50:42] <Regulus> 21+ for any alcohol here
[23:50:49] <Regulus> Any.
[23:51:03] <RandomNinja> because a bottle of Madeira won't destroy you just as well as hard liquor :V
[23:51:06] <johnsey> funnily enough, bock beer or wine has a lot more alcohol in it than something mix drinks with vodka for example, which are 18+
[23:51:20] <johnsey> *some
[23:51:24] <RandomNinja> I've had 14% abv stouts
[23:51:34] <RandomNinja> it starts to get silly at that point
[23:51:45] <johnsey> it's because these mix drinks became way too popular with children
[23:52:05] <RandomNinja> ew thin sugary nonsense though
[23:52:11] <johnsey> like smirnoff ice
[23:52:24] <johnsey> there were tons of these like 10 years ago
[23:52:25] <RandomNinja> isn't that like 4%?
[23:52:26] <johnsey> all 16+
[23:52:33] <johnsey> maybe even less
[23:52:47] <johnsey> but then some people noticed that people drank them like sodas lol
[23:53:35] <RandomNinja> you mean like chugging or casually?

[23:53:45] <johnsey> casually
[23:53:57] <RandomNinja> yeah I can see that being an issue
[23:54:26] <johnsey> it's more appealing the younger generation than beer because sweet and all
