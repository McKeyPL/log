[00:01:26] *** sunsetwubs is now known as sunsetwubs|LIVe
[00:01:26] <Boxer> I'm talking about the Cake children and the school ponies. 
[00:01:33] <Zuthal> RandomNinja: FO:E
[00:01:35] <Zuthal> duh
[00:01:41] <Hamtramck> what if "school ponies" were like
[00:01:43] <Hamtramck> not ponies in school
[00:01:44] <Zuthal> it will be made canon
[00:01:48] <Hamtramck> but ponies that were schools
[00:01:58] <Zuthal> Hamtramck, what did you smoke?
[00:01:58] <RandomNinja> we almost had that already tho
[00:02:05] <wobniaR> The whole ashlands thing at the end is the closest thing to FO:E being made canon
[00:02:18] <Eywind> FO:E has life on the plane
[00:02:24] <wobniaR> That's true
[00:02:29] <Eywind> The only life in the wasteland was the tree of harmony
[00:02:45] <wobniaR> Deathclaws and cazadores are life right?
[00:02:50] <Eywind> technically
[00:02:58] <Zuthal> the wasteland at the end is what would realistically happen if NMM won
[00:03:04] <Zuthal> except that it would also be frozen
[00:03:08] <Zuthal> even the air would be frozen
[00:03:12] <RandomNinja> also the whole war and industrialization part
[00:03:14] <Eywind> Umm what
[00:03:14] <wobniaR> Nah eternal night's pretty chill
[00:03:15] <NightmareMoon> Except that didn't happen in the show.
[00:03:22] <Hamtramck> NMM's future honestly seemed alright.
[00:03:25] <RandomNinja> ^
[00:03:30] <Zuthal> NightmareMoon: I said realistically
[00:03:31] <Eywind> Yeah it was far better than the Changeling timeline
[00:03:35] <NightmareMoon> Well of course, I wish to rule, not have a wasteland.
[00:03:40] <RandomNinja> more oppression but a lot better than every other option
[00:03:41] <Eywind> Zuthal you make it seem like a being like NightmareMoon wouldn't have the power to make things livable
[00:03:52] <RandomNinja> NightmareMoon confirmed best evil tyrant
[00:04:06] <Eywind> NMMs was by far the best one shown
[00:04:13] <Zuthal> but then why would it still be dark? Enough light has to be supplied for photosynthesis
[00:04:18] <Hamtramck> I mean worst things about NMM's timeline? Rainbow and Rarity were kind of jerks. But what else is new !!!!
[00:04:36] <Eywind> Zuthal being 'dark' doesn't mean there's no light and no way to magically cultivate food and plants
[00:04:52] <RandomNinja> magic
[00:04:53] <Boxer> NNM seems powerful. I bet she would have laid waste to Sombra handidly.
[00:04:54] <Eywind> a lot of the plants grown in equestria are more based on earth pony magic
[00:05:04] * Zuthal flails
[00:05:16] <Eywind> your headcanon is bad and you should feel bad
[00:05:21] <Zuthal> You can't just sidestep science by saying "a wizard did it"
[00:05:23] <Hamtramck> Boxer Yeah she probably did. Celestia kind of sucks at fighting
[00:05:27] <Zuthal>  /scientistrage
[00:05:37] <Hamtramck> ... Wait yeah. Equestria was definitely better off under NMM than Celestia.
[00:05:38] <Zuthal> And NMM also wouldn't hold back
[00:05:46] <Boxer> Speaking of Celestia,  I believe Celestia has forsight that stretches beyond experience.
[00:05:49] <Zuthal> she'd just blast him five ways to friday
[00:05:50] <Eywind> Science, in a world where weather is controlled by magical flying talking horses?
[00:06:05] <Eywind> I mean there is science, but it's vastly different than this plane
[00:06:19] <wobniaR> Magical science
[00:06:24] <wobniaR> The best kind
[00:06:43] <NightmareMoon> Rainbow was a guard.
[00:06:50] <Hamtramck> Anyway I kind of hope that bad future timelines are still around :S it'd be fun if we got some /dimension hopping/ episodes where they go fix things
[00:06:54] <NightmareMoon> Rarity was an interior decorator for a Queen.
[00:06:56] <Zuthal> Eywind: if magic is done well, it should be able to be treated like any science
[00:06:58] <NightmareMoon> So of course they'd be snooty.
[00:07:06] <Eywind> Zuthal and it is, but it doesn't function the same as here
[00:07:20] <Zuthal> yeah, but then you have to explain /how/ it works
[00:07:22] <Boxer> But... in most cases, Celestia bested NMM either by befriending (in one case) or banishing her back to the moon.
[00:07:27] <Eywind> saying plants can't grow well in night because they can't grow here in night doesn't really make sense
[00:07:43] <Eywind> Given that plant growth is bolstered, if not driven, by earth pony magic, you can make arguments that plants can grow there because of that.
[00:07:54] <Eywind> "Magic" is a legitimate argument in a world predicated by magic
[00:08:12] <Hamtramck> You could also have plants that evolve to just synthesize chemicals in the soil/air instead of light
[00:08:16] <Boxer> You can't use that logic then, Eywind, because it is lazy and false.
[00:08:30] <Eywind> Fine, whatever.
[00:08:38] <Eywind> This discussion doesn't do anything
[00:08:56] <Boxer> I think Celestia has precognition.
[00:09:17] <Eywind> precognition doesn't necessarily mean you can change it
[00:09:35] <Boxer> Eactly. It makes you aware of it.
[00:09:42] <Boxer> *Exactly
[00:09:53] <Eywind> I'm rarely able to change situations where I have precognition heh
[00:10:03] <Eywind> but mine's not as coherent as someone like Celestia's would be
[00:10:22] <Hamtramck> (also new headcanon is that the comics take place in alternate universes created by Starlight's shenanigans somehow)
[00:10:42] *** Ali|AFK is now known as Ali
[00:11:26] <Boxer> I believe that Twilight was Celestia's best alternitive.
[00:13:12] <FN> http://rottenpanda.com/uploads/gallery_images/56b948d5bf1892402d4809ec0d890b65.jpg
[00:14:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> can i give up. i can’t do this making music thing
[00:14:58] <Boxer> Sorry, that was a bit obvious. Let me explain. Celestia, with her precognition COULD stop the threats all by herself but she she knew she couldn't withstand all the results as her power is drained each time She was exapecting an onslaught of bad times. Just remember that all the villians in the show attacked during a span of one year.
[00:15:50] <Hamtramck> I think it was two years!
[00:16:00] <Hamtramck> Or was the first year before they started attacking.
[00:16:22] <Cloud_Zephyr> maybe i should be a youtuber instead of a dj
[00:16:40] <SabSparrow> I don't think Celestia has much control over those prophetic dreams
[00:16:45] <Boxer> Still a small span be it one or two years.
[00:17:23] <Hamtramck> It's also kind of like that AJ/Rarity episode -- if celestia just solves everything they'll rely on her and it won't really work the same way
[00:17:41] * Boxer nods.
[00:17:58] <DinkyBot> !hat
[00:17:59] <DerpyBot> May I take your hat, muffin?
[00:17:59] <DerpyBot> May I take your hat?
[00:17:59] <DinkyBot> I'm wearin' a muffin hat, momma!
[00:18:42] <Boxer> I do have a couple of gripes with the episode. Such as why didn't the Celestia army use their spears or that song at the end.
[00:19:02] <Hamtramck> Boxer okay the first point!
[00:19:06] <wobniaR> Spears are pointy
[00:19:17] <Hamtramck> Ponies are exceedingly nice and don't want to hurt anything
[00:19:19] <Hamtramck> so they're holding back
[00:19:31] <Hamtramck> But in the Chrysalis timeline stuff's way worse so they're kind of like yeah just stab things
[00:19:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> i could always get a ghost producer :3333
[00:19:58] <Hamtramck> I do wonder if /evil celestia/ is going to be a thing -- there's that one card from the cardgame, and Future 7 looks like a supernova hit it
[00:20:08] <SabSparrow> Also, Celestia didn't predict the return of the Crystal Empire, she had to be told

[00:21:29] <Cloud_Zephyr> who wants to be my ghost producer?
[00:21:30] <Zuthal> FN: Because ponies are the size of cats and love to cuddle

[00:22:52] <FN> That's the size those mini-ponies grow to
[00:23:41] <Boxer> SabSparrow: To what extent?
[00:23:45] <Hamtramck> man i was reading about this, miniature horses are different from ponies because like bone structure
[00:23:58] <Hamtramck> or proportions or something
[00:24:04] <Hamtramck> also miniature horses don't get fluffy like ponies do
[00:24:53] <Boxer> To me, SabSparrow, Celestia got herself captured.
[00:25:22] <RandomNinja> what a skrub
[00:25:25] <Hamtramck> Anyway i'm assuming a CMC-counseling-Starlight is going to be an episode
[00:25:29] <SabSparrow> At the start of the episode about the Crystal Empire, a guard came with a message: It has returned
[00:25:44] <Eywind> IT
[00:25:46] <Eywind> Has returned
[00:25:47] <SabSparrow> Remember that? She didn't predict that
[00:26:00] <Eywind> or did she?
[00:26:12] <Eywind> just might not have been sure when
[00:26:33] <Boxer> Eywind: Like she told her gaurds to look for Changlings and they found some?
[00:26:55] <Eywind> so are you arguing against your earlier point?
[00:27:07] <Boxer> Heavens no.
[00:27:10] <Eywind> then...?
[00:27:15] <SabSparrow> Perhaps, but still, clearly her precognitions don't tell her everything
[00:27:30] <Boxer> Well said, SabSparrow.
[00:28:08] <Boxer> She must have know generally when but not how.
[00:28:24] <Boxer> Thus, bubble shield!

[00:39:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> i can’t life lul
[00:39:41] <Boxer> Maybe the design is meaningless.
[00:40:43] <Hamtramck> Man I don't usually go for Early Access stuff but SubNautica is my kind of thing ._.
[00:41:05] <Eywind> I've gotten a few early access games
[00:41:15] <Eywind> they usually turn out wel
[00:41:16] <Eywind> well*
[00:41:19] <Hamtramck> Boxer maybe cutie marks aren't meaningless but in the bad futures, by breaking the context in which they got them, it caused some cascading effect where cutie marks quit mattering and society borked?
[00:41:36] <Hamtramck> SubNautica's supposed to be reasonably far along afiak. My main desire there is ocean exploration which it apparently does
[00:42:18] <Boxer> I said the DESIGN is meaningless. I did not say that the cutie mark is void of meaning.
[00:42:24] <Hamtramck> o
[00:42:28] <Hamtramck> Well yeah that's kind of true :O
[00:42:45] <Hamtramck> That's actually addressed a bit
[00:43:09] <Hamtramck> Cheerilee doesn't totally get what her's symbolizes!
[00:44:09] <Hamtramck> And then you get the CMC's which don't actually make sense at all outside of that specific context

[04:53:31] <MikeM> Because explosions & war.
[04:53:43] <Boxer> The main reason I enjoyed the Sombra Timeline was becasue of how fleshed out it was.
[04:54:08] <RandomNinja> probably because it's reminicent of the actual fanfic that's super popular?
[04:54:15] <RandomNinja> also yeah it was
[04:54:28] <SaultSteMarie> i liked the sombra timeline because sombra is a very attractive horse and a healthy piece of real estate (?)
[04:54:57] <Boxer> What fanfic, RandomNinja? The Fallout one?
[04:55:33] <Flurshy> I didn't even realize RD is a war wonderbolt till just now
[04:55:36] <RandomNinja> yes
[04:55:43] <RandomNinja> Flurshy, skrub
[04:55:44] <Flurshy> I'd say there are two fallout timelines
[04:55:54] <Boxer> That was not Fallout.
[04:55:54] <RandomNinja> pre- and post nukes?
[04:55:56] <Flurshy> pre-detonation and post-war
[04:55:59] <Flurshy> yep

[05:00:53] <SaultSteMarie> so was anyone not expecting the bad future thing
[05:00:55] <RandomNinja> not as great though

[05:06:41] <Boxer> She moved forward through time normally. Except when Twilight used the spell they were both sent back to that moment
[05:06:51] <EM-C> How could she be an external observer?  She couldn't remain in the altered past, could she?  And wasn't the whole point so she could go back and have her village back again?
[05:07:10] <RandomNinja> I think she remained more or less around the time of the race
[05:07:11] <SaultSteMarie> No the point was that she ruined twilight's life

[05:10:52] <RandomNinja> she wasn't
[05:10:53] <Boxer> I believe it was a proimity issue. Starlight didn't have contact with the scroll and thus didn't timetravel again.
[05:11:00] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !s5
[05:11:00] <DerpyBot> The next episode airs in 5d:11h:19m:00s

[05:11:17] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Indeed
[05:11:38] <EM-C> I'm sorry.  I just...don't get it.  Of course, time travel plots are full of stuff like this.
[05:11:41] <Boxer> Do you remember when Spike touched the scroll?
[05:11:47] <Flashy> i think the next episode would be more then 5 days away DerpyBot
[05:11:55] <EM-C> Yes, of course.
[05:12:15] <Boxer> That created a connection.
[05:12:28] <EM-C> Why would Starlight want to remain in the past?  Why wouldn't she want to go back to a Twilightless future where she could have her village back?
[05:12:46] <EM-C> I'm sorry.  I tend to obsess over questions like this and if I'm not careful I'll get everyone mad at me.
[05:13:16] <Boxer> So she could continue to twart Twilight. Starlight used herself as an anchor.
[05:13:17] <EM-C> I simply must confess that I don't know what happened to Starlight whenever Twilight and Spike got pulled into the vortex and taken to a dark future.
[05:13:25] <EM-C> Okay...I suppose.
[05:13:42] <Flashy> just like the table was an anchor
[05:13:44] <Boxer> She said that is how she wrote the scroll.
[05:14:05] <Flashy> tho i think that part was uninted
[05:14:06] <EM-C> She sure must have relished the opportunity to defeat Twilight over and over and over again, even more than getting her village back.

[06:01:22] <Snapai> SaultSteMarie, 201s are best cheapy listening headphones. They're not gonna outperform fancier ones.
[06:01:36] <Snapai> Main issue is they have an enormously long cord, which is easy to run over with rolling chair
[06:02:42] <SaultSteMarie> Snapai I mean compared to other cheap headphones I've had they sounded terrible

[23:22:24] <Boxer> Not as fun yesterday.  Yesterday was like a party. Today is just like the after party vibe.
[23:24:12] <MikeM> Those days always feel a little weird.
[23:24:51] <Boxer> I saw the episode again. I feel like the song at the end was meant to roll through the credits.

[23:30:09] <MikeM> No hangover.
[23:31:02] <Boxer> I'm a Wisconsinite, no hangover.
[23:31:42] <RandomNinja> do you eat large amounts of cheese beforehand?
[23:31:46] <MikeM> Lucky
[23:32:12] <Boxer> I don't like to mix the two.
[23:32:27] <RandomNinja> fat is great though
[23:33:03] <Boxer> It can be. My fat levels are a tad high at the moment.
[23:34:52] <RandomNinja> no I mean as a hangover counter
[23:35:21] <RandomNinja> salt, fat and water fix or prevent even the worst hangover

[23:40:03] <Boxer> Basically what you are talking about is a saline solution to counter deyhdration.
[23:42:51] <RandomNinja> dunno why it works, but it does
[23:44:48] <Boxer> Eating food before drinking fills your stomach. The alcohol stays in your stomach longer but is not filtered into your system quickly.
[23:45:17] *** Midnight_Lilly is now known as DinkyDoo
[23:50:17] <Boxer> This can be dangerous because you'll get drunk hours laters such as when you are driving home.
