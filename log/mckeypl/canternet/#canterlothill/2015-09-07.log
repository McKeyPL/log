[02:20:43] <EM-C> Oh, sorry about that.  I was thinking recently that he might want to do that with the new eps coming up.
[02:21:00] <EM-C> I'm just a nervous wreck right now.  I'm all worked up.
[02:21:37] <MikeM> That sucks.
[02:21:43] <EM-C> I have to take my mother to a doctor at Jackson two days in a row (Tue. and Wed.) and I'm having to fill out and send in forms I don't understand in the slightest.
[02:22:02] <RandomNinja> yay, bureaucracy
[02:22:07] <EM-C> I can't call for help tomorrow because it's a holiday and the next two days are the days I'm going to be busy driving to Jackson.
[02:22:27] <EM-C> I have no idea what I'm doing.  This is so unpleasant for me.
[02:22:32] <Trildar> Fallout Shelter lies to me. These Rush failure rates are most definitely not <30%.
[02:22:38] <EM-C> But my sister has a job and can't be expected to do everything.
[02:22:50] <RandomNinja> do you even statistics bruh
[02:22:59] <EM-C> Maybe Thurs. I can call them and find out what date they won't put down.
[02:23:09] <EM-C> Because I don't have the slightest idea.
[02:23:32] <RandomNinja> Trildar, Gambler's Fallacy kicks in pretty hard
[02:23:32] <EM-C> I'm just so nervous.  What if I do something wrong and ruin everything?
[02:23:36] <MikeM> Are the forms for her appointment?
[02:23:56] <EM-C> I hope this depressed/nervous spell passes because I'm just practically shaking right now.
[02:24:37] <EM-C> I need Twilight Spectacle to calm me down...to use her MFP(tm)'s on me till I can't remember my own name.
[02:24:46] <MikeM> Sounds like you have done what you can, and have something of a plan to finish the rest.
[02:25:15] <EM-C> Oh, no MikeM.  We're trying to get it so she can pre-pay her funeral (a very unpleasant topic to me) and also get a copy of the one policy that we've lost over the years.
[02:25:57] <EM-C> First they sent us the wrong forms, then the right ones came Friday, and I can fill it all out except the date when the policy begins.  I don't have the slightest idea what to put down there.
[02:26:24] <EM-C> I'm going to have to call them.  Tomorrow I have a whole day to fret but nothing I can do.  The next two days I'm going to be too busy.
[02:26:37] <MikeM> I bet the company can help with that date.
[02:27:20] <EM-C> Yeah.  And I'm just frustrated.  I explained to my sister that the application for the copy of the policy goes in *at the same time* as the form to make the policies irrevocable.
[02:27:52] <EM-C> For whatever reason she didn't hear me or understand me and had Mama go ahead and sign the form asking for a copy, as if it were going on ahead.  I told her three or four times it wasn't!
[02:28:23] <EM-C> The thing is, I can't do anything right, yet I'm as hard on anyone else who messes up as they are with me.  I'm a big hypocrite.
[02:28:32] <EM-C> I'm just a nervous wreck.  I don't need all this.
[02:29:09] <MikeM> It'll get worked out. Do you need Princess Cadence to help with breathing exercises?
[02:29:33] <EM-C> No, I need Twilight Spectacle to breath into my lungs...for about five hours.

[02:46:20] <MikeM> They're growing the staff for these projects
[02:46:57] <wobniaR> If you guys understand project management and how they delegate the work you'll understand how multiple things at once works
[02:47:23] <wobniaR> It all takes time and they move people around as needed and do what can be done while other things get developed
[02:47:24] <Fantasma> Growing the staff?
[02:47:26] <Fantasma> that's expensive
[02:48:24] <Fantasma> The entertainment business is a very close nit club, they don't like bringing other people in.
[02:48:36] <wobniaR> Depends
[02:48:48] <wobniaR> You don't know how sure how it works at Hasbro and DHX do you?
[02:49:30] <wobniaR> They also outsource their animation to a studio in the Philippines

[02:50:15] <RandomNinja> darn
[02:50:20] <Fantasma> Because it's cheaper.
[02:50:25] <wobniaR> Of course
[02:50:41] <Fantasma> Why would they be doing all these projects at once? because it's cheaper.
[02:50:53] <MikeM> No, they're seizing on opportunity.
[02:51:01] <wobniaR> And to get people to BUY THEIR TOYS
[02:51:26] <Fantasma> Of course.
[02:51:40] <wobniaR> Every pony episode is a subliminal message by Hasbro to buy their toys
[02:51:57] <Fantasma> Not exactly, it's just a 22 minute advertisement.
[02:51:59] * Trildar throws horse toys at wobniaR
[02:52:12] <wobniaR> Exactly
[02:52:18] * wobniaR throws monies at Trildar
[02:52:19] <RandomNinja> high quality ads
[02:52:28] * RandomNinja intercepts the monies
[02:52:40] <wobniaR> High quality ads that take an entire team many months to create a season worth
[02:52:58] <MikeM> And are lots of fun to watch.
[02:54:14] <Fantasma> Well
[02:54:18] <Fantasma> I don't know about many months.

[19:46:11] <One-Trick> did you read the section on gases and exothermic reaction?
[19:46:14] <One-Trick> thats what you want
[19:46:52] <One-Trick> Le Chatelier's principle allows better conceptualization of these trends. First, note that the process of dissolving gas in liquid is usually exothermic. As such, increasing temperatures result in stress on the product side (because heat is on the product side). In turn, Le Chatelier's principle predicts that the system shifts towards the reactant side in order to alleviate this new ...
[19:46:58] <One-Trick> ... stress. Consequently, the equilibrium concentration of the gas particles in gaseous phase increases, resulting in lowered solubility.

[22:44:10] <KooK> Best thing about being American - you can sit there and eat way too much crap, deep fried, borderline dangerous food and alcohol.  If you do it around rednecks all you have to say is "Murica," and not only is this an excuse to consume all this, but you will likely get a "Hell yeah!"

[23:04:11] <RandomNinja> yus
[23:04:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuu my protein folding has slowed down
[23:04:17] * RandomNinja throws Cloud_Zephyr to the moon
[23:04:26] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr switch to protein consumption instead
[23:04:36] <snitch567> i ment do !moon Cloud_Zephyr :D RandomNinja 
[23:04:40] <RandomNinja> pls
[23:04:44] <snitch567> hehehehheh
[23:04:51] <RandomNinja> I only modabuse accidentally
[23:05:01] <RandomNinja> u do it :P
[23:05:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> it seems this thing is best if u leave ur computer on 24/7 
[23:05:12] <snitch567> i cant it will kick me :P
[23:05:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> but i don't trust it yet
[23:05:15] <RandomNinja> free heating also
[23:05:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> yus
[23:05:54] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr go to teh gym
[23:06:06] <RandomNinja> cuz when you get stronger you can more easily fold things, like protein
[23:06:13] <RandomNinja> and then you can consume that protein for gainz
[23:06:18] <RandomNinja> and positive loop
[23:06:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> but effort
[23:06:42] <RandomNinja> it will increase your girlfriend acquisition probablities tho :P
