[23:38:33] <RandomNinja> yus I managed to improve printing quality
[23:38:40] <Snap_Shot> Oh?
[23:40:05] <MikeM> Did you use better paper?
[23:40:07] <RandomNinja> changed from generic to photo print and forced max quality
[23:40:19] <RandomNinja> turns out Auto quality doesn't like color
[23:41:55] <RandomNinja> could really use a laser printer though
[23:42:15] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: Hello.
