[03:32:53] <RandomNinja> yeah I've played it like 4 times
[03:32:59] <RandomNinja> Dead Money is fantastic
[03:33:25] <whovian4423> yeah i like the other one it were your in the canyon and your carivan gets owned i love the thomsan in it
[03:33:51] <RandomNinja> it is the only acceptably weapon to shoot up the strip with
[03:33:54] <wobniaR> That's honest hearts
[03:34:04] <RandomNinja> wearing a suit and fedora, obviously
[03:35:36] <whovian4423> nah i went with the crr outfit and a helmet
[03:35:43] <RandomNinja> boo
[03:36:03] <RandomNinja> >not going full gangster
[03:36:23] <wobniaR> I go with elite riot gear once I pick that up, before that just a hat and some random light armor
[03:36:39] <wobniaR> Armor doesn't matter much thanks to project nevada

[03:37:12] <RandomNinja> I usually progress Leather -> Reinforced Leather -> Joshua -> Ulysses Duster for dat sweet crit chance
[03:37:30] <whovian4423> NO LONESOME ROAD THE INTERSAT was horrible death claws everwere
[03:37:31] <RandomNinja> also delicious light armor movement speed
[03:37:40] <RandomNinja> yeah if you're a skrub
[03:37:57] <RandomNinja> you should be able to handle deathclaws by the time you do Lonesome Road
[03:38:09] <RandomNinja> otherwise you're severely undergeared
[03:38:39] <thereallynewmop12100> Tough-Shield is 4 sides & 8 angles. #JackBlackApproves
[03:38:43] <wobniaR> There's only a few deathclaws there, and the tunnelers are deadlier
[03:38:49] <RandomNinja> ^
[03:38:56] <PinkieShy> avast has really become the new norton.
[03:38:57] <wobniaR> The most deadly thing in lonesome road is the freaking mines lol
[03:39:04] <wobniaR> One beep BOOM
[03:39:04] <RandomNinja> Riot Shotgun + And Stay Back = you win
[03:39:10] <RandomNinja> Light Step bruh
[03:39:16] <wobniaR> Yeah but without light step
[03:39:34] <RandomNinja> the satchel charges are pretty sweet tho
[03:39:37] <wobniaR> I did super slam+ strong melee weapon for the tunnelers
[03:39:44] <RandomNinja> yeah that also works
[03:39:53] <PinkieShy> avast cons: Its bloated, It has to many daily ad popups, their cleanup tool can do more harm to your pc than it fixes, and they are having scummy business tatics now.
[03:39:54] <whovian4423> i was but i used the rocket launcher and hit in the trailer and blasted terh crap out of them
[03:39:54] <wobniaR> Add turbo for godmode
[03:40:02] <PinkieShy> Avast only pro is it works
[03:40:12] <RandomNinja> only weakness of close combat build is snipers and the like
[03:40:22] <RandomNinja> also elevated positions
[03:40:35] <wobniaR> Anti-material rifle with 50mg explosive rounds solves that
[03:40:35] <RandomNinja> which is why you dual-spec with explosives
[03:40:47] <RandomNinja> explosives tho
[03:40:48] <wobniaR> Don't need a direct hit with those
[03:41:06] <wobniaR> Explosives is the fun way
[03:41:12] <RandomNinja> you already got high strength with melee, and you're not carrying any other ammo
[03:41:17] <whovian4423> i had a 44 rifle and scope it that and the 357 saved my butt on some ocasions 
[03:41:33] <RandomNinja> might as well grab Annabelle and 50 missiles
[03:41:55] <One-Trick> i just had one of those sammiches from dominos
[03:41:56] <One-Trick> meh
[03:41:59] <One-Trick> wasnt worth it
[03:42:04] <RandomNinja> darn
[03:42:22] <wobniaR> They're mediocre
[03:42:33] <RandomNinja> whovian4423, those weapons are really puny past level 15 or so
[03:42:44] <RandomNinja> Brush Gun is where it's at
[03:42:54] <wobniaR> I just get pizza, or pizza + that bread stuff with spinach and feta cheese
[03:42:59] <Regulus> the chicken there is good One-Trick 
[03:43:12] <Regulus> Especially the bbq and cheese chicken 
[03:43:25] <One-Trick> ill try it, the sausage and peppers was very boring
[03:43:37] <One-Trick> it tasted fine but it was too much bread
[03:43:42] <whovian4423> that and the m1 gerand copie you get in the base there awesome dang it now i want to play again
[03:44:06] <RandomNinja> That Machine is pretty great early-mid game
[03:45:44] <whovian4423> the the ray gun is epic tho
[03:46:33] <whovian4423> the sniper was kool tho but i like the brush gun
[03:47:19] <whovian4423> that flame sword tho and the gernad launchers were epic

[13:24:15] <RandomNinja> what are you, a construction engineer?
[13:26:25] <Trildar> Taking an engineering course. For whatever reason this is one of the units we have to take in our common first year
[13:26:49] <Trildar> Supposed to be engineering design
[13:30:30] <Zuthal> Trildar: Crush up spaghetti and mix the spaghetti dust with glue to form a composite
[13:30:36] <Zuthal> then cast the bridge out of it in one piece
[13:30:45] <Trildar> So yeah, spaghetti truss bridge. Tension members somehow failed. Given, there was some buckling elsewhere prior to the failure, but I still can't make sense of it
[13:31:12] <Zuthal> or just dunk the truss bridge in glue several times after building it
[13:32:16] <Trildar> Weight to failure load ratio is a grading criterion. And they won't award points for going above 1.2 kg
