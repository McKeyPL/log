[22:43:19] <DinkyBot> RandomNinja told me to that comic.
[22:43:19] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Best medicine in the world.
[22:43:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I tell you what them Swiss guys know what to do.

[22:46:27] * thereallynewmop12100 puts his horn and blows it to MikeM "Ricccccccccccccccccccccccccccola!"
[22:46:51] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: I bet she would not be able to take over Switzerland because no has been able to.
[22:47:04] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> *no one
[22:47:23] <RandomNinja> that's for economical reasons at least as much as anything else
[22:47:39] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay?

[22:48:37] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: Sorry i hurt your ears
[22:48:50] <RandomNinja> first off, switzerland isn't particularily attractive to conquer. It's a small, mountainous land in the middle of more attractive things
[22:48:59] <MikeM> No worries; I always wear earplugs.
[22:49:28] <RandomNinja> the fact that it's mountainous makes it relatively expensive to invade with a larger army, but it's certainly doable
[22:49:46] <RandomNinja> and don't forget the fact that they hold much of your money
[22:49:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: Indeed
[22:50:04] <Zuthal> Also, they have literally turned the mountaisn into swiss cheese
[22:50:10] <Zuthal> only not full of holes but full of bunkers
[22:50:22] <MikeM> And cheese?
[22:50:23] <RandomNinja> swiss cheese...
[22:50:24] <RandomNinja> pls
[22:50:31] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> True those bunkers are packed with stuff.
[22:50:46] <RandomNinja> there's certainly some cheese there, that stuff stores well
[22:50:56] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Sure does.
[22:50:58] <RandomNinja> Zuthal that's just now though
[22:51:38] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Do not forget about the guns.
[22:53:00] <Zuthal> all of the guns
[22:53:00] <RandomNinja> hm
[22:53:20] <Zuthal> and if someone tries to invade, they can just blow up all the passes and tunnels and hide out
[22:53:24] <RandomNinja> how does the Geneva convention affect civilian guerillas?
[22:53:43] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> RanomNinja: The same as any other?
[22:53:45] <Zuthal> why do you ask?
[22:54:08] <RandomNinja> since pretty much every household has military weapons
[22:54:28] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yeap they do
[22:54:35] <thereallynewmop12100> nuuuuuu  no tacos :(
[22:54:41] <MikeM> They're only dangerous if they're used in a threatening manner.
[22:54:42] <Zuthal> well, pretty much everyone is in the army reserve too, I think :P
[22:54:43] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Tacos?
[22:54:53] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: It's Taco Tuesday

[23:34:35] <EM-C> Seriously, what's wrong?
[23:35:28] <RandomNinja> must be a glitch
[23:35:44] <EM-C> Is it just me?  I'm showing "0" as the number of people here, and no names on the right.
[23:36:10] <EM-C> Guys, I have a question about Friendship Games.
[23:36:19] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Tell me
[23:36:46] <EM-C> In the credits Shannon Chan-Kent is credited as the voice of "Lemon Tart," not "Lemon Zest.
[23:36:57] <EM-C> Did everyone get her name wrong?
[23:37:14] <EM-C> Is her official canon name Tart or Zest?
[23:37:47] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Zert 
[23:37:52] <EM-C> Ha ha.
[23:38:10] <EM-C> Really, what's with that?  Why does everyone call her Lemon Zest if her name is Lemon Tart?
[23:38:23] <EM-C> I thought she was Lemon Zest too.
[23:38:56] <EM-C> Is she ever addressed by name in the movie?
[23:39:30] * thereallynewmop12100 needs to watch the new episode of CSI Cyber again at 6
[23:39:32] <EM-C> Anyone???
[23:39:50] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Maybe
[23:39:59] <MikeM> I've only seen the movie once, and I don't remember if they did or didn't.
[23:40:14] <EM-C> So...you mean we don't know what her name is?
[23:40:40] <EM-C> I honestly thought she was Lemon Zest.  Maybe that's just a fan name.
[23:41:04] <EM-C> But why would she get a fan name and everyone else doesn't?
[23:41:28] <MikeM> There's this: http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Equestria_Girls:_Friendship_Games

[23:42:59] <EM-C> I see it now.
[23:43:15] <EM-C> It says she was "miscast," so they must have called her "Lemon Zest" in the movie.
[23:43:19] <EM-C> Thanks guys.

[23:47:49] <EM-C> I think most fans saw Lemon Zest as "the good one," since she's never overtly mean or obnoxious to anyone else, but unfortunately she seems to enjoy knocking Twilight's device away on the skating track.
[23:48:19] <EM-C> But she's still my waifu.
[23:48:47] <EM-C> I'm gonna reload the page and see if I can get everyone's names to come up.
