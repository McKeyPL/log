[03:54:35] <StrykerVylon> I still havent figured out pig-latin.
[03:55:07] <Snuggle_Trumpet> Pig latin is severely easy as long as you know what vowels are

[03:56:27] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> It really is.  If a word starts with a consonant or series of consonants (such as a dipthong), you move those to the end of the word and add "ay".  If not, you just add "ay" to the end.  That's Pig-Latin in its entirety.
[03:57:29] <Shad0wMeister> dang these are serious derpiculties, it doesn't normally take this long to fix
[03:57:41] <Snuggle_Trumpet> All consonants leading up to the first vowel.... (i.e.  Thing becomes ing thay and apple is just apple ay)
[03:57:43] <StrykerVylon> !t derpiculties
[03:57:43] <DinkyBot> Techinical derpiculties hold on just a sec. Later
[03:57:48] <Hamtramck> diphthongs are vowels, son.
[03:57:51] <Hamtramck> You're thinking of digraphs.
[03:58:03] <Hamtramck> Although consonant clusters aren't digraphs either.
[03:58:14] <Hamtramck> Er, not necessariy at least.

[19:44:40] <RandomNinja> nouns are always capitalized
