[07:50:03] <Eywind> not necessarily as many as EFN but still some stuff
[07:50:20] <Eywind> let's say the hiatuses and life have hit a few shows hard heh
[07:50:35] <JoJo> Oh those game guys are gone 
[07:51:22] <Eywind> Yeah they rebranded to another name and had some issues with consistency and web sites and Draco's been having some stuff go on recently

[07:56:14] <Eywind> at 2AM EST?  no
[07:56:19] <JoJo> lol
[07:56:28] <JoJo> It's 11pm here
[07:56:39] <Eywind> it's also 11PM on a Thursday night
[07:57:23] <JoJo> I live on an upside down sense of time
[07:57:38] <Eywind> Most people have a regular schedule
[07:57:39] <JoJo> Come into a chatroom at like 2am expecting to talk to people
[07:57:47] <Eywind> yeah that's not gonna happen much
[07:57:52] <Eywind> most people in here have regular jobs are in school
[07:58:00] <Eywind> and neither of which are cohesive to being up at 2-5am and talking
[07:58:35] <JoJo> On winter break looking for work got lots of time on my hands
[07:58:57] <Eywind> well you could develop a regular schedule regardless
[07:59:10] <crystallinewind> regular schedules are overrated
[07:59:31] <Eywind> Yes, having regular social interaction with reasonably-well-adjusted inviduals is overrated
[07:59:56] <crystallinewind> by having a rotating schedule, you can meet all the people though!
[08:00:03] <JoJo> yeah exactly
[08:00:04] <crystallinewind> the third shifters, the morning people
[08:00:05] <Eywind> but not develop repeating things
[08:00:46] <Eywind> I can't say "hey you wanna do the thing that one time" because who knows when you're gonna be up?
[08:00:49] <JoJo> I do video editing at night
[08:01:07] <Eywind> I'd rather have a few good friends than a handful of aquaintences
[08:01:12] <JoJo> Actually I'm really good if I got schedules
[08:01:18] <JoJo> Im the one scheduling things
[08:01:38] <JoJo> that being said don't expect me to make it to school early
[08:03:37] <Eywind> okay

[21:41:18] <Mike_Coltfield> Oh man, there we go. I have good evidence of what headphone amplification does. The song "Compass" by Two Steps From Hell has crackling on Merethe's voice when played directly from the headphone out on my laptop. If I just plug my portable amp in and run the same song, headphones, and computer settings, her voice is clear.
[21:41:53] <Mike_Coltfield> I say this as "finally" because it's something I can demonstrate to anyone without getting pedantic about a particular nuance
