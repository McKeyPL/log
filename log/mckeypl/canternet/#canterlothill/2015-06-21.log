[21:08:01] *** Madness is now known as DARK
[21:11:12] <ModusPonens> yesterday's episode does not match up with its moral
[21:13:14] <Eywind> Mmhmm
[21:13:48] <ModusPonens> Spike chose to stop work on the trees and pipe for Twi's sake, not for his own
[21:15:00] <ModusPonens> So the episode saying that the disaster is because of spike's abuse of power doesn't play out
[21:15:22] <Eywind> Yeah when really it was because sometimes decisions you make, even if you make them with the best information you have, don't pan out as well as you'd hoped
[21:16:04] <Eywind> I feel like the first half was solid
[21:16:07] <Eywind> last half just fell apart, but meh
[21:16:08] <ModusPonens> me too
[21:16:19] <ModusPonens> more like the moral doesn't work
[21:16:25] <ModusPonens> but the episode otherwise was solid
[21:16:44] <Eywind> Well I think up to the point where Cadence talked to him first about power abusing and he started getting Spike hero pictures drawn of him
[21:17:00] <Eywind> after that just unraveled because they tried to force that in there instead of making the moral about judgment calls
[21:17:53] <Eywind> Which is a MUCH more impactful moral for real people
[21:18:15] <DinkyBot> !shoo
[21:18:15] * DerpyBot sways from side to side, quietly humming "shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo"
[21:18:16] <DinkyBot> What a silly song, momma!
[21:21:14] * DerpyBot perches on the tree next to her house, watching out for her muffin
[21:21:14] * DinkyBot comes skipping her way home and whistles up to her momma, "Hooooooome!"
[21:21:22] <ModusPonens> I suppose the way the main broke was a bit rube goldberg-ey
[21:21:46] <ModusPonens> but if all it took was a ball, those trees were coming down regardless
[21:22:04] <RandomNinja> those trees were weaksauce
[21:22:43] *** KooK_ is now known as KooK
[21:22:47] <ModusPonens> Spike abusing his power was great. And for all we know, outside of combining the two talks, he may have made great decisions
[21:24:15] <ModusPonens> actually, when I look back at the episode, it DOES fit its moral
[21:24:43] <ModusPonens> there's a scene, Eywind, when Cadence first confronts Spike, where he talks to the plumber again
[21:25:17] <Eywind> Where he asks for a few more hours?
[21:25:20] <ModusPonens> yes
[21:25:36] <Eywind> Meh he was still on the "don't let Twilight wake up" plan
[21:25:49] <ModusPonens> the plumber goes "this thing's about to blow", Spike says to stop, ostensibly to give Twilight some rest
[21:26:27] <ModusPonens> but his expression and body language, PLUS Cadence's talk immediately afterwards suggests that he was using that simply as an excuse
[21:27:50] <ModusPonens> "as long as that's the real reason you're doing it"
[21:27:54] <ModusPonens> plus the crossed fingers
[21:28:07] <ModusPonens> and then that evil villain laugh after Cadence leaves

[21:28:43] <ModusPonens> Spike was being a piece of turd at this point

[23:50:50] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this picture is about interspecies crack shipping flash sentry sonata dusk siren (and 5 more)
[23:51:09] <wobniaR> Ultimate waifu + Ultimate waifu thief lol
[23:51:57] <Eywind> that one is cute though
[23:53:26] <wobniaR> So here's my question: Is there a regular human non-siren version of the sirens in human world?
[23:53:52] <Eywind> no clue
[23:54:00] <Eywind> I still don't get the time lapse though
[23:54:22] <Eywind> I guess we just have to ignore the sirens comic for that
[23:54:26] <Eywind> since Starswirl was the one that banished them
[23:54:47] <wobniaR> The comic implies they were both sent to another dimension and forward in time at the same time
[23:54:47] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[23:54:58] <Eywind> fair enough
[23:55:06] <wobniaR> Which is wat, but MAGIC
[23:55:27] <Eywind> So why didn't Celestia banish Luna to the moon and forward in time 1000 years? :P
[23:55:32] *** Unixkitty is now known as Awaykitty
[23:55:54] <RandomNinja> because reasons
[23:55:58] <wobniaR> The comic throws that off
[23:56:03] <RandomNinja> something something plot device? 
[23:56:14] <Eywind> yeah the weird critters on the moon are weird :P
[23:56:30] <wobniaR> The show kinda implied she was just sealed in the moon for 1000 years, basically preserved
[23:56:41] <wobniaR> Like cryogenic freezing without the cryogenics
[23:56:44] *** Quits: TSparkle_Alt (TSparkle339@Pony-oas72s.ks.cox.net) (Connection closed)
[23:56:51] <Eywind> though kinda still freezing
[23:56:57] <wobniaR> Then the comics like "NYX PEOPLE, SHE DID STUFF"
[23:57:03] <Eywind> XD
[23:57:12] <Eywind> ew Nyx
[23:57:18] <RandomNinja> I declare Moonstuck canon

[23:57:42] <DerpyBot> https://derpibooru.org/559633
[23:58:04] <Pony_69072> Isn't Celestia in the comics basically a giant troll?
[23:58:09] <wobniaR> I downloaded the whole moonstuck thing, all the comics in 1 zip file
[23:58:18] <Eywind> nah
[23:58:25] <wobniaR> All the princesses are silly ponies
