[01:41:28] <TipsyBOT> Im the worst idea for a cosplay.
[01:41:35] <TipsyBOT> Im just a claptrap unit painted like Trixie.
[01:42:17] <TipsyBOT> My cape and hat are just construction paper disguised to look like the real thing.

[01:43:55] <TipsyBOT> That's actually a scary combo. Trixie and Claptrap mixing is like mixing the Genie from Aladdin with Discord.

[02:24:38] <Flurshy> right. I should probably work on music in the time I spend at home right now
[02:24:49] <Eywind> or you can play video games
[02:25:03] <MikeM> Hey Flurshy, how'd the interview go?
[02:25:07] <Flurshy> so... I dunno if I told you this onetrick, but watching movies with my PA speaker as a rear channel is pretty dang good
[02:25:18] * One-Trick fallsover
[02:25:26] <Flurshy> Mike, it was great, but they have a hair length policy so it wouldn't work out
[02:25:31] <Flurshy> but I got practice!
[02:25:40] <MikeM> Interesting.
[02:26:08] <One-Trick> i watch movies on my eris e5s with a dual channel reflexive sub
[02:26:13] <One-Trick> its quite entertaining :)
[02:26:22] <One-Trick> i can see how the pa as a rear channel is fun
[02:26:26] <One-Trick> in 3.1 mode?
[02:26:29] <Flurshy> mhm
[02:26:31] <One-Trick> err, i guess thats 4.1
[02:26:36] <Flurshy> well, it's tricky
[02:26:47] <Flurshy> on the computer software it's quad, 4.0
[02:27:04] <Flurshy> but my computer speakers have a sub, and the pa speaker has power to match
[02:27:17] <One-Trick> my xfi has optical 5.1/6.1 mode, though the latter is faked
[02:28:13] <One-Trick> the monitor speakers have a wonderful range, though
[02:28:20] <Flurshy> my main speakers are analog only
[02:28:34] <One-Trick> so are mine in the end- both are mono xlr
[02:28:40] <Flurshy> I actually don't have -anything- that can handle optical input, now I think about it
[02:28:50] <One-Trick> the peavey mixer has an optical and a decent DA
[02:29:07] <Flurshy> my uncle who also does sound recommended getting a digital board, but that's not going to happen without a job
[02:29:15] <One-Trick> yeah
[02:29:23] <Eywind> Is the hair thing a religious thing?
[02:29:23] <One-Trick> even my little one was 200$
[02:29:40] <Flurshy> I'm looking at either a Behringer xenyx 12 channel or a Mackie 8 channel

[02:30:09] <One-Trick> i aaaam
[02:30:19] <One-Trick> i just got home and ate chicken thingies
[02:30:22] <Flurshy> bad enough that I gave myself the torment of pretending to be a guy >.<
[02:30:23] <Eywind> well no I meant for you, if you keeping your hair long was a religious thing
[02:30:26] <One-Trick> no idea what parts they were
[02:30:26] <Eywind> Wow
[02:30:30] <Eywind> Yeah fun stuff
[02:30:36] <Flurshy> Eywind I'm trans
[02:30:43] <Eywind> Yeah I figured
[02:30:57] <Eywind> I just mean that if you feel the need to do that it's not an atmosphere you'd really want to be involved with long-term
[02:31:04] <Flurshy> I felt naked without my purse
[02:31:24] <Flurshy> this was under the advice of my mom, but I think for future interviews I'm going to go as I wish
[02:31:31] <One-Trick> do that
[02:31:35] <Eywind> yeah definitedly do that
[02:31:37] <One-Trick> its easier on us supervisor types
[02:31:45] <Flurshy> yeah, if they won't hire me because of that, I wouldn't want to work there
[02:31:49] <Flurshy> One-Trick: explain?
[02:33:13] <One-Trick> it can be a nightmare to suddenly change everything- especially with other employees, and we're the ones that have to make sure things remain civil- its easier just to do that kind of thing from the beginning, most of us dont even care (at least where i work, no one would)
[02:33:26] <Flurshy> well
[02:33:29] <Flurshy> this is texas
[02:33:33] <Flurshy> so there's that
[02:33:34] <One-Trick> so?
[02:33:39] <One-Trick> this is arkansas :p
[02:33:47] <One-Trick> i lived in texas and we didnt care, either
[02:33:55] <Flurshy> but even if it makes it harder to land a job, any job where it would be a problem WOULD be a job I wouldn't like
[02:34:13] <One-Trick> thats true

[02:52:03] <Flurshy> FN_away: but when you have no job and your final pay is gunna be from half a pay period, money matters
[02:52:21] <One-Trick> you can just use yer computer
[02:52:25] <Flurshy> I might still buy a db meter
[02:52:29] <FN_away> I can send you one+
[02:52:34] <Flurshy> do eet
[02:52:50] <One-Trick> open audacity, press 'monitor mic' and watch the vu jump
[02:53:07] <MikeM> How accurate are the apps?
[02:53:21] <One-Trick> audacity does a fairly decent fft average
[02:53:25] <FN_away> depends on the microphone
[02:53:29] <Flurshy> on a laptop webcam mic?
[02:53:33] <One-Trick> even with a crap mic
[02:53:35] <Flurshy> cause I know on phones those things don't work
[02:53:43] <MikeM> Ahh.
[02:53:53] <One-Trick> phones arent really made to monitor the data stream from a mic
[02:54:05] <Flurshy> I also wanna get this basic DAC box so we can use the speaker in the living room when we watch a movie
[02:54:12] <FN_away> Yeah for good dB measurement you need a decent microphone
[02:54:36] <FN_away> The dB meters though use a different method than mic
[02:54:43] <One-Trick> you can get a decent mic for cheaps
[02:55:19] <Flurshy> still twenty bucks online for a db meter
[02:55:24] <One-Trick> yep
[02:55:35] <Flurshy> it's not high on my priority list, and certainly not important enough to buy while unemployed
[02:55:35] <One-Trick> just make sure you use the field it recommends
[02:56:00] <Flurshy> what I need is a mixer and XLR cables
[02:56:11] <One-Trick> get monoprice cables
[02:56:12] <FN_away> Yeah there is a bandwidth you need to measure the sound correctly
[02:56:15] <Flurshy> oh! and a mic stand. I keep forgetting that

[02:57:12] <One-Trick> yes, definitely

[02:58:11] <FN_away> I think it would be easier to buy on amazon and punch in your address, than buying one in Germany and sending via snail mail
[02:58:26] <Flurshy> I was looking at the snake cable thing
[02:58:48] <One-Trick> monoprice ships from florida, are very nicely made, and theyre cheap
[02:58:56] <Flurshy> the quality is the kicker
[02:59:10] <Flurshy> I have on my amazon list a 4 pack of 25 foot cables for $30
[02:59:19] <One-Trick> they powered several brony conventions, i know :)
[03:00:11] <Flurshy> do you have any experience with bulk pack xlr cables? the sort that's $7 a piece
[03:00:32] <One-Trick> depends on the brand
[03:00:54] <FN_away> Unshielded cables are detrimental to quality
[03:00:59] <Flurshy> MCS, probably nothing you've heard of

[03:08:58] <FN_away> Oh btw Flurshy what for do you need a dB meter?
[03:09:09] <FN_away> Aka what class and scale?
[03:09:18] <Flurshy> oh geez I wouldn't know
[03:09:47] <Flurshy> 50-100db range? I want to see the decibels that my speaker can reach, both in front of the speaker and at the edge of the property
[03:09:59] <FN_away> What do you want to measure with it? Continuos noise, peak value?
[03:10:26] <Flurshy> I'm not sure which one the law takes into consideration to be honest
[03:10:35] <FN_away> Oh so you don't need the average sampling, that is clear
[03:11:03] <FN_away> The peak noise will suffice
[03:11:12] <Flurshy> ah
[03:11:27] <FN_away> Now's the question wether you need A or C scale

[03:24:24] <FN_away> At least it points out that it is ANSI S1.4 class2
[03:24:45] <Flurshy> I... was actually looking at $20 meters
[03:25:54] <FN_away> There are 4 classes of these devices 0 (lab equipment, super sensitive); 1 (professional equipment); 2 (precise enough for general usage); 3 (least presice, only good for general approximation)
[03:26:14] <FN_away> $20 will be pretty much all class 3
[03:27:20] <Flurshy> ah

[03:29:00] <Flurshy> what's C scale?
[03:31:33] *** Quits: KooK (KooK@Pony-1vdac7.client.mchsi.com) (Connection closed)
[03:34:40] <FN_away> Oh it is just a flatter scale, that includes more frequency range
[03:35:10] <FN_away> It is used to access noise overall, for, say animals (as they hear in other ranges)
[03:35:42] <FN_away> A-scale is an approximation of human hearing (as we don't hear certain frequencies, we don't need to measure them)
[03:36:31] <Flurshy> don't really need C scale then I think...
[03:36:52] <FN_away> Though, historically A scale is a bit flawed in the region of low frequencies, so people like to double-check A-scale results with C-scale for cross-reference and less errors

[05:18:49] <StrykerVylon> That doesnt make any sense...
[05:19:37] <Flurshy> they were instructed not to kill the protagonists when they were escaping the death star
[05:19:48] <StrykerVylon> There is no way Vader told them to miss cause he wasnt entirely aware of Luke and Leia until later and I doubt any high ranking Empire military officers would tell them that.
[05:19:49] <StrykerVylon> ...
[05:19:50] <StrykerVylon> Oh.
[05:19:58] <StrykerVylon> So Protagonist immunity?
[05:20:09] <StrykerVylon> Not the Stormtroopers being told to miss.
[05:21:23] <Flurshy> they put a homing beacon on the ship, remember?
[05:21:38] <Flurshy> they themselves weren't the end goal
[05:21:43] <Flurshy> the end goal was finding the rebel base

[18:19:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> my monitor is prbably to skrubby for 140fps
[18:20:17] <FN> 140 is such an overkill
[18:21:00] <FN> I am not even sure human eye can really see this 24fps difference between 120 and 144 
[18:21:18] <Flurshy> we don't actually see in frames
[18:21:33] <FN> Yes, that is a fair bit more complicated than that
[18:21:36] <Flurshy> :P
[18:22:09] <RandomNinja> but the human eye can only see 30 fps http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.31881486.1812/ap,550x550,12x16,1,transparent,t.png

[18:23:14] <RandomNinja> indeed
[18:23:28] <RandomNinja> the choppyness adds to the immersion somehow
[18:24:04] <Trildar> Obviously.
[18:25:00] <FN> Tests with Air force pilots have shown, that they could identify the plane on a flashed picture that was flashed only for 1/220th of a second. 
[18:25:26] <Flurshy> at that point sight becomes subliminal
[18:26:08] <FN> At the same time any screen that has a a refresh rate above 100Hz is a non-flickering to our eye
[18:26:43] <FN> There is a difference between a flash/appearance of object and continuous imaging to our sight
[18:27:28] <FN> Anything sudden will get registered and you will indeed see an enemy earlier on a 120fps screen as opposed to 60 or lol 30
[18:28:02] <FN> But you would not necessary see the difference in picture fluidity between 60 and 120

[18:28:26] <StrykerVylon> !t RandomNinja
[18:28:27] <FN> 24fps is actually the /LOWEST/ boundary of fluid motion that we perceive
[18:28:28] <DinkyBot> It's been covered by newer bands before but this is da gift RandomNinja https://derpibooru.org/807988?scope=scpe8d941222300142f5844c88be089d0d5abfc070d9
[18:28:34] *** SkyHighAway is now known as SkyHigh
[18:28:46] <FN> So that is a horribad criteria to base your system around
[18:28:58] <Phantom> the songs are putting me to sleep right now DX
[18:29:02] <Flurshy> at 24fps though there's motion blur, and when you pan the camera you can't follow the picture because suddenly objects stutter-jump
[18:29:04] <RandomNinja> you need more metal
[18:29:15] <Flurshy> I've seen this in a movie theater where the camera pans and suddenly the motion is jumpy
[18:29:24] <Phantom> i requested for join the herd to play
[18:29:26] <RandomNinja> 24 hz works great for the movies that were around back when it was standardized
[18:29:43] <Flurshy> while in the hobbit in HFR I could follow camera pans no problem
[18:29:46] <RandomNinja> because the camera didn't jump around at 900 kph
[18:29:55] <Flurshy> mhm
[18:30:09] <FN> Again 24fps is the /LEAST/ amount of frames, not the exact amount we see
[18:30:10] <Flurshy> the more motion there is, the higher framerate needed
[18:30:43] <RandomNinja> to be fair the modern jerky camera movement sucks for more reasons than that, but still
[18:30:49] <FN> 60fps is an accetable "middle ground"
[18:31:25] <Flurshy> I've never seen a movie in 60fps
[18:31:25] <RandomNinja> needs infinite framerate
[18:31:25] <FN> Modern cameras have horisontal scan and anti-aliasing filters that distort things and ruin each frame
[18:31:47] <FN> Thanx for nothing CMOS chips
[18:31:50] <Flurshy> the last of us was in 60fps but that was a little messed up because this isn't a true 1080p screen
[18:32:30] <FN> I'd rather play FPS game in lower resolution than below 60FPS
[18:32:45] <RandomNinja> the fun part of that was how half were enjoying the smoothness and the other half said it was too smooth and immersion breaking
[18:32:55] <FN> Because any lower than that and you are losing like mo tomorrow
[18:33:27] <Flurshy> the last of us is a third person survival game...
[18:33:37] <RandomNinja> yeh
[18:33:46] <RandomNinja> apparently the 60 fps ruined the "filmic look"
[18:33:56] <Flurshy> in my opinion it made it far more enjoyable
[18:33:59] <Trildar> 1/10 FPS too high
