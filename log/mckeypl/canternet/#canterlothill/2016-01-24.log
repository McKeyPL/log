[00:02:00] <JockeTF> The router I decided to get. It was on sale at the time: http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-Archer-C9-Wireless-1300Mbps/dp/B00PDLRHFW/

[00:02:05] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well yes, but I was saying more in terms of being stuck with BT's infrastructure as well.
[00:03:24] <Sketchy_Sounds> I'm with Virgin myself. Haven't had a need to buy a router because they actually give you a decent one.
[00:03:39] <Cloud_Zephyr> yeh. unfortunately most isps use bt infrastructure. unfortunaly virgin isn’t in my area yet

[00:04:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> That does make some sense, yes.
[00:05:51] <Sketchy_Sounds> This is most certainly one of the bigger benefits of living in a major population centre. We've had top-of-the-line Virgin fibre service available here for a while, with BT only recently catching up.
[00:05:59] <JockeTF> Sketchy_Sounds: My parents ISP (ComHem) gave them a router that would accept requests from JavaScript running on any site (due to incorrect CORS headers)... I gave them something else. :P

[00:18:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> anyone know if that router should be kinda future proof? looks like it will last a while, just it was released on 2013
[00:21:15] <Sketchy_Sounds> Really all it needs to be capable of is supporting... I think ADSL3 was the latest standard? Can't remember for that. That and as long as it's happy with IPv6, which i would expect it to be, and has Gigabit Ethernet support, which I would imagine it does.

[00:25:28] <Sketchy_Sounds> When something is obsolete, that means it either no longer works or is not up to the latest standard.
[00:25:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> The latter is the more common definition in computing.
[00:26:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> For example, something such as, say, an old 80386 CPU would be considered obsolete by today's standards, because it can no longer run the most up-to-date version of Windows.
[00:28:41] <Sketchy_Sounds> I suppose a better way of terming it is that something is obsolete when a newer version of it has been invented that outperforms it in every way.
[00:29:37] <Sketchy_Sounds> But again, it's somewhat of a sliding scale depending on the nature of the object being assessed for obsolescence and the task for which it has been assigned.
[00:29:59] <thereallynewmop12100> Do you think Windows will be future-proof in 2099?
[00:30:12] <Sketchy_Sounds> I don't think Windows will still exist in 2099.

[06:31:34] <LadyCameron> i prefer vtectax
[06:31:40] <HamtRamKc> I don't have any interesting deductions. Like Imight be able to declare whatever I give to the mid ohio foodbank and doctors without borders, but meh.
[06:31:53] <wobniaR> Look at us talking about boring adult stuff
[06:31:55] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> you get like 15/$50
[06:32:02] <wobniaR> There's someone to blame for this
[06:32:03] <MikeM> Vtectax is fun when the second bit kicks in.
[06:32:06] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> so it's usually worth it if it's provable and you're over your standard deduction already
[06:32:25] <HamtRamKc> Eh, me tax refund's big enough as it is.
[06:32:28] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> I might look at how much I donated on twitch and to Dusty last year so I can get some cash back
[06:32:32] <Flashy> how did they react to jabba the hut in a bikini?
[06:32:48] <HamtRamKc> Like I THINK I give 40 total a month to various charities
[06:32:48] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> I talked more to my roommate about magic for a little bit and then he started pounding his head on the doorframe
[06:33:02] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> "You're thinking about Jabba the Hut in a bikini, aren't you?" "Kinda, yeah..."
[06:33:09] <LadyCameron> that's how you hammer nails
[06:33:16] <HamtRamKc> so that'd get me like 115 dollars back? Not really worth the effort.
[06:33:28] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> HamtRamKc it only works if you're using itemized too
[06:33:37] <HamtRamKc> Yes that's the problem.
[06:33:44] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> Next is [[something Sonic does]]
[06:33:50] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> or well, last thing*
[06:33:51] <HamtRamKc> disappoint
[06:33:55] <Flashy> over dose on rings

[06:34:34] <HamtRamKc> EYwind: like afaik I could get my charitable donation information in a format where I could do the itemized deductions thingy but that'd take effort
[06:34:46] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> yeah but you'd have to itemize the rest too
[06:34:53] <HamtRamKc> What's itemizing anyway
[06:34:56] <Kelazi5> star in really bad fanfictions
[06:35:04] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> it's when you have a lot of other non-taxable stuff that you paid out
[06:35:11] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> that you can total up to more than the standard
[06:35:22] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> like for me, I paid like 7-8k in mortgage-related stuff I can deduct
[06:35:23] <HamtRamKc> I don't think I do.
[06:35:34] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> so that's more than the standard deduction of 5850 or somethiung
[06:35:41] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> so that means I can add more stuff on and reduce my taxable income more
[06:35:41] <HamtRamKc> Basically I don't have any debt at all.
[06:35:52] <HamtRamKc> I think most of the stuff you can use for that amounts to debt in some capacity
[06:35:55] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> yeah if you're not paying interest or mortgages then you probably don't itemize
[06:36:08] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> yeah pretty much
[06:36:15] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> alright, I'll get the lib tidied up and posted, one sec
[06:36:22] <Kelazi5> cool
[06:36:38] * Flashy glomps Ali
[06:36:39] <HamtRamKc> Maybe I should mortgage things so I can get the proper adult experience.

[06:39:41] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> I mean, I'm getting maybe $500 more back this year

[07:37:13] <LadyCameron> the answer: lmao not happening
[07:37:15] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> My Saturdays are different because now I don't have to avoid chat so I didn't feel like I had to moderate the IRC lol
[07:37:42] <FinalDraft> The worst part was that when we premiered songs, because of how last-minute final mixes got sent to Dave, I never heard what was playing live
[07:37:50] <FinalDraft> So I'd have to talk about tracks I hadn't heard yet

[08:00:29] <FinalDraft> *represses urge to rant*
[08:00:40] <NoraMermaid> we did meet up Draft, and he had nothing but good things to say about you
[08:00:45] <FinalDraft> what a liar
[08:00:45] <Flashy> must be better then LPU ^^
[08:00:49] <FinalDraft> lol
[08:00:55] <BlackSentinel> that's not saying anything
[08:01:05] <FinalDraft> Flashy: not really
[08:01:10] <FinalDraft> they just have more $$ to work with
[08:01:12] <NoraMermaid> what, im being honest, apart from calling you a bacon cheeseburger
[08:01:29] <Eywind> mmm bacon cheeseburger
[08:01:33] <Araxnus> ^
[08:01:33] <Flashy> i would love a bacon cheeseburger
[08:01:34] <FinalDraft> lol he probably used my line
[08:01:39] <NoraMermaid> he did
[08:01:42] *** Joins: FrozenSound (Frozen@Pony-kfkrl2.vri0.ofsc.0238.2a02.IP)
[08:01:47] <Faith> suddenly, Frozensound
[08:01:49] <FinalDraft> "I'm as Jewish as a bacon cheeseburger"
[08:01:54] <FinalDraft> ^accurate
[08:01:56] <NoraMermaid> yep thats the one
[08:01:59] <Eywind> hah

[08:02:00] *** Quits: MikeM (A@watcher.in.the.water) (Quit: Good night.)
[08:02:00] * LadyCameron  hasn't met FrozenSound before
[08:02:05] <LadyCameron> hi!

[08:02:21] <Eywind> ^
[08:02:34] <FrozenSound> have to be back at the Dreamhack in 3 hours
[08:02:45] <Araxnus> Ah. That is right.
[08:02:45] <FinalDraft> It's hard for me to read about/talk about conventions because I'm so damned biased
[08:02:54] <FinalDraft> 1) I run one
[08:02:58] <NoraMermaid> but Dave is a sweetheart, he was like "You gotta go to a con outside of denver, convince your family"
[08:02:59] <FinalDraft> 2) I've been to too many
[08:03:04] <FinalDraft> NoraMermaid: he isn't wrong
[08:03:06] <HamtRamKc> !t norf side long beach
[08:03:07] <FrozenSound> it's not a convention it's a LAN
[08:03:08] <DinkyBot> norf side long beach
[08:03:10] <Araxnus> I have my favs. And I have not even been to a con yet.
[08:03:21] <LadyCameron> i've been to derby city comic con
[08:03:21] <NoraMermaid> i know man, but i've only been to rotl the past three years
[08:03:24] <FinalDraft> FrozenSound: I was referring to an early chat here
[08:03:25] <FrozenSound> and an eSport tournament
[08:03:26] <LadyCameron> once. for work
[08:03:29] <FrozenSound> oh okay
[08:03:36] <FinalDraft> how was your event?
[08:03:39] <Eywind> I'm gonna head to bed, ya'll have fun chatting :)
[08:03:44] <FinalDraft> later Eywind 
[08:03:44] *** Quits: Eywind (Eywind@drifting.aimlessly) (Quit: )
[08:03:44] <NoraMermaid> i almost went to mlp msp in 2015 but my mom and dad were like nope, work
[08:03:45] <LadyCameron> nini windy
[08:03:55] <FinalDraft> NoraMermaid: it was a good time
[08:03:58] <FrozenSound> exhausting Draft
[08:04:04] <NoraMermaid> i wish i was there
[08:04:13] <NoraMermaid> then again im glad i didn't go
[08:04:14] <LadyCameron> saw a princess celestia, a luna, two fluttershys... good times
[08:04:22] <FinalDraft> what were you doing at your thing FrozenSound 
[08:04:22] <Faith> FrozenSound: Which game you more-so looking forward to?
[08:04:34] <NoraMermaid> because......well you know
[08:05:08] <Araxnus> WoW. Warcraft and World of Warcraft. -FrozenSound 
[08:05:17] <FrozenSound> shooting some footage for a report i'll produce at the local tv station
[08:05:22] <Araxnus> Oh wait the 2nd is not the same as the others xD
[08:05:28] <FrozenSound> hush Rax
[08:05:31] <NoraMermaid> then i almost went to grand brony gala 2015, but still, work got in the way so no
[08:05:36] <FinalDraft> I'm going to JapanPonycon this year... that's going to be amazing even if it's a tiny event
[08:05:48] * LadyCameron  can't wait to go to DCCC again, especially if it is for work. wants to see some RWBY cosplayers
[08:05:53] <Faith> JapanPonycon is definately one to go to
[08:05:56] <NoraMermaid> but then i was like, maybe i'll go to eqla, but that all changed with a tweet on june from ROTL
[08:06:29] <FrozenSound> I'm playing like Rax said WoW atm also Diablo 3 (*glares at FinalDraft*) also SWTOR and a bit Lol Faith 
[08:06:49] <FinalDraft> Back in 2013 I made a point to go to EVERY convention I could
[08:06:55] <NoraMermaid> damn
[08:06:56] <FinalDraft> this year, I may do 3 total
[08:07:00] <NoraMermaid> nice
[08:07:02] <Faith> dang, I haven't played SWTOR in forever
[08:07:05] <NoraMermaid> come to Running of the Leaves!!!!! We're small, lovely, and the people are amazing
[08:07:17] <Araxnus> Mmm. Yeah I bought Diablo III too.
[08:07:21] <NoraMermaid> usually, i'd say and I'll be there too, but i won't be there this year
[08:07:24] <FinalDraft> I can't justify too much vacation time outside of MSP, Japan, and maybe Ciderfest
[08:07:33] <FinalDraft> I even stepped down from running programming at Chicago
[08:07:37] <NoraMermaid> damn
[08:07:40] <Flashy> !t Ali
[08:07:41] <DinkyBot> Ali, pls. You're just in denial.
[08:07:44] <FrozenSound> it's worth to pick it up again Faith 
[08:08:01] <Faith> I'm gonna finally try Final Fantasy Online after all this time lol
[08:08:18] <NoraMermaid> i don't play video games
[08:08:20] <FinalDraft> I was offered a panel-programming management position at AMKE (Anime Milwaukee) and turned it down too. I just don't want to dominate my life with conventions
[08:08:20] <Araxnus> How I pick a con. Whoever has the best and pro staff.
[08:08:28] <FinalDraft> Araxnus: go to MSP
[08:08:30] <FinalDraft> done
[08:08:31] <LadyCameron> i go to the ones nearest me
[08:08:34] <FrozenSound> then you should poke Midli Faith he's playing too
[08:08:42] <LadyCameron> since i'm in louisville, that's derby city comic con
[08:08:51] <NoraMermaid> i would go to more........if my parents let me
[08:09:05] <Faith> I'll probably hit him up on Steam some time, FrozenSound lol
[08:10:00] <Araxnus> FinalDraft: Yeah. I know! Everfree Northwest is 2nd on my list. That and MSP are the only ones I am seriously considering. EqLA too if Cayci is doing that again I guess as well.
[08:10:02] * Ali gasps at FinalDraft 
[08:10:16] * FinalDraft is gasped at
[08:10:23] <NoraMermaid> and so far I really wanna go to everfree this year
[08:10:27] * Ali tries glomping!
[08:10:38] * NoraMermaid pokes FinalDraft 
[08:10:40] <FinalDraft> ack
[08:10:44] * Ali is gonna try Whinny Citty
[08:10:46] * Flashy interepts the gloms, and glomps Ali instead
[08:10:53] <Araxnus> Get Gabe at MSP :p
[08:10:56] <FinalDraft> Ali: I think that will be a really good convention
[08:11:04] <Ali> It has De Lance
[08:11:08] * Ali can't spell
[08:11:09] * LadyCameron  laughs; nobody can glomp like penny did to ruby
[08:11:19] <FinalDraft> I wish I could have gone, but if I have to chose between Chicago and Japan....well...
[08:11:26] <Ali> Doh
[08:11:37] <Flashy> japan all the way
[08:12:01] <FinalDraft> Actually, what happened is I was their Programming Division Director (I was even shooting for Vice Chair) but due to a very long story JHaller and I have the same employer now
[08:12:05] <NoraMermaid> why Japan
[08:12:15] <FinalDraft> And we can't both take the same weekend off, and he has family down there
[08:12:16] <LadyCameron> because he's big in japan
[08:12:35] <FinalDraft> so I gave that one to him... you can't argue against family
[08:12:51] <FinalDraft> I'm going to Japan because I find it fascinating and it's always been on my bucket list
[08:13:05] * LadyCameron  is moving further east in the future
[08:13:30] * LadyCameron  ... to the netherlands
[08:13:32] <Faith> prepare your body for snow. and lots of it.
[08:13:35] * Ali guesses she'll only have Berry to pester at Chicago then.
[08:13:54] <FinalDraft> Ali: Mike_Coltfield might be there
[08:14:03] <Ali> Last he told me he might not
[08:14:03] <LadyCameron> no snow in Eindhoven, though
[08:14:08] <Araxnus> Snow is scary. Oh and cold.
[08:14:10] <LadyCameron> rain, yes
[08:14:17] <FinalDraft> he's going for a job, if he gets it he may not go to many cons at all
[08:14:29] <LadyCameron> but it's supposed to be 48 today over there
[08:14:30] <Ali> Jobs will do that to you.
[08:14:37] <Araxnus> Ah the one in L.A.
[08:14:40] <FinalDraft> I really wish I could go to Chicago and MWBF, but it's going to be really hard to pull off either
[08:14:53] <FinalDraft> I'm going to Japan for 2 weeks much to the chagrin of my boss
[08:15:05] <LadyCameron> boss?
[08:15:11] <NoraMermaid> im hoping that if i can't go to efnw, i can go to mwbf
[08:15:13] <Araxnus> MWBF is not on my list as it is the week after EFNW/
[08:15:30] <Faith> Big Boss. Draft is secretly Solid Snake.
[08:15:33] <NoraMermaid> i want to do something before summer semester begins
[08:15:38] <NoraMermaid> so a con would be awesome 
[08:15:42] <LadyCameron> hehe
[08:15:44] <FinalDraft> LadyCameron: I have a day job lol
[08:15:49] <LadyCameron> ah
[08:15:52] <FinalDraft> MWBF is a solid event
[08:16:01] <NoraMermaid> i heard
[08:16:36] <NoraMermaid> i wanna do something after may 12 and before june 6, and cons are perfect
[08:16:47] <NoraMermaid> so im hoping either efnw or mwbf
[08:17:07] <FinalDraft> I think Crystal Mtn Pony Con is in there somewhere too
[08:17:18] <FinalDraft> But I haven't been to that one... I've heard some people say they had fun
[08:17:19] <Araxnus> Try for the fist one so we can meet in person, Nora :3
[08:17:27] <NoraMermaid> one of my very good friends was there last year
[08:17:43] <FinalDraft> but most people who go to conventions tend to meet friends and have fun - there are only a few rare cases where cons suck systemically
[08:18:08] <NoraMermaid> i want to!!!! especially this year, i might room with Tim there and someone i know wants to give me something there
[08:18:15] <NoraMermaid> I so want to Raxi!!
[08:18:17] *** Quits: DJMidli (DJMidli@Crazy.Dancing.Canadian.DJ.Pony) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[08:18:24] <Ali> And that's the one we don't speak of
[08:18:43] *** Snapai is now known as Sleepai
[08:18:51] <LadyCameron> nini Sleepai
[08:19:08] <FinalDraft> LPU was a train wreck that most attendees enjoyed somehow
[08:19:33] <FinalDraft> it was the vendors, media, VIPs and programming that had the migraines
[08:19:34] <NoraMermaid> yeah, before rotl con existed, lpu was the only con that colorado bronies could go to and they enjoyed
[08:19:37] <Ali> Though FinalDraft the Milwaukee con was fun, just some minor noise problems that kept me in noisecanceling headphones and the fact I had to clutch a Twilight Plushie to even be minorly social.
[08:19:52] <NoraMermaid> people still wear tees from that event to this very day
[08:19:57] <NoraMermaid> in colorado
[08:20:00] <FinalDraft> Ali:  you were there?! lol people keep haunting these things and not saying hi
[08:20:13] <Ali> Uhhhh FinalDraft, I talked to you at the con...
[08:20:19] <FinalDraft> wait a sec
[08:20:25] <Araxnus> Best con ever tho: Sweet Apple Acres :p
[08:20:46] <NoraMermaid> sorry, but Running of the Leaves rules!
[08:20:48] <FinalDraft> Ali: remind me when, those events are blurs
[08:20:57] <FinalDraft> and did you introduce yourself as Ali?
[08:21:14] <Faith> My last 2 BronyCons I met up with a few friends and had a great time. Kelazi, Snap Shot, HardCover, plenty of others
[08:21:17] <Ali> Probably right before the con really started, and yes I did tell you I was Ali, and that I saw you at Canterlot Gardens.
[08:21:29] * LadyCameron  has yet to attend a brony con
[08:21:34] <Snap_Shot> hmm?
[08:21:52] * NoraMermaid will probably never go to BronyCon
[08:22:05] <Faith> I gotta come up with a response to every time you say "hmm?" lol
[08:22:13] <Flashy> !t Snap_Shot
[08:22:14] <DinkyBot> Snap_Shot : thats pretty impressive
[08:22:16] <BlackSentinel> cam, never had a con close enough to you?
[08:22:22] <LadyCameron> i did once
[08:22:22] <FinalDraft> Ali: I remember that! crazy.
[08:22:26] <LadyCameron> when i lived in seattle
[08:22:55] <Ali> And the Secruity shirts!
[08:23:01] <LadyCameron> not sure what's near me now that i'm back in Louisville, Ky. though
[08:23:13] <Ali> Whinny City
[08:23:32] <Ali> There's one in KC
[08:23:34] <NoraMermaid> i found out that Nashville is starting a con
[08:23:43] <Ali> Milwaukee has a con
[08:23:57] <FinalDraft> Minneapolis has one...........
[08:24:03] <LadyCameron> :P
[08:24:07] <Ali> WHY CAN'T INDY!!!!
[08:24:08] <Faith> #DraftCon
[08:24:19] <Flashy> Ali, come to BronyCAN
[08:24:36] <NoraMermaid> Now I wonder what would happen if I go to MLP MSP and run into Draft
[08:24:45] <Ali> Faint
[08:24:51] <LadyCameron> you'd... not faint?
[08:24:52] <FinalDraft> NoraMermaid: if you don't legit faint like you did for Gabe I'll take it personally
[08:25:03] <FinalDraft> lol
[08:25:14] <Faith> Draft is requiring Gabe status now haha
[08:25:17] <NoraMermaid> first of all FinalDraft i only did it 7-8 times in front of him irl
[08:25:38] <FinalDraft> actual reaction: "oh god no, no, no, why? there is no god!!"
[08:25:46] <NoraMermaid> FinalDraft: you are not Gabe and you never will be
[08:25:53] <Faith> wrecked
[08:25:55] <FinalDraft> Not looking to be tbh
[08:25:57] <LadyCameron> unless you join the navy right now
[08:25:59] <LadyCameron> ;)
[08:26:07] <LadyCameron> that's half the game right there
[08:26:09] <NoraMermaid> good but i might give you a present
[08:26:18] <NoraMermaid> i do it for everyone
[08:26:20] <Faith> with my 12 week program you can be a Gabe today!
[08:26:26] <LadyCameron> hhee
[08:26:35] <NoraMermaid> Faith: why?
[08:26:43] <Faith> why not?
[08:26:44] <Ali> FinalDraft, do you happen to know off the top your head who's Rarity's Singing VA?
[08:26:48] <LadyCameron> because boy bands don't make themselves!
[08:26:50] <FinalDraft> Kazumi Evans

[08:27:55] * Ali squeees
[08:27:59] <FinalDraft> Kazumi is super nice
[08:28:07] <NoraMermaid> actually i think my interaction with draft might be a high five, a selfie, and maybe some teasing from him as well as puns
[08:28:09] <Ali> I'll get to meet her in Chicago
[08:28:37] <FinalDraft> followed by fainting
[08:28:51] <LadyCameron> screaming, hollering, and loss of control
[08:28:51] <Ali> Eh I didn't pass out when meeting Tara
[08:28:52] <Faith> have your fainting couches handy

[08:29:21] <Ali> Just wish I wasn't so stupid shy
[08:29:22] <NoraMermaid> no fainting Draft!!
[08:29:23] <FinalDraft> that's the problem - when you have to pick and choose who to bring to a convention ;P

[15:54:53] <Fancy_Pants> Ponies! A moment of your time!
[15:54:59] <Fancy_Pants> I have a conundrum with which some companionable assistance would be greatly helpful. The key component of the question is Canterlot. How do you imagine the city works/functions/is built? What places are there in it? Anything at all.
[15:55:27] <thereallynewmop12100> Fancy_Pants: Hello
[15:55:44] <Fancy_Pants> Greetings my good sir!
[15:56:07] <thereallynewmop12100> Fancy_Pants: How are you?
[15:56:31] <Fancy_Pants> I am in a state of wellbeing similar to that in which most other ponies are in.
[15:58:39] <thereallynewmop12100> Fancy_Pants: Canterlot has 10 or 20 places. 
[16:00:07] <Fancy_Pants> Alas good sir, I doubt you are correct. Certainly, only a few places have been shown on the television series, but it IS the capital city of Equestria. Surely there is more than that. That is the knowledge I seek.
[16:00:50] <RandomNinja> Fancy_Pants, this is not a roleplaying channel, FYI

[16:01:32] <Fancy_Pants> I just like being able to play up my Britishness.
[16:01:41] <Sketchy_Sounds> Do his locutions confuse?
[16:02:14] <Fancy_Pants> Seriously, does anyone have any thoughts on what kind of places, buildings, etc. exist in Canterlot?
[16:02:26] <Sketchy_Sounds> A palace
[16:02:36] <RandomNinja> are you asking for worldbuilding reasons?
[16:02:45] <RandomNinja> because that's a pretty big question in that case
[16:03:48] <Sketchy_Sounds> In all seriousness though, in the course of my story writing I've come up with a number of bits and bobs, such as Royal guard barracks, sandwich shops, tearooms, a street dedicated to seamstresses, and all sorts of things.
[16:04:29] <RandomNinja> red light district :P
[16:04:35] <Sketchy_Sounds> No XD
[16:05:25] <Fancy_Pants> Indeed RandomNinja. World building is the object of the exercise.
[16:06:53] <Fancy_Pants> Actually RandomNinja, you make a good point. I do like the idea that Canterlot, mountain city that it is, has a rather seedy underbelly that the high society ponies ignore, as all we see in the show is "High" Canterlot. The rich areas.

[16:08:28] <Sketchy_Sounds> I definitely invite you to do some picking through my own writing then, seeing as the one and a half very long stories I've written are set almost entirely in the city.

[16:12:00] <Fancy_Pants> I might very well do that!
[16:12:44] <Sketchy_Sounds> ^^
[16:12:51] <Fancy_Pants> Also, I'm trying to think of puns on places like theatres and culture-y places.
[16:13:04] <Fancy_Pants> The Barbicolt (Barbican)
[16:13:18] <Fancy_Pants> The Royal Alicorn Hall (Royal Albert Hall)
[16:13:20] <Fancy_Pants> Etc
[16:13:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> That second one is really good, I wish I'd thought of that one actually XD
[16:13:45] <HamtRamKc> isn't ponyville the seedy underbelly of Canterlot
[16:13:52] <Sketchy_Sounds> HAHA OH DAMN
[16:13:56] <HamtRamKc> I mean for all intents and purposes it's a nudisty colony literally situated on top of the gates of hell
[16:14:02] <Fancy_Pants> Wow
[16:14:17] <Fancy_Pants> That's... Surprisingly accurate
[16:15:01] <Fancy_Pants> I like to think that Tartarus has its gate under the Canterhorn, which is one of the reasons Celestia built the city there.
[16:15:22] <HamtRamKc> Makes sense.
[16:15:39] <HamtRamKc> Also the crystal caves beneath canterlot seem to have /something/ going on
[16:15:51] <Fancy_Pants> Smuggling?
[16:16:11] <HamtRamKc> or canterlot was built there and the ponies mined too deep and, well, hit the gates to tartarus :V
[16:16:17] <Fancy_Pants> What do you think of Canterlot Mafia families?
[16:16:32] <Sketchy_Sounds> I don't think that'd work, to be honest
[16:16:47] <RandomNinja> if they're not 30's stereotypes you're doing it wrong
[16:16:55] <Fancy_Pants> Ooh, nice idea Hammy
[16:17:20] <Sketchy_Sounds> From a purely logical standpoint, it'd be difficult to operate a criminal network right under the watchful eyes of the Princesses and their Guards.
[16:17:26] <Fancy_Pants> Maybe not mafia... I need some corruption though.
[16:17:39] <RandomNinja> probably more Manehattan
[16:17:41] <Sketchy_Sounds> Now if it were Manehattan, I could totally see it.
[16:17:46] <Fancy_Pants> The nobles. Look at Blueblood as an example.
[16:18:08] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah if you want corruption in Canterlot, I'd say it's got to be more subtle. More political.
[16:18:23] <Fancy_Pants> Easy. I know several politicians.
[16:18:37] <Fancy_Pants> I know how they work. *cue evil laugh*
[16:18:42] <Sketchy_Sounds> More a case of the sort of nasty, dirty, claok-and-dagger shenanigans noble families that don't like eachother would get up to.
[16:18:55] <Fancy_Pants> Yesssss
[16:18:58] <Sketchy_Sounds> **cloak
[16:18:58] <RandomNinja> I imagine Fancu Pants as the one really powerful straight edge that all the schemers hate
[16:19:16] <Fancy_Pants> Exactly why I like him! :D
[16:19:16] <Sketchy_Sounds> That's practically canon as it is, RandomNinja.
[16:19:26] <RandomNinja> actual court intrigue isn't though
[16:19:45] <Fancy_Pants> But it's surely there
[16:19:52] <RandomNinja> maybe
[16:20:06] <Sketchy_Sounds> I mean it was pretty obvious in that one Rarity episode that if Fancy Pants decides he likes someone, it's very disagreeable to ridicule them - regardless of what you think of them.
[16:20:25] <Fancy_Pants> We know Celestia holds the "Day Court", where ponies come petition her, so there would definitely be some intrigue there.
[16:20:32] <thereallynewmop12100> Besides. Is Rarity still likes Fancy Pants?
[16:20:37] <RandomNinja> it's less likely when the ruler is basically an immortal god
[16:20:44] <Sketchy_Sounds> Not really relevant here, thereallynewmop12100.
[16:21:04] <Fancy_Pants> But she tends not to interfere as long as it's not life threatening. 
[16:21:35] <RandomNinja> yeah but any attempt at grabbing power would be lolnoped
[16:21:35] <Fancy_Pants> Also, the Gala would be so much fun to write. The intrigue and powermongering.
[16:21:40] <sunsetwubs> thereallynewmop12100: look who,s back 
[16:21:41] <sunsetwubs> <
[16:21:48] <Fancy_Pants> Not so much grabbing power. 
[16:21:53] <Sketchy_Sounds> My perception of Celestia's always been that she lets the nobles play their petty little games and subtly manipulates them when and where she sees fit, only intervening directly if there's a real threat to life or limb or such.
[16:21:54] <Fancy_Pants> Influencing Celestia though.
[16:21:57] <RandomNinja> hm true
[16:22:06] <Fancy_Pants> Exactly Sketchy
[16:22:24] <Fancy_Pants> Of course, Celestia has had millennia to perfect her political game
[16:22:36] <Fancy_Pants> These nobles are children compared to her.
[16:22:40] <WildSoft> My OCD is tingling xD https://youtu.be/bPM8LKYMcXs
[16:22:41] <Sketchy_Sounds> It's been proven here and there that Celestia's a grand chessmaster, or can be. I imagine she has them all under her hoof, they just don't realise they are.
[16:22:43] <DinkyBot>  [ Самый смешной балет, из тех что я видел - YouTube ]
[16:22:54] <WildSoft> Also, I heard it's snowy in the states
[16:23:07] <Sketchy_Sounds> They all think they're influencing her, but actually it's the other way around.
[16:23:42] <Fancy_Pants> Heheh, sounds just like what I'm thinking of Sketchy. 
[16:24:32] <RandomNinja> when you've been playing with Discord everyone else must seem like a moron
[16:25:04] <Sketchy_Sounds> Naturally I would expect that every so often there are the odd few schemers that genuinely try to plot against her or what have you, but she knows how to put such things down.
[16:25:11] <RandomNinja> !t horses
[16:25:12] <DinkyBot> tactically horses around
[16:25:21] <RandomNinja> excellent decision
[16:25:24] <Fancy_Pants> Indeed they must. ... Though... Can you imagine Canterlot intrigue once Discord returned? Or Luna for that matter?
[16:25:55] <Sketchy_Sounds> Oh yeah, I imagine when Luna cam,e back that must have set a lot of ponies' heads spinning.
[16:26:01] <Fancy_Pants> They'd try and influence Luna during Night Court, or sneak sneaky things past her, hoping she'd be less experienced
[16:26:08] <thereallynewmop12100> sunsetwubs: #SunsetwubsIsBack 
[16:26:12] <RandomNinja> do you even history books
[16:26:41] <sunsetwubs> yup
[16:26:47] <Sketchy_Sounds> If anything Luna's probably got an even SHARPER mind. She's the only one that ever managed to get something past her sister, almost.
[16:27:02] <Fancy_Pants> Exactly. But the nobles wouldn't have realised that.
[16:27:12] <RandomNinja> she did?
[16:27:27] <Fancy_Pants> The Nightamre Moon incident?
[16:27:35] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yes, RandomNinja. Her transformation into Nightmare Moon. CCelly didn't see it coming until it was too late.
[16:28:23] <RandomNinja> that didn't really look like scheming as much as Luna snapping to me though
[16:28:47] <thereallynewmop12100> sunsetwubs: I can't wait
[16:28:58] <Sketchy_Sounds> Maybe, maybe not. But either way, she managed to keep her growing dissatisfaction hidden from her sister until then.
[16:31:09] <RandomNinja> how canon are the comics?
[16:31:12] <Fancy_Pants> How exactly would the nobles decide who was influential? What gives you power in Canterlot?
[16:31:21] <RandomNinja> the whole nightmare spirit thing specifically
[16:31:33] <Sketchy_Sounds> Comics aren't considered canon
[16:31:55] <Sketchy_Sounds> Or more specifically they're considered their own separate take, I believe.
[16:32:32] <Sketchy_Sounds> Fancy_Pants: business, I would expect, along with bloodline to a certain extent.
[16:33:57] <Sketchy_Sounds> I'm pretty sure Blueblood, as an example, only holds any sort of sway with anyone due to him being a relative of Celestia.
[16:34:32] <RandomNinja> for some reason I'm reminded of a HiE crackfic where he tries to introduce democracy to equestria

[16:36:33] <Fancy_Pants> It 'intrigues' me.
[16:37:22] <Fancy_Pants> Sketchy_Sounds: which is why the various fashion personages are so influential. They have big business on Canterlot. Thus, POWER.
[16:37:30] <Sketchy_Sounds> Mmhmm
[16:37:59] <Sketchy_Sounds> I would imagine a number of caterers and patissieres have some influence as well.
[16:38:06] <Fancy_Pants> Bloodline too. That's very important indeed.
[16:38:18] <RandomNinja> what are patissieres
[16:38:30] <Fancy_Pants> Also, Twilight must be from a pretty influential family. Nepotism and all that. 
[16:38:32] <Sketchy_Sounds> Bakers. More specifically, those that make sweets and fancy things.
[16:38:40] <RandomNinja> ah
[16:38:44] <Fancy_Pants> They're Prench.
[16:38:58] <Sketchy_Sounds> But yes, you know exactly why they'd have influence. XD
[16:39:03] <RandomNinja> lots of fanfics have them be royalty
[16:39:06] <Fancy_Pants> Small cakes, tarts, sweet pastries etc.
[16:40:23] <Sketchy_Sounds> Twi's family are obviously of high standing. I mean, their son is Captain of the Guard and married to royalty, and Twi herself is also a Princess.
[16:40:45] <Fancy_Pants> Indeed. They had a princess as a foal sitter, their son becomes a prince, and Captain of the Guard (presumably quite swiftly), Twilight is chosen as Celestia's personal protégée, and later becomes a princess in her own right. Nice breeding Night Light and Velvet.
[16:40:52] <Fancy_Pants> Hahahahah
[16:40:54] <Sketchy_Sounds> Even if they'd not had much influence already, they definitely do by now :p
[16:41:06] <HamtRamKc> Speaking of breeding
[16:41:12] <HamtRamKc> I still like the idea that Twilight/Sunset/Moondancer/Trixie/Starlight are all descended from Starswirl the Bearded, but only if Discord is actually Starswirl, just because of how wonderfully awkward

[16:41:20] <RandomNinja> the royal guard could be a meritocracy, but yeah
[16:41:30] <Fancy_Pants> That would be fabulous Hammy
[16:41:33] <HamtRamKc> Also Celestia like /navigated/ all these breeding lines to produce the uh
[16:41:52] <Fancy_Pants> Yes she did. She is THE chess master.
[16:42:24] <Fancy_Pants> Indeed RandomNinja, though they'd still be some things going on in its ranks.
[16:42:41] <Sketchy_Sounds> I'd say the Guard is primarily a meritocracy, though possibly with a few bought-in commissions here and there.
[16:42:51] <Fancy_Pants> Mhmm.
[16:43:21] <Fancy_Pants> Though the Royal Guard seems to mostly be ceremonial...
[16:43:45] <Sketchy_Sounds> Mmm, I'm not so sure about that.
[16:43:53] <Fancy_Pants> Although, most of the threats they've faced recently have been way out of their league.
[16:44:01] <Fancy_Pants> So that might be it.
[16:44:01] <Sketchy_Sounds> They didn't look all that ceremonial when Canterlot came under attack by changeleings.
[16:44:18] <Fancy_Pants> True, thy actually did good there.
[16:44:34] <Fancy_Pants> And Tirek sucked them dry before they could retaliate
[16:44:44] <Fancy_Pants> Very well, I withdraw my previous statement.
[16:44:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> He did, though he'd had to covertly suck a lot of other ponies dry first.
[16:45:08] <Fancy_Pants> It is quite small for a standing army though.
[16:45:31] <Sketchy_Sounds> Mmm, again I'm unsure about that. We've only seen what's in Canterlot.
[16:45:57] <Fancy_Pants> True. Perhaps each city has their own section of Guard.
[16:46:11] <Fancy_Pants> Also, I'm curious as to who acts as the police.
[16:46:13] <Sketchy_Sounds> And I'd equate that to being not too dissimilar from the ceremonial guard our own Queen retains in London. It's a small share of active forces.
[16:46:33] <Fancy_Pants> We know Manehattan has actual police from the comics, but Canterlot?
[16:46:59] <Fancy_Pants> Very true Sketchy
[16:47:12] <Sketchy_Sounds> My thinking was that in Canterlot at least, they've retained a simplified system whereby the currently active members of the Royal Guard patrol Canterlot and deal with criminal offences as well as public defence.
[16:48:02] <Sketchy_Sounds> That is to say, the Guards apprehend criminals and are responsible for detaining them, and they're then dealt with by Canterlot's courts.
[16:48:19] <Fancy_Pants> That's exactly what I like to think. Which is the premise for my Night Watch story.
[16:48:29] <Fancy_Pants> Does Celestia act as judge?
[16:48:57] <Sketchy_Sounds> I'd imagine she only does that for very important cases, and has officials in place for smaller ones.
[16:49:40] <Fancy_Pants> Most likely. Those cases which involve the state, herself or mirder in her city perhaps?
[16:49:49] <Fancy_Pants> *murder
[16:49:50] <HamtRamKc> what if Blooblued's basically horse batman.
[16:49:55] <Sketchy_Sounds> Like I said, serious crimes.
[16:49:55] <Fancy_Pants> No
[16:50:02] <Fancy_Pants> Indeed.
[16:50:23] <Sketchy_Sounds> If someone was plotting treason, as an example, or regicide, or similarly ugly things.
[16:50:38] <Fancy_Pants> Trying to kill Celestia? Foolish.
[16:51:08] <Sketchy_Sounds> Of course, but it doesn't mean people won't try it :p
[16:51:23] <Fancy_Pants> True. People are foolish.
[16:51:27] <Fancy_Pants> Again and again.
[16:51:47] <Fancy_Pants> I can see assassination being common...
[16:51:56] <Fancy_Pants> Or attempts anyway
[16:51:57] <Sketchy_Sounds> It's like K says in MiB. A person is smart. People are dumb, foolish, stupid, panicky animals, and you know it.
[16:52:27] <Sketchy_Sounds> It only takes one person listening to another person being stupid and agreeing with that for it to spread.
[16:53:15] <Fancy_Pants> Heh, very true.
[16:54:00] <Fancy_Pants> Can you imagine someone trying to start a revolution in Canterlot?
[16:54:04] <Fancy_Pants> That'd be hilarious
[16:55:01] <HamtRamKc> Would regicide even work on Celestia?
[16:55:08] <HamtRamKc> I'd imagine she'd stay dead for maybe five minutes
[16:55:54] <Fancy_Pants> Like a Phoenix? Where have we seen one of those...
[16:56:44] <Sketchy_Sounds> Certainly there's an even bigger deterrrent for attempting it, nowadays.
[16:57:26] <Sketchy_Sounds> Cos the problem any would-be assassin now faces if they wanted to try to kill one of the Royal Sisters is that, if they succeed, the other one will becomee immensely pissed off with them.
[16:57:28] <Fancy_Pants> Luna?
[16:57:29] <HamtRamKc> I'm assuming Celestia actually did die for a bit when Luna blasted her fwiw
[16:57:50] <HamtRamKc> Just a smidgen.

[22:21:59] <HamtRamKc> I need to replay Undertale, apparently there's a bunch of weird hidden stuff
[22:22:14] <Eywind> there indeed is
[22:22:23] <Eywind> plus there's new dialogue with the newest patch 
[22:22:45] <Eywind> Really, though, the weird hidden stuff is all about having Fun.
[22:23:20] <HamtRamKc> I'm having a strange time of trying to sort out my thoughts on gaming in general
[22:25:31] <HamtRamKc> Like i'm not even sure what kind of games I like anymore, although I... guess I play games more for the emotional response? I get from them than necessarily finding them /fun/ per se?
[22:25:41] <HamtRamKc> I mean super-un-fun is bad.
[22:25:54] <Eywind> super unfun games are great
[22:26:26] <HamtRamKc> But I don't know if having really solid gameplay mechanics resonates with me quite as much as having a really interesting world or atmosphere.
[22:26:57] <HamtRamKc> Trying to play shmups more seriously hurt my enjoyment of them -- I think I like just chilling out and credit feeding through them and appreciating the music and the flow of the levels and the art.
[22:27:04] <HamtRamKc> That sounds really casual but I don't care!
