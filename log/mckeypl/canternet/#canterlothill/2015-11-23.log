[01:58:23] <Regulus> Extra 40 at tier 5, plus 25% more from lone wanderer 3 if you're using dogmeat, plus another 15% from bloody mess 3
[01:58:59] <Sombra> I thought lone wanderer didn't count if you had dogmeat with you.
[01:59:09] <Regulus> It really makes shotguns, rifles, and the gauss rifle super deadly

[01:59:35] <Sombra> So as long as you don't have a human as a companion its in effect?

[02:00:00] <Regulus> Anyone other than dogmeat voids the perk
[02:00:28] <Regulus> So damage resistance, extra carry weight, and bonus damage

[04:16:26] <MikeM> Howdy, Boxer
[04:17:10] <Boxer> How's things?
[04:18:10] <MikeM> Procrastination has its downsides.
[04:18:12] <thereallynewmop12100> Hamtramck: Unikitty from the lego movie 
[04:18:26] <Boxer> What are you working on?
[04:18:37] <MikeM> Math homework.
[04:18:47] <Eywind> I'm sure you'll get it done
[04:18:54] <Eywind> math is easy for me so it has to be easy for everyone
[04:18:59] <MikeM> hahaha
[04:19:19] <Eywind> lmk ifyou need help though
[04:19:23] <Eywind> not sure what math you're in but I've probably done it before?
[04:19:26] <Boxer> Calc.?
[04:19:53] <MikeM> Equations and graphs. 
[04:19:56] <Eywind> have to warn you if you're in multivariable calc or discrete math I probably got like a C in there
[04:19:58] <thereallynewmop12100> I hate Math
[04:20:09] <MikeM> Def. not any calculus
[04:20:14] <Eywind> lol yea it's cool
[04:22:12] <Regulus> RandomNinja, explosive minigun is best minigun
[04:22:38] <Regulus> It significantly outperforms the gattling laser
[04:23:14] * thereallynewmop12100 makes RandomNinja explode
[04:23:34] <Regulus> Gunner's sight and tri-barrel is pretty nice
[04:23:58] <Regulus> Now I need waaaaaaaay more 5mm ammo
[04:24:38] <Boxer> You're  distracting MikeM.
[04:24:55] <MikeM> Me? Naw, I'm fine.
[04:25:32] <Regulus> Also, titanium MK VI X-01 combat armor can seriously tank a mini nuke.
[04:29:45] * RandomNinja boops MikeM 
[04:30:18] <RandomNinja> Regulus, explosive gatling laser tho
[04:30:31] <Regulus> nope

[04:31:02] * thereallynewmop12100 waves to MikeM "Goodnight!"
[04:31:06] <RandomNinja> MikeM confirmed fox
[04:31:16] <Regulus> Minigun pumps out rounds faster, and that 15 aoe damage per shot buff works wonders on enemies behind cover

[04:31:27] <MikeM> Noo...the tail was a gift.
[04:31:37] <RandomNinja> also, bleeding is even more ridiculous
[04:31:41] <Regulus> Even a tri-barrel is a bullet hose
[04:31:47] <RandomNinja> 25 damage per bullet DoT
[04:32:04] <Regulus> Radiation is really crazy.
[04:32:12] <RandomNinja> oh?
[04:32:30] <Regulus> 50 damage per bullet, but useless on pretty much anything but humans

[09:52:24] <Boxer> Did you stoke the fireplace?
[09:53:32] <JockeTF> Boxer: Certainly. But I hope they have enough trash without me going overboard.
[10:01:21] <Boxer> What is overboard to you, JockeTF?
[10:03:20] <JockeTF> Boxer: Well, I usually throw away ~1 trash bag per week.
[10:03:26] <JockeTF> Wouldn't want to do even more. :)
[10:04:11] <Boxer> No composting?
[10:06:26] <JockeTF> Well, they said they'd start that for my apartment too, but that hasn't happened.
