[16:55:38] <Unixkitty> By the way, graphics in this game are rather decent, I'm not entirely sure what people are complaining about
[16:55:47] <RandomNinja> compare Witcher 3
[16:56:07] <Unixkitty> I haven't played it
[16:56:33] <wobniaR> People complain about anything that doesn't run 1080 60 fps 100% of the time on all hardware
[16:56:41] <Unixkitty> And it's a completely different game by different developers, things like budgets and scale always have to be kept in mind
[16:56:46] <RandomNinja> http://gfycat.com/EagerAgedGalapagostortoise
[16:57:14] <FN> Or rather, wobniaR, people are more likely to voicce their complaints than their satisfaction
[16:57:19] <Unixkitty> That gif is way too pixely RandomNinja

[16:57:41] <Unixkitty> ^
[16:58:19] <Unixkitty> I imagine most satisfied people simply play enjoy their time quietly without feeling the need to debate on the internet
[16:58:29] <Unixkitty> edit: word
[16:58:43] <wobniaR> Witcher 3 is medieval fantasy rpg, fallout 4 is post-apocalyptic futuristic 1950's
[16:59:03] <RandomNinja> also, different kind of game
[16:59:05] <wobniaR> The worlds alone are going to look drastically different
[16:59:09] <RandomNinja> engine-wise that is
[16:59:36] <RandomNinja> pretty much any other engine would explode at what Gamebryo does
[16:59:41] <Unixkitty> I wish Elder Scrolls VI would appear soon
[16:59:56] <Unixkitty> And not Soon™ soon
[16:59:59] <FN> I wish EA would us frostbite for some gorgeous cinematic single player game

[17:00:41] <Unixkitty> inb4 people complaining ww2 theme is overused
[17:00:54] <wobniaR> I wish EA would let us crash an emperor-class spaceship into darth vader
[17:01:00] <RandomNinja> to be fair it kinda was at the time
[17:01:09] <RandomNinja> there is only so much you can do with "kill hitler"
[17:01:29] <wobniaR> That would probably destroy the planet too, but worth it
[17:01:37] <FN> And yet no games actually let you kill hitler!
[17:01:37] <Unixkitty> I personally haven't played any of those Call of Duty 2 type games...
[17:01:40] <Zuthal> wobniaR: You can at least do the "crashing an ISD into a planet" part in space engineers :P
[17:01:41] <RandomNinja> Wolfenstein does
[17:01:54] <FN> Ooh? Didn't knew that
[17:01:57] <RandomNinja> though not The New Order, sadly
[17:02:03] <wobniaR> You can kill zombie hitler in nazi zombie army, and hitler in sniper elite
[17:02:10] <Zuthal> you will need the NSA's supercomputer to play it anything more than one frame per hour, but still
[17:02:14] <RandomNinja> although it does have nazis on the moon and laser rifles, so there's that
[17:02:23] <Unixkitty> I did play through The New Order, but that was like alternate universe

[17:02:45] <FN> I would love it if Hitman series would venture into "kill hitler" field
[17:02:58] <RandomNinja> it knew exactly what it wanted to be and was better for it
[17:03:19] <RandomNinja> FN, like carrying out all those failed assasination attempts?
[17:03:26] <FN> Yup
[17:03:31] <RandomNinja> that would be cool
[17:03:40] <FN> I thought about it
[17:03:46] <RandomNinja> we could use more WW2 games though
[17:03:55] <FN> It can even be true to history
[17:04:50] <Unixkitty> Stupid dog keeps leading me to mirelurks and bears
[17:05:05] <wobniaR> There any games with the scenario "what if the axis powers won?"
[17:05:14] <RandomNinja> Wolfenstein?
[17:05:17] <wobniaR> Yao guai are friendly
[17:05:18] <FN> Like you play all the failed assassinations as a Hitman who was sent back in time, and then when you succeed in killing hitler, you make everything worse all of a sudden, so you have to get back in time again and killy our previous self1

[17:08:53] <RandomNinja> isn't that completely unrelated anyway?
[17:09:17] <Zuthal> Almost, ye.
[17:09:37] <FN> Yeah the network of alliances would explode anyway
[17:09:41] <Zuthal> Also... if you remove Hitler, Germany might instead get a leader who is maybe a bit less worse, but actually competent in military strategy.
[17:09:52] <RandomNinja> Zuthal, did you read my second link?
[17:10:10] <FN> Just the point of start and the powers in question would be different

[17:10:47] * RandomNinja applies movies about Hitler saving the world from time travelers to chat
[17:11:05] <Zuthal> FN: the "network of alliances would explode anyways" is a thing that I hear more with respect to WWI
[17:11:08] <FN> So just removing one variable would not do that much of a difference
[17:11:24] <FN> For all we know stalin may have been even worse
[17:12:19] <Zuthal> Or, without Germany to apply at least some resistance, and the western allies in the west of Europe, soviet russia might have conquered all of europe
[17:12:28] <FN> Zuthal, network of alliances and vowing to aid in conflicts is like a room full of loaded mouse traps, no matter which one you set off, eventually they all will go off
[17:12:29] <RandomNinja> dunno, Germany gathered behind a leader who was willing to take revenge on Europe is fairly important

[19:32:35] <Dew_Leaf> Tanks and arial support.
[19:32:50] <Unixkitty> It is an MMO though, and you have thousands of players on the battlefield

[19:33:47] <Dew_Leaf> Fully customizable down to what you want it's abilities to be. Only 16v16 as of now but eve players can participate from space with orbital bombardments
[19:34:03] <RandomNinja> funnily enough my favorite moment in BF2 was actually one of brutal defeat
[19:34:14] <Dew_Leaf> Tell me more?
[19:34:21] <RandomNinja> turns out running 25 or so tanks through a valley is a terrible idea
[19:35:04] <RandomNinja> not long after entering the enemies started popping up on the sides, raining missiles down on us from above

[19:35:38] <Dew_Leaf> No
[19:35:52] <RandomNinja> It seemed as a good idea at the as we were basically steamrolling the continent before that
[19:36:15] <RandomNinja> well yeah we won eventually, but by then most of our armored forces were taken out
[19:36:40] <Dew_Leaf> My favorite dust514 memory was of me taking off in my drop ship and and a tank just fell out of the sky and tore me to pieces on the way down
[19:36:45] <RandomNinja> hah
[19:36:57] <Unixkitty> How could anyone think tanks through a valley would be a good idea anyway
[19:37:09] <Dew_Leaf> Just a random unnamed tank dropped out of nowhere
[19:37:10] <RandomNinja> because we were already winning and got cocky
[19:37:38] <Unixkitty> Because that obviously always ends well
[19:37:38] <RandomNinja> still worth it though, because it was fun with some actual opposition for the first time in hours
[19:37:53] <RandomNinja> note that both enemies united to take us down without infighting

[19:43:20] <RandomNinja> what does 30% cooler even mean?
[19:43:33] <Zuthal> temperature is 30% less?
[19:43:33] <Unixkitty> 30 seconds flat?
[19:43:39] <RandomNinja> relatively to what?
[19:43:45] <Zuthal> Though 30% less in absolute temperature would be impressive
[19:43:50] <RandomNinja> exactly
[19:43:54] <Zuthal> that'd be, like, on the order of 90-100 K
[19:44:07] <Zuthal> less, that is
[19:44:08] <Dew_Leaf> Wouldn't the best graphics card have a liquid cooling system?
[19:44:20] <RandomNinja> anything that's not measured to a known absolute needs definition
[19:44:39] <RandomNinja> yes, though those are fairly messy to set up
[19:44:44] <Dew_Leaf> I didn't understand that last post sorry
[19:44:54] <Zuthal> also
[19:45:00] <RandomNinja> if you say "X% cooler" you need a reference point
[19:45:03] <Zuthal> that would require a cryogenic cooling system
[19:45:07] <Dew_Leaf> Well aren't they more effective. Just need to be careful
[19:45:24] <Zuthal> plus, x% cooler/hotter is only meaningful in absolute temperature
[19:45:40] <RandomNinja> no I mean they take a lot more work and more space to put in
[19:45:50] <RandomNinja> Zuthal water cooling
[19:46:20] <Zuthal> RandomNinja: I think for a 100K reduction from what a normal graphics card operates at you'd almost need cryo
[19:46:31] <Dew_Leaf> Well if you have two fans. Wouldn't it take up only a little more room?
[19:46:34] <RandomNinja> water acts as a buffer and you can in theory have as many radiations and fans as you want
[19:46:34] <Zuthal> not LN2, but maybe, like, liquid ammonia or something
[19:46:43] <Dew_Leaf> I think a tower can space the space
[19:46:44] <Zuthal> water is awesome at cooling shit
[19:46:49] <RandomNinja> ah yeah I thought you meant generally
[19:46:50] <Zuthal> because it has a huge heat capacity
[19:46:57] <RandomNinja> for actual sub-room temp yes
[19:47:14] <Zuthal> though even better would be flooding the computer with some sort of non-conducting (and preferably nonpolar) liquid
[19:47:26] <Dew_Leaf> ?
[19:47:28] <RandomNinja> Dew_Leaf, that doesn't change the fact that it takes more money and work
[19:47:28] <Zuthal> and circulating that through a heat exchanger
[19:47:37] <RandomNinja> that's been done, and it's awesome
[19:47:43] <miss> RandomNinja: have some super coffee.http://images.techtimes.com/data/images/full/124408/dc-cafe4-jpg.jpg?w=600
[19:47:49] <RandomNinja> mineral oil is commonly used
[19:47:58] <Dew_Leaf> Flooding the computer? Wouldn't that mean you have a lot of trouble working on it?
[19:48:11] <Zuthal> Dew_Leaf: Well, you can drain it whenever you want to swap a compoennt
[19:48:20] <Dew_Leaf> Oh
[19:48:21] <Zuthal> but generally you'd do that only once you have finalised the design
[19:48:33] <Zuthal> ...could also of course use some internal fans to move the liquid around more
[19:48:47] <Dew_Leaf> All I ever swap is ram chips out for a larger memory or pulling a hard drive
[19:48:48] <Zuthal> RandomNinja: the problemw ith those is of course that they are flammable
[19:49:04] <Dew_Leaf> I did replace my fan in my laptop the other day though
[19:49:22] <RandomNinja> Zuthal, what about a counterflow cooler system?
[19:49:35] <Zuthal> you mean for cooling the coolant? Ye

[19:54:54] <Trildar> Dunno. Not that I've heard much, but I usually hear that distilled water is fine and special coolant liquid is mainly for the safety of accidental leaks not frying your system.
[19:54:54] <RandomNinja> this is true
[19:55:07] <Zuthal> Hmm... if you want it to be nonflammable, maybe you could use some sort of perfluorocarbon for a submerged system

[19:56:16] <Zuthal> Good idea: Cooling your overclocked PC with liquid cooling
[19:56:21] <RandomNinja> this is true for 100% of things involving chlorine triflouride
[19:56:22] <Zuthal> Bad idea: Using ClF3 as the coolant
[19:56:33] <Zuthal> even using it as flamethrower liquid
[19:56:35] <RandomNinja> I water cool mine, it's pretty neat
[19:56:44] <Zuthal> the nazis investigated it for that, and it was too much for them

[23:22:29] <Cloud_Zephyr> yay!
[23:23:26] <Cloud_Zephyr> darn it, this episode isn’t about the nerdery in mizzou (would go perfect with the season theme)
[23:23:31] <Cloud_Zephyr> but oh well it’s about adblocking

[23:28:03] <Unixkitty> I'm not sure I will be wearing the armor too often though, can't exactly sneak around in it very well
[23:28:32] <RandomNinja> I gave up sneaking and moved on to bashing everyones face in with a giant hammer
[23:28:58] <Unixkitty> I have no strength and not much endurance
[23:29:00] <RandomNinja> also there's an upgrade that gives you free stealth boy
[23:29:20] <Unixkitty> Upgrade for what?
[23:29:31] <RandomNinja> so you can be a sneaky 200 kg wall of death
[23:29:49] <RandomNinja> power armor
[23:29:52] <RandomNinja> chest, I think

[23:31:16] <snitch567> RandomNinja: dont love me so you can ship him with me
[23:31:29] <Unixkitty> Oh
[23:31:44] <Unixkitty> I forgot armor pieces can be upgraded as well
[23:32:03] <Unixkitty> Although since I don't have any strength, that is beyond me
[23:32:17] <RandomNinja> you need like rank 4 armorer and science
[23:32:18] <Unixkitty> Gun mods instead
[23:32:30] * Unixkitty mods all the guns
[23:32:36] <RandomNinja> or you can find it, no idea if possible
[23:32:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> lelelel south park mentioned microagressions
[23:32:50] <Unixkitty> We'll see I suppose
[23:32:50] <RandomNinja> I do know you can get a jetpack mod from the main quest

[23:39:04] <RandomNinja> don't blame me if you crush a scribe on the ground 
[23:39:09] <Unixkitty> Also Danse is not wearing a helmet for some reason, it looks weird
[23:41:06] <Unixkitty> "Give me a laser rifle and my Power armor, and I'm ready to take on the world."
[23:41:11] <Unixkitty> Haha goodness isn't he adorable

[23:43:37] <Unixkitty> :P
[23:43:45] <RandomNinja> there needs to be a mod for that
[23:43:57] <Unixkitty> You're reading my thoughts
[23:44:09] <RandomNinja> time to edit the BOS power armor texture file :3
[23:44:22] <Unixkitty> Maybe like +2 CHR or something in the actual game
[23:45:59] <Unixkitty> Oh by the way, what does the number under the "CORE" meter mean on power armor hud?
[23:46:05] <RandomNinja> spares
[23:46:37] <Unixkitty> Oh, I thought that was something similar to rate at which it depletes
[23:46:40] <RandomNinja> nope
[23:46:49] <Unixkitty> Then I have 7
[23:46:59] <RandomNinja> also fun fact: Gatling Lasers run on Fusion Cores
[23:47:20] <RandomNinja> this seems expensive, but if you do the math you'll realize it's ridiculously cheap
[23:48:28] <RandomNinja> I recommend you acquire one and murder the wasteland, they're great
[23:51:34] <Unixkitty> If I find one
[23:51:51] <RandomNinja> you can "find" them on various Knights <.<
[23:51:57] <Unixkitty> Also high charisma: "Your crops are belong to us" -"Okay."
[23:52:17] <RandomNinja> also I think there's one you can "borrow" on the Prydwen somewhere, not sure tho
[23:52:27] <Unixkitty> Yes well, I don't "find" them that way RandomNinja 
[23:52:37] <Unixkitty> And if there is, I haven't seen it
