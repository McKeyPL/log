[20:44:31] <miss> thereallynewmop12100: What did i miss of Back to the future day?
[20:44:59] <RandomNinja> I find it very interensting that they're compared to Fidelio X1, which by all accounts is great and about twice as expensive
[20:45:14] <thereallynewmop12100> miss: You have to watch 3 Back to the future movies..
[20:45:28] <FN> Ugh I dislike it when big record labels try to enter the "underground" musical scenes
[20:45:41] <miss> oh thanks thereallynewmop12100 
[20:46:15] <FN> Their attempts are pathetic, and mainly just a regurgitated stuff they already sell, just remixed to fit the certain genre
[20:46:31] <RandomNinja> !t sellout
[20:46:31] <DinkyBot> Artillery_Sounds is a sellout to the LCD
[20:46:32] <miss> how is the early winter thereallynewmop12100 
[20:46:47] <FN> But the thing is: no matter how much remixing you do in justin bieber it is still justin bieber
[20:47:32] <RandomNinja> that's one advantage metal has: it's too scary and aggressive for mainstream
[20:47:44] <RandomNinja> so it's mostly left alone

[20:59:02] <FN> Yes RandomNinja 
[20:59:39] <FN> Worthy headphones, but too expensive from this particular seller
[20:59:52] <RandomNinja> I was thinking more like Amazon
[20:59:59] <RandomNinja> they're ‚Ç¨110 there
[21:00:32] <FN> I wonder why they have dropped in price so much though?
[21:00:41] <FN> They used to be much more expensive
[21:00:53] <RandomNinja> are you looking at the amazon pricing?
[21:01:45] <FN> Nope, the Philips official website prices
[21:02:05] <FN> They kinda dropped in price very steeply
[21:02:37] <RandomNinja> amazon UK offers for ¬£67,50 btw, which is equal to ‚Ç¨94
[21:02:47] <RandomNinja> not sure about shipping but probably like ¬£10

[21:04:53] <RandomNinja> have you considered beyerdynamics?
[21:04:57] <FN> It even has "assembled in Australia" on it
[21:05:07] <RandomNinja> they're probably a lot cheaper in germany than pretty much anywhere else
[21:05:29] <FN> My Sennheisers 650 are almost broken
[21:05:36] <FN> I need some replacement for them
[21:05:46] <RandomNinja> you might want to up your price range then
