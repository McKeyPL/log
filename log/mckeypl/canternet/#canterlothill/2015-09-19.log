[20:52:03] <wobniaR> I assume Lycan's streaming in 320 but it's always a little like that

[21:15:28] <ynoP> So, basically, he ran 13 five minute miles in a row
[21:15:52] <SpectraMusic> I did a half marathon once
[21:16:06] <ynoP> He was this tall super muscular black guy. Had absolutely no body fat. I swear he must be in the Olympics
[21:16:10] <SpectraMusic> I didn't train properly and basically walked the 2nd half of it xD
[21:16:12] <Lycan> I did a 2 hour sit... does that count?

[21:17:02] <Trildar> Sitting is great exercise.
[21:17:18] <ynoP> A couple people passed out, one guy wrecked his knees, some others needed a wheelchair, and one was just crying when she came through the finish
