[03:10:47] <Regulus> I'd dart the Deathclaw, then it would be a reversal!
[03:11:45] <RandomNinja> or a melee build in New Vegas
[03:11:50] * wobniaR shoots RandomNinja's legs with rubber darts
[03:12:14] * RandomNinja flops

[03:15:45] <Regulus> Needs moar non-violent gameplay. 
[03:15:46] <MikeM> Needs more upconversion.
[03:15:55] <RandomNinja> it will also not look like a blurry mess
[03:16:10] <RandomNinja> resolution matters
[03:16:50] * RandomNinja applies boops launcher to Regulus

[03:19:04] * Regulus floofs at RandomNinja 
[03:19:31] <Hamtramck> idk i generally don't notice graphical details in action games at all.
[03:20:11] <Regulus> Personally, I'd rather have good gameplay mechanics and well written narrative

[03:20:38] <Regulus> If either of those is lacking, it ruins it for me.
[03:20:38] <RandomNinja> why not both
[03:20:56] <Regulus> I can deal with bad graphics. 
[03:21:42] <RandomNinja> of course
[03:21:44] <Regulus> If the story sucks, I will bail, hard
[03:22:13] <Hamtramck> I haven't really played too many games with narratives recently
[03:22:16] <Hamtramck> Just, uh, Undertale.
[03:22:23] <RandomNinja> but if the game is the same I'll go for the better graphics version every day of the week
[03:22:27] <Regulus> Unless it's so bad it's comical and the gameplay is fun
[03:22:37] <Regulus> Yeeeeesssssss
[03:22:38] <MikeM> Is Undertale worth it? I'm on the fence.
[03:22:41] * RandomNinja applies Rayman games to Regulus 
[03:22:44] <Hamtramck> I like it a lot

[03:24:09] <BF3_Pony[NLR]> I cant wait for Fallout 4. Take my Money
[03:24:13] <MikeM> That goes without saying. I don't even know who Goat-mom is.
[03:24:38] * Erwin is indiffrent towards FO4
[03:24:43] <RandomNinja> heretic
[03:24:50] <Hamtramck> MikeM: Basically it's a five hour, fairly linearish JRPG thing that has a lot of replayability and mindscrew.
[03:25:00] <Regulus> Yesssss
[03:25:07] <RandomNinja> http://gfycat.com/LargeElderlyAmericansaddlebred
[03:25:11] <Hamtramck> Also it branches/tracks what you do a lot
[03:25:22] <Hamtramck> You can basically either kill everyone or not kill anyone
[03:25:25] <Hamtramck> or somewhere in between
[03:25:27] <Hamtramck> and it follows that
[03:25:41] <RandomNinja> "you can kill anywhere between none and everyone"
[03:25:45] <RandomNinja> seems logical
[03:25:52] <Regulus> Including if you attempt to cheat
[03:26:21] <Hamtramck> Also if you kill someone and reload and don't kill them, which is kind of a spoiler
[03:26:35] <Regulus> Mmmhmmm

[03:28:32] <Regulus> The more you know, the less effective it is
[03:28:33] <Hamtramck> Well I guess 10 dollars isn't cheap in this day and age
[03:28:49] <MikeM> That's a lunch or so
[03:28:51] <Regulus> No, $10 is cheap
[03:28:59] <RandomNinja> not since steam sales
[03:29:22] <Regulus> $60 Triple A games says otherwise 
[03:30:05] <Hamtramck> I'm not really convinced that Steam sales are good for developers in the long run.
[03:30:16] <BF3_Pony[NLR]> gaming is a expensive hobby if you think about :/
[03:30:37] <BF3_Pony[NLR]> also is restoring cars......
[03:30:42] <RandomNinja> yeah I was about to say
[03:30:47] <Hamtramck> Gaming can be expensiver or less expensive depending on what you do
[03:30:53] <Hamtramck> Like, Saturn game collecting? Expensive!
[03:31:01] <RandomNinja> gaming is pretty cheap per hour
[03:31:01] <BF3_Pony[NLR]> so much money
[03:31:06] <RandomNinja> most of the time

[03:37:08] <BF3_Pony[NLR]> why must all good things from Japan be so damn expensive.
[03:37:22] <Regulus> Because we buy them?
[03:37:23] <Hamtramck> 24,000? Is that a lot for a car?
[03:37:28] <MikeM> Blame the EPA and US crash test standards.
[03:37:28] <Regulus> No

[13:26:46] <Flurshy> yes you can
[13:26:52] <Flurshy> why would you eat rice for breakfast
[13:27:01] <RandomNinja> I have steak for breakfast sometimes
[13:28:27] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> Rice with a slice of cheese and some shreaded turkey, topped off with some sweet and sour sauce
[13:28:41] <Flurshy> that sounds very not breakfast
[13:28:49] <Flurshy> where are the eggs
[13:29:02] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> Flurshy i would if i had any :P
[13:29:04] <RandomNinja> also I just tried root beer
[13:29:13] <RandomNinja> please explain how this is popular
[13:29:25] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> nostalgia i think
[13:29:30] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> root beer is nasty
[13:29:44] <Flurshy> it's softer than most other soda
[13:30:35] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> ahh, actually thats right
[13:30:53] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> it does have a bitter taste, but the carbonation doesnt feel as strong
[13:32:09] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> unlike Coke or Pepsi where as you try to drink it fast and you end of belching it right back up lol
[13:32:33] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> *...end up...*

[13:34:52] * Copper-Cap|breakfast points to himself "Teaholic"
[13:34:57] <RandomNinja> too sweet
[13:35:05] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> ^
[13:35:09] <RandomNinja> which is odd since I love sweet beer
[13:35:19] <RandomNinja> might be a balance thing
[13:36:07] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> well there's no sugar added in beer is there?
[13:36:20] <RandomNinja> the alcohol comes from sugar
[13:36:34] <RandomNinja> depending on technique there can be quite a lot left
[13:36:52] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> so it's not just hopps?
[13:36:58] <RandomNinja> no
[13:38:14] <RandomNinja> if you compare to cooking, malt(fermentable and unfermentable sugars, starches) is the base ingredients. Hops is spices
[13:39:41] <Copper-Cap|breakfast> and yeast to right?
[13:40:08] <RandomNinja> extremely dry beer has 5-10% sugar left, your average british ale might have 15-25%, a Sweet Stout can be as much as 30%
[13:40:25] <RandomNinja> yeah yeast affects flavor to varying degree
[13:40:34] *** Copper-Cap|breakfast is now known as Copper-Cap
[13:42:02] <Copper-Cap> dang...i didn't know that beer contained that much
[13:43:28] <RandomNinja> different yeast strains ferment different percentages, so sweetness, and they also create trace amounts of chemicals that affect the flavor to varying degrees, the most obvious ones being the spicy fruitiness of belgian abbey styles
[13:43:43] <RandomNinja> also, sour beers, but those don't play in the same ruleset

[18:47:18] <Jokerboxer> May I say something about the CMC's cutie marks in relation to today's episode?
[18:47:38] <thereallynewmop12100> Jokerboxer: After LDB.
[18:49:02] <thereallynewmop12100> We can talk about the episode at 4pm EDT/3pm CST
[18:49:33] <Jokerboxer> It's not a spoiler to say that: "It is indeed permanent."

[18:50:45] <MikeM> I think the size issue is also because they got the same marks, too. 
[18:51:05] <One-Trick> i am hoping my equipment plays nice today
[18:51:09] <thereallynewmop12100> The CMC are growing up!

[18:55:59] <Jokerboxer> What do you mean, MikeM? 
[18:56:46] <MikeM> Their cutie marks are a little smaller than others. But added together, they are normal size. Compare Apple Bloom's to Applejack's.
[18:57:00] <MikeM> I could be wrong, though.
[18:57:42] <Jokerboxer> Interesting thought. It is as if the more they exercise their magic the sooner they can grow. 
[18:58:02] <One-Trick> they have cutiemarks now?
[18:58:16] * Jokerboxer boops One-Trick.
[18:58:23] <One-Trick> i havent watched ponies in forever

[21:45:40] <Lrond> Im out of energyDrinks
[21:45:47] <Lycan> You mean, you want to stay up for the next six hours??
[21:45:53] <Lrond> At least
[21:45:58] <Lycan> Apples
[21:46:05] <Lycan> The natural sugars keep you awake
[21:46:11] <Lunatic> The booty always wakes me up
[21:46:21] <Lycan> Also, if you drink lots of water, your bladder will keep you awake
[21:46:24] <Lrond> Im going somewhrer with friends...i dont want them to see me tired, because they could think i am bored
[21:46:40] <MikeM> Take a quick nap, then you'll be refreshed
[21:46:42] <Lycan> have a nap?
[21:46:51] <Lrond> like 1/2 h long?
[21:46:59] <Lycan> yup

[22:07:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> i think i'm getting back into eadmau5 :3
[22:07:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> deadmau5*
[22:07:31] <Fantasma> Here's all I'll say about it then.
[22:07:34] <Fantasma> I totally called it.
[22:08:43] <MikeM> So, do we see the baby this season or the next?
[22:08:58] <wobniaR> Next if anything
[22:09:07] <MikeM> That's what I was thinking.
[22:10:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> check this out https://youtu.be/Sg_Kt39n4ug?t=3m14s
[22:10:43] <DinkyBot>  [ Deadmau5 Cthulhu Sleeps (Live from Brixton) - YouTube ]
[22:10:48] <Fantasma> I called it 100%.
[22:11:06] <wobniaR> Considering they've been marketing Skyla for 3 years now 
[22:11:34] <Hamtramck> Watch that be some huge misdirection and it's reincarnated Sombra.
[22:11:44] <Fantasma> I wish.
[22:12:08] <Fantasma> Don't you remember/
[22:12:13] <MikeM> I don't think they can do that to children in Y7 shows.
[22:12:23] <Hamtramck> Reincarnation?
[22:12:31] <Fantasma> "You know how they did the royal wedding as sort of a hats off to prince william and kate? Well they just had a baby so..."
[22:12:37] <MikeM> Reincarnation of a villain
[22:13:18] <Fantasma> That's what I said.
[22:14:21] <Fantasma> I'm not going to lie to you though I was really dissapointed by the last episode.
[22:14:21] <Hamtramck> Reincarnation of the Villain is my favorite Phish album
[22:14:41] <Fantasma> the something something crusaders for the mark something.
[22:14:42] <Fantasma> What a story mark.
[22:15:31] <thereallynewmop12100> This week's Doctor Who is epic!!!
[22:15:54] <Fantasma> Come on man.
[22:16:12] <Fantasma> The only cutie mark they would have had a bit of difficulty with was appleblooms.  The other two were obvious.
[22:16:55] <Fantasma> Come on hasbro.

[22:17:25] <MikeM> So you don't like their cutie marks?
[22:17:37] <Fantasma> They don't make any sense.
[22:17:43] *** Quits: FritzyBeat (wchlmhknqqe@Pony-27mb1b.bchsia.telus.net) (Connection closed)
[22:18:36] <Fantasma> They're like the only three ponies in Equestria who's names don't match their cutie marks.
[22:18:44] <MikeM> The crusader shield and individual element?
[22:21:14] <Fantasma> They're also ugly, and clash with their colors.
[22:21:36] <johnsey> they're the cutie mark crusaders, so the name matches well enough 
[22:21:55] <Fantasma> No they're sweetie bell, scootaloo, and applebloom.
[22:23:28] <MikeM> I think they do match.

[22:24:05] <johnsey> Fantasma: what about Firefly? two lightning bolts?
[22:24:35] <Fantasma> Also I was mad that they got rid of the ultimate villian.
[22:25:19] <Hamtramck> Their cutie marks are very unusual and I wouldn't say I find them visually appearling, but I appreciate them more for how weird/non-obvious they are?
[22:25:27] <Fantasma> I guess...
[22:25:30] <johnsey> also, pinkie pie has balloons which does not relate to the name either but to what she likes
[22:25:42] <Fantasma> It's so wierd.
[22:26:13] <johnsey> if you keep looking, you'll see that cutie marks belong more to a pony's behavior/job/attitude than the necessarily the name
[22:26:37] <Lycan> aaaand... we are back from watching the episode
[22:26:39] <Lycan> WOW!
[22:26:46] <Fantasma> But what's with all the shield?

[22:26:52] <johnsey> crusaders!
[22:26:53] <Fantasma> That just doesn't fit in.
[22:27:04] <Fantasma> Like, that implies that they have two special talents.
[22:27:06] <Fantasma> That's not fair.

[22:27:51] <Lycan> The shield, the apple/wing/star and the heart/lightning bolt/music note
[22:27:54] <johnsey> plus, the crusaders' marks DO have something to do with the pony
[22:27:58] <johnsey> yes, what Lycan said
[22:28:16] <Hamtramck> What if the CMC are a tripartite alicorn :V
[22:28:22] <Fantasma> Yeah but that would imply that they have a special talent of Apple/wing/star, and crusading.
[22:28:28] <Lycan> aaaaaand fusion!
