[08:31:53] <RandomNinja_> Why not free client?
[08:31:59] <Trildar> Malaysian currency is so bad
[08:32:14] <Eywind> ah true
[08:32:23] <RandomNinja_> Also Eywind you underestimate how far people are willing to go to avoid paying money in general

[08:32:40] <Eywind> Some people just don't value their time as anything apparently
[08:33:01] <Eywind> I usually value my rec time at like $10-20 an hour if I'm doing something I really have no pleasure from
[08:33:09] <RandomNinja_> Some people have more time than money
[08:33:28] <Eywind> then they should use that time to obtain more money

[22:46:13] <Eywind> so I'd encourage them to actually use their votes properly
[22:46:13] <RandomNinja> Eywind there should be laws against this kind of abuse though
[22:46:17] <thereallynewmop12100> sunsetwubs:  on every radio station in Canada?
[22:46:21] * RandomNinja votes himself
[22:46:32] <Eywind> thereallynewmop12100 the catch is that it'll be on TV
[22:46:33] <One-Trick> a minimalist dnb track i made using my ipad was flagged as a taylor swift song, then i lost faith in humanity
[22:46:34] <sunsetwubs> thereallynewmop12100: yes and uk :D
[22:46:37] <Eywind> and it'll be on the day the Big Brother finale is on
[22:46:46] <RandomNinja> can't miss that
[22:46:47] <Eywind> so you'll miss it because of sunsetwubs
[22:46:56] <Eywind> One-Trick hah
[22:47:11] * thereallynewmop12100 checks the TV Guide..

[23:03:25] <RandomNinja> Eywind, drink beer instead
[23:03:27] <Zuthal> and One-Trick, a greek question mark looks the same as a semicolon
[23:03:31] <Zuthal> #DankeMerkel
[23:03:35] <Eywind> that's not a suitable replacement
[23:03:36] <Arkomeda> Yeap

[23:04:31] <Zuthal> doing to that to ONE semicolon in someone's code
[23:04:51] <Zuthal> or even better, making it so that every time they want to type a semicolon they type a greek question mark instead
[23:05:06] <Zuthal> And then watch them go insane as they just cannot figure out why their code won't work
