[03:08:29] <BerryPunch> Listening to Gloryhammer makes me wanna write stories again.
[03:08:41] <BerryPunch> Good usually doesn't come out of my writing. But I like to think it's good.
[03:08:57] <MikeM> Making yourself happy is the first step. 
[03:09:12] <MikeM> And then read it again, and see all the errors.
[03:09:26] <BerryPunch> Oh I meant the content of the stories. I have a habit of writing absurdist literature.
[03:10:30] <BerryPunch> My second drafts tend to not have all that many errors. First drafts are full of so many cause I like to overwrite.

[03:16:16] <BerryPunch> Idk ... I don't see Equestria as a utopian escape.
[03:16:19] <MikeM> Some people would have read it and liked it.
[03:16:19] <RandomNinja> Yus
[03:16:56] <RandomNinja> HiE is pretty much auto failure
[03:17:12] <RandomNinja> Too much stigma
[03:17:23] <BerryPunch> Yeah. It would'v ehad to come out back when I started writing it in March 2011
[03:17:32] <BerryPunch> to even stand a chance of people reading it
[03:18:01] <RandomNinja> My Little Dashie is pretty much best case scenario
[03:18:10] <BerryPunch> I don't like stories like that.
[03:18:20] <RandomNinja> I don't like it, for the record
[03:18:37] <RandomNinja> FoE 4 lyfe
