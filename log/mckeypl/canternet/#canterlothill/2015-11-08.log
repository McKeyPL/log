[02:23:41] <Regulus> I studied the crafting video a bit more
[02:24:47] <Regulus> Turns out you can build a low recoil, high ammo count sniper that doesn't suffer an accuracy penalty from firing it... so basically as fast as you can fire...

[02:50:28] <RandomNinja> you'll probably want to max out either Intelligence or Idiot Savant
[02:50:49] <Regulus> Intelligence 
[02:51:18] <RandomNinja> yeah
[02:51:45] <RandomNinja> I wonder if there's a statistical sweet spot for Idiot Savant
[02:51:54] <Regulus> Probably 
[02:52:14] *** Joins: Invert_Shade (uid63062@Pony-jogq8d.ealing.irccloud.com)
[02:52:39] <RandomNinja> or if 10 Int is the best
[02:52:50] <Regulus> Everything has a statistical sweet spot
[02:53:05] <Regulus> Higher intelligence usually means more XP, ya?
[02:53:16] <Sombra> So, it's safe to say that this episode was written months ago.
[02:53:18] <Sombra> Right?
[02:53:36] <RandomNinja> but Idiot Savant randomly triggers more XP, with the chance inversely proportional to intelligence

[02:54:15] * DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around DinkyBot in a tight embrace
[02:54:16] <Regulus> Indeed, but as long as it's non-zero at 10 Intelligence, it's got a sweet spot

[02:57:45] <Regulus> Nah
[02:58:11] <Regulus> Recoil absorbing stock is most useful.

[02:59:17] <Sombra> That was a bit surprising.
[03:01:08] * RandomNinja applies somehow hand-holdable minigun to Sombra 
[03:01:18] <Sombra> Thank you.
[03:01:41] <RandomNinja> they make airsoft miniguns
[03:02:19] <RandomNinja> they weigh like 15 kg and are probably entirely useless, but I want one
[03:03:17] <Sombra> I dunno, depends on how much they cost.
[03:03:22] <Sombra> I need to build an AR again
[03:03:24] <RandomNinja> about 5K
[03:03:45] <Sombra> Yeah I could just buy a 1911, another AK, a really nice AR and 3000 rounds of ammo

[03:05:57] <RandomNinja> oh you mean actual guns
[03:05:59] <RandomNinja> I meant airsoft
[03:06:06] <Sombra> I find actual ones to be more useful.
[03:06:21] <RandomNinja> yeah but you can't legally shoot people with them
[03:06:53] <Regulus> Tru dat
[03:07:17] <Sombra> I don't think you can legally shoot people with airsoft either.  You just won't get the same criminal charges if you do
[03:07:26] <RandomNinja> sure you can, in the right place
[03:07:31] <Regulus> lol
[03:07:59] <CrassyPaddles> Spike was on point this episode

[03:12:12] <Flurshy> oh yeah, so this was fun yesterday. playing halo with my little cousin, 1v1 simple shoot and kill. I get on a turret and start shooting him from range, he hops in a vehicle and hurries up
[03:12:20] * RandomNinja applies days of mindnumbing questing to Flurshy 
[03:12:23] <Flurshy> when he gets behind me I pull off the turret and finish him
[03:12:51] <Regulus> RandomNinja, I want to create a shotgun in Fallout with a stupidly bad range and a crazy high fire rate
[03:12:57] <Flurshy> was fun, although he threw a fit because he's young and still needs to learn how to handle losing

[07:22:32] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> BlackSentinel I wiped my HD
[07:22:42] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> that sounds more like a board game
[07:22:45] <Faith> also, Windy, there was an option to add 1000 more rows to the spreadsheet. I couldn't NOT do it.
[07:23:06] <Faith> so looks like we've gotta do 1356 libs
[07:23:14] <Eywind|Mad-Libbing> ...
[07:23:25] <LadyAubernon> at that rate, Michelle will be back

[23:48:04] <wobniaR> $140 isn't bad depending on the quality
[23:48:18] <wobniaR> $200 if you want non-synthetic leather

[23:48:28] <RandomNinja> true, that's usually like twice my price range for jackets though
[23:48:35] <RandomNinja> but leather is expensive
[23:48:44] <wobniaR> If you want to rule, I suppose you must pay the price
[23:48:59] <RandomNinja> 200 bottle caps is reasonable
