[19:43:10] <miss> I read the novel of the movie ^ RandomNinja 
[19:43:49] <RandomNinja> any good?
[19:46:05] <miss> It was different than all the books i read before. It's the letters that you read of the main character, who writes down all the things that happen in his teen life. It's a mix of sociology, psychology, friendship, drugs abuse,...  I found it interesting to read. RandomNinja 
[19:46:47] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t miss
[19:46:49] <DinkyBot> Wait did I just miss it due to those 8hrs/12 hrs/16hrs
[19:47:53] <miss> !t Jon-The_Bronynerd 
[19:47:55] <DinkyBot> Jon-The_Bronynerd watch out or we will all die
[19:48:06] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> o_o
[19:49:28] <wobniaR> Only book reading i do these days is warhammer 40k
[19:49:41] <wobniaR> And there is nothing but heresy, death and more death
[19:50:00] <miss> wobniaR, is that a comic book?
[19:50:18] <miss> wobniaR, too bloody for me.
[19:50:24] <wobniaR> They're novels miss
[19:50:31] <miss> ah
[19:50:46] <RandomNinja> wobniaR, you forgot heresy
[19:50:57] <wobniaR> Yes and heresy
[19:51:05] <RandomNinja> also heretics
[19:51:20] <wobniaR> Heretics are implied when there's heresy
[19:51:35] <RandomNinja> implicit heresy, the worst kind
[19:51:46] <wobniaR> But yeah it's a really violent and dark universe with almost no hope of redemption
[19:52:04] <wobniaR> Most are either corrupt, heretics or dead
[19:52:36] <RandomNinja> the Ciaphas Cain stories is fairly lighthearted though
