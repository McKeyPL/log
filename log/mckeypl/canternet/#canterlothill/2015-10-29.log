[17:35:24] <Zuthal> how old is your campus?
[17:35:28] <RandomNinja> but yeah, a huge population of very vigorous yeast of a super-high alcohol tolerant yeast, tons of extra nutrients (mainly nitrogen), tons of oxygen and staggered sugar additions

[17:36:37] <Trildar> Zuthal: What do you mean by that? :P I mean, they've been around for decades, but that doesn't really mean anything.
[17:36:42] <RandomNinja> start with this, then provide ideal circumstances
[17:36:54] <Trildar> They're just cheap/lazy to actually give the computers more RAM.
[17:37:20] <Zuthal> Hmm, interesting
[17:37:25] <RandomNinja> they actually send the instructions to a room full of guys with whiteboards and abacuses
[17:38:14] <RandomNinja> Zuthal, you probably want to use this as a secondary strain though, as they throw a lot of esters
[17:38:24] <Zuthal> ahhh
[17:38:47] <RandomNinja> start with a normal yeast to maybe 12-14%, then add more sugars and this strain
[17:39:22] <RandomNinja> I think somewhere around or slightly above 30% is the most you can realistically get
[17:39:39] <RandomNinja> at least with current strains, because eventually everything just dies from alcohol poisoning

[17:45:51] <RandomNinja> moral panic strikes again
[17:46:17] <RandomNinja> a party's alcohol licence was revoked, because a lot of the patrons drank a lot of water and weren't wearing shirts

[17:46:53] <RandomNinja> hue
[17:47:20] <RandomNinja> there's a 50% chance of that meaning iMacs
[17:47:51] <Trildar> Sadly not even that. :P
[17:48:06] <Trildar> I'm pretty sure they have Macs somewhere, but I don't think I've seen any.
[17:49:46] <RandomNinja> yeah I just went with iMacs because that's a lot of money for little performance
[17:52:29] <Trildar> To be honest I can't actually remember if the computer I hanged had 8 or 4 GB of RAM.
[17:52:52] <RandomNinja> I have 16 gb ram at home that I never use :P

[23:02:38] <Eywind> you know the irish would have loved to have potatoes three days in a row
[23:02:47] <comicpony44> that kool
[23:03:02] <Eywind> but instead they died
[23:03:16] <MikeM> The end
[23:03:45] <Snap_Shot> Well i made this recipe last night called Tex Mex. basically cut up potatoes with taco seasoning and a ranch dressing seasoning
[23:03:55] <Snap_Shot> added in some shredded chicken breast
[23:04:04] <Snap_Shot> was alot better than i thought it would be
[23:04:06] <Eywind> One can only wonder what this "tex mex" actually originates from
[23:04:47] <Snap_Shot> now im making loaded potatoes in the crockpot for tonight. had it on a slow cook all day. been so tempting to eat some

[23:07:15] <RandomNinja> I recommend using only the chili fruit without seeds and pouring a stout into the boil
[23:07:59] <RandomNinja> the roasty malt character balances the spices amazingly
[23:08:26] <Snap_Shot> meh ill make it work with stuff we have in the apartment
