[21:20:10] <miss> thereallynewmop12100, :)
[21:20:25] <Cloud_Zephyr> EM-C will this movie have humans or horses?
[21:20:44] <EM-C> It's the third Equestria Girls.  The one with the very geeky Twilight.
[21:20:55] <Cloud_Zephyr> lul
[21:21:26] <EM-C> There is no crueler breaker of hearts and tormentor of souls than a really nerdy looking beautiful girl with glasses.

[21:22:21] <EM-C> Actually though, I'm here mostly right now cause I'm depressed and need a little company.
[21:22:24] <EM-C> Money worries.
[21:22:48] * thereallynewmop12100 waves to miss 
[21:22:51] <EM-C> And a few other things.
[21:23:24] <EM-C> thereallynewmop12100: thank you for your help the other night.  And sorry for falling to pieces.
[21:23:27] <EM-C> Like I always do.
[21:23:41] <miss> waves bach to thereallynewmop12100 
[21:24:10] <EM-C> I can't wait for the Nerd Twi fan fics.
[21:25:04] <EM-C> BTW, after being on fimfiction for a couple years now, I've finally started availing myself of the favoriting and tracking options.
[21:25:31] <EM-C> It's made keeping up with stuff that I'm following so much easier.  I don't know why I had such an aversion to using it up till now.  I just did.
[21:27:40] <RandomNinja> EM-C: kinda looking forward to Horse Humans 3 actually
[21:27:47] <RandomNinja> Because SCIENCE
[21:27:58] <EM-C> Actually, me too.  Because beautiful girl with glasses.
[21:28:10] <RandomNinja> Also nerdery
[21:28:48] <EM-C> Don't let the "nerdery" fool you.  She's still a beautiful girl.  She isn't as awkward or approachable as she seems.
[21:29:19] <EM-C> She's like a venus fly trap.  Entice some poor shlub who thinks you're harmless...then KILL!!!!!
[21:30:12] <EM-C> I think Spectacled Twilight is going to replace Yolei in my mind's gallery of beautiful girls with glasses.
[21:31:07] <EM-C> ::Sigh::  I thought we had one more year on our termite inspection contract.  Turns out we don't.  We're going to have to pay $500 for another then years worth of inspections.
[21:31:27] <EM-C> The first contract was paid by the realtor who sold us the house, so this is our first time.
[21:31:35] <RandomNinja> Termites?
[21:31:37] <EM-C> It was for five years.
[21:31:52] <EM-C> Termite **inspection**.
[21:32:10] <EM-C> When you're getting a subsidized mortgage, you have to have termite inspections.
[21:32:20] <RandomNinja> Solve your problem with termites using thermite!
[21:32:39] <EM-C> Yeah, I read a fic this morning or yesterday that mentioned a "termite bomb."
[21:32:50] *** Cloud_Zephyr is now known as Cloud_Zephyr|Away
[21:33:07] <EM-C> I don't think you understand.  We don't have termites.  But we are required to have regular inspections if we don't want to lose the subsidy to our mortgage.
[21:33:41] <EM-C> We've just been paying $95 a year for each inspection.  Now we have to have a new contract, and it's going to be $500 for the next ten years.
[21:34:17] <EM-C> I'm glad it lasts so long, but...you know.  If you've ever once been really, really poor (like I grew up) a little something like that comes along when you aren't expecting it and it's kinda scary.
[21:34:40] <EM-C> And the minute I informed my mother this morning (after talking with the termite guy on the phone)...
[21:34:59] <EM-C> ...She informed me today's the day she's going with my sister to the funeral home to pre-pay her funeral.
[21:35:09] <RandomNinja> Yeah it's a big scary upfront payment
[21:35:09] <LunaticHell> Wow, wall of text.
[21:35:21] <RandomNinja> LunaticHell pls
[21:35:26] <EM-C> Now that's an excellent idea.  But that coming at the same time as the new termite contract?  I'm...I'm really unsettled right now.
[21:35:51] <LunaticHell> RandomNinja: :3
[21:36:21] <EM-C> I grew up in rural poverty.  After finally knowing what it's like to live like a middle class person and to actually have a little money in the bank...this is scary.
[21:36:24] <thereallynewmop12100> I am back
[21:36:48] <RandomNinja> Nuu
[21:37:00] <EM-C> Once you've been really poor, you kind of emotionally depend on that little shock absorber in the bank.
[21:37:47] <EM-C> I mean, the prime reason for having the money in the first place is to pay for her funeral, so that does take care of that.  But emotionally...well...
[21:38:03] <EM-C> I don't even know if I should be saying all this here.  But I can't help but be uncomfortable.
[21:38:21] <EM-C> She's had a savings account for years now.  When she gets back it'll be GONE.
[21:38:46] <EM-C> Then on top of that the new termite contract, which I wasn't expecting until NEXT year.
[21:39:10] <EM-C> And I'm on SSI, so I simply can't help with big expenses like this.  Shoot, I don't have $2000 to my name.
[21:39:26] <EM-C> So I'm really...feeling vulnerable right now.
[21:39:31] <EM-C> And scared.
[21:39:44] <EM-C> And selfish for feeling that way.
[21:40:00] <EM-C> And for using you good folks to get it all out of my system.
[21:41:28] <LunaticHell> https://derpiboo.ru/944015 this makes me wish I work out more, for some reason. o3o

[21:43:40] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Your welcome.
[21:44:32] <EM-C> I think now that it wasn't YT but the most recent Firefox update that got rid of the flash player and screwed everything up.
[21:44:51] <EM-C> I just wish whoever it was would leave well-enough alone.
[21:44:55] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Nuuuuuuu!! 
[21:46:00] <EM-C> Yeah, I'd had a Firefox update just before all this started.  Suddenly YT looks completely different and won't play anymore.
[21:46:37] <EM-C> I've discovered another great fic by MythrilMoth, btw.  That dude can write.  He has over seventy fics up and works on all of them.
