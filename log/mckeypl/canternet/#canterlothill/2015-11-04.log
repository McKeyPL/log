[02:10:27] <EM-C> Anyway, sorry again.  I'll get off my soapbox.  I just wish people would stop portraying "Flutterbat" as some horrifying creature with terrible powers.
[02:10:39] <Eywind> She's a cartoon character
[02:11:21] <wobniaR> I see most people portraying her another way
[02:11:23] <EM-C> I'll say this again: within the context of the episode, Fluttershy received some characteristics of the "vampire fruit bats.'  Within the show "vampire fruit bats" are animals...not supernatural monsters.
[02:11:26] <Eywind> people have different portrayals of different things, especially when they want to tell a different story
[02:11:52] <Eywind> But in Scare Master everyone was afraid of Flutterbat to begin with
[02:11:57] <EM-C> You don't seem to be seeing my point.  If people want to make Fluttershy's "stare" into something sinister, fine.
[02:12:01] <wobniaR> She did an evil laugh and hissed
[02:12:13] <wobniaR> She also tore Spike's 2nd head off
[02:12:19] <wobniaR> I'd be scared too
[02:12:23] <EM-C> But to say that being given the characteristics of actual bats gave her hypnotic powers is very hurtful.
[02:13:10] <Regulus> OI! Fanart is a person's interpretation. You're entitled to your interpretation, they're entitled to theirs.
[02:13:20] <Eywind> When did she get hypnotic powers?
[02:13:29] <Hamtramck> Like season 1
[02:13:31] <wobniaR> But people have opinions I don't like Regulus, they're WRONG and I MUST CORRECT THEM
[02:13:32] <Hamtramck> she used them on dargons
[02:13:40] <EM-C> You're still not getting my point.  I'm not complaining per se about how people interpret Fluttershy.
[02:14:07] <EM-C> I'm complaining about people's assumptions that for Flutters to acquire bat characteristics she must become some evil magical being.
[02:14:33] <Eywind> Your point is that people need to be in-world-accurate in a world that has magical talking flying ponies and chimeric gods of chaoses having tea every Tuesday
[02:14:41] <EM-C> I'm not complaining about "the stare."  Doesn't anyone understand?
[02:14:44] <Regulus> And it's their RIGHT to make that assumption
[02:14:45] <Eywind> Let people believe what they want to believe.
[02:14:52] <wobniaR> Don't forget the cucumber sandwiches Eywind
[02:14:56] <Eywind> XD
[02:15:14] <EM-C> I can't stop them.  But this merely illustrates that many otherwise sane people believe that actual bats are supernatural.
[02:15:24] <EM-C> And evil.
[02:15:28] <EM-C> The end.
[02:15:35] <Eywind> People watch Fox News

[12:32:02] <RandomNinja> that didn't last long :3
