[21:48:08] <LongPlay> Ok then Dinky. You do that.
[21:55:52] <RandomNinja> halp there is snowing falling on me
[21:57:36] <LongPlay> Lucky pony
[21:57:47] <LongPlay> We got one snowfall
[22:00:52] <wobniaR> There was a tiny bit of snow here today, barely a flurry
[22:01:09] <wobniaR> It stopped pretty quick but everyone on the streets were like :o snow
[22:01:28] <wobniaR> Cause it's been 50-60 degrees for most of this winter
[22:02:09] <RandomNinja> and everyone was happy for 15 minutes until they realized what a pain snow is to deal with when you have things to do
[22:03:01] <wobniaR> True, last winter it was pretty bad and the snow usually gets packed on street corners and turns into blocks of ice
[22:03:10] <wobniaR> Which can take months to melt due to the temperature
[22:04:00] <wobniaR> It's not bad here compared to other places, where you actually have to shovel your way out of a house
[22:04:21] <RandomNinja> yeah that didn't happen this year fortunately
[22:04:30] <RandomNinja> 2 winters ago we had almost as bad
[22:07:51] <thereallynewmop12100> !t LongPlay

[23:51:41] <RandomNinja> probably because it was offensive to some soccer mom
