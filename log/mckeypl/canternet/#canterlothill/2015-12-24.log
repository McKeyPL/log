[23:23:24] <EM-C> Well, it uses Latin letters; just in strange combinations.
[23:23:37] <EM-C> It's phonetic according to its own rules.  Just not English rules.
[23:23:46] <EM-C> Even Irish is phonetic according to its own rules.

[23:24:48] <Inucroft[NLR]> English yes, Gaelic is Celtic sphere

[23:25:23] <Inucroft[NLR]> Correct.
[23:25:44] <EM-C> Languages are one of my things.  Too bad I don't have a talent for learning them.

[23:25:57] * thereallynewmop12100 gives RandomNinja a gift box and hides in it 
[23:26:09] <EM-C> Well, they're Brythonic Celtic; Manx and Gaelic are Goidelic Celtic.
[23:26:29] <thereallynewmop12100> RandomNinja: Open it up. It's for you
[23:26:51] <Inucroft[NLR]> EM-C Bretonic is simply Welsh folk that fled across to Frankia after the Anglo-Saxon invasion.
[23:26:55] <EM-C> Welsh, Cornish, and Breton are descended from the old Celtic language of pre-Anglo-Saxon Britain.
[23:27:04] <EM-C> I know.
[23:27:16] <Inucroft[NLR]> Gaelic can apply to Welsh awell... or Irish.

[23:27:27] * thereallynewmop12100 opens the gift up and boops RandomNinja 
[23:27:42] <Inucroft[NLR]> EM-C go on, how long?
[23:27:43] <EM-C> No, Gaelic is a specific language.  Welsh is not Gaelic; both Welsh and Gaelic are Celtic languages.
[23:28:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> Gaelic really isn't, however in modern termonology it is.
[23:28:10] <EM-C> Well, I used to check out linguistic books from the high school library back in the early 70s.

[23:29:43] <thereallynewmop12100> Inucroft[NLR]: Cymreg? What's that? 
[23:29:56] <EM-C> Cymraeg is the Welsh word for Welsh.
[23:30:01] <Inucroft[NLR]> Mind... Welsh is devided into; North Welsh (gog), South Welsh (taff), Cornish & Bretonic
