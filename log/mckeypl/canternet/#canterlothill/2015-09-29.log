[20:37:43] <Spectra_Borealis> I know. but I am still really stupid. math, spanish, english, poni, anything.
[20:37:55] <RandomNinja> number bases are pretty simple tho
[20:38:27] <Spectra_Borealis> I know. but to a stupid person, the most simple things are complex.
[20:38:29] <RandomNinja> for a base α, the n:th number from the right is equal to α^(n-1)
[20:38:43] <miss> RandomNinja, did i really hunted JockeTF away, or was he quite a bit longer offline?
[20:38:50] <RandomNinja> compare base 10, which you are used to
[20:39:10] <Spectra_Borealis> NO! No more math. I am done. any more math today, I'm going to explode.
[20:39:32] <RandomNinja> 123 is 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0
