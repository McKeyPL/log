[23:30:15] <RandomNinja> darn
[23:30:23] <RandomNinja> that is solid logic
[23:30:59] <Inucroft[NLR]> XD
[23:33:00] <Regulus> My logic in regards to foxes and fox related matters is always solid.

[23:42:38] <Hamtramck> Brett Cider was my favorite 90s method actor
[23:42:46] <Hamtramck> His cameo on Baywatch was memorable.
[23:43:00] <MikeM> And don't forget his scene in American Ninja
[23:43:06] <RandomNinja> Regulus, brett doesn't work in most things
[23:43:16] <RandomNinja> in a few things it's magical though
