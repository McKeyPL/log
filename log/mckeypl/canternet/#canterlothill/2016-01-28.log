[06:03:34] <Jokerboxer> Why Saturday?
[06:03:46] <Cocoaway> That's when I go home
[06:04:31] <Jokerboxer> Ah.
[06:04:38] <Jokerboxer> That is good to hear.
[06:05:00] <Cocoaway> Surreal_Nightmares androirc doesn't use up much battery power, AndChat seems to drain it a bit faster though, from my experience.
[06:05:06] <Jokerboxer> I've not heard from that Blu fellow since he rolled his stats.
[06:05:11] <Cocoaway> Yep I'm so ready to go home
[06:05:29] <Cocoaway> Ahh, I thought I saw him on yesterday
[06:05:35] <Surreal_Nightmares> I'm using AndChat.
[06:05:55] <Jokerboxer> What is his name. I want to send a memo.
[06:06:00] <Cocoaway> Oh then yeah, it will drain a decent amount of power

[06:06:49] <Cocoaway> Np
[06:07:54] <Surreal_Nightmares> Oh thanks. I'll switch apps when I'm done with work.
[06:07:57] <Cocoaway> Also Surreal_Nightmares AndChat won't be getting anymore updates, and hasn't been updated in a long time, just so you know. I do prefer the look of it though
[06:08:07] <Cocoaway> K :p
