[01:40:41] <DrelvanianGuard> well I haven't actually shown much on my twitter, aside from following Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, and InfoWars, and by openly talking about God, and by making a well thoughtout remark about the Boston Riots

[01:46:12] <Eywind> Hamtramck such a rebel
[01:46:15] <DrelvanianGuard> Hamtramck, are you listening to some grunge and smoking dope?
[01:46:32] <Eywind> DrelvanianGuard I certainly didn't say the latter
[01:46:41] <Eywind> I most certainly said the former
[01:47:31] <DrelvanianGuard> I think I remember someone did tell me to die.. unless I misunderstood something someone said and took it as a deaththreat...

[01:47:35] <DinkyBot>  [ Wondermark  » Archive   » #1062; The Terrible Sea Lion ]
[01:47:43] <Eywind> You are misunderstanding
[01:48:46] <DrelvanianGuard> XD
[01:48:46] <MikeM> Sea lion did that to me once. Followed me for two weeks, until I bought it a bucket of fish.
[01:48:57] <DrelvanianGuard> XD
[01:49:47] <DrelvanianGuard> See.. thats how its done.. Message to all Liberals/atheists.. if you dont want to make conversation, just buy me pizza... or a bucket of fish (so long as its Catfish or Salmon)
[01:50:02] <DrelvanianGuard> >_>
[01:50:06] <MikeM> You know, we usually don't talk about politics or religion in here.
[01:50:14] <MikeM> And that's pretty nice.
[01:50:27] <DrelvanianGuard> I've noticed.
[01:50:36] <DrelvanianGuard> I almost got kicked from here during the boston riots.
[01:50:37] <Hamtramck> You can talk about canadian politics, though. They don't matter.
[01:50:38] <Hamtramck> Zing!
[01:50:42] <DrelvanianGuard> XD
[01:50:55] <Winter_Nights> Oh snap!
[01:51:00] <DrelvanianGuard> can we also talk about the amish? its not like they'll ever know we had the conversation..
[01:51:07] <Eywind> Straight up you're the person who I've interacted with that I dislike the most out of this entire fandom
[01:51:10] <Snap_Shot> Yes?
[01:51:13] <Winter_Nights> ... Dude. Harsh.
[01:51:18] <Eywind> and I have no qualms with getting rid of you forever from here
[01:51:21] <Eywind> so don't give me a reason to
[01:51:54] <Winter_Nights> Silly Snap_Shot :P Just saying snap. Wait, does that ping you or something?
[01:52:00] <Snap_Shot> Yes
[01:52:12] <DrelvanianGuard> XD
[01:52:12] * Winter_Nights ponders this. Interesting...
[01:52:18] <Snap_Shot> I have Snap set as a ping along with Hennet plus all of my mod pings
[01:52:33] <Winter_Nights> Huh. Ok then.
[01:52:40] <DrelvanianGuard> I love to snap my fingers sometimes..
[01:52:47] <Winter_Nights> If I may, how do you set multiple pings?
[01:52:51] <DrelvanianGuard> sorry.. I couldnt resist..
[01:52:56] <Eywind> Winter_Nights get an IRC client
[01:53:20] <Winter_Nights> But I don't want to get one! It works just fine!
[01:53:28] <Eywind> that was your answer
[01:53:36] <Snap_Shot> Winter_Nights i use a free IRC client called Icechat v7
[01:53:38] <Regulus> IRC clients are nice.
[01:53:51] <Regulus> Very helpful.
[01:53:56] <Winter_Nights> I will... Look into it. Sigh.
[01:54:08] <Eywind> don't have to, just if you want a ping list
[01:54:09] <Winter_Nights> Thanks anyway guys.
[01:54:14] <DrelvanianGuard> why does the canterlot hill client never work..
[01:54:23] <MikeM> wikipedia has a pretty good article on IRC clients
[01:54:26] <Eywind> because the last time our developer has been active was December?
[01:54:32] * Winter_Nights will do research.
[01:54:48] <DrelvanianGuard> it hasnt worked for me since novembor
[01:55:09] <Winter_Nights> Bashscript hasn't been around?

[01:57:10] * Winter_Nights was here too. He was there till its last moments.
[01:58:00] <Winter_Nights> And then... It burned. All of it. *sniff*

[02:17:40] <DrelvanianGuard> I actually talk about video games or ponies most of the time.
[02:18:06] <Eywind> Or post incredibly offensive jokes, or disparage other people's opinions in very important personal matters
[02:18:09] <Winter_Nights> But when I do...
[02:18:39] <DrelvanianGuard> I don't disparge peoples opinions.. I cant do a word i dont know the definition of..

[02:19:06] <DrelvanianGuard> i actually only talk politics to certain people..

[16:54:50] <RandomNinja> we will have a spitroasted lamb though

[16:56:12] <RandomNinja> nah but srsly there's like 30 gallons of mead

[16:57:36] <wobniaR> It's not a party until someone gets alcohol poisoning
[16:57:52] <DrelvanianGuard> no.. its not a party til an irishman shows up
[16:58:04] <DrelvanianGuard> and drinks half the mead and then leaves partially still sober
[16:58:38] <RandomNinja> last year there was some random dude who was completely sloshed and just fell over into a pile of mud

[16:59:16] <RandomNinja> his friend had the brilliant idea of trying to wash it off... with cider
[16:59:19] <DrelvanianGuard> We irish can hold our alchohol.. which is good, because most people probably have issues holding on to things when they're drunk... >_>
[16:59:32] <RandomNinja> yeah but you drink Guinness
[16:59:52] <DrelvanianGuard> actually I specifically dont drink anything
[17:00:32] <DrelvanianGuard> 1: not old enough. 2. I dont plan on doing anything that could cause me to have hours of fun without being able to even know I had the fun..
[17:00:55] <DrelvanianGuard> what good does fun do if I didnt get to experience it
[17:01:11] <RandomNinja> I think you're missing the entire point with 2
[17:01:42] <DrelvanianGuard> blackouts and memory loss just arent my cup of tea..
[17:01:43] <RandomNinja> people don't (usually) drink to make boring things fun, people drink because drinking feels good AND you're already having fun
[17:01:53] <RandomNinja> yeah that's why you don't get that drunk
[17:02:12] <DrelvanianGuard> I'm irish.. if I started drinking, i would probably drink that much
[17:02:33] <RandomNinja> there's a pretty wide area of "drunk enough" where you wake up the next day without memory gaps and hangover
[17:04:21] <RandomNinja> stick to Guinness and you'll be fine, it's pretty weak and you dont drink it quickly
[17:04:26] <DrelvanianGuard> Irish rule of drinking: If you pass out. Try to remember when you wake up.. to get a refill, because you probably spilled your drink.
[17:05:58] <DrelvanianGuard> Either way, I stick to soda being my poison..
[17:06:09] <DrelvanianGuard> why get drunk and pass out, when you get get diabetes
[17:06:13] <RandomNinja> you say that now, wait a few years and see :P
[17:07:03] <DrelvanianGuard> I did plan on drinking a shirley temple on my 21st birthday as a joke, just because its non-alchoholic, but technically still a cocktail
[17:07:34] <RandomNinja> 21? weren't you irish?
[17:07:45] <DrelvanianGuard> I live in america.
[17:08:03] <RandomNinja> so you're not actually irish?
[17:08:05] <DrelvanianGuard> I'm actually part Irish.. I just am more twords my irish haritage than anything else
[17:08:41] <DrelvanianGuard> I've been really into most things irish pretty much since I was a wee lad.
[17:09:50] <DrelvanianGuard> I have an ancestor who owned a castle in Ireland.
[17:09:55] <RandomNinja> neat

[17:10:46] <DrelvanianGuard> and I apparnetly have a little bit of scottish in me as well, because he married a scottish girl and had a son, who also married a scottish girl and had a son with her

[17:23:45] <RandomNinja> though I guess monasteries are less full of loot nowadays
[17:24:09] <DrelvanianGuard> but then you look at black metal bands...
[17:24:20] <DrelvanianGuard> apparently some norse people never lost their love for burning down churches
[17:24:56] <DrelvanianGuard> never actually thought of that before... Black Metal Bands = modern vikings
[17:25:26] <RandomNinja> last to convert to christianity, first to leave it
[17:25:45] <RandomNinja> also not really, church burning is ideological, the vikings only wanted easy loot
[17:25:51] <DrelvanianGuard> I should adopt the black metal style to use for christian music.. call it white metal
[17:26:03] <RandomNinja> there is christian black metal IIRC
[17:26:16] <DrelvanianGuard> seems kindof ironic though

[21:08:32] <EM-C> She may have, considering that I eventually calmed down considerably and almost fell asleep.
[21:08:58] <EM-C> But she told us that we were there because something HAD been found with each of us and they needed to take a closer look.

[21:32:53] <DrelvanianGuard> i would like to see a game with a decent food rot system.. like.. for example... if someone recently grew and sold food in a store in fallout.. it shouldnt be radioactive.. its fresh fruit someone just grew in their backyard.. surely they would have sterlized the land before growing things
[21:33:00] <RandomNinja> laser sniper rifle get hype
[21:33:10] <Regulus> True dat
[21:33:12] <RandomNinja> they probably wouldn't
[21:33:14] <DrelvanianGuard> ew.. i dont even use laser weapons
[21:33:20] <RandomNinja> primitive
[21:33:23] <wobniaR> The laser rifle in new vegas had a scope modification
[21:33:29] <Regulus> Still, there's just something about a solid round
[21:33:38] <RandomNinja> the LAER and Gatling Laser were brutal
[21:33:56] <DrelvanianGuard> I may use some laser weapons in FO4.. just because of the weapon you get during the main quest
[21:33:57] <RandomNinja> also Fallout 3 had the hilariously broken Metal Blaster
[21:34:22] <Regulus> I deal in 2 types of weapons, LMGs and rifles. I don't care what ammo it uses.
[21:34:44] <RandomNinja> instead of splitting crit damage over all rays like it should, it applied the full critical damage to each laser. All nine of them.
[21:34:59] <RandomNinja> random 500 dmg crits, thank you very much
[21:35:03] <DrelvanianGuard> thats how I go.. but I tend to avoid laser weapons, because they only ever seem that useful against robots.. I always do more damage with bullets
[21:35:32] <DrelvanianGuard> aside from the Gauss rifle.. now thats a good weapon..
