[20:44:35] <RandomNinja> the moon was built by humans
[20:45:00] <RandomNinja> "
[20:45:00] <RandomNinja> Are we really suggesting that someone or something came along 4.6 billion years ago and 'manufactured' the Moon from surface material taken from the Earth? We are, and when 'all' the evidence is taken into account this is the most reasonable explanation."
[20:45:24] <Unixkitty> "10/10 -IGN"
[20:45:39] <RandomNinja> "The Moon is a sculpture of sorts, but it is also a very powerful machine. It doesn't need an engine or any sort using artifical motive power because it was manufactured in such a way that it would be powered by natural physics, using gravity specifically."
[20:46:34] <LetsEatHay> haha RN that’s good stuff

[20:57:50] <LetsEatHay> or maybe the shadow government traveled back in time and planted Hitler there to provide deniability that they are working on time travel technology
[20:58:29] <LetsEatHay> so Hitler’s existence actually proves that there *is* secret time travel research going on
[21:01:10] <LetsEatHay> think about it — every time traveler would want to go back and kill Hitler. So doesn’t it seem suspiciously coincidental that he even exists in the past?
