[02:36:06] <One-Trick> Gaming_Sounds: havent heard about it
[02:36:17] <Gaming_Sounds> I picked up a Taylor K24CE.
[02:36:25] <Gaming_Sounds> That's a guitar made mostly of koa.
[02:36:38] <Gaming_Sounds> They cost about three grand in UK money.
[02:36:47] <RandomNinja> damn
[02:37:00] <One-Trick> wow, it looks neat
[02:37:02] <Gaming_Sounds> Needless to say, I was having a look at instrument insurance earlier today XD

[02:37:24] <One-Trick> fancy
[02:37:26] <RandomNinja> indeed
[02:37:37] <Gaming_Sounds> But yeah, cool thing is, every one of those looks unique.
[02:37:58] <RandomNinja> handmade?
[02:37:59] <Gaming_Sounds> Like, you'll never see two guitars with a similar grain pattern, cos koa is hard to come by.
[02:38:03] <One-Trick> i havent even opened my violin case in, like, a year
[02:38:23] <RandomNinja> do it

[02:38:32] <One-Trick> i never imagined college was this all-encompassing.
[02:38:53] <Eywind> and when it's not encompassing, it's draining
[02:39:02] <Windows98Pony> One-Trick: i know how you feel. I havent touched my guitar in years
[02:39:05] <Gaming_Sounds> Primarily due to koa being fiendishly expensive material. You only find it growin on the Hawaiian islands, and you're not allowed to actively cut it down, I believe.
[02:39:07] <Hamtramck> Man what are you even studying
[02:39:16] <One-Trick> huh
[02:39:19] <Hamtramck> I did comp sci. It wasn't even remotely encompassing.
[02:39:20] <One-Trick> didnt know that
[02:39:26] <Gaming_Sounds> Also the trees suitable for instruments generally only grow above 5,000ft.
[02:40:06] <One-Trick> Hamtramck: compsci/engineering major, microbiology minor
[02:40:49] <Gaming_Sounds> It's worth the pricetag, though. As a tonewood it's spectacular. Has an amazing sound like a mix of cedar and spruce. You get deep resonant bass notes, full mids, and bright crisp treble.
[02:41:03] <Gaming_Sounds> And it gets better with age, too :)
[02:41:12] <Hamtramck> Just like babies!
[02:41:20] <Gaming_Sounds> No, those get worse.
[02:41:32] <Windows98Pony> hahahah
[02:41:34] <Hamtramck> I meant if you pickle them.
[02:41:52] <Windows98Pony> so cruel
[02:42:14] <One-Trick> im also learning another language
[02:42:32] <Gaming_Sounds> But yeah. Taking into account that I will basically keep this instrument for the rest of my life if I possibly can, I figured the price was reasonable. Specially when I found out that if I'd waited til the end of the month I'd have paid half a grand more than I actually did for it.
[02:42:34] <Hamtramck> Which one?
[02:42:42] <Hamtramck> I double majored in russian when I was doing CS. It was fun.
[02:42:44] <RandomNinja> yay
[02:43:04] <RandomNinja> so now you can communicate in Dota2?
