[01:46:34] <RandomNinja> it's true
[01:46:36] <Hamtramck> They're like dogs that live a lot longer.
[01:46:37] <Regulus> I no longer make that assumption

[04:45:06] <ynoP> Greetings chattybox
[04:46:01] <ynoP> I'm really not feeling it this school year... Not like last year. I have nice teachers and stuff, just... the sports aren't going well.
[04:46:18] <ynoP> Also I'm 120 pages behind on my history reading
[04:46:54] <MikeM> That sucks. 
[04:47:47] <ynoP> And the coach made a rule new of no electronics in the bleachers when the JV game is happening before ours so that takes away over an hour of reading time
[04:48:14] <ynoP> No way I'm lugging the textbook all day in school and all day after just to read for an hour
[04:48:34] <ynoP> PDF is where it's at
[04:48:55] <MikeM> So more reading on the weekends, then?
[04:49:09] <ynoP> Yeah...
[04:50:13] <ynoP> Volleyball sucks this year
[04:50:43] <ynoP> The whole team is awful, but the coach is the worst
[04:51:50] <ynoP> Even before varsity I didn't like his attitude or persona... It seemed so unapproachable. Now I know it's worse than I'd thought
[04:53:26] <ynoP> I spent a lot of time putting in hours practicing, going to clubs, and I know I can contribute to the team, but he doesn't care. I've been trying to figure him out since tryout day.
[04:53:36] <ynoP> Very confusing individual
[04:54:05] <MikeM> Keep at it. Have you thought about just telling him?
[04:54:17] <ynoP> See that's where things go bad
[04:54:34] <ynoP> He's a very visual person, hates talking, loves action
[04:54:56] <ynoP> The more I talk the less he listens
[04:55:14] <ynoP> And I don't even say much
[04:56:26] <MikeM> Hmm
[04:57:18] <ynoP> I haven't played at all in the last 2 games
[04:57:40] <ynoP> That's like, 12 hours of my time wasted
[04:58:50] <ynoP> And it's all because he only wants me to play libero, despite the fact that we don't need 2 liberos and he knows it, and I can play front row better than anyone in front row now
[04:59:05] <MikeM> That sounds strange, that you haven't played in two games.
[04:59:33] <ynoP> I'm beginning to suspect that he hates me or something
[04:59:37] <ynoP> Or he's depressed
[05:00:13] <MikeM> It could be something in his personal life that's carrying over.
[05:00:35] <ynoP> Maybe.
[05:00:39] <MikeM> But whatever it is, he's a coach and a teacher, right? Supposed to be concerned with development.
[05:00:50] <ynoP> He's a health teacher
[05:02:57] *** Quits: Flurshy (Flttrshy@TightRope.is.best.pony) (Quit:  HydraIRC -> http://www.hydrairc.com <- Would you like to know more?)
[05:03:06] <ynoP> The fact of the matter is, I can spike the ball down 9/10 times, and half of our front row players can't, and it doesn't matter how well I show myself in practice, he doesn't care. I get 0 opportunities and I can't talk my way into opportunities so I basically have no options anymore
[05:03:20] <ynoP> Which is why now I'm considering quitting the team
[05:04:52] <MikeM> Sounds like time for an off-court conference.
[05:05:11] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t ynoP
[05:05:12] <DinkyBot> ynoP : never said it cost money?
[05:05:24] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> ^
[05:05:25] <ynoP> Dinky: everything costs money
[05:05:35] <ynoP> Dinky: That'll be $3
[05:05:42] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t money
[05:05:43] <DinkyBot> I liked dead money too
[05:07:10] <ynoP> I would love any kind of conference, but it just doesn't seem possible. I may contact the incompetent sports administrator or the school principal before I actually do that, if I do
[05:07:52] <ynoP> But I don't trust them not to let on the the coach that I said something, which would provoke further anger
[05:08:09] <ynoP> I might get what I want, but not in a good way
[05:09:19] <ynoP> People are touchy. If you tell the authorities on them and they find out, they get mad, and it's not the same situation anymore
[05:09:25] <MikeM> It seems like having a talk about what's bothering you might get better results than just straight up quitting.

[05:11:05] <wobniaR> Woo
[05:11:22] <ynoP> I feel like at this point I probably have little to lose, but I don't know if he thinks me to be simply disposable as a player. If he'll just say "Alright then, goodbye, you're off the team" instead of being helpful
[05:11:59] <ynoP> Which frightens me somewhat because I can visualize him saying that, in character
[05:12:12] <ynoP> It's definitely in the realm of possibility
[05:12:21] <MikeM> It's my experience that talking about that stuff is better than keeping silent and angry.
[05:13:44] <ynoP> I just hope things get better. It'll be a load off my shoulders either way.

[05:15:11] <MikeM> Good. Hoping the oncoming hurricane isn't too bad.
[05:15:59] <PinkieShy> MikeM we're under a flood watch..

[05:48:08] <Hamtramck> I actually like minecraft as a game, the franchise has just gone in such a weird and uncomfortable direction
[05:48:23] <wobniaR> It's really popular and they're milking the popularity while it lasts
[05:48:38] <wobniaR> Same as everything else that becomes popular
[05:48:47] <Hamtramck> I guess it's a generation gap thing.
[05:49:05] <wobniaR> Nah, plenty of people of all ages like Minecraft
[05:49:09] <Hamtramck> I appreciate it for being a really solid first-person sort-of-roguelike that came about in an era before there were a lot of those.
[05:49:13] <Hamtramck> idk why it's so POPULAR though.
[05:49:22] <wobniaR> Besides you're more in the target demographic for Minecraft than kids
[05:49:37] <wobniaR> It's built on 8 bit graphics and java
