[05:57:59] <ynoP> So, I'm still in high school, and as expected, people are always trying to get past the firewall so they can browse freely. Or at least, that used to be the case, but now mostly everyone has data plans for their phones. 
[05:59:41] <Sombra> And their parents don't have proper locks and monitoring software on their phones.
[06:00:01] <ynoP> I remember in grade school everyone just used a slightly different directory and it would work, then they started blocking entire sites, and we moved to the https trick
[06:00:27] <ynoP> Then domain blocking started
[06:00:35] <ynoP> And that's where it still is
[06:01:03] <Snap_Shot> meh i just gave myself admin access and never had to worry about that stuff again
[06:01:07] <Sombra> Did you try going to proxies ynoP?
[06:01:15] <Sombra> we used otunnel back in my day.
[06:01:22] *** Joins: thereallynewmop12100 (~Mibbit@Pony-dd1uig.acanac.net)
[06:01:31] <ynoP> It was primitive domain blocking at first so you could easily find a web proxy
[06:02:01] <ynoP> then they got better, so I found a google group page with new proxy sites every day
[06:02:08] <ynoP> that worked for a few years
[06:02:16] *** Quits: Luna_Jax (Luna_Jax@Pony-l0ci24.ut.comcast.net) (A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.)
[06:02:30] <ynoP> Finally I found Ultrasurf
[06:02:39] <ynoP> and it's probably the most reliable thing
[06:03:34] <ynoP> the google group page was finally blocked just this year when the school outsourced their networking
[06:04:05] <ynoP> And now nobody really cares anymore, because phones
[06:05:35] <Sombra> Why are you going around the school's internet blocked pages anyway?
[06:05:58] <ynoP> because they blocked pretty much everything that wasn't boring
[06:06:27] <Sombra> What do you mean by that?
[06:06:29] <ynoP> I could at least get on hotpockets.com though
[06:07:02] * One-Trick has her own vpn. wutevs.
[06:07:04] <ynoP> I mean, you couldn't even get on a flash game if you were bored
[06:07:21] <thereallynewmop12100> ynoP: Before the christmas break. I listened to Christmas Music on KOST 103.5 at School

[06:08:37] <Regulus> Entirely overkill that only leaves you feeling like just punching a hole probably would have worked
[06:10:02] <ynoP> See, the Hot Pockets effect was basically where everyone is in a computer lab, one guy goes the hotpockets.com and the jingle plays, then everybody starts doing it
[06:10:10] <ynoP> All at once
[06:10:31] <ynoP> And I think I started an epidemic
[06:10:42] <Sombra> Why would you need to be using flash games at school ynoP?

[22:17:48] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Nothing like that only the screw on my glasses came off.
[22:18:02] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> And had to fix it.
[22:18:13] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Oh
[22:18:51] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yes it is.
[22:21:28] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: I am listening to Ponies At Dawn: Snowfall with the yule log as a visualizer

[22:23:40] <DinkyBot> THE GREAT DINKY SAYS ITS RandomNinja
[22:23:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay then.
[22:23:55] <RandomNinja> vote me for president
[22:24:24] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: Sorry buddy you are Swedish
[22:24:32] <RandomNinja> I will not do the thing you don't like about the other guy
[22:24:40] <thereallynewmop12100> Vote TokusatsuKuuga-RX for President
[22:25:01] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I would be a better President than Barack Obama
[22:25:10] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> But I am not 40 years old yet.
[22:25:10] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: And Donald Trump too, right?
[22:25:22] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Maybe
[22:25:27] <Regulus> yea, so? Trump is clearly from the depths of hell, so I say let the Swede run
[22:25:44] <RandomNinja> but running is cardio <.<
[22:26:01] * Regulus curls up for a nap
[22:26:10] * RandomNinja boops Regulus on the nose
[22:26:27] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Just that you need to be a United States citizen to be President of United States
[22:27:00] <thereallynewmop12100> Sorry, RandomNinja 
[22:27:34] <RandomNinja> darn
[22:27:53] <thereallynewmop12100> Move to the US first. then run as a president
[22:27:55] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: But you are still best Viking.
[22:28:05] <RandomNinja> actually no that doesn't work
[22:28:13] <RandomNinja> you need to be born a US citizen
[22:28:34] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Is RandomNinja right about that?
[22:29:07] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Let me check.

[22:36:46] * RandomNinja steals wobniaR's gainz
[22:37:32] <wobniaR> -2 gainz congrats
[22:37:35] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: How much can you lift?
[22:37:52] <RandomNinja> my best is a 120 kg deadlift
[22:38:27] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: I can only lift 26 Kilograms
[22:38:42] <RandomNinja> I find that unlikely
[22:38:51] <RandomNinja> at that point you'd have problems carrying grocery bags
[22:38:53] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Serious I can.
[22:39:25] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> More like 26.5
[22:39:32] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Give or take
[22:39:49] <RandomNinja> are you thinking of a different lift? because in deadlifts you are in a mechanically very strong position
[22:40:25] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> It is mechanical.
[22:40:57] <wobniaR> !link do you even lift

[22:41:07] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> But I am trying to lift that much in dumb bells.
[22:41:13] <RandomNinja> ah yes the swolemoth
[22:41:20] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Got to get them big muscles.
[22:41:31] <RandomNinja> this is a deadlift http://cdnimg.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/barbell-deadlifts.png?cfaea8
[22:41:33] <wobniaR> What has science done
[22:41:46] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> So I can impress the girl I like.
[22:42:12] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Don't forget to wear a Goku Costume
[22:42:16] <RandomNinja> 26 kg is unreasonably low for an adult male without serious handicaps
[22:42:56] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> thereallynewmop12100: Maybe
[22:43:29] <RandomNinja> TokusatsuKuuga-RX, if you want to get big https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/boring-but-big-3-month-challenge

[22:44:27] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Darn
[22:45:31] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> But I will try.
[22:46:17] <RandomNinja> don't just do dumbell biceps curls, because your arms will be disproportonately big and you'll look silly
[22:46:23] <RandomNinja> also what is spelling
[22:46:35] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay then.
[22:46:56] <wobniaR> Never skip leg day
[22:47:04] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Truly
[22:48:01] <RandomNinja> every day is leg day http://i.imgur.com/eVtwqHd.png
[22:49:05] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Does that mean I have to get tattoes as well?
[22:49:40] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: You might be strong like Goku! 
[22:49:42] <RandomNinja> no you need to lift 1x/1.5x/2x bodyweight first
[22:50:06] <thereallynewmop12100> RandomNinja: Once you do that. you will become a Super Saiyan :D 
[22:50:08] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Maybe like Goku but remember he is not Human.
[22:50:29] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay then.
[22:50:59] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Plus of course natural raw foods.
[22:51:19] <RandomNinja> chicken breasts and GOMAD
