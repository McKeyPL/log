[14:32:17] <JockeTF> Good. 
[14:32:20] <JockeTF> You?
[14:32:48] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: Good
[14:33:04] <JockeTF> Good.
[14:34:12] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: Sadly today is the aftermath of LoE OSW
[14:35:30] <Midnight_Lilly> LoE?
[14:35:48] <thereallynewmop12100> Midnight_Lilly: Legends of Equestria
[14:36:20] <Midnight_Lilly> can it run on a atom?
[14:36:30] <Midnight_Lilly> OSW?
[14:37:16] <thereallynewmop12100> Midnight_Lilly: Open Server Weekend, right? 
[14:37:55] <thereallynewmop12100> ^ Jok
[14:37:58] <thereallynewmop12100> *JockeTF 
[14:39:20] <JockeTF> Yes.
[14:40:46] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: It's sad the open server weekend ended
[14:43:41] <Midnight_Lilly> AH
[14:44:14] *** SleepySilver is now known as Silvy
[14:44:32] <Midnight_Lilly> still i would love to see it work on a atom notbeook. but the atom's days are behind
[14:45:12] <JockeTF> Midnight_Lilly: Yeah, it wouldn't run great on that. My Intel i5 (Ivy Bridge) with HD4000 has a hard time running LoE.
[14:45:34] <JockeTF> It can run decently in 1080p with shadows disabled, but it still struggles at times.
[14:46:35] <Midnight_Lilly> i love my atom notebook. i curse its name and call ithe crapbook9000 all the time but still i love it, dont really mean it. its a sturdle little machine. still time to upgrade.
[14:47:12] <Midnight_Lilly> have you tried it with a AMD processor? would be interesting to see if it would run it better?
[14:47:25] <JockeTF> Midnight_Lilly: All that said, LoE is glorious: http://jocketf.se/files/images/loe/flight.png
[14:48:05] <JockeTF> Midnight_Lilly: Only AMD CPU I have is an old E-350 Zacate, don't have a display for that machine though since it's my server. :P
[14:48:17] <Midnight_Lilly> ah
[14:49:21] <Midnight_Lilly> i have a toshiba satellite AMD A4 quad core. as soon as it gets back up and running ill try it out if i can mach up to a open server weekend
[14:49:40] <JockeTF> I think the HD4000 is more powerful when it comes to graphics. I kind of don't get AMD (A|C)PUs anymore since their open graphics drivers for Linux take a long time to get up to speed.
[14:49:40] <Midnight_Lilly> so what can you do in that game?
[14:50:11] <JockeTF> Midnight_Lilly: It's an MMORPG. So, quests, fights, and derping around. :)
[14:50:22] <Midnight_Lilly> i prefer AMD over intel but for gaming i will give intel credit where its due.
[14:50:33] <JockeTF> http://jocketf.se/files/images/loe/fire.png
[14:51:23] <JockeTF> I'd definitely get an AMD card if I could have an actual graphics card. But well, I don't really game much.
[14:51:44] <JockeTF> Midnight_Lilly: Derping around in LoE is very nice though.
[14:51:46] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: Favorite moment from the OSW? 
[14:51:57] <Midnight_Lilly> i game a bit but i use my pc's for 1080p editing and music and general work
[14:52:10] <JockeTF> Ah, I mainly code.
[14:52:17] <JockeTF> thereallynewmop12100: Just flying around.
[14:52:39] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: and meeting me in LoE? 
[14:53:09] <Midnight_Lilly> still ive had better experance on AMD A4 versus Intel i5 
[14:53:27] <Midnight_Lilly> plus it actuall ran games better. 
[14:54:02] <JockeTF> Yeah, I'd love it if they really got their act together when it comes to open Linux drivers.
[14:55:33] <Midnight_Lilly> yeah cheaper then intel also. but whats wrong with linux ones?
[14:55:33] <JockeTF> I'd definitely use AMD graphics in that case.
[14:56:14] <JockeTF> Midnight_Lilly: It took three years before hardware video decoding started working nicely with my AMD E-350.
[14:56:24] <Midnight_Lilly> ah.
[14:56:35] <JockeTF> Kind of ruins it for me. :P

[14:56:46] <JockeTF> Especially since I wanted that machine to be a bit of an HTPC.
[14:56:56] <Midnight_Lilly> maybe the new chipset they talked about last year worked better?
[14:57:09] <Midnight_Lilly> kelvari? or something like that
[14:57:38] <JockeTF> No idea. I'd have to test that myself before buying anything though.

[14:58:56] <JockeTF> Either way, unless there are solid open source drivers within the first year after release I really don't care for that particular GPU.
[14:59:40] <JockeTF> It's worth looking into though.
[15:01:09] <Midnight_Lilly> yeah they fairly new still so. they where bragging about them up on there site when i was updating the driver last i was (around 05/01/2015)
[15:01:15] <JockeTF> The E-350 is really nice for me now, but you really shouldn't have to wait three years. ;P

[20:55:33] <Eywind> swap outs only give a % of EXP instead of half, so it's even harder to grind
[20:55:57] <RandomNinja> makes sense since Gyrados is also pretty OP, at least early

[22:18:05] <FN> Acquire a mansion, it will eat up all the disposable income!
[22:19:10] <Eywind> and if it doesn't, hire a staff
[22:20:56] <HamtRamKc> What's the point of mansions anyway.
[22:21:05] <HamtRamKc> Oh man look at all these goddamn rooms that need vaccuumed now! Sweet!
[22:21:14] <Eywind> when you want a house that has like 8 more bathrooms than bedrooms you get a mansion
[22:21:19] <wobniaR> That's why you hire staff
[22:21:33] <wobniaR> So you don't have to clean them
[22:21:38] <HamtRamKc> yeah but the point of a mansion is so you don't have to deal with people
[22:21:43] <HamtRamKc> but you get staff and you got people to deal with
