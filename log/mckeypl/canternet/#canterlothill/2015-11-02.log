[02:45:23] <Regulus> Wish I could actually remember any of the dreams I have
[02:45:23] <Eywind> and I stopped to talk to him and I was like "but.. you're dead, at least where I'm from" and he's like "Oh, well, that's alright." and kept painting
[02:45:25] <thereallynewmop12100> And everyone was recreating Bob Ross' art w/ photo editing software (like MS Paint & Photoshop)

[03:56:37] <Hamtramck> understanding of adulthood after ten years of experience being an adult: adulthood is when you quit spending time with your parents on a regular basis because your pets are dead and the pets were the only thing you had in common with them, and every time you do see your mom you're not really sure it's the same person each time.
[03:56:44] <Trildar> Infinity probably.
[03:56:49] <Eywind> damn that's dark
[03:56:51] <Hamtramck> I sure wish my pets existed.
[03:57:10] <MikeM> What about getting new ones?
[03:57:23] <Regulus> I AM THE FLOOF
[03:57:32] <MikeM> You can pet Regulus 
[03:57:40] <Hamtramck> Eh, having pets is just a lot of anxiety about when they might die to me, now.
[03:57:54] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: This week is the Halloween Special of Hearts of Space.. i honestly think The Evil ID plays on Hearts of Space. just saying..
[03:58:00] <Hamtramck> ... That's not really a normal response to having pets, is it.
[03:58:07] <wobniaR> Enjoy and treasure the time you do have them, no one lives forever
[03:58:14] <MikeM> That's the thing.
[03:58:15] <Eywind> or do they?
[03:58:25] <MikeM> You know they're gonna die, but the do bring a lot of joy.
[03:58:34] <Trildar> Eywind confirmed immortal
[03:58:45] <Regulus> YOUR FLOOF GOD ALWAYS APPRECIATES EAR SCRITCHES
