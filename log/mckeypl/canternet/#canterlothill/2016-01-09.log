[01:53:54] <DinkyBot>  [ [For Sale] Scootaloo Shoulder Pony by Bendykins on DeviantArt ]
[01:54:52] <RandomNinja> that seems way too small for shoulder carry
[01:55:19] <wobniaR> Supposedly has magnets in stomach to stick to something metal on your shoulder
[01:56:05] <RandomNinja> how many monies?
[01:56:09] <wobniaR> $250
[01:56:18] <wobniaR> So it's quite a bit for its size
[01:56:21] <RandomNinja> yeah
[01:56:48] <wobniaR> I'm just trying to think what would I strap to my backpack strap that would be metal and wide enough
[01:56:58] <wobniaR> So it could stick

[01:57:21] <RandomNinja> make your blood metal
[01:57:36] <wobniaR> I'm not a space marine sadly so that much iron in my blood would probably kill me
[01:58:08] <RandomNinja> you can probably just buy a thin metal plate for pocket change
[01:58:20] <RandomNinja> then cut a hole in the cloth and sew it in

[02:01:58] <RandomNinja> also https://i.imgur.com/OePU5hP.jpg
[02:03:42] <wobniaR> Yeah it's not very practical to shoulder carry that, and sewing a thin metal plate on my backpack strap is not something I'm skilled in
[02:03:56] <RandomNinja> that's really really easy tho
[02:04:40] <RandomNinja> cut a slit along the edge, slide plate in, stich it back together in 5 minutes

[13:36:27] <FN> I wish it would be the case for Germany
[13:36:36] <Sketchy_Sounds> Dude you have it even better.
[13:36:42] <Sketchy_Sounds> AER is based in Germany.
[13:36:45] <FN> "Made in Germany" makes the price skyrocket, not drop
[13:36:58] <Sketchy_Sounds> They are considered the best acoustic amps in the world by many :p
[13:37:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yah well, consider the horrendous price gouging that happens if you want to buy an AER amp over here, considering that means that import fees become a part of the price.
[13:38:29] <FN> Oh, indeed
[13:40:57] <FN> I wonder if it would be cheaper to buy it here and send it as a "present" to Brittain
[13:41:10] <FN> Probably cheaper than they sell it there
[13:41:27] <Sketchy_Sounds> Possibly, although customs would still slap a fee on it for the recipient.
[13:41:43] <FN> Nope
[13:41:52] <Sketchy_Sounds> British customs would, I mean.
[13:42:08] <FN> My guitar and watch are worth a sum, but since they are legit presents, I paid no fees
[13:42:18] <Sketchy_Sounds> Trust me, I work for HMRC and I've imported stuff before, I know how our customs work.
[13:42:43] <FN> But, yeah I never visited Britain
[13:42:48] <Sketchy_Sounds> British customs will charge a fee even if it's a gift, though only if it's over a certain value :<
