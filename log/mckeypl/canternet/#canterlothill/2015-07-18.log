[16:59:31] <Vulpor> Morning everyone
[16:59:31] <Sketchy_Sounds> Put in simple terms it's when the hydrochloric acid from your stomach is sent back up into your oesophagus. It burns the way one might expect hydrochloric acid to do.

[17:00:09] <Sketchy_Sounds> Hence the term heartburn. Anyways, I'm off to go get some calcium carbonate for it. That's an antacid which neutralises the excess acid and calms things down.
