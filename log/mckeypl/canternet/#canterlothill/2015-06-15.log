[00:39:57] <One-Trick> pretty much, i need to watch the episode again cuz i was half asleep when i saw it and i feel like i dreamed it
[00:40:10] <Eywind> hah it felt like a dream
[00:41:56] <EM-C> Everyone enjoy the 100th episode?
[00:42:04] <Eywind> yup
[00:42:26] <wobniaR> Still like 78k people watching this stream
[00:42:36] <EM-C> I wish they hadn't listed Derpy as "Muffins."  They could have at least called her Ditzy, or maybe even Bright Eyes.
[00:42:37] <Eywind> 122k?
[00:42:42] <One-Trick> my brother in law is one of them
[00:42:55] <Eywind> Eh EM-C that's what Hasbro decided I guess
[00:43:09] <EM-C> But since Derpy's love of muffins is a fan-created thing, I guess it's sort of a back-handed complement.
[00:43:40] <Hamtramck> Derpy as a whole is kind of a fan-created thing.
[00:43:45] <EM-C> I wish they'd give Vinyl a voice.  I don't like seeing her turned into Equestria's version of Harpo Marx.
[00:44:01] <Hamtramck> Maybe she's mute and has to communicate through her music
[00:44:10] <Eywind> maybe she wasn't feeling well
[00:44:17] <Hamtramck> Also come one techno DJs don't traditionally talk
[00:44:20] <Hamtramck> That ruins the illusion
[00:44:26] <EM-C> I tell myself they're just waiting for Jill to become an actual professional voice actress so she can do her.  She's become THE definitive Vinyl voice.
[00:44:38] <Hamtramck> I want Meg Whitman to voice Vinyl
[00:44:41] <Hamtramck> Because I'm awful
[00:44:48] <EM-C> Who's Meg Whitman?
[00:44:53] <Hamtramck> The CEO of Hewlett Packard.
[00:44:55] <One-Trick> betty white is vinyl scratch
[00:45:11] <EM-C> Are they still around?  Sorry, I'm not very tech-savvy.
[00:45:14] <Hamtramck> Anyway back to playing rare imported Saturn games. Because who needs women when I got these?
[00:45:17] <Eywind> that would be fantastic One-Trick
[00:45:21] <Hamtramck> emc >:t

[00:49:37] <Sketchy_Sounds> That episode was honestly all about ass kissing.
[00:49:53] <Sketchy_Sounds> Cos it was a pair of them getting married. :3
[00:50:07] <EM-C> And Steven Magnet's fan name comes from a faulty YouTube caption?  Really?
[00:50:13] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yep, it does.
[00:50:22] <Sketchy_Sounds> A YouTube auto-caption fail, actually.
[00:50:46] <Eywind> yeah it was that, then became a merch name
[00:50:59] <EM-C> Really?  I didn't know he had any merch.
[00:51:01] <Sketchy_Sounds> Honestly I think my favourite part of the entire episode was Gummy's deep internal monologue.
[00:51:02] <Eywind> yeah
[00:51:09] <Eywind> He has the trading cards and some toyls and stuff
[00:51:16] <Eywind> maybe toys? IDK he's referenced in a few
[00:51:18] <Sketchy_Sounds> That was the bit where I just totally lost it.
[00:51:20] <EM-C> And Octavia was listed as "Octavia," which is also a fan-created name.
[00:51:21] <Eywind> he had a ccg card too
[00:51:31] <EM-C> They're discriminating against Derpy!
[00:51:34] <Eywind> umm
[00:51:41] <EM-C> They accept everypony's name but hers!
[00:51:45] * Eywind rolls eyes
[00:51:53] <Sketchy_Sounds> EM-C, pretty much every pony in the entire episode was named as per fan-given names.
[00:51:53] * thereallynewmop12100 applies temp profile on sunsetwubs 
[00:51:59] <wobniaR> Octavia was Octavia in the toy lines
[00:52:11] <EM-C> Maybe, but the name was still coined by a fan.
[00:52:20] <Eywind> Wait, you're not actually joking about the Derpy thing?
[00:52:21] <Sketchy_Sounds> The Doctor, Lyra, Bon Bon, Steven, Octavia, Vinyl, the lot of 'em.
[00:52:23] <thereallynewmop12100> Sketchy_Sounds: I like the Doctor & Derpy, Button Mash and Vinyl part.

[00:52:54] <EM-C> Not up in arms, but it still hurts that they changed the name of the most beloved of all fan-created characters well accepting the names of the others.
[00:53:11] <Eywind> this game looks dumb lol
[00:53:21] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah well, you know why they couldn't actually call her Derpy. It'd upset too many people whose opinions don't actually matter :p

[00:53:55] <Eywind> like it goes from splatoon to that
[00:53:55] <EM-C> I have a theory (which is bound to be unpopular) that, as a special brony episode (featuring even Derpy the Philosopher) rather than a regular episode for the original target audience, this ep really doesn't fit into canon.
[00:53:57] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well, whose opinions don't matter to us, but do matter to Hasbro as the people who'd be upset would be parents of children who would be spending money on their product.
[00:54:01] *** ryaxnb21 is now known as Pony_56016
[00:54:11] <Eywind> yes they'd spend like $30 on some toys

[00:54:42] <EM-C> Sorry!
[00:54:44] <Sketchy_Sounds> EM-C, I reject your idea on the basis that it fits into continuity far too well to not be canon.
[00:54:47] <wobniaR> I only buy the highest quality of knockoffs
[00:55:12] <Sketchy_Sounds> For starters the entire premise of the episode was Matilda and Cranky's wedding :p
[00:55:16] <EM-C> Anyway, surely it's not canon now that Gummy is a philosopher, right?  So the rest of the ep isn't actually canon either.  It was simply something special: a love letter to the bronies.
[00:55:18] *** Pony_56016 is now known as ryaxnb
[00:55:30] <Sketchy_Sounds> Also Larson stated it was canon :)
[00:55:43] <wobniaR> canon canon canon everything's canon no one is free of sin
[00:56:00] <thereallynewmop12100> !t canon 
[00:56:01] <DinkyBot> Because that's all that canon means
[00:56:03] <Sketchy_Sounds> 'sides, it makes sense for Gummy to constantly be in deep thought. Would explain why he seldom does much. XD
[00:56:13] <EM-C> The word "canon" actually comes from the Hebrew "qaneh" which refers to a reed which was used as a measure.
[00:56:27] <Eywind> Cool
[00:56:32] <Sketchy_Sounds> Cool story
[00:56:32] <Eywind> no reeds here
[00:56:38] <EM-C> It went from there into Greek, Latin, and everywhere else.
[00:57:15] <EM-C> Ashleigh can really do different voices, can't she?
[00:57:21] <Eywind> they're voice actors
[00:57:49] <EM-C> Yeah, but there are two kinds of voice actors (both good): the kind whose voices all sound alike, and those whose voices sound totally different from each other.
[00:58:10] <EM-C> Mel Blanc's voices all sounded alike, yet he was one of the greatest VA's of all time.
[00:58:23] <EM-C> Same goes for Grey DeLisle.
[00:58:32] <Eywind> what's the metric of being a 'great' VA though?
[00:58:37] <One-Trick> i do my own voice in all my shows
[00:58:50] <EM-C> A great voice actress whose voice is always immediately recognizable.
[00:58:59] <Eywind> To you maybe
[00:59:05] <wobniaR> I like Morgan Freeman
[00:59:06] <EM-C> That's referring to Grey DeLisle, not answering your question.
[00:59:30] <Eywind> There's a difference between liking a voice and thinking they're a great voice actor
[00:59:48] <Eywind> Morgan Freeman would do voice acting because people liked his voice and wanted it to be immediately recognizable
[00:59:54] <Eywind> They'd make the role for him, not the other way around
[00:59:55] <EM-C> I'm referring to VA's who can really act.
[01:00:24] <Sketchy_Sounds> ...OK, just saw something that I couldn't believe was actually a thing
[01:00:24] <EM-C> "I'd like to sleep on a bed made of your voice."...Ted
[01:00:38] <Eywind> what's that Sketchy?
[01:00:43] <Eywind> Did you get the bill for your guitar?
[01:00:54] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well I saw a post on Tumblr that said "But remember that time Ireland was so done with the Eurovision that we entered a turkey-shaped puppet who just screamed GIVE IRELAND TWELVE POINTS to a bass line".
[01:01:19] <Sketchy_Sounds> And I thought "Naaaah, come on". but then I saw a link in the follow-up comments from someone who thought the same.
[01:01:29] <Sketchy_Sounds> ...IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
[01:01:36] <Eywind> XD
[01:01:44] <Sketchy_Sounds> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps3kxGo_gro
[01:01:44] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[01:01:45] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Eurovision 2008 Semi Final 1 11 Ireland *Dustin The Turkey* *Irlande Douze Pointe* 16:9 HQ
[01:02:13] <Sketchy_Sounds> And on that note, it's time I slept. Enjoy that dose of surrealism.

[23:42:32] * DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around DinkyBot in a tight embrace
[23:42:33] <DinkyBot> I love you, momma.
[23:42:41] <Sombra> The closer I look the more I get sucked into the void.

[23:42:54] * DerpyBot puts her front hooves on FruitNibbler's shoulders.
[23:43:04] <RandomNinja> Considering the rest of the episode, the changeling is pretty low on the list
[23:43:19] <FruitNibbler> Was a nice touch
[23:43:47] <FruitNibbler> I giggled at how mane six was quite literally "left out"
[23:44:11] <FruitNibbler> A bit of 4th wall metahumour there
[23:44:11] <Sombra> I dunno, I just figured the rest of it kind of "made sense".
[23:44:20] <Sombra> To a degree... except for the horse head masks...
[23:44:43] <FruitNibbler> Good epiaode overall, albeit random and silly
