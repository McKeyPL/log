[00:03:09] <Snap_Shot> RandomNinja just avoid Kodak and Canon printers. they run out of ink too fast and refills cost an arm and a leg. I'd say go Espron since you can buy 1L ink bottles and refill them yourself
[00:03:38] <RandomNinja> I was thinking pretty much the cheapest laser printer that has good reviews
[00:04:04] <RandomNinja> already have an ink printer that's starting to die on me, and I'm not getting another one

[00:05:53] <RandomNinja> to be fair it's been around for like 10 years

[22:12:43] <snitch567> Cloud_Zephyr: never :P
[22:13:35] <EM-C> thereallynewmop12100: Remember how worried I was about that catscan the other day?
[22:14:07] <EM-C> Oh, and you mistyped my name so I didn't hear a ping.
[22:14:58] <EM-C> Anyway, since he just wanted me to come in for one I was afraid he might have found something.  But the next day his receptionist called Mama and he's going to give her one too.
[22:15:20] <EM-C> In other words, it looks like this is going to be strictly routine as well.  So I'm a lot less worried now.
[22:15:58] <EM-C> I still dread having to get up so early in the morning, though...and doing without Co-Cola or chocolate for 24 hours beforehand.
[22:16:24] <EM-C> Anyway, just wanted you all to know.
[22:16:45] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Why?
[22:16:57] <thereallynewmop12100> And yes..
