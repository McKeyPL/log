[06:48:54] <Muffin_Spectacles> thereallynewmop12100: Nope, no Season 3...but the show's creator did have a say in pulling the plug on it...he did want it to be like an amazing once-in-a-lifetime summer adventure, and it would suffice to say, it was a pretty active summer for the kids.
[06:49:07] <Eywind> better to go out on top
[06:49:19] <thereallynewmop12100> Let me check google.
[06:49:58] <Hamtramck> Iiiii thought Gravity Falls always had a story arc planned out and a known end-point
[06:50:27] <Muffin_Spectacles> Hamtramck: Well, there were hints that 'something big' was coming, and i think the show is at that point.
[06:50:48] <thereallynewmop12100> Muffin_Spectacles: "On November 20, 2015, creator of the show Alex Hirsch announced that the second season of the show would be its last.

[06:56:51] <Hamtramck> P&F was like my favorite thing in college
[06:57:01] <Muffin_Spectacles> One series I wish that could have done more with its stories, was 'My Life as a Teenage Robot.' Sadly, it had memorable production design...but the stories just really...meh, at times.
