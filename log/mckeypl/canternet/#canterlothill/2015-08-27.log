[14:12:06] <FruitNibbler> There is a house here in Stuttgart that is remaining uninhabited
[14:12:16] <RandomNinja> madness
[14:12:17] <FruitNibbler> That house has a huge debt with it
[14:12:45] <RandomNinja> wait why does the house have debt?
[14:12:50] <FruitNibbler> Like 4 times the price of the house itself last time I heard it (even more today), so nopony wants to buy it
[14:13:19] <FruitNibbler> The person who lived there died before paying his debts, and he had no one to cover that
[14:13:24] <RandomNinja> lol
[14:13:36] <FruitNibbler> Thus the debt grew and will carry on to whoever buys it
[14:13:40] <FruitNibbler> Stupid thing
[14:13:53] <RandomNinja> It's like a haunted house, except of stealing your sleep it steals your money
[14:13:57] <FruitNibbler> Bank could have stopped that and sold this house looooong ago
[14:14:34] * RandomNinja throws monopoly money at FruitNibbler 
[14:14:47] <FruitNibbler> According to our economy prof: the only way to escape this stupid loop is financial suicide
[14:15:08] <RandomNinja> or the bank could write it off as loss, but that would be sensible
[14:15:15] <FruitNibbler> A person or a company would buy this house and file for bankruptcy to remove the debt
[14:15:38] <RandomNinja> solution: set up company just to buy the house
[14:15:43] <FruitNibbler> But this is a financial suicide for all the future purposes, unless you happen to be Goldman Sachs himself
[14:16:20] <FruitNibbler> Nopony is willing to stain their future with such a jig
[14:16:46] <RandomNinja> this makes a lot more sense knowing it's Goldman Sachs
[14:16:57] <RandomNinja> as common sense is unknown to giant banks
[14:17:26] <FruitNibbler> Oddly enough the house that is 3 storey high, with 2 garages and a small yard around it is priced at "only" 180 000‚Ç¨
[14:17:37] <RandomNinja> that's pretty cheap really
[14:17:38] <FruitNibbler> Which for this region is outrageously cheap
[14:17:51] <FruitNibbler> Flats cost more than this house
[14:18:01] <FruitNibbler> But the debt makes it a luxury house
[14:18:11] <RandomNinja> it's pretty reasonable for anywhere that's not away from civilization
[14:19:05] <FruitNibbler> Well, as a downside it is located smack bang between two active factories and two busy roads that run near those factories
[14:19:13] <RandomNinja> parents' reasonably large single floor villa in a small town in the middle of nowhere is about ‚Ç¨120K IIRC
[14:19:18] <FruitNibbler> So the location is not exactly perfect tbh
[14:19:27] <RandomNinja> yeah that wrecks property value
[14:20:04] <FruitNibbler> Also: if not this peculiar status of this house this small bit of land with just 4 houses would be long bought by one or the other factory, if not this debt
[14:20:57] <FruitNibbler> It is like a financial black hole nopony wants top bother with

[14:46:08] <RandomNinja> silly

[14:50:14] <Flurshy> this is a rare occasion
[14:50:57] <FruitNibbler> Butt dialing is a thing
[14:51:08] <Flurshy> FruitNibbler: it wasn't in the oxford dictionary till now though

[15:12:25] * RandomNinja falls out of the ring
[15:14:19] * Flurshy climbs out of the ring and thwacks again
[15:14:33] <Flurshy> because apparently in wrestling, falling out of the ring doesn't mean you lose
[15:15:02] <FruitNibbler> I like the debates between prescriptive and descriptive school of thought
[15:15:03] <Flurshy> I've seen a wrestling match where they were just brawling on the ground >.< didn't even look like they were -trying- to be convincing
[15:15:50] <RandomNinja> yeah that's not fun
[15:16:06] <RandomNinja> wrestling is obviously fake, but the good matches are the ones where you don't care
[15:16:12] <FruitNibbler> For those who don't know: prescriptive school of thought dictates that we must speak like it is written in the dictionary, descriptive on the other hand states that dictionaries only describe language and its evolution
[15:16:39] <RandomNinja> ye
[15:16:48] <Flurshy> well if you want to nitpick, which came first?
[15:17:05] <FruitNibbler> The truth, as always is smack bang between those
[15:17:32] <FruitNibbler> We need to follow a dictionary to remain understood, but the elements that are too archaic fall out of use

[15:39:55] <Flurshy> TL;DR is this: they're threatening to sue soundcloud because THEIR members post their own music on the site
[15:44:53] <RandomNinja> Copyright law: it works
[15:48:53] <FruitNibbler> Pff
[15:49:50] <FruitNibbler> Just delete the PRS member uploaded content and be done with it
[15:50:05] <FruitNibbler> No content hosted - no copyright violation
[15:51:01] <FruitNibbler> That is a fairly asshole thing to do: to demand money from a free hosting website
[15:51:35] <FruitNibbler> The fact that you don't pay anything for your music being hosted and exposed to others is already a deal
[15:52:22] <JockeTF> The copyright industry have always been assholes, they wouldn't make any money otherwise. :P
[15:52:23] <FruitNibbler> So if Soundcloud has to pay, it would be only fair to start charging those PRS members for music hosting 
[15:53:12] <JockeTF> Or well, maybe they would, but they don't want to bother changing their ways unless absolutely necessary.
[15:53:15] <FruitNibbler> Well same way you could argue that Imgur, Tumblr and Instagram should pay you for hosting your photos
[15:53:26] <Flurshy> that, or have a requirement that if it's copyrighted then you HAVE to allow ads on the music page
[15:53:30] <FruitNibbler> Can you see how stupid this demand really is?
[15:53:46] <JockeTF> I didn't say it wasn't stupid. :P
[15:54:10] * JockeTF is a member of the Swedish pirate party.
[15:54:13] <Flurshy> it's rediculous
[15:54:39] <FruitNibbler> German pirate party went stupid, so I don't support them any more
[15:56:07] <FruitNibbler> Copyright law is a weird tug-o-war game
[15:57:13] <FruitNibbler> In one case James Bond movie pays Cessna to feature its plane in the movie, in other case mercedes and Jaguar pay the movie to feature their cars in it...
[15:57:30] <Flurshy> I'm pretty sure if copyright activists got their way you'd need a special license to play music at your family get-together
[15:58:00] *** Joins: Chaotic_Harmony (Chaotic_Har@Super.Sad.Super.Secret.SadCave)
[15:58:40] <FruitNibbler> I man copyright law somehow can be interpreted both ways, so I don't think there is much fairness to it
[15:59:33] <Flurshy> I think the mercedes thing is product placement for advertising, which means they pay the movie company
[15:59:36] <FruitNibbler> At least definitely not the fairness it was meant to provide originally, now that middle man benefits from it more than the actual creator
[15:59:51] <RandomNinja> >tfw bus is late in your favor
[16:00:02] <Flurshy> the odds are NEVER in our favor
[16:01:37] <FruitNibbler> Funny how too many executives in the government project means corruption, but too many middle-men between creator and customer is called "business" or "marketing"
[16:02:18] <Flurshy> oh god someone used pepperspray in an airplane http://www.hngn.com/articles/123423/20150827/fight-jetblue-flight-sends-two-people-hospital.htm
[16:02:19] <DinkyBot>  [ Fight On JetBlue Flight Sends Two People To The Hospital : News : Headlines & Global News ]
[16:02:34] <Flurshy> that is NOT an appropriate setting for pepperspray
[16:03:03] <FruitNibbler> Reminds me of school days when my class mate wanted to spray me with the pepperspray and the school had to be evacuated later
[16:03:16] <Flurshy> I had keychain mace at one point
[16:03:36] <Flurshy> it went off in a closet for a split second. After that you couldn't enter the closet because you couldn't breathe
[16:04:31] <FruitNibbler> My parents had to throw my sweater into the garbage bin after that pepper spray: it wouldn't come off after two washing cycles
[16:05:19] <FruitNibbler> Like a bright orange paint mark (which might have been a feature of that brand to identify a perpetrartor by the coloured face
[16:06:19] <FruitNibbler> But since I am kind of into martial arts, I haven't allowed that kid to spray my face, so he ended up spraying 4 of my class mates and a teacher who went to separate us
[16:06:39] <Flurshy> modern pepperspray uses UV paint instead
[16:06:46] <Flurshy> so you can't see it except with a blacklight
[16:07:04] <FruitNibbler> I had a UV tattoo on my shoulder
[16:07:16] <FruitNibbler> It fades away rather quickly though
[16:07:27] <FruitNibbler> Not a trace of it now
[16:08:12] <FruitNibbler> I mean the kind of tattoo that is only visible under UV lamp
[16:08:32] <FruitNibbler> And not visible at all with the naked eye
[16:09:11] * Flurshy nod
[16:09:20] <Flurshy> UV lamp = blacklight
[16:09:26] <Flurshy> they are both the same thing
[16:10:31] *** Octave|Work is now known as OctaveSymphony
[16:10:56] <FruitNibbler> Not exactly
[16:11:28] <FruitNibbler> The blacklight includes a visible violet light, UV lamp is meant to have strictly UV rays

[16:12:55] <thereallynewmop12100> Hello
[16:14:08] <FruitNibbler> Wow some gangsta grannies there
[16:14:17] <FruitNibbler> One slashes, other maces
[16:14:38] <FruitNibbler> Kinda shows that stupidity has no age boundaries
[16:14:50] <Flurshy> apparently
[16:16:09] <FruitNibbler> I think western planes should adopt this russian system they used to built into their planes
[16:16:44] <FruitNibbler> An emergency venting mode for things like fire or other hazardous fumes on board
[16:17:14] <FruitNibbler> It was almost never used, but it seems it was a good foresight none the less
[16:17:21] <Flurshy> indeed
[16:17:34] <Flurshy> considering they were on the ground, venting would have been a good idea
[16:18:13] <FruitNibbler> No this russian system was meant to function at altitude as well
[16:18:21] <Flurshy> nice
[16:19:10] <FruitNibbler> Like for example fire that doesn't have open flames, but produces toxic fumes
[16:19:28] <Flurshy> mhm
[16:19:41] <FruitNibbler> Or if some dim witted passenger would sneak a gallon of acetone and spill it
[16:20:18] <FruitNibbler> The trouble was that the filters for that thing were very roomy, and took space that could be used for more luggage
[16:21:01] <FruitNibbler> So after the fall of soviet union no one used those
[16:22:25] <FruitNibbler> Oh, speaking of crazy soviet things: there was a project, that is featured in one of the russian tech museums which proposed to have personal capsules on the plane for each passenger
[16:22:51] <FruitNibbler> Those would separate in case of emergency and descend on a personal parachure each
[16:23:28] <FruitNibbler> Interesting concept that was never realised due to exceeding costs

[16:24:09] <Flurshy> do modern planes even HAVE enough parachutes for passengers?
[16:24:31] <FruitNibbler> Nope
[16:24:50] <Flurshy> how encouraging
[16:24:50] <FruitNibbler> Only the crew has parachutes actually
[16:25:01] <Flurshy> you know what happens when parachutes are needed?
[16:25:07] <Flurshy> if there aren't any for passengers
[16:25:27] <Flurshy> passengers will -kill- crewmembers to take their chutes
[16:25:58] <FruitNibbler> Most of the time there are no parachutes at all on the passenger lines, but there definitely are on the cargo planes though
[16:27:12] <FruitNibbler> In majority of cases that is just an olden regulation that wasn't overruled
[16:27:48] <FruitNibbler> Not that the crew would have a chance to use parachutes in most accidents anyhow: they happen on landings and takeoffs
[16:28:25] <FruitNibbler> So there is simply not enough time and altitude for a chute
