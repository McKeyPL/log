[18:17:51] <Flurshy> then I built a computer about a year later, though not with gaming specs
[18:18:06] <Flurshy> well not all computers can beat a ps4
[18:18:26] <johnsey> yeah, i don't think my pentium 166mhz can
[18:18:28] <Trildar> I've never been too convinced by GPU accelerated video encoding.
[18:18:30] <Flurshy> many people just have an i3 with integrated graphics and maybe 4GB of ram
[18:18:38] <Trildar> Though to be fair, I don't really know where that's at now.
[18:18:39] <RandomNinja> true, but you don't have to go much higher in price
[18:18:43] <johnsey> maybe if i overclock it
[18:18:49] <RandomNinja> also, cheaper games + not paying for online

[18:23:26] <Trildar> Ah, effects rendering would be a different thing.

[18:34:39] <Trildar> Huh, sounds like the GPU video encoding thing is in a bit of a funny state. It's workable now, but it seems more like it's a hardware encoder put on the GPU more than the GPU cores itself.
[18:34:53] * RandomNinja hardware encodes Trildar 
[18:35:29] <Trildar> Also not sure about support. Adobe has a beta-ish plugin for NVENC. AMD probably has less support.
[18:35:41] * Trildar software decodes RandomNinja
