[18:11:49] <Flurshy> so people can't complain when they try to max out the graphics with an i3

[18:11:58] <Flurshy> most likely

[18:14:19] <RandomNinja> I'm more confused as to why it recommends a GTX 780

[18:14:26] <RandomNinja> I mean, have you seen the graphics?
[18:14:41] <RandomNinja> modded New Vegas looks much better
[18:15:05] <Flurshy> maybe they'll say "new consoles announced way too early" or something like that

[18:16:21] <RandomNinja> nerdery

[18:16:46] <Cloud_Zephyr> for rendering college stuff

[18:17:51] <Flurshy> then I built a computer about a year later, though not with gaming specs
[18:18:06] <Flurshy> well not all computers can beat a ps4
[18:18:26] <johnsey> yeah, i don't think my pentium 166mhz can
[18:18:28] <Trildar> I've never been too convinced by GPU accelerated video encoding.
[18:18:30] <Flurshy> many people just have an i3 with integrated graphics and maybe 4GB of ram
[18:18:38] <Trildar> Though to be fair, I don't really know where that's at now.
[18:18:39] <RandomNinja> true, but you don't have to go much higher in price
[18:18:43] <johnsey> maybe if i overclock it
[18:18:49] <RandomNinja> also, cheaper games + not paying for online

[18:34:39] <Trildar> Huh, sounds like the GPU video encoding thing is in a bit of a funny state. It's workable now, but it seems more like it's a hardware encoder put on the GPU more than the GPU cores itself.
[18:34:53] * RandomNinja hardware encodes Trildar 
[18:35:29] <Trildar> Also not sure about support. Adobe has a beta-ish plugin for NVENC. AMD probably has less support.
[18:35:41] * Trildar software decodes RandomNinja
