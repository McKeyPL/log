[19:50:19] <Jokerboxer> No. I mean in terms of speed and physics.

[19:51:44] * Unixkitty retranslates all the wavelengths towards RandomNinja 
[19:51:56] <Jokerboxer> Take at Twilight when she flies. A lot of her magic goes to her horn not flight. But when she got the magic from the other Alicorns she gained a speed boost because she was able to allacate it.
[19:55:09] <Jokerboxer> We all know that magic in MLP:FIM is mostly mental/inherent. If they concentrate on it the task can be improved. If RD wills it she can move faster conssidering she has such magic in the first place. My question is: When RD is powered up witht he elements of harmony does she still more faster or does that energ go towards blasting?
[19:55:46] <Jokerboxer> Think about it.
