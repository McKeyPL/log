[00:00:22] <TheTaZe> fun fact. I used Harmor, Harmless, and Sylenth1 for this track

[00:00:54] <TheTaZe> Arp is in harmor
[00:00:57] <Selv3dge> My track was mostly Sylenth

[02:33:11] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Oh no
[02:33:18] <EM-C> I'm afraid I don't know what that is, Mop.
[02:33:44] <EM-C> Well like I said, the medicine she's taking is supposed to get rid of the clot.  She has a mammogram scheduled for the spont in her breast.
[02:33:57] <EM-C> And the doctor's just going to keep an eye on the one on ther thyroid.
[02:34:13] <EM-C> But she has to go back next month.  I don't have another appointment for three.
[02:34:39] <EM-C> Anyway, I've been to enough doctors since October to be sick and tired of all of them.  It's been one after another.

[02:36:40] <EM-C> It doesn't help that it's December and I don't celebrate Xmas anymore (for religious reasons).  But even if I did, I wouldn't be able to do any Xmasy stuff anymore.
[02:36:58] <RandomNinja> why not?
[02:37:04] <EM-C> It's just like...the world's just a TV screen and I'm just watching it.
[02:37:19] <EM-C> As I said, religious reasons.  I haven't observed Xmas for 25 years.
[02:37:31] <EM-C> Nothing to do with politics or the culture wars.
[02:37:34] <RandomNinja> no, why wouldn't you be able?

[02:37:38] <EM-C> Oh.
[02:37:56] <EM-C> I understand.  I remember being a little kid in the early 60s.
[02:38:25] <EM-C> RandomNinja: I couldn't hunt down a tree, chop it down, put it up, decorate it, undecorate it, and take it down.
[02:38:39] <EM-C> And I can't shop PLUS don't have expendable income.
[02:38:44] <RandomNinja> this is what nephews are for :P
[02:39:22] <EM-C> I can barely shop for groceries anymore.  Standing and walking about (especially standing) are extremely painful  and I can't do either for very long.
[02:39:56] <RandomNinja> busted knees?
[02:39:56] <EM-C> Plus...I guess I'm just jaded.  I remember what it was like way back then.  There's no way to recreate that.
[02:40:11] <EM-C> Knees, feet, ankles, hips, lower back.
[02:40:49] <EM-C> I have to sit down to do everything now.  I have to sit down to shave.  Sit down to pray.  Sit down for **everything**.
[02:41:33] <EM-C> I don't know what I'd do without my DSL Internet.  Unfortunately, my only connection is one old desktop computer, so I'm always just one glitch away from being offline.
[02:42:06] <EM-C> The other day I was watching this guy catch snakes on YouTube.  I used to look for snakes and catch them.
[02:42:11] <EM-C> I can't anymore.
[02:42:28] <EM-C> And even if I could I couldn't keep them where I live now.
[02:42:52] <EM-C> So I just have to watch people catch things on YT and miss the days when I could go on long critter-hunting walks.
[02:43:27] <EM-C> I caught a black racer one time and kept it as a pet.  They're very bad tempered, but this one just lay there and let me pick it up.  Didn't even bite.  Unusual for the species.

[02:52:52] <EM-C> Most of the spiders in the house here are the long-legged cellar spiders.  I don't know why, but we've never had any common North American house spiders inside this house.
[02:53:08] <EM-C> Although they were all over the place in the houses I'd lived in before.
[02:53:38] <EM-C> Back in the early 00's we had a dog that ate them.
[02:53:52] <EM-C> She'd follow the broom along the floor and pick up any she found running away from it.
[02:54:07] <EM-C> She picked one right off the wall one time.  Funny, but I felt sorry for the spider.

[04:35:54] <Regulus> Yea

[05:13:42] <RandomNinja> there's a reason I consider Old Glory to be miles ahead of eerything
[05:13:56] <RandomNinja> that reason is ridiculous crits
[05:14:48] <wobniaR> Her default weapon is a power glove, increases melee attack speed
[05:14:58] <RandomNinja> yeah but for me
[05:15:09] <wobniaR> Keeping it is the obvious option
[05:15:41] <RandomNinja> basically useless vs. borderline gamebreaking
[05:17:48] <RandomNinja> also melee > unarmed because the extra reach is useful against Deathclaws
[05:19:17] <Hamtramck> okay yeah memory overclock definitely caps out at like 1050.
