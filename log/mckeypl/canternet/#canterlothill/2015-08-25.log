[16:54:39] <RandomNinja> no oven? madness!
[16:54:44] <Zuthal> No oven
[16:54:47] <Zuthal> no microwave

[16:55:18] <MikeM> How about bread on a stick, roasted over the electric coils?
[16:55:32] <Zuthal> That is crazy enough that it might actually work
[16:55:42] <RandomNinja> my old student corridor had 2 stoves and a microwave
[16:55:48] <RandomNinja> as in stoves with oven
[16:56:16] <MikeM> I had a roommate who heated up a hot dog with a stripped electric cord. One lead in each end, and you get a hot dog.
[16:56:31] <RandomNinja> you could also get a cast iron pot, heat it, and keep the stove running at low power
[16:56:33] <Zuthal> heh
[16:56:43] <RandomNinja> should make an acceptable pseudo-oven
[16:56:58] <Zuthal> well, utilities are all included in the rent

[16:57:06] <RandomNinja> so was mine
[16:57:11] <RandomNinja> depends on the pot :P
[16:57:17] <MikeM> That would work. Might need a trivet in the bottom of the pot.
[16:57:23] <Zuthal> so I do not have to worry at all about power draw
[16:57:23] * BerryPunch pies RandomNinja in da faise
[16:57:26] <Zuthal> also a what?
[16:57:29] <RandomNinja> would you even need that?
[16:57:35] <RandomNinja> cast iron pots are pretty thick
[16:57:42] <Zuthal> what is a trivet?
[16:57:52] <RandomNinja> at low effect the heat should be reasonably distributed
[16:57:54] <Zuthal> I would also need to acquire a cast iron pot
[16:57:55] <MikeM> The trivet is a little spacer to lift the food off the bottom of the pot.
