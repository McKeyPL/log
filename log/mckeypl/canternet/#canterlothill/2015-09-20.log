[00:56:14] <RandomNinja> yeah but >pink horse

[12:57:43] *** Braixen is now known as Hoofy
[12:58:53] <Jokerboxer> What is........ MATLAB?
[13:00:50] <Trildar> Supposedly stands for Matrix Lab. Not too sure how to describe it. I suppose you could say it's a computational engine with an accompanying language that is used mainly for data analysis.
[13:01:22] <Trildar> It has a number of different uses though, and I've yet to learn about a lot of them.
[13:02:24] <Jokerboxer> It is a format to view what does what in your computer. You pry open the guts of your OS.
[13:03:13] <Jokerboxer> Is that correct?
[13:04:00] <Trildar> Nah... don't think it does that.

[13:17:20] <CyberFoxx> MATLAB is kinda like the desktop computer version of those really expensive Texas Intruments calculators.
