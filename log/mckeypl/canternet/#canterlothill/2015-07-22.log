[04:56:33] <Sombra> You know I was talking to some guy, I think it was in either this channel or EQD, he was in new york and he got a ticket for riding his bike on the sidewalk.
[04:56:43] <Sombra> I think the ticket was for, "Public endangerment"
[04:57:05] <Sombra> Because bicycling is, as everyone knows, a sure terror to society.

[04:57:28] <Muffin_Spectacles> That reminds me when they outlawed scooters almost 15 years ago bvecause that was the big craze.
[04:57:51] <LensFlare> It rocks the foundation of society with it's two wheels and strange physics
[04:57:51] <Muffin_Spectacles> Kids were supposedly riding scooters all over the sidewalks, and several places enforced 'no scooters on sidewalks' laws.
[04:58:22] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, almost 15-18 years ag, Razor Scooters were the in thing.
[04:58:33] <Sombra> They're a real killer man.  First thing it's scooters, next thing you know you're riding bikes, or even... GASP 4-wheeling... where does the small wheeled vehicle mayhem end?!

[15:40:05] <RandomNinja> right, could you be more specific?
[15:40:19] <RandomNinja> the formula for what property?
[15:40:23] <FruitNibbler> It spirals into a flat disc while the distance between cog teeth remains equidistant
[15:41:46] <RandomNinja> yes?
[15:41:57] <RandomNinja> I'm still not sure what you're asking

[15:46:27] <RandomNinja> hi'
[15:46:56] <FruitNibbler> lololol http://imgur.com/YTeiVzu
[15:47:05] <FruitNibbler> Google search results, u so funny
[15:47:28] <RandomNinja> safesearch pls
[15:48:26] <FruitNibbler> I have it on safesearch actually
[15:48:32] <RandomNinja> ya I know
[15:49:20] <FruitNibbler> So the form I was searching is called "hafl toroid"
[15:49:24] <FruitNibbler> half*
[15:49:57] *** Zzzuthal is now known as Zuthal
[15:50:06] <FruitNibbler> But instead of having outer part rise like in toroid it then goes into a flat disc
[15:50:25] <thereallynewmop12100> Tonight is the PREMIERE of Sharknado 3!
[15:50:33] <RandomNinja> what are you looking for, exactly?
[15:50:38] <RandomNinja> surface area? volume?
[15:50:44] <FruitNibbler> So a mix of a flat circle and inner part of half toroid
[15:50:51] * RandomNinja boops Zuthal 
[15:51:15] <thereallynewmop12100> FruitNibbler: like a vinyl? 
[15:52:07] <FruitNibbler> I am looking to "paint" that surface with equidistant lines that start at the top of the half-toroid as a slight spiral and goes down winding around this shape
[15:52:51] *** Quits: DARK (DARK@Pony-5tbcdc.41m0.c54a.0e35.2a01.IP) (Quit: You're so zetta slow!)
[15:53:11] <thereallynewmop12100> What's the different between Half Toroid, CD & Vinyl?
[15:53:33] <RandomNinja> a half toroid isn't a medium for playing music
[15:53:42] <RandomNinja> and also not a flat disc
[15:54:24] <thereallynewmop12100> But a CD play music, right?
[15:54:39] <RandomNinja> well, store, but yes
[15:55:06] <thereallynewmop12100> RandomNinja: Same as Vinyls
[15:55:11] <RandomNinja> yes.
[15:57:29] <FruitNibbler> Yeah thereallynewmop12100 is correct in what I want: vynil has equidistant grooves in it that spiral on the flat surface
[15:57:33] <snitch567> RandomNinja: <3
[15:57:35] <snitch567> thereallynewmop12100: <3
[15:57:55] <FruitNibbler> But the vynil plate has only one groove, I need at least six
[15:57:59] <thereallynewmop12100> snitch567: <3
[15:58:01] <RandomNinja> I'm not really sure how to solve that
[16:00:16] <FruitNibbler> So six "spirallel" grooves on a flat disc that rise up into a half toroid in the middle till they reach the smallest diameter possible (aka when all six grooves make a simple straight cog with 6 teeths/trophs)
[16:01:13] <FruitNibbler> I don't know either: no idea how to implement the equidistant part into an equation for a spiral
[16:01:45] <RandomNinja> start from the middle, set a certain curving per line length maybe
[16:02:02] <bikey> You only need to describe one tooth, then offset the other five from the starting point
[16:02:21] <RandomNinja> good point
[16:04:14] <FruitNibbler> Hmm now I wonder if there was a vynil plate with 2 tracks on one side?
[16:04:33] <bikey> If you only need the "paths" the teeth take, you can work with a helix that starts traveling upwards, I linked you the formula for that
[16:04:43] <bikey> Yes, stereo vinyls
[16:04:44] <RandomNinja> it's definitely doable, but just seems like a stupid way to do things
[16:04:48] <RandomNinja> oh?
[16:05:15] <RandomNinja> how does that work?
[16:05:25] <bikey> The stereo vinyls?
[16:05:28] <RandomNinja> yeah
[16:05:51] <FruitNibbler> Yeah that would make sense
[16:06:06] <bikey> You have two groves that are in a 90 degree angle to each other, and a needle that's able to discern the two
[16:06:08] <FruitNibbler> How else would you make sound sereo on vynil?
[16:06:42] <Flurshy> ugh
[16:06:44] <Flurshy> serato
[16:06:51] <Flurshy> thinking all dubstep is set to 70bpm
[16:07:01] <Flurshy> I forgot to set range when I analyzed
[16:07:05] <RandomNinja> hue
[16:07:45] <bikey> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record#Stereophonic_sound
[16:12:57] <FruitNibbler> Clever way to not waste playtime
[16:13:19] <FruitNibbler> Two grooves would mean only half the playtime
[16:14:09] <bikey> Or a higher compression, or lower volume
[16:14:38] <thereallynewmop12100> Gotta go afk for a shower
[16:14:40] <bikey> All the analog tech is really crafty at doing things effectively with what they had
[16:14:44] <FruitNibbler> Since vynil is not the most durable material to have a record I wonder if there is a better alternative that lasts longer?
[16:15:26] *** Octave|Work is now known as OctaveSymphony
[16:15:33] <bikey> Vinyl is pretty durable already, and it's pretty cheap
[16:15:54] <johnsey> use a stone disc

[16:30:14] <bikey> Yeah, but remote backups, more hard drives, decent algorithms... I'm sure it's more effective than any analog medium

[18:50:46] <Snapai> RandomNinja, pasta, that's why
[18:51:09] <Snapai> Pasta > sugar rush > sugar crash a few hours later
[18:52:13] <Flurshy> pasta causes a sugar rush?
[18:52:15] <Flurshy> how?
[18:52:24] <UniteThePinkies> LOL I don't think that's what Snapai meant
[18:52:53] <wobniaR> When you break down starch it turns into essentially sugar
[18:53:02] <wobniaR> Pasta has starch
[18:53:16] <Flurshy> is that why pasta is so good despite being flavorless on its own?
[18:53:33] <wobniaR> It's not flavorless but yes it's good
[18:53:46] <Flurshy> tastes like rubber by itself >.<
[18:53:58] <UniteThePinkies> Alfredo = <3
[18:53:58] <Flurshy> anywho time for me to poof
[18:53:58] <RandomNinja> you must cook it wrong
[18:53:58] <wobniaR> You're eating bad pasta
[18:54:02] <RandomNinja> also do you even salt
[18:54:04] <wobniaR> Or undercooked
[18:54:09] <Flurshy> nah, just unseasoned
[18:54:09] <RandomNinja> or over
[18:54:18] <Flurshy> that's without butter or seasoning or anything
[18:54:21] <RandomNinja> also, basil is top tier pasta spice
[18:54:24] <UniteThePinkies> Good alfredo that is... I for one prefer Maggiano's (an upscale chain).
[18:54:38] <Flurshy> I don't discriminate
[18:54:46] <Flurshy> I'll eat pizza buffet alfredo
[18:54:52] <wobniaR> Basil is good, so is butter
[18:55:02] <wobniaR> Try pesto
[18:55:10] <Flurshy> we made tuna casserole recently >:D
[18:55:21] <wobniaR> It's like a mash of different herbs & spices
[18:55:37] <Snapai> Flurshy - sugar rushes feel different for adults. You don't get hyper, you get that kinda drugged feeling
[18:55:47] <wobniaR> Use some olive oil with that, add butter and you have god tier pasta
[18:55:53] <Flurshy> what drugged feeling?
[18:55:57] <wobniaR> Lazy
[18:55:59] <UniteThePinkies> I for one don't really get either... in fact studies show that it's mostly placebo
[18:56:14] <Snapai> And most high carb meals will cause a bunch of sugar in teh bloodstream, followed by a strong tiredness/food craving 2-3 hours later
[18:56:21] <UniteThePinkies> then again placebos typically *are* sugar so I don't know how they did the study :P
[18:56:41] <RandomNinja> like caffeine
[18:56:42] <Flurshy> I have ADHD, which changes the way food affects my energy levels
[18:57:13] <Flurshy> 'tis probably why I have no interest in drinking coffee
[18:57:23] <UniteThePinkies> Flurshy do you get the strange feeling where caffeine makes you sleepy for the first 20 minutes or so afterward?
[18:57:27] <Flurshy> other than the social pressure
[18:57:28] <RandomNinja> Snapai, so that's why I felt much weaker than I actually was
[18:57:30] <RandomNinja> ?
[18:57:38] <Flurshy> UniteThePinkies: I've tried using a 5 hour energy after an all nighter once
