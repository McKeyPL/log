[02:20:51] <Flarecobra> And as a little follow-up... if one lives in a place where it snows in the winter, would you think it ok if one put up lights, but did not turn them on, while the weather is good?

[03:02:36] <Flarecobra> On another note... what the *Buysomeapples* is wrong with some people?
[03:03:35] <pinkpearlapple> no idea
[03:03:40] <Flarecobra> This one woman, didn't state where she's from, duct-taped a chocolate lab's muzzle shut, then posted it on Facebook.
[03:03:56] <pinkpearlapple> i deal with rude and cursing people at work and i work in a toy and baby store
[03:04:50] <Flarecobra> *Nods* And yet, when it's human/human stuff, society tends to go "That sucks." and moves on
[03:05:25] <pinkpearlapple> saw someone abandoned a newborn in a manger scene in new york, theres been two major shootings here in my city. one, my sister happening to be in the same building at the time
[03:05:42] <pinkpearlapple> and thats this passed year alone
[03:06:02] <pinkpearlapple> so many gun crimes this year. its easier to hear good news than bad
[03:06:21] <wobniaR> There's rude & crazy people everywhere, and news media jumps all over anything violent or horrifying cause it gets them views
[03:07:02] <pinkpearlapple> actually read someone burried a newborn alive in a pot hole in the road before she was rescued.
[03:07:04] <ED-SKaR> More people die from Alchahol than guns 
[03:07:21] <Hamtramck> that's just because nobody's drinking guns
[03:07:22] <ED-SKaR> cancer too
[03:07:31] <wobniaR> If you go around and watch/read every news story on the internet or elsewhere you're gonna have a bad time
[03:08:05] <pinkpearlapple> ah. its THESE people.nevermind then. i dont trust news on the internet,hun. im not an idiot
[03:08:14] <Flarecobra> And then one animal abuse story crops up, and society loses it's lid.
[03:08:40] <Hamtramck> To be fair, dogs are more likable than people.
[03:08:57] <pinkpearlapple> i get news from newspapers and tv
[03:10:03] <Flarecobra> Yeah... and the news nowadays is more about entertaining the masses then being informative.
[03:10:18] <pinkpearlapple> its probably best to drop this subject before a fight breaks out

[20:54:34] <wobniaR> You can still use flash, default is ask to activate
[20:54:44] <wobniaR> Bunch of sites still haven't made html5 plugins
[20:54:48] <wobniaR> Like twitch
[20:55:39] <wobniaR> Main difference between flash and html5 is the purpose it's used for
[20:55:53] <wobniaR> Explaining it would take too long and i'm a bit busy
[20:58:20] <RandomNinja> That would explain why it sucks
[20:59:39] <wobniaR> Flash sucks because there's well-known vulnerabilities that people keep abusing and for every one that adobe patches there's 5 more
[21:01:01] <wobniaR> And they're mostly the same thing too, some sort of buffer overflow or escape possible in some variable used in actionscript that leads to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine

[21:02:15] <RandomNinja> Isn't html5 faster as well?
[21:02:41] <wobniaR> Beats me, probably
[21:02:59] <wobniaR> It's still different software, html5 is for websites and flash is an animation software
[21:03:35] <wobniaR> It's not flash itself that's an issue, it's the integration with browsers to display content over the internet
[21:04:29] <wobniaR> And people will be more inclined to discover html5 vulnerabilities once flash becomes less used
[21:04:37] <RandomNinja> True
[21:05:15] <wobniaR> But at least html5 won't be closed source and everyone won't be at the mercy of adobe to patch their software
