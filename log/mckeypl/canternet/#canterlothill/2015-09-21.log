[19:04:43] <Spectra_Borealis> I'm only in high school. Trying to decide between being in a stage performance and going to London.
[19:07:03] <RandomNinja> this might be a bit big of a choice, but

[19:07:36] <RandomNinja> flip a coin. If you see the coin and feel disappointed, you know what you really wanted
[19:08:33] <Spectra_Borealis> I know which one I want more. I want to go to London. But my auditions for the play are so late that I will have to make my decision before I even know what role I will have.
[19:09:12] <Spectra_Borealis> I know that being in the play will be great for my future, because I want to be an actor and a musician. But if I go to London... well, it may be the only chance I get.

[21:06:34] * RandomNinja pokes Inucroft[NLR] 
[21:08:00] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja less organge. More natural colours so pale browns, greens, pale black (cause black sheep)
[21:08:11] <RandomNinja> dyes?
[21:08:13] <Inucroft[NLR]> or natural white
[21:08:21] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja sometimes
[21:09:20] <Inucroft[NLR]> they used natural colours/dyes so local plants. Or simply left it undyed... I'm no expert though
[21:10:08] <RandomNinja> need to find fashion historians :P
[21:10:14] <Inucroft[NLR]> the rricher could afford blues & reds ect

[21:11:44] <Inucroft[NLR]> that's the kind of colours that likely would have been used (pending money ect)
[21:12:06] <RandomNinja> right, I think I have a decent idea of what to go for then
[21:13:25] <Inucroft[NLR]> np. Cosplay/re-enactment/acting?
[21:13:36] <RandomNinja> annual viking party
[21:14:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> oh~
[21:14:18] <Inucroft[NLR]> If i had a round sheild, I could pass off as a viking or saxon
[21:14:24] <Inucroft[NLR]> yay pleb level clothing
[21:14:30] <RandomNinja> the clothing part is surprisingly srs bsns
[21:14:53] * wobniaR applies yak hide armor to RandomNinja
[21:15:03] <RandomNinja> a fair amount of people have easily put 3 digit figures into their clothes
[21:16:31] <Inucroft[NLR]> I know...
[21:16:33] <Inucroft[NLR]> all too well
[21:18:13] <RandomNinja> drop by, we have unlimited mead :P
[21:18:21] <wobniaR> Old peasant clothing costs more than regular clothing these days
[21:18:33] <RandomNinja> supply and demand
[21:19:06] <RandomNinja> also I should get a fake Ulfbehrt
[21:19:41] <wobniaR> I'd like a nice ebony sword
[21:19:54] <RandomNinja> you need to sacrifice the soulds of your friends though
[21:19:57] <RandomNinja> souls*
[21:20:20] <wobniaR> A non-possessed one
[21:20:35] <Inucroft[NLR]> my cloths cost ~110
[21:20:39] <Inucroft[NLR]> all hand made
[21:20:46] <Inucroft[NLR]> by my own re-enactment group
[21:20:52] <RandomNinja> for how much=
[21:20:54] <RandomNinja> ?*
[21:21:05] <Inucroft[NLR]> Tunic, under tunic, hoes, braes
[21:21:12] <Inucroft[NLR]> Mind I'm over 6ft 
[21:21:18] <Inucroft[NLR]> so they need extra material
[21:21:21] <RandomNinja> that's pretty good tho
[21:21:49] <Inucroft[NLR]> aye. Mind they're getting on, i'll need a new outer tunic & pair of hoes
[21:22:31] <wobniaR> Acquire plate armor instead
[21:22:37] <wobniaR> Or some chainmail
[21:22:53] <RandomNinja> there we go, I have ordered a province flag which will be attached to my cloak
[21:23:01] <RandomNinja> that's expensive though wobniaR 
[21:23:03] <RandomNinja> also heavy
[21:23:24] <wobniaR> Yeah but it won't need replacing as oftrn as tunics
[21:23:37] <RandomNinja> depends on if you're getting hit a lot
[21:24:11] <wobniaR> That's when you go to the local blacksmith and pay them to repair your armor
[21:24:24] <RandomNinja> if your armor gets hit with a sword you need to fix or replace it
[21:24:26] <wobniaR> Because all towns have a local blacksmith right?
[21:24:32] <RandomNinja> clothes will last the rest of your life
[21:25:39] <RandomNinja> actually fairly large towns probably have some sort of metalworkers
[21:26:01] <RandomNinja> likely more delicate work though
[21:26:02] *** Joins: JockeTF (jocke@Pony-iqmf0q.priv.bahnhof.se)

[21:26:45] <Inucroft[NLR]> wobniaR plate is naff. Moreover Chainmail is victorian fiction.

[21:31:51] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja be glad round sheilds are "fairly" easy to make. Kitesheilds are curved, as such need to be bent
[21:31:58] <Inucroft[NLR]> always additional pylons
[21:32:06] <RandomNinja> yeah
[21:32:18] <RandomNinja> I'm not making weaponry though, just clothes
