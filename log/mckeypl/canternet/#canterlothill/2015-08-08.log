[15:31:46] <Flurshy> "The United Kingdoms High Court ruled today that is it illegal for someone to rip a CD and back it up with a digital copy without the copyright holders consent."
[15:31:53] <Flurshy> so now it's illegal to be a DJ in the UK
[15:32:15] <Flurshy> or a normal human being
[15:32:53] <Flurshy> I do hope they understand that something like that can't be enforced because basically anyone who has CDs -to- rip is going to rip it to their computer, itunes or not
[15:34:15] <Flurshy> oh yeah, and they also said you can't convert files from one format to another without copyright holder's consent
[15:35:29] <Cloud_Zephyr> how will they enforce that?
[15:35:41] <Flurshy> they can't
[15:35:56] <Flurshy> and moreso, a ruling like that encourages piracy rather than discouraging it
[15:35:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh yus
[15:36:15] <Flurshy> it's illegal to put music on your phone, so why pay for it anyway?
[15:36:27] <Cloud_Zephyr> exactly
[15:37:14] <Flurshy> they also say you can't back up your music to another drive or to the cloud
[15:37:37] <Cloud_Zephyr> i think i'll do that now then
[15:38:00] <Flurshy> my entire music library is on several drives
[15:38:11] <Flurshy> let's see... laptop drive, check. desktop, check. phone? check.
[15:39:31] <Cloud_Zephyr> rekt i just broke the law
[15:39:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> come get me david cameron
[15:44:33] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well here's the thing
[15:44:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> Although they make laws like that, I think there is also a caveat with those laws that enforcement responsibility lies with the copyright holders.
[15:45:16] <Sketchy_Sounds> So it's pretty much a case that those laws are simply there to allow the use of DRM.
[15:45:37] <Cloud_Zephyr> then no one will buy CD's
[15:45:42] <Flurshy> DRM is one of the worst things on this planet
[15:46:01] <Flurshy> Cloud_Zephyr: I'd buy a CD because you can do things to a CD that you can't do to DRM'd itunes
[15:46:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> music from itunes isn't DRM'd unless you download an offline copy from apple music
[15:46:55] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well that's kind of my point. The laws exist so that record companies and such can protect their music, if they so wish. But a lot of them don't really put any sort of DRM on their physical media, and there also plenty of DRM-free ways of getting hold of music.
[15:47:00] <Flurshy> "offline" copy?
[15:47:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> kinda like spotify. which is understandable
[15:47:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> but actually buying a song doesn't have drm
[15:47:49] <Flurshy> if DRM were to be put on itunes/etc copies of music AND on CDs, piracy would completely kill record companies
[15:48:14] <Flurshy> because at that point even more people would go pirate clean, unrestricted versions of tracks
[15:48:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[15:48:45] <Flurshy> and what about DJs?
[15:49:01] <Flurshy> DJs -have- to have unrestricted versions of tracks to use them with DJing software
[15:49:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> they probably didn't think of that
[15:49:39] <Sketchy_Sounds> GAH
[15:49:43] <Flurshy> I wouldn't expect beatport to start using DRM though
[15:49:48] <Sketchy_Sounds> I just saw a goddamn centipede crawling about my desk
[15:49:53] <Sketchy_Sounds> brb, letting it outside
[15:50:06] <Flurshy> Sketchy_Sounds: last week I had a scorpion squirm around under my bare foot
[15:50:21] <Sketchy_Sounds> ...OK, I've lost sight of it
[15:50:25] <Sketchy_Sounds> o_o
[15:52:33] <Sketchy_Sounds> ...I'll worry about that later. Blasted thing will probably pop up again sooner or later, or end up dead. That or it'll make itself useful by viciously killing any other household pests that might be creeping around the place.

[15:53:01] <Flurshy> better to have spiders than to have everything else
[15:53:16] <Flurshy> unless it's a brown recluse or a black widow.
[15:55:04] <Sketchy_Sounds> OK, got rid of it. Let it outside. Anyway! I was about to say that I'm pretty sure the anti-piracy laws are only there to be used against hotbeds of piracy, such as torrenting or P2P sites. Or at least, that's the spirit in which they were put together.
[15:56:15] <Sketchy_Sounds> But you then have the RIAA coming in like a senile old man yelling at clouds and telling kids to get off its lawn, threatening them with its shotgun and so forth. And sadly the laws can be and are used against individuals, which in turn just gives the music industry a bad name.

[16:05:24] <Sketchy_Sounds> Hamtramck: then you find a better vendor :p
[16:05:46] <Sketchy_Sounds> I personally have never had that issue, seeing as I just use Amazon for mine and they usually give you 320kbps CBR.
[16:06:07] <Hamtramck> I think Amazon uses whatver the publisher sends them.
[16:06:08] <Sketchy_Sounds> Or rather, you can get them in that quality IIRC.

[16:06:37] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well so long as it never goes below 192kbps I'm fine with it. I think it was 192 anyway, maybe 196? One of those.
[16:06:57] <Trildar> 192 is the common one, so that would probably be it.
[16:07:14] <miss> !t Trildar 
[16:07:15] <Sketchy_Sounds> I recently realised I can't happily listen to 128kbps any more though, because I then hear the artefacting.

[16:07:40] <Hamtramck> Artifacting gets really noticable to me at like 170kbs
[16:07:43] <Trildar> Shout Factory compresses audio to 192 kbps MP3? :P
[16:07:49] <Hamtramck> I can't really tell the diffrence between 256 and 320 kbps
[16:08:14] <Sketchy_Sounds> For stuff I really like, I tend to get it in FLAC instead if I can, but I don't do that too often seeing as the filesizes get pretty big.

[16:20:09] <Cloud_Zephyr> ah yes thats a point
[16:20:20] <Sketchy_Sounds> Tell him I said hi if you find him, though. That and he needs to work on his German :3
[16:20:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> apparently the reason my last show was rubbish was because there were 2 cons going on
[16:20:36] <Parchment_Scroll> XD will do, Sketchy!
[16:21:03] <Parchment_Scroll> Yeah, that'll kill the listener count.
[16:21:10] <Sketchy_Sounds> Background for that: he was at GalaCon, and after the con was over I was hanging out with him and the PVL crew at our hotel, along with some other con attendees.
[16:21:29] <Sketchy_Sounds> Bash tried to read out some of the stuff on the menu, and he sucked at it.
[16:21:37] <Parchment_Scroll> XD
[16:21:55] <Flurshy> how many listeners do you guys normally get?
[16:22:16] <Sketchy_Sounds> So then I was like "Let me try". Thing is, I took German as a moden language in secondary school. I proceeded to read out the stuff on the menu with near-perfect pronunciation. The two german guys with us were like "Wow, really good!".
[16:22:28] <Parchment_Scroll> :D
[16:22:35] <Sketchy_Sounds> And Bash was just like "Well... I tried, man!". XD
[16:23:34] <Sketchy_Sounds> Oh and apparently if I put on what I like to call my silly German accent I sound Bavarian.
[16:23:39] <Cloud_Zephyr> Flurshy normally about 30ish, but before some huge downtime we had about 80, and before that we had around 100

[16:24:03] <Flurshy> wow it's gone down...
[16:24:11] <Parchment_Scroll> LOL, NM, Cloud had the numbers.
[16:24:35] <Flurshy> does it also have to do with the name change?
[16:24:41] <Parchment_Scroll> TBH, part of it is that I'm not doing a good enough job promoting the site.
[16:24:48] <Sketchy_Sounds> The thing is that in order to maintain a good listener count, we'd need a working website. And the problem with that is that Bash is the one sorting that. And, well, he's currently away at cons XD

[22:53:36] <One-Trick> do you nav with a tree then?
[22:53:51] <Snapai> (to get technical: a directed acyclic graph, which is like a tree structure except you can have multiple roots and things merge and split in any way that doesn't create a cycle)

[22:54:19] <Snapai> Yup!
[22:54:26] <One-Trick> doeet
[22:54:37] <Snapai> Yeah. It's how I store "things to do" in my own head, with most of my brain cpu cycles spent reparsing the DAG. I figure if I put it in a computer, I can at any point just click a filter, and see all the leaf nodes.
[22:54:52] <Snapai> IE: the nodes that show me what, of my list, I can do "now"

[22:56:28] <Snapai> GTD annoyed me, because "next actions" were what you could do now, but other things you need to do had to get sorted into "projects" and it bothered me that often you'd have subtasks in "projects" that weren't actions OR projects...
[22:56:31] *** Quits: MikeM (wanderer@watcher.in.the.water) (Quit: bbl)
[22:56:55] <One-Trick> its all just fancy relational databases
[22:56:58] <Snapai> And even in Trello, they have an ability to add to each task card, a to-do list, which kinda' strikes me as silly since that's what Trello is most commonly used for - a fancy to-do list
[22:57:04] <One-Trick> just use sqlite!
[22:57:37] <Snapai> Same in JIRA, and in various SCRUM organizational systems. There's always tasks, then tasks that have subtasks and almost-categories
[22:58:18] <Snapai> You always run into the situation that something you had as a task now needs to be a category or project, or a project needs to be demoted to a task or subtask
[22:58:25] <One-Trick> just make everything objects and define them by their contents- thats how i wrote a MUCK, like, 20 years ago
[22:58:54] <Snapai> That's precisely what my insight was. All these things, are the same thing, they all fill in "We need to do _____"
[22:59:18] <Snapai> And as it turns out, a DAG is stupidly simple to store. You just have a table of nodes, and a table of edges/links between the nodes.
[22:59:42] *** Joins: luckyspirit (luckyspirit@pony.poni.pony)

[23:01:11] <Snapai> Got that insight from looking at how the .DOT format stores graph structures. Define nodes, then list all the edges. :p
[23:01:49] <Snapai> One-Trick, the thing is, it also allows a very wiki-like way of creating the map in the first place. You just wander aimlessly around the nodes, adding children or parent nodes as you realize em.
