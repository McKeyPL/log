[15:39:57] <RandomNinja> silly murican channels
[15:42:27] <Tactile11> Oh yeah you aren't american. Haha. I forgot. Well, ya know, we have a stereotype that says that we are ¨those dumb rude americans.¨ That's true, but only for the people in big cities, and that stereotype doesn't even aply to a lot of them. So yeah. Since I live in the country, kind of in the middle of the woods, even though I am a nice individual, I get that stereotype.
[15:42:55] <Tactile11> It hurts me feewingz.

[15:45:30] <RandomNinja> tons of good stuff at slightly higher prices tho
[15:45:44] <Tactile11> Oh yeah I understand. And hey, I never chose to be born here. God put me here, and here is where I am.

[15:52:26] <JockeTF> At least the medical people says it's allergy. :P
[15:52:36] <Tactile11> Oh they always say that.
[15:53:04] <Tactile11> Just like when the dentist messes something up and to cover it up, he says, ¨Hm... Yeah, okay...¨

[15:53:47] <RandomNinja> Tactile11, catholic?
[15:53:49] <JockeTF> Tactile11: Well, at least the medicine is helping. Kind of.
[15:54:00] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: Your welcome
[15:54:15] <Tactile11> That's good, JockeTF. And no, RandomNinja, I'm actually a Lutheran. 
[15:54:24] <JockeTF> Tactile11: Me too! :D
[15:54:25] <RandomNinja> didn't know they did wine
[15:54:42] <Tactile11> Well the catholics around here use sparkling grape juice. lol.
[15:54:50] <RandomNinja> lul
[15:55:01] <Tactile11> And hey, a holy supper is a holy supper. :P
[15:55:11] <JockeTF> Or well, just protestant here.
[15:55:20] <JockeTF> Whatever the difference is.
[15:55:44] <Tactile11> I have no clue. I just know the differences between baptist, catholic, and lutheran.
[15:57:20] <RandomNinja> wait a minute...
[15:57:32] <RandomNinja> those aren't mutally exclusive Tactile11 :P https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Catholic_Church

[15:58:02] <RandomNinja> also JockeTF Svenska Kyrkan is apparently Lutheran as well
[15:58:20] <Tactile11> Wow I have never heard of the evangelical catholic church... That's interesting
[15:58:20] <JockeTF> RandomNinja: Oh.

[15:58:40] <JockeTF> There are almost as many branches as there are Linux distributions. ;)
[16:00:11] <Tactile11> Haha. yeah I can imagine. You guys ever heard of the cfsm?
[16:00:20] <Tactile11> Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster
[16:00:27] <RandomNinja> johnsey is a devout follower
[16:00:33] <JockeTF> Nope!
[16:00:40] <Tactile11> Hahaha. You know where it originated? 
[16:00:44] <JockeTF> Oh, wait, I've heard.
[16:00:50] <JockeTF> Just Googled it.
[16:01:20] <Tactile11> Some guy invented it to prove that people will believe and worship absolutely anything they are told.
[16:01:52] <johnsey> not quite
[16:02:23] <johnsey> it was because kansas wanted to have creationism tought in school
[16:02:38] <johnsey> taught
[16:02:56] <Tactile11> That is.... weird....
[16:03:12] <Tactile11> So we teach creationism by creating spaghetti to create us?
[16:03:34] <Tactile11> Very circular.
[16:03:48] <Tactile11> I totally need to write a song about this!
[16:05:25] <Tactile11> I learn something every day! Okay I have to go soon. Thanks guys for the interesting (and not discriminating,) conversation! It is not very likely for an internet religion conversation to go so smoothly, so I need to thank you all so much. It was very interesting to me. Bye guys!
[16:05:32] <Tactile11> I learned a lot!
