[00:17:22] <EM-C> Hey.
[00:17:24] <wobniaR> Feliz naviDAD [sick drop & w0bz] run the trap

[00:18:09] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: How are you?
[00:18:18] <EM-C> Our cardiologist upped Mama's dosage of Pradaxa to get rid of that blood clot in her lung.
[00:18:20] *** Joins: Quindo (Quindo@Pony-8qt.17k.198.99.IP)
[00:18:21] <EM-C> But...
[00:18:44] <EM-C> The high dosage he gave her is exactly what put her in the hospital almost 2 years ago with heart failure.
[00:19:11] <EM-C> And after three days it started affecting her again.  She's been very short of breath and unable to do almost anything physical without panting and sweating.
[00:19:30] <EM-C> So I called the office and told the doctor and he said reduce the Pradaxa back down to 75mg.
[00:19:59] <EM-C> But, once again, this will leave her vulnerable to that blood clot and a stroke, since it hasn't been strong enough to prevent it from forming.
[00:20:11] <EM-C> She NEEDS the higher dosage, but can't take it.
[00:20:44] <EM-C> Cutting back could save her from heart failure, but is inadequate to deal with the other danger.  So it's one or the other.
[00:20:46] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Really?
[00:20:53] <EM-C> And I'm really really anxious right now.
[00:21:38] <EM-C> I just called the pharmacy and they said call the doctor again tomorrow and tell them how worried I am.
[00:21:48] <EM-C> He barely had time to talk to me earlier when he called back.
[00:21:55] <EM-C> It's just...

[02:24:27] <Conan_Royal> Lemon Zest was the only one of the Crystal 6 I liked (besides Sci Twi of course)

[02:25:09] <Conan_Royal> Eh, I found Indigo to be Rainbow Dash with a different design. Not unique enough. 
[02:25:31] <Araxnus> That was why I liked her
[02:25:49] <Araxnus> "We gonna win?!"
[02:26:11] <ricardofr-200> xD

[12:34:38] <RandomNinja> the options are basically "yes", "yes", "sarcastic yes", "yes later"
[12:34:59] <Mongoosie> As much as I enjoyed the game, I'll agree completely they made a massive mistake with it.
[12:35:08] <RandomNinja> compared to New Vegas' basically 6 different options if you have good enough skills
[12:35:53] <RandomNinja> base building is unreasonably fun though
[12:36:13] <Mongoosie> Though RPG wise? I don't really see the dumbing down much x3
[12:36:50] <RandomNinja> I mostly hate how the PC drops 50 IQ as soon as Shaun is involved in dialogue
[12:37:09] <Mongoosie> Oh god. Yeah.
[12:37:18] <RandomNinja> oh you were frozen, had your son stolen, were frozen again, woke up to it being 2 centuries later?
[12:37:26] <RandomNinja> oh obviously your son is still an infant
[12:38:45] <Mongoosie> It's annoying. I made my character into a rough tomboy but then suddenly her personality completely changes the moment shaun comes up -.-

[12:39:42] <DinkyBot>  [ Steam Community :: Yagi :: Review for Fallout 4 ]
[12:40:08] <RandomNinja> I wish there was an actual choice to say "I hate babies"
[12:40:49] <Mongoosie> It's making fun of the first time you run into piper and one of the dialog choices is literally just "Hate Newspaper" 
[12:41:00] <RandomNinja> oh right
[12:43:28] <RandomNinja> It can make sense with your background and joining the Brotherhood though
[12:44:06] <RandomNinja> stupid journalists deliberaty misinterptering everything
[12:44:18] <Mongoosie> Yeah. The dialogue choice itself makes sense 
[12:44:45] <Mongoosie> But it just comes from the fact that the choices themselves don't tell you enough about what you're gonna say 
[12:44:53] <RandomNinja> I have a mod that shows the entire dialogue, and the one that removes the PC voice
[12:44:54] <RandomNinja> it's great
[12:45:27] <Mongoosie> I'm one of the few who likes the voice...but then again I'm biased because the female voice actor voiced one of my favorite characters in another game >.> 
[12:45:44] <RandomNinja> once again female character is miles better
[12:45:57] <RandomNinja> also Mass Effect
[12:46:06] <Mongoosie> Yeah. Jack from Mass Effect x3 
[12:46:34] <RandomNinja> I meant femshep VA but yes :P
[12:47:52] <Mongoosie> I dunno. I like MaleShep's voice
[12:48:03] <RandomNinja> maleshep was good but femshep was world class
[12:48:29] <RandomNinja> Fallout 4 did have much better voive acting in general though, I'll give them that
[12:48:31] <RandomNinja> like Nick
[12:48:50] <RandomNinja> also, BUY A SWATTAH
[12:49:19] <Mongoosie> God I love that guy 
[12:49:28] <Mongoosie> Nick is probably my favorite companion as well. 
[12:49:35] <RandomNinja> don't do his quest, it's broken
[12:49:47] <RandomNinja> I like Curie
[12:49:56] <RandomNinja> Curie is best robot waifu
[12:50:20] <Mongoosie> Haven't met Curie yet. So far I've met Piper, Nick, The Druggie Chick and Codsworth 
[12:50:34] * Mongoosie runs with Codsworth the most. He's my family and he's sticking with me to the end <3
[12:50:37] *** Joins: SkyHighAway (Tom@Pony-gk4cse.threembb.co.uk)
[12:51:12] <RandomNinja> Piper is apparently super jealous
[12:51:47] <Mongoosie> I think the only one I didn't like so far was the druggie chick
[12:52:04] <Mongoosie> It felt like she was just generically evil and never had a reason behind being that way.
[12:52:10] <RandomNinja> she's less one dimensional than she seems once you get her affinity up
[12:52:21] <Mongoosie> Ah
[12:52:34] <RandomNinja> to be fair she's basically a bunch of tropes duct tape together, but still
[12:52:37] <RandomNinja> she has reasons
[12:52:49] <Mongoosie> Pretty much 
[12:53:07] <Mongoosie> I'll be sure to do her quest though.
[12:53:20] <RandomNinja> just do a ton of drugs, she likes that :P
[12:53:36] <RandomNinja> also, Hancock best character
[12:54:04] <RandomNinja> because he's pretty much a player
[12:54:24] <Mongoosie> She fell in love with me because I lockpicked a lot of stuff
[12:56:35] <RandomNinja> srsly tho
[12:57:39] <RandomNinja> becomes the mayor of a town, doesn't actually do much leading and goes off for weeks on random adventures, can be a jerk but generally sticks up for the little guy, does a bunch of drugs because why not...
