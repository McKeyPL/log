[05:04:02] <Sombra> I mean the actual animated cartoon.
[05:04:03] <Eywind> I know
[05:04:08] <Eywind> They put it in the cartoon
[05:04:15] <Sombra> Yeah I've seen the video game, it's pretty... something.
[05:04:36] <Sombra> But anyway, I watched the cartoon out of boredom expecting it to be equally bad.  I was surprised because a few times the writing was cleaver.
[05:04:41] <Sombra> And it made me laugh a time or two.

[16:07:37] <Zuthal> relativistic and n-body effects get ignored
