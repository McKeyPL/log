[04:26:37] <One-Trick> they now allow you to keep the win10 key once you upgrade, instead of needing to start at win7 and go through the process

[16:08:27] <DinkyBot> Butts and cats and make a major meme in the fandom from here
[16:08:49] <Midnight_Lilly> Indeed
[16:09:39] <RandomNinja> apparently in Battlefront most of the imperial weapons have lots of random spread and miss all the time
[16:09:44] <RandomNinja> 10/10 stormtrooper immersion
[16:10:34] <Midnight_Lilly> Basicly
[16:10:49] <Unixkitty> They are actually, I played beta, and compared to Rebel's rather precise rifles, Imperial ones felt... Counter-Strikey? Not too much though, but the spread was very visible due to lasers.
[16:10:52] <Midnight_Lilly> I allway thought they shot like half blind cave bats
[16:11:10] <RandomNinja> hey now CS guns are highly accurate if you know how to handle the recoil
[16:11:15] <Midnight_Lilly> Though you need to put it into perspective
[16:12:15] <Midnight_Lilly> Storm troops work as a unit. When you got 20 (or even five) laying fire on a position they are like a rain of last fire
[16:12:49] <Midnight_Lilly> Rebels work solo or in very small groups so they need every shot to count. Lore wise that is :p
[16:12:59] <RandomNinja> http://imgur.com/gallery/w5MHii8
[16:14:45] <Midnight_Lilly> Hmm you have a point
[16:15:08] <RandomNinja> there's also the one about the Empire intentionally letting the Death Star explode as an excuse to attack Hoth for its natural resources
[16:15:12] <RandomNinja> basically 9/11 conspiracy
[16:15:34] <Midnight_Lilly> I'm just saying the empire doesn't really need a amazing accurate weapon they can gut throw a few million of the crappy ones at you. Problem solved
[16:15:55] <RandomNinja> this is basically how the 40K Imperium works
[16:16:13] <Midnight_Lilly> Rebels.... Not so many ch they seem to be outnumbered 300 to one in the books and movies and games
[16:16:20] <Midnight_Lilly> Much*
[16:16:33] <RandomNinja> the army is poorly trained and hilariously underequipped but that doesn't really matter when there's billions of them
[16:16:52] <Midnight_Lilly> Well storm troops are extremely well trained.
[16:17:01] <RandomNinja> yes
[16:17:11] <RandomNinja> though they're not clones anymore, right?
[16:17:12] <Midnight_Lilly> The empire just format seem to care as much about there gear :/
[16:17:14] <RandomNinja> most of them
[16:17:26] <Midnight_Lilly> Doesn't seem to*
[16:18:03] <RandomNinja> the armor is supposedly really good
[16:18:29] <Midnight_Lilly> well there are some clones. But they are mainly just highly trained soldiers recruited or pressed into a army at a younge ages and brainwashed
[16:18:30] <RandomNinja> like complete protection from most smaller weapons good
[16:19:20] <Midnight_Lilly> Yeah but there weapons? They pack a punch when they hit. And can fire a area with laser fire. That all it has going for them
[16:19:54] <Midnight_Lilly> I think they should go back to the DC-17 the clone wars era troops used :p
[16:20:09] <RandomNinja> really, faking incompetence is the only realistic answer :P

[16:24:18] <RandomNinja> which one?
[16:24:20] <Midnight_Lilly> Yeah
[16:24:58] <Pony_3697> the one with storm troopers
[16:25:20] <RandomNinja> that narrows it down to about 5000
