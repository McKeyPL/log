[22:55:09] <thereallynewmop12100> Away|Vigilant_Watch: Hasbro & MLP getting sued for a font? 
[22:55:34] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Yes
[22:55:42] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Yes they are
[22:56:49] <thereallynewmop12100> Away|Vigilant_Watch: Every Brony's reaction will be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc
[22:56:49] <DinkyBot>  [ NO GOD! PLEASE NO!!! NOOOOOOOOOO - YouTube ]
[22:57:16] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Here's some of the irony about this situation
[22:57:24] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> If they use the 'Brony Knock-off' version of Generation B
[22:57:32] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> And stop using Generation B proper
[22:57:43] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> They're kosher, since Celestia Redux is public domain :P

[22:58:16] <RandomNinja> not that it'd work, I just want to see it happen
[22:58:36] <thereallynewmop12100> The Fandom is all okay for Hasbro to use Celestia Redux 
[22:58:58] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Yes. Yes they are
[22:59:06] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> And the guy who made it would totally be ok with that
[22:59:07] <RandomNinja> yeah I meant for comedy value
[22:59:37] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> RandomNinja: The guy would be like "Cease and Decist using my IP... unless you put my OTP in the show." :O

[23:00:32] <thereallynewmop12100> I hate Hasbro geting sued for that font 
[23:00:54] <RandomNinja> nothing will happen
[23:00:58] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> I just read the text of the case
[23:01:07] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Heh... Font Brothers ain't pulling any punches
[23:01:15] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> They LITERALLY want Hasbro to DELETE My Little Pony
[23:01:30] <thereallynewmop12100> Away|Vigilant_Watch: What!?!
[23:01:37] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> To quote the Filing:
[23:01:40] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> "
[23:01:53] <RandomNinja> Hasbro's lawyer army is probably 10 times the size of the entire Font Brothers company
[23:01:54] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Direct that Defendant deliver for destruction at Defendant’s expense, inter alia, all  computer files, hard drives, solid state drives, flash drives, disks, CD-ROMs, DVD’s, and all other recorded media together with all other items, including but not limited to, all products, goods, merchandise, television and film properties, and advertising materials showing the use of Plaintiff’

[23:02:41] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> For your reading pleasure
[23:03:36] <thereallynewmop12100> The Brony Fandom will don't want to tell Hasbro to remove My Little Pony
[23:03:41] <RandomNinja> I didn't think I'd be reading "monies" in a legal document
[23:04:29] <thereallynewmop12100> do you agree with me!?
[23:04:53] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Monies is an actual term tho
[23:04:55] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> And yes, thereallynewmop12100 
[23:05:06] <RandomNinja> "we're waiting in court" - Hasbro
[23:05:07] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> We'd file Briefs on Hasbro's behalf
[23:05:07] *** Joins: vi[NLR]1 (vi[NLR]@Pony-rdj90s.vie.surfer.at)
[23:05:25] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Hasbro could literally give 150K to these people and be happy with it
[23:05:28] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> I'm sure
[23:05:31] *** Quits: vi[NLR]1 (vi[NLR]@Pony-rdj90s.vie.surfer.at) (Quit: Leaving.)
[23:05:32] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Possibly even royalties
[23:05:43] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> And just be like 'Eh, it's 0.01% of our quarterlies'
[23:05:46] <RandomNinja> they are demanding a trial though
[23:06:00] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> No, they're demanding a Jury IF it goes to trial, not just a judge.
[23:06:07] <RandomNinja> ah
[23:06:11] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Hasbro can still settle out-of-court
[23:06:20] <thereallynewmop12100> Away|Vigilant_Watch: We are still bronies!
[23:06:41] <thereallynewmop12100> Since Hasbro got sued for that font
[23:07:38] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Why would Hasbro being sued affect that?
[23:07:44] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> We'd just make our own poni
[23:07:49] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> With Blackjack and Celestia Redux
[23:08:42] <RandomNinja> !t Blackjack
[23:08:43] <DinkyBot> thinks RandomNinja: Is Blackjack as cool as being Rock Bottomed through the roof then
[23:08:52] <RandomNinja> I'm not sure what that means
[23:09:18] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> Nor am I
[23:09:20] <Away|Vigilant_Watch> !t wat
[23:09:21] <DinkyBot> wat is even going on... Wait.. :)

[23:11:46] <Regulus> Tasty, tasty irony 
[23:13:14] <One-Trick> i find it hard to believe hasbro used a random font off the internet without research
[23:13:26] <One-Trick> thats, like, graphic design 101
[23:13:59] <One-Trick> theyre going to whip out a single sketch and be like "shove off, we used Illustrator"
