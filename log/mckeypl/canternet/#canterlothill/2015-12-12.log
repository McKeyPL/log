[20:40:31] <Vace> i kinda still am, just really rusty at the actual math
[20:40:45] <Lycan> mi piace molto questa canzone 
[20:40:56] <SpectraMusic> I love how the Italian theme doesn't bother translating "little ponies"
[20:41:08] <Lycan> That's because it's a title
[20:41:14] *** Joins: FN_away (FruitNi@Pony-4o6fma.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[20:41:21] <Lycan> rather than actually talking about little pony's
[20:41:24] <Vace> does it tranlate "my"
[20:41:27] <SpectraMusic> Just goes "Little ponies vivono in pace e sempre in armonia"
[20:41:33] <Vace> i guess not
[20:41:39] <SpectraMusic> yeah I guessed that Lycan 
[20:42:06] <Lycan> This is a way for those who can't understand Italian to enjoy the Italian opening
[20:42:07] <Vace> i kinda this intro theme without thinking of La Oreja De Van Gogh
[20:42:18] <Lycan> I ear you Vace
[20:42:24] <Lycan> >.>
[20:42:32] <Vace> i kinda?
[20:42:40] <Vace> "i can't listen to"
[20:42:42] <Araxnus> Lycan: Did you mispun and typo?
[20:43:16] <Lycan> pun was completely intentional :P
[20:43:20] <Araxnus> lol

[22:48:41] <OctaveSymphony> Hm, may have to try modding one of my miniguns for explosive, I gravitate towards the gatling laser though
[22:48:51] <Regulus> It's viscous 
[22:48:51] <OctaveSymphony> But then, I can slap Explosive on that to
[22:49:10] <Regulus> The rate of fire is higher on a minigun though
[22:49:41] <Toothpaste> OctaveSymphony: Let me listen to Psychlon first :P
[22:49:54] <Regulus> 15 points of explosive damage on it nearly acts like a 50% boost, AND it scales with both big guns and demolition expert
[22:50:20] <OctaveSymphony> Also, ejecting fusion cores is herpaderpy funny
[22:50:20] <Toothpaste> Then I'll see if I can find my favorite song of the metal genre-- as it seems y'all are only into metal xD
[22:50:25] <Regulus> Only thing better would be a 2 shot variant on a high speed minigun
[22:50:52] <OctaveSymphony> Have tried adding 2 shot to a few things, that particular legendary is utterly useless on a shotgun :P
[22:50:56] <Regulus> Absolute bullet hose right there
[22:51:05] <Sombra> I just learned.
[22:51:19] <Regulus> Also on a fully automatic institute shotgun lol
[22:51:24] <Sombra> That my little niece is a fan of mlp.  So I asked my sister to ask her what her favorite character is, and do you know what she told me?
[22:51:32] <Regulus> Waaaaay too much recoil

[22:51:54] <Sombra> derpy
[22:52:02] <OctaveSymphony> Well, the problem with shotguns is that it adds "one additional projectile" on a shotgun, that apparently means 1 more pellet instead of an extra round

[22:53:06] <Regulus> Oh, and the melee weapon level 5 perk is mildly bugged
[22:53:27] <OctaveSymphony> Yay new version of NMM!
[22:53:35] <OctaveSymphony> Regulus, there's a mod to fix that :D
[22:53:41] <Regulus> It displays the damage wrong on weapon cards, but deals the full 2x value in combat
[22:54:00] <OctaveSymphony> Mod also fixes the Shishkebab not getting the damage boost from that perk
[22:54:11] <OctaveSymphony> Unless Bethesda actually patched that by now
[22:54:17] <Regulus> So if you're not bugged by the incorrect values being listed, it's fine
[22:54:25] <Regulus> I think they did

[22:54:34] <Araxnus> One-Trick: I am very far behind on Once. Like S4 behind. lol. Used to watch it live on TV every night tho.
[22:54:47] <OctaveSymphony> Covenant has plenty of nice tracks
[22:54:54] <Regulus> Oh, irradiated plasma rifles are nice, Octave
[22:55:15] <Sombra> So i think she might be a brony.
[22:55:19] <Regulus> 3 major damage types on one weapon is pretty useful to have
[22:55:19] <OctaveSymphony> I just wish the Alien Blaster had a nice sight attachment
[22:55:20] <Sombra> Because how else would she know who "derpy" is?
[22:55:28] <Regulus> Yea

[22:55:52] <OctaveSymphony> Probably won't happen until the G.E.C.K comes out though
[22:56:01] <Regulus> They do call her Derpy in there
[22:56:26] <OctaveSymphony> Also, Toothpaste the guy in the video is the bands singer
[22:56:53] <Toothpaste> It's a strange video.
[22:57:14] <Regulus> Also, kneecapper automatic weapons are hilariously broken, Octave

[22:57:50] <Regulus> 10mm and pipe pistol variants are particularly nice. Pretty easy to immobilize pretty much anything.
[22:58:13] <Sombra> Over a barrel, maybe.
[22:58:15] <Sombra> I dunno
[22:58:20] <Sombra> I'd expect someone that young to sort of forget that.

[23:02:05] <Araxnus> Still my fav bumper
[23:02:06] <Spitfire> I really need a 2 shot gauss rifle...
[23:02:59] <Sombra> I really wish that minigun had a faster rate of fire.
[23:03:11] <Spitfire> Get a high speed variant
[23:03:25] <Spitfire> It boosts rof by about 100
[23:04:17] <Araxnus> lol. Am I the only one that can;t afford Fallout 4?
[23:04:27] <Araxnus> Least I got Witcher 3 tho.

[23:05:39] <Araxnus> Eywind: Donate me your FO4 :p
[23:05:39] <One-Trick> i can afford it, i just dont want to
[23:06:04] <SaultSteMarie> I just got TW3!
[23:06:07] <SaultSteMarie> Seems super neat so far.
[23:06:24] <Araxnus> Yeah. Witcher 3 is pretty epic.
[23:06:26] <SaultSteMarie> Only downside is that my GPU's kind of weak so I have to run it at 1024 x 768 which in and of itself is fine but like
[23:06:31] <SaultSteMarie> I can't stop the screen from stretching.
[23:07:39] <Spitfire> I prefer high power though. Makes my explosive minigun feel like those AC-130 miniguns. So much damage...
[23:07:42] <Araxnus> Worth getting a new PC for TW3 game. Has the best graphics I have seen in a long time.

[23:08:16] <One-Trick> i love how most of these dj desk pics have some sort of 4x4 on them
[23:08:26] <Flurshy> 4x4?
[23:08:30] <SaultSteMarie> The funny thing is it still looks great at 1024 x 768
[23:08:31] <Araxnus> Now Fallout 4s. Graphics mod is needed xD Hope that is out by the time I buy it.

[23:10:12] <Flurshy> "midi pad" seems to do the trick
[23:10:33] <One-Trick> midi pad sounds like a feminine hygene product
[23:10:37] <One-Trick> just sayin
[23:10:45] <Araxnus> So does iPad :p
[23:10:51] <One-Trick> i agree
[23:11:04] <One-Trick> though i have one, also hah
[23:11:15] <Araxnus> Lol. I know.
[23:11:22] <Flurshy> I want a midi pad
[23:11:49] <One-Trick> i love my ipad, just wish it wasnt so difficult to just, like, share a single file between two apps on the same device
