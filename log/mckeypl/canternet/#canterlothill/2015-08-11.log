[00:10:02] <comicguy4> that and a comic series i would like to see and some background ponies episodes
[00:11:19] * RandomNinja boops MikeM 
[00:11:34] <MikeM> W00t
[00:11:40] <comicguy4> or a video game bur i wonder how the movies going to be

[00:12:10] <MikeM> Awesome, of course
[00:12:23] <RandomNinja> how could they not, there are ponies
[00:12:46] <comicguy4> i hope so i heard dont know if true but the girl voice pinkie is leaving after sseasong 6

[00:14:28] <MikeM> Oh, man. Now I want to start a company and call it, "Company."
[00:15:04] <RandomNinja> so mega-corporations are ganging up into ultra-corporations
[00:15:20] <comicguy4> i hope so i know aj my favorite out the main six but i love the background ponie episode i hope we get more
[00:15:22] <RandomNinja> this doesn't sound remotely dystopian cyberpunk
[00:15:33] <MikeM> Not at all. 
[00:15:50] <MikeM> I think you have to wait until ep 200 for another bg pony special, comicguy4 
[00:16:17] <comicguy4> i know witch bites but i would love a spin off of them in the series

[00:19:14] <Hamtramck> Wasn't the Luna Dream ep pretty much a background pony ep
[00:19:29] <RandomNinja> episode 100 tho
[00:19:49] <comicguy4> i dont think so since the main ponies it was focus on i know derpy shutting the door on the main six was epic
[00:19:56] <comicguy4> best part
[00:20:20] <RandomNinja> dream episode was more of background pony cameo episode

[02:36:46] <MikeM> Con overload?
[02:36:49] <Waveform> But one of the things that was pretty awesome was the animation they played during opening/closing ceremonies.
[02:37:03] <Waveform> It should be up on YouTube soon, I think. 
[02:37:22] <Waveform> A lot of the panels were really good, too. Nice variety.

[04:30:43] <One-Trick> oh, https, right
[04:31:12] <ynoP> Thanks again
[04:31:27] <One-Trick> i think the Win10 download has an option to create a bootable flash from its archive
[04:31:41] <One-Trick> you can just specify which type of windows you have; home or pro
[04:31:49] <One-Trick> itll do the rest, then just reboot with the tumbdrive
[04:32:04] <One-Trick> once there- you can choose the recovery options just like previous windows versions
[04:32:20] * One-Trick has already done this, like, 5 times :)
[04:33:09] <ynoP> I just freaked out earlier, because I used a wonky app and it screwed up something in the registry, and then I got this weird spaz lock screen
[04:34:02] <One-Trick> if youre having login issues, i cant really help you. my days of windows admin stopped at NT4
[04:34:28] <ynoP> Lol
[04:34:29] <One-Trick> now, if it was ldap or kerberos, i could help!
[04:34:56] <One-Trick> but the steps i gave you will help you copy and/or create a backup before you let anyone mess with it or try something
[04:35:12] <One-Trick> look into how to use ROBOCOPY for windows, its built into the system
[04:35:26] <One-Trick> it will help you retain a duplicate copy of anything youre backing up
[04:36:18] <ynoP> I should probably buy an external hard drive at this point... Not sure why I don't already have 3 or 4 of them just lying around or something. Stupid.
[04:36:29] <One-Trick> theyre cheap as hell
[04:36:35] <One-Trick> 10tb for 200$
[04:36:52] <One-Trick> Sams, if you have one/membership
[04:36:56] <One-Trick> but thats been awhile
[04:37:57] <One-Trick> the best backup system i have is a small external hd that has an ethernet port- you just plug it in and configure it to your router and run the app that comes with it. boom.

[04:39:28] <One-Trick> im fairly sure logins are all handled by the windows credential manager, which is a backend for the user manager
[04:39:40] <One-Trick> i dunno how that works under the hood, i havent cared
[04:39:54] <One-Trick> i just know how to keep windows from messing up my junk
[04:40:37] <ynoP> But, if someone found a stray hard drive, extracted from someone's PC with the OS and everything on it, would they be able to get the files out?
[04:40:51] <One-Trick> this is a simple and low-fuss external which i have used: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E055H5O/ref=psdc_595048_t1_B0042Z55RM
[04:40:52] <DinkyBot>  [ Amazon.com: Western Digital My Passport Ultra 2 TB Portable Hard Drive, Black (Old Model): Computers & Accessories ]
[04:41:13] <One-Trick> you can plug it into anything and it just works
[04:41:30] <ynoP> Even a phone?
[04:41:39] <One-Trick> i could get into yer files with a 2 cent cd and 5 minutes
[04:41:50] <One-Trick> unless you use BitLocker
[04:41:55] <One-Trick> windows is not safe
[04:41:55] <Hamtramck> we use that at work!
[04:42:20] <One-Trick> if i have physical access to your laptop, i can get to almost everything of yours with minimal knowledge
[04:42:52] <ynoP> Mad hacker skillz
[04:43:01] <One-Trick> no, just use a bootcd
[04:43:11] <ynoP> Same thing
[04:43:14] <One-Trick> windows doesnt make any attempt to restrict permissions
[04:43:26] <One-Trick> you have to be proactive and do it yourself
