[04:48:16] <RandomNinja> from too much cookies
[04:48:23] <Lunatic> RIP One-Truck
[04:48:23] <wobniaR> So if it's trash I'll just drop it and never look at it again
[04:48:37] <wobniaR> Like I did with wildstar
[04:48:44] <Lunatic> wobniaR, it died rather quickly on xbone. Many bought it, few still play it
[04:48:47] <RandomNinja> also steam refund is a thing now
[04:48:56] <Lunatic> truuu
[04:49:18] <wobniaR> It got a revamp and stuff and went with no sub Lunatic, PC MMO's tend to have larger player bases
[04:49:26] <RandomNinja> ^
[04:49:27] <Lunatic> that's for true
[04:49:30] <wobniaR> Destiny is one of those exceptions
[04:49:42] <One-Trick> TROVE
[04:49:45] <Lunatic> Destiny has had so many people playing it, but not many stuck with it
[04:49:47] <RandomNinja> partly because typical MMO gameplay is butts with controllers
[04:49:47] * One-Trick flails
[04:49:55] <Lunatic> Even now, I don't really play it much
[04:50:05] <Lunatic> Destiny isn't really an MMO to me
[04:50:13] <Lunatic> I think it more of a FPSRPG
[04:50:19] <Lunatic> with multiple people
[04:50:37] <RandomNinja> from what I've heard, people played a ton of Destiny for a month or so before deciding that it actually was pretty dull
[04:50:48] <Lunatic> Accurate.
[04:50:51] <wobniaR> I'd rather play borderlands for a FPSRPG
[04:50:55] <Lunatic> It is dull. But it's still fun.
[04:51:00] <Lunatic> with friends at least
[04:51:14] <RandomNinja> Borderlands already has the small-party gameplay nailed down
[04:51:15] <wobniaR> Still need to do UVHM in pre-sequel
[04:51:26] <wobniaR> Yeah 4 person in borderlands would be sweet
[04:51:34] <wobniaR> I've been playing duo with a friend most of the time and it's great
[04:52:00] <RandomNinja> my biggest issue is the bullet sponginess reaching ridiculous levels with more players
[04:52:05] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|sleepies
[04:52:18] <wobniaR> It's okay if you play below UVHM in borderlands 2
[04:52:34] <wobniaR> And pre-sequel stuff is much less bullet spongy
[04:52:46] <RandomNinja> I was thinking about BL2 mostly
[04:52:57] <wobniaR> It's because of the slag mechanic change in UVHM in BL2
[04:53:08] <wobniaR> Multiplies enemy hp by 3x but makes slag more effective
[04:53:23] <wobniaR> Then there are enemies who are immune to slag, and bosses that slag only lasts .5 seconds on
[04:53:28] <RandomNinja> fun times
[04:53:33] <wobniaR> Who have a free 3x hp multiplier
[04:53:56] <RandomNinja> so basically slag elemental weapons are op?
[04:54:08] <wobniaR> No you don't use slag weapons cause they only have a % chance per shot to slag
[04:54:17] <RandomNinja> oh rite
[04:54:17] <Lunatic> what is UVHM?
[04:54:19] <wobniaR> Magic missile grenade is a 100% slag chance
[04:54:29] <wobniaR> And I can trait the commando turret to slag 100% on bullets
[04:54:35] <RandomNinja> ultimate vault hunter mode
[04:54:38] <Lunatic> rite
[04:54:42] <Lunatic> I am not good enough for that
[04:54:50] <wobniaR> Just need to level up enough for it
[04:55:05] <wobniaR> I can carry you if you got PC version Lunatic
[04:55:16] <Lunatic> I do
[04:55:18] <Lunatic> But not the time
[04:55:25] <RandomNinja> also, Fallout 4 news: that guy you'll definitely murder to get his sweet hat confirmed companion
[04:55:28] <Lunatic> When I go to school, my time will be free
[04:55:34] <RandomNinja> but how will I then get his hat?
[04:55:36] <wobniaR> Yeah just gimme a message on steam/twitter whenever you got time
[04:55:37] <RandomNinja> game ruined
[04:55:48] <wobniaR> Or here too
[04:55:51] <Lunatic> I will be quitting my job when I start school.
[04:56:13] <wobniaR> Not gonna do something part-time while in school or are you fully focusing on school?
[04:56:37] <Lunatic> The Army will be paying me and paying for my school, so no need to waste time for an extra 2 hundred dollars and 40 hours of my week gone
[04:56:48] <wobniaR> Good stuff
[04:56:59] <Lunatic> Plus, after 4 years, it's probably best to have school my ONLY focus at a given time for at least the first year
[04:57:03] <wobniaR> Lose werk acquire vidya game tiem
[04:57:08] <Lunatic> ^
[04:57:18] <Lunatic> And buy my own internet so I can stream
[04:57:19] <Lunatic> yay
[04:57:31] <wobniaR> Something better than comcast hopefully
[04:57:49] <Lunatic> I'd take taco bells wifi that is 2.3 miles away over the internet I currently have.
[04:58:03] <Lunatic> But I will be going with Verizon, more than likely.
[04:58:12] <Lunatic> Unless there is something else nearby that is even better.
[04:58:15] <wobniaR> Fios?
[04:58:21] <Lunatic> ye
[04:58:33] * RandomNinja nibbles 100/10 fiber
[04:58:37] <wobniaR> Yeah you can get at least the basic 50/50 package, you usually get 58/58 out of that
[04:58:53] <Lunatic> That'd be ideal.
[04:58:55] <wobniaR> You can get 75/75 too for $10 more for a few months, then it goes up
[04:59:15] <Lunatic> I will probably go with 50/50 at first and see how it works out, and if neccesary go with 75/75
[04:59:37] <RandomNinja> 50 up should be enough for pretty much anything tho
[04:59:39] <wobniaR> 50/50 works for me but I don't do heavy streaming
[04:59:56] <wobniaR> It should be enough even for 1080p streaming

[05:50:20] <Lunatic> HEY
[05:50:24] <Sombra> .My stomach tells me I didn't eat enough today.
[05:50:31] <Lunatic> wobniaR, pls.
[05:50:42] <Lunatic> I am just trying to get it to work more than anything.
[05:50:57] <wobniaR> Downloaded it a few days ago and it works for me
[05:50:57] <Lunatic> Playing would be cool for a day, or whatever, but I just want to be able to resolve the issue.
[05:51:03] <Lunatic> Seriously?
[05:51:05] <wobniaR> Now windows 8 that's another story
[05:51:05] * DerpyBot hugs her muffin and straightens her mane
[05:51:06] * DinkyBot fusses and frowns, but hugs her momma and shakes her mane out when she finishes. "Mooommmaaa! Staaaahp! Hhehe!"
[05:51:09] <Lunatic> Precisely.
[05:51:16] <Lunatic> Win8 is satan's OS
[05:51:40] <wobniaR> Hey get windows 10 now, possibly a subscription based OS in the future with forced automatic updates at the worst possible time
[05:51:55] <Lunatic> waaaat
[05:52:41] <Lunatic> Does anyone know how to play mobile games on a PC?
[05:53:33] <wobniaR> There was something google was offering for android but it was limited in what it could do
[05:53:51] <wobniaR> iOS I have no idea, probably something OSX based
[05:54:47] <Lunatic> I am trying to play this game I have become addicted to but on PC

[06:17:56] <Snapai> I just realized that Steven Universe is how they should write Spike.
[06:18:17] <Hamtramck> Spike should be black chick that's two lesbians?
[06:18:22] <Snapai> No

[06:19:05] <DinkyBot> Snapai: That IS cute. Love it :)
[06:19:06] <Snapai> I've only seen a dozen or so episodes so far
[06:19:06] <Hamtramck> Snapai: ... whoopsies.
[06:19:08] <Lunatic> pls
[06:19:15] <Hamtramck> I'm on episode 8
[06:22:07] <Snapai> But if you think about it - Steven's a kid with abilities in his own right, who mostly just tags along with a bunch of older women who go out saving the world, but wants to be awesome AND a kid at the same time.
[06:22:13] <wobniaR> It's not that Spike isn't written "properly", it's the inconsistency
[06:22:29] <Snapai> It's kinda' the same way with Spike.
[06:22:49] <wobniaR> One episode he's the voice of reason over everyone else, the next he's a goofball kid 
[06:23:01] <Lunatic> There is too much of spike being the love struck butthole that he is
[06:23:04] <Snapai> Yeah. But it works for Steven. XD
[06:23:28] <wobniaR> I haven't watched too much steven universe so I don't know exactly how they play on that
[06:28:04] <Lunatic> I haven't seen anything but vines of Steven Universe
[06:28:34] <Lunatic> I've also read that the Steven Universe fandom "belongs" to the LGBT community, and that they are taking back MLP next.
[06:28:37] <Lunatic> I kek'd
[06:28:39] <wobniaR> I've seen a few episodes on cartoon network and a few people I follow on tumblr constantly reblog steven universe stuff

[06:29:55] <Lunatic> What other show can you compare it to?
[06:29:56] <Sombra> What if I end up watching the whole series in one go, and then I just sort of sit with it for a while, and then it slowly grows on me, and then I become a fan?
[06:30:03] <Sombra> That's how I got into mlp...
[06:30:05] <wobniaR> They were pretty good, it's above average

[06:36:40] <Snapai> Steven Universe is nice because the stories are very short
[06:36:55] <Snapai> It's 11 minute episodes, with full open/end credits
[06:37:17] <wobniaR> Yeah adventure time does that too, I don't like it
[06:37:20] <Snapai> So it's bitesize.
[06:37:33] <wobniaR> I'm too used to the half hour shows
[06:37:41] <Snapai> Which are 22 minute
[06:37:49] <wobniaR> Yeah 
[06:37:56] <wobniaR> I need muh gak commercials inbetween
[06:37:59] <Snapai> I'd like to see a cartoon successfully pull off 44
[06:38:12] <wobniaR> EQG is just a glorified extended episode
[06:38:13] <Snapai> All Star Trek episodes use the 44 minute format
[06:38:20] <wobniaR> And that's like an hour and 10
[06:38:39] <Shadow_Soul[NLR]> Lunatic pulled a Shadow and didn't log in for a long time? lol

[21:58:54] <Lycan[LDB]live> :(
[21:59:03] <miss> Stay
[21:59:24] <Limeskittle> Does anypony know a good mlp episode to start someone on who is into science and comedy?
[21:59:27] <FritzyBeat> XP
[21:59:31] <FritzyBeat> Spectraaaaaaaa
[21:59:42] <Damuchi99> good show today Lycan[LDB]live and FritzyBeat 
[21:59:46] <FritzyBeat> Limeskittle: not Feeling Pinkie Keen XDDDD
[21:59:48] <ponyshouldponypony> What is this place?
[21:59:55] <FritzyBeat> I love that episode tho *ded*
[21:59:56] <Lycan[LDB]live> What are you XD
[22:00:07] <StandingLeaf> Filled with so many wonders?
[22:00:07] <miss> Limeskittle, What about Season 1 ep1+ep2 It ends with a cliffhanger
[22:00:10] <Trildar> wut is this show even

[22:00:31] <Limeskittle> Hmm maybe but its a bit too rushed.
[22:00:51] <Limeskittle> How about just one episode to start someone on?
[22:01:34] <Lycan[LDB]live> Limeskittle, I would recommend S1E1+2... the reason is, because the clliffhanger on ep 1 keeps people watching
[22:01:43] <FritzyBeat> Tanks for the Memories? Sleepless in Ponyville?
[22:01:47] <SpectraMusic> And it introduces the characters nicely
[22:01:49] <Lycan[LDB]live> OR... Sonic Rainboom is another one
[22:01:55] <FritzyBeat> eps 1 & 2 are great tho'

[22:06:59] <FritzyBeat> hmmm
[22:07:06] <Hamtramck> just because someone is into sciene doesn't mean they can't into other things
[22:07:49] <SpectraMusic> Testing, Testing, 123 kinda comes to mind because learning

[22:08:20] <Lycan> Hey there Bunnypony
[22:08:22] <Hamtramck> That'll totally make sense if you've never seen the rest of the series
[22:08:27] <RandomNinja> ^
[22:08:30] <Lycan> Hamtramck, episode 100 is not a good idea
[22:08:35] <Hamtramck> Science is the opposite of comedy I don't think your friend exists
[22:08:40] <RandomNinja> pls
[22:08:47] <Lycan> pffft...
[22:08:51] <RandomNinja> there's tons of science jokes
[22:08:52] <Lycan> Science IS comedy
[22:08:52] <Hamtramck> also if your friend DID exist why would you be on the internet insted of watchin' movies or hanging out eating parks in the ice cream with them HM?
[22:09:31] <FritzyBeat> there are so many science jokes
[22:09:59] <SpectraMusic> ...
[22:10:23] <StandingLeaf> I would suggest Feeling Pinkie Keen
[22:10:48] <miss> tell me one RandomNinja 
[22:10:55] <SpectraMusic> hmm, perhaps not for a scientist :L
[22:11:06] <SpectraMusic> or "person who likes science"
