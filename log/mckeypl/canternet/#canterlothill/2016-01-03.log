[03:41:16] * RandomNinja pokes Regulus 
[03:41:29] <Regulus> Hm?
[03:41:39] <RandomNinja> what happens if you visit the Railroad early?
[03:41:57] <Regulus> How early?
[03:42:11] <RandomNinja> before you're sent there by anyone
[03:42:12] <Regulus> Like, before main quest forces you to?
[03:42:18] <Regulus> Well
[03:42:21] <RandomNinja> say right out of 111
[03:42:43] <Regulus> Depending on what you've done depends on what Deacon knows
[03:43:19] *** Quits: corkfuse (corkfuse@corkfuse) (Connection closed)
[03:43:29] <Regulus> As far as I can tell, as long as you've helped Preston they'll take you.
[03:43:58] <Regulus> Otherwise they might just know you just left the vault
[03:44:23] <RandomNinja> yeah I was thinking mostly about dat sweet ballistic weave
[03:44:30] <Regulus> lol
[03:44:44] <RandomNinja> srsly that stuff is op
[03:44:55] <Regulus> I never used it
[03:45:23] <RandomNinja> +120/120 damage/energy resistance on clothes that go under armor
[03:45:38] <Regulus> wow
[03:45:49] <Regulus> Kinda sad I never got any 
[03:46:02] <RandomNinja> did you destroy them?
[03:46:07] <Regulus> No
[03:46:30] <Regulus> You get it from Jackpot missions, ya?
[03:46:53] <RandomNinja> yes
[03:47:07] <RandomNinja> it unlocks after 1 or 2 but is unmarked
[03:47:18] <Regulus> Those are Act II exclusive. 
[03:47:45] <Regulus> Like, Prydwyn has to be at the airport to get those.

[03:48:00] <RandomNinja> butts
[03:48:21] <RandomNinja> well at least you can fast forward to Fort Hagen
[03:48:34] <Regulus> How? 
[03:48:41] <RandomNinja> just go there and enter
[03:48:48] <Regulus> He's not there
[03:48:51] <RandomNinja> what
[03:48:53] <RandomNinja> bethesda pls
[03:49:00] <Regulus> Not until that quest is active
[03:49:14] <RandomNinja> well that's dumb
[03:49:24] <Regulus> I've had fetch quests there before that main quest
[03:49:34] <Regulus> The elevator is boarded up
[03:50:31] <Regulus> You need Nick to get the quest. You /might/ be able to bypass Preston
[03:50:49] <RandomNinja> Unixkitty did that iirc
[03:50:53] <Regulus> I haven't tested it
[03:51:26] <Regulus> That's about the only quest you can skip
[03:51:51] <RandomNinja> stay out of Concord = no more raiders somehow kidnapping people from my incredibly overdefended settlements
[03:51:56] <Regulus> Everything else is essential 
[03:52:57] <Regulus> I need to test if you can nuke Concord from the Red Rocket 
[03:53:41] <RandomNinja> I don't think you have range
[03:54:41] <Regulus> I know you get people rendered in Sanctuary, and from a non-elevated platform I can hit the edges of Concord
[03:55:36] <Regulus> So, from max height I should be able to nuke Concord, though there will be no enemies to hit since they're not rendered.
[03:56:59] * RandomNinja nukes Regulus

[03:58:49] <RandomNinja> hopefully CK releases soon and modders will start fixing the game

[03:59:23] <RandomNinja> pls
[04:00:31] <Regulus> Needs a mod that adds buggy multiplayer
[04:00:38] <RandomNinja> Skyrim has that
[04:00:52] <RandomNinja> expect relatively quick ports
[04:00:56] <Regulus> Yes, but think of the possibilities
[04:01:48] <Regulus> Retaking the castle with a party of 8 fat man armed people, plus their companions
[04:01:51] <RandomNinja> finally some use for those healing guns
[04:02:12] <RandomNinja> 10 end tank + minigun healer
[04:02:29] <SaultSteMarie> man i was playing this amazing Skyrim mod recently
[04:02:35] <SaultSteMarie> Like it makes everything slavic themed
[04:02:40] <SaultSteMarie> and you get to play as this white haired guy
[04:02:44] <Regulus> The army of Curies will be thunderous in their disapproval of your looting of everything. 
[04:03:03] <RandomNinja> she doesn't really mind tho
[04:03:32] <Regulus> Lootable objects will have to be localized to each player so crafting isn't impossible due to scarce resources
[04:03:33] <SaultSteMarie> Man Ultima 7 had NPC companions complaining about you stealing stuff back in
[04:03:33] <RandomNinja> but yes, deploy the waifu brigade
[04:03:34] <SaultSteMarie> idk
[04:03:36] <SaultSteMarie> 94?
[04:03:45] <SaultSteMarie> It's good to see that Bethesda's finally up to 1994 standards
[04:04:45] <Regulus> Or, you could just have 8 Dogmeats.

[04:05:55] <SaultSteMarie> my furry fantasies are realized
[04:06:02] <Regulus> Yus
[04:06:14] <RandomNinja> pretty sure there's already a mod that turns everyone into horrifying anthro ponies
[04:06:18] <RandomNinja> or 5
[04:06:46] <Regulus> Turn everyone into Kahjit
[04:06:59] <Regulus> Yus

[04:07:43] <RandomNinja> wait....
[04:08:15] <Regulus> Hm?
[04:08:18] <SaultSteMarie> i want a mod that replaces everyone's heads with entire ponies
[04:08:33] <SaultSteMarie> humans with whole ponies for heads

[04:17:27] <RandomNinja> also there's only 1 target if you do it right
[04:17:49] <thereallynewmop12100> Regulus: Is it a sparkle dog mod is a weird mod? 
[04:18:04] <Regulus> RandomNinja, oh, I know
[04:18:14] <Regulus> That's how I did it last time
[04:18:22] <Regulus> Hence why I'm waiting

[23:49:05] <RandomNinja> the solution is crows, they're smart enough to not burn the house down by accident
[23:49:26] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> i have a pet ox
[23:49:27] <RandomNinja> also slightly less likely than dogs to steal the pizza
[23:49:49] <Eywind> well the crows won't be able to eat the entire pizza
[23:49:53] <RandomNinja> that too
[23:49:54] <Eywind> unless you get a whole murder of them
[23:50:09] <RandomNinja> !t murder
