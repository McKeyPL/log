[03:02:51] <Hamtramck> What dogfood does your vet rcommend?
[03:03:18] <MikeM> Well, Ol' Roy is Walmart brand.
[03:03:20] <PinkieShy> Hamtramck i never asked the vet that lol
[03:03:39] <PinkieShy> MikeM should it be safe tho like it won't kill or make him sick?
[03:03:47] <MikeM> Myself, I'm ok with GreatValue peas, but I'm not sure what's in their dog food.

[03:04:05] <Hamtramck> I've heard that grocery story catfood is really, really bad for cats.
[03:04:08] <Flurshy> I'm not sure how my tastes compare to those of your dog though
[03:04:22] <Hamtramck> I think dogs are more sturdy in that regard.

[03:04:36] <MikeM> I'm with Hamtramck on this. Ask your vet. And it's probably going to be expensive.
[03:04:40] <Hamtramck> Dogs don't care about the flavor.
[03:04:49] <Hamtramck> Mike, not really expensive
[03:04:59] <Hamtramck> Just not as cheap as garbage Walmart stuff.
[03:06:22] <Hamtramck> That being said, Ol Roy doesn't sound, uh
[03:06:24] <Hamtramck> trustworthy.
[03:06:30] <PinkieShy> Hamtramck should the 20LBS bag i bought be safe tho? 
[03:06:39] <Hamtramck> That probably won't do longterm damage
[03:06:43] <Flurshy> I did try this yummy dog biscuit though
[03:06:49] <Flurshy> it was actually quite delicious
[03:06:56] <MikeM> I fed my dogs Ol Roy for a long time, and they didn't die from it.
[03:06:59] <Flurshy> (Yes I checked the ingredients, am not stupid)

[03:09:44] <Flurshy> actually
[03:09:52] <Flurshy> you can die from eating nothing but mcdonalds
[03:10:17] <MikeM> At least sue them before you die for making you fat and ded.

[03:15:22] <MikeM> Why switch?
[03:15:27] <Hamtramck> "Moist and Meaty" doesn't sound healthy.
[03:15:42] <Hamtramck> Wet dog foods usually have higher fat and are worse for their teeth.
[03:15:52] <PinkieShy> MikeM I wanted to see if he likes this one better
[03:15:59] <Hamtramck> Pinkie dogs will eat anything.
