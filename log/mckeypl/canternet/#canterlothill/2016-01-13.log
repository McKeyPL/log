[20:01:35] <RandomNinja> sprays don't really work well on porous surfaces
[20:01:50] <RandomNinja> you pretty much have to soak them for extended periods
[20:02:28] <wobniaR> What about some sort of coating?

[20:02:45] <RandomNinja> probably your best bet
[20:03:21] <RandomNinja> the problem with bathrooms is high temperature and humidity
[20:03:57] <RandomNinja> that's basically heaven for mold

[20:05:13] <wobniaR> Jet fuel can't melt mold confirmed?
[20:06:22] <RandomNinja> what if the mold is located on steel beams?
[20:10:01] <JockeTF> RandomNinja: In this case it's probably a leaking pipe.

[22:53:25] <Cocoaway> I'd rather ride the youth in Asia rollercoaster
[22:53:42] <RandomNinja> I don't know, dying from a rollercoaster (except for crashes) seems like a top 10 way to go out

[22:54:15] <Cocoaway> I've had g force blackout, it probably wouldn't be painful or anything, so I guess
[22:54:44] <RandomNinja> you go directly from awesome to passed out
[22:55:22] <Cocoaway> yep, guess it's better than a lot of other options
[22:56:00] <RandomNinja> did you read the article in its entirety though?
[22:56:04] <RandomNinja> it's kinda hilarious
[22:56:22] <RandomNinja> "Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers."
[22:56:23] <Cocoaway> I skimmed it, mostly checked the practical functions of the design
[22:56:28] <Cocoaway> yep
[22:56:39] <Cocoaway> saw that part x3
[22:58:13] <RandomNinja> that's how I plan to die
[22:58:23] <RandomNinja> not necessarily a rollercoaster, but some dramatic and awesome fashion
[22:59:00] <Regulus> RandomNinja, halp. I got addicted to another web comic
