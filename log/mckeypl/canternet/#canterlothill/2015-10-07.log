[01:26:25] <wobniaR> As in, free services
[01:26:30] <MikeM> One thing I've never understood is why dental ins. is separate from health ins.
[01:26:41] <MikeM> Teeth are part of health.
[01:26:43] <RandomNinja> this counts as cosmetic though
[01:26:53] <RandomNinja> as it's not causing me any discomfort
[01:27:01] <Hamtramck> I think dentists get paid differently?
[01:27:04] <RandomNinja> so I'm not sure how insurance works
[01:27:19] <Hamtramck> Like in particular, doctor fees go to more than just the doctor.
[01:27:31] <Hamtramck> Whereas with the dentist THINK it's just the dentist.

[01:29:00] <Hamtramck> In retrospect I think my orthodontist was a nut.
[01:29:14] <Hamtramck> LIke he kind of held my dental records hostage until 2008
[01:29:30] <Hamtramck> And I didn't really realize this until after the fact.

[21:46:02] <miss> BF3_Pony[NLR]: maybe a site that is specialized in that kind?
[21:46:23] <BF3_Pony[NLR]> someone told me a Ls3 is a direct bolt in swap
[21:47:18] <BF3_Pony[NLR]> but 6,000$ just for a motor not including a trans is a bit steep
[21:47:57] * BF3_Pony[NLR] thats more than the car...
[21:48:23] <miss> BF3_Pony[NLR]: those things aren't cheap i believe, i don't know nothing about restauration or tuning. But i really like cars.
