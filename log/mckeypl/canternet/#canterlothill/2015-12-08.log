[04:42:46] <Luna_Jax> see?
[04:42:59] <Sombra> I think the whole, war vs sombra, or chrysalis thingie in the finale would have been a cool set up for fallout equestria.
[04:43:55] <Regulus> Maybe the Flim Flam bros one is more in line
[04:44:09] <Luna_Jax> I'm testing a new IRC client, try pinging me, if you please.
[04:44:35] <Sombra> Ah maybe.
[04:44:39] <Regulus> The war in Fallout is due to resource scarcity due to corporate overuse
[04:44:59] <Sombra> But that could be easily adapted in equestria via the war with sombra.
[04:45:26] <Regulus> Consume, consume, consume, realize there's not enough left for everyone, nuke the world
[04:46:01] <Sombra> Which is really wierd considering that they were using nuclear power...
[04:46:33] <Regulus> Yes, but there's only so much uranium 
[04:46:51] <Regulus> And they were overusing other resources too
[04:47:09] <Regulus> Plastics, metals, etc
[04:47:44] <Sombra> I dunno man, the wasteland doesn't really suggest that.
[04:47:57] <Eywind> Luna_Jax
[04:47:58] <Eywind> sorry
[04:48:07] <Sombra> Also there's thorium, and considering the amount of power you'd have to use to use up ALL the uranium... I mean, it's ridiculous.

[04:50:18] <Sombra> It doesn't really do that great of a job.
[04:50:43] <Sombra> Especially of explaining how wood is around 200 years later, without being worn by natural disasters.
[04:51:13] <Sombra> Or why there's supposedly SO MUCH excess in this world, but there's some houses that are standing perfectly fine, some a bit torn down, followed by vast expanses of nothing.
[04:52:43] *** Joins: KooK (Magnus__@Pony-b30g75.client.mchsi.com)
[04:54:25] <Luna_Jax> So, if you use a client, do you get kicked for inactivity still?
[04:54:51] <Regulus> Well, trees are normal, but you exit the vault in October, so leaves would already be off
[04:55:21] <Regulus> Other buildings were probably just well built
[04:55:44] <Sombra> But why would there be tree's around? And what I mean is, there's no vast expanses of buildings and houses.  If you think about it, having small suburban style houses that close to the city would be inneficient.
[04:56:20] <Sombra> They shouldn't have suburb houses until several miles outside of the city.  If you overlay the fallout 4 map over actual massachusettes, most of it is covered in heavily urban area.
[04:57:12] <Regulus> Remember: this is a current world AU based in a 1950's styled US
[04:57:40] <Regulus> Smaller suburbs, bigger cars, more conservative fasion
[04:58:01] <Snap_Shot> Luna_Jax no. I use a client and never leave
[04:58:20] <Luna_Jax> Sweet! 
[04:58:34] <Regulus> Clients are nice 
[04:58:45] <Sombra> So if everything is smaller (presumably also the population) how are they able to consume so much?
[04:58:57] <Regulus> Lots of customizability
[04:58:59] <Luna_Jax> indeed
[05:00:01] <Regulus> Sombra, think of it like The Capitol in the hunger games. Everything is disposable, nothing is reused, everything is built for style, not efficiency 
[05:00:02] <Sombra> There's nothing to suggest people were vastly overweight, and people can only consume so much.  If you look at the regularly used products, there's nothing to suggest that they were poorly made, IE easily disposable for newer products, thus would contribute to an overuse of materials.
[05:01:17] <Sombra> furniture is still in tact, as well as some appliances, cars, food is long lasting, robots, computers, even weapons.
[05:01:34] <Regulus> Disposable does not imply cheap
[05:01:43] <Regulus> Or poorly made
[05:01:52] <Regulus> That's a recent development 
[05:02:14] <Regulus> In the 50s, disposable things weren't cheaply made
[05:02:35] <Regulus> Solid steel cans, not thin aluminum or tin
[05:02:50] <Sombra> So if stuff lasts a long time, how would people burn through it?
[05:03:02] <Regulus> Single use items
[05:03:27] <Sombra> Single use items that are still around? Where is the garbage dumps and landfills full off this MASSIVE amounts of stuff that's burned through so fast?
[05:03:27] <Regulus> TV dinner trays. Fusion cores.
[05:03:48] <Regulus> You're thinking too much about it, Sombra.

[05:04:26] <Sombra> I can acknowledge that it's not realistic while still enjoying it.
[05:04:36] <Sombra> Skyrim has magic in it, that's fun.
[05:04:41] <Regulus> The devs aren't going to include every single small detail to create continuity for continuity's sake
[05:04:50] <Regulus> It would be impracticable. 
[05:05:33] <Sombra> Let's just all acknowledge that in a world of nuclear power, such a future wouldn't be possible.
[05:05:39] <Sombra> But it's okay to play it out for fun anyway.
[05:05:50] <Regulus> >.<
[05:06:04] <Regulus> You're severly missing the point of the AU
[05:06:28] <Sombra> Australia?
[05:06:43] *** FN_away is now known as FN

[05:07:48] <Regulus> The Fallout world is wasteful and enjoys it's overindulgence.
[05:08:29] <Sombra> Why go to war then?
[05:08:41] <Regulus> Over resources
[05:09:08] <Regulus> That's why the war happened
[05:10:37] <Sombra> I dunno man, from what little I know of human history, I just don't see it.
[05:11:22] <Regulus> Again, you're overthinking things
[05:11:40] <Sombra> From both fear of anihiliation, and the abundance of trade, war, to a a degree becomes obsolete.
[05:11:58] <Sombra> War uses more resources than it would take just to trade with nations containing those resources.
[05:12:19] <Sombra> Also, why would anyone want to risk going to war with a nation that has nuclear powers?
[05:12:32] <Regulus> The point of the AU they established in Fallout is that the history there IS NOT OUR CURRENT HISTORY but is different and because of that trying to compare it to our history is pointless
[05:13:35] *** Joins: ynoP (BackwardsPo@Pony-759snc.res.rr.com)
[05:13:44] <Sombra> It's not a comparison of our history, it's a comparison of human history.  To my understanding, fallout history is identical to ours prior to the 1950's, correct?
[05:14:14] <Regulus> Perhaps. They never say anything for or against that.
[05:14:55] <Sombra> So you can make reasonable asumptions based on the repitition of human history.
[05:15:10] <Sombra> I can't remember who said this but, "It is good that war is so terrible, least we become fond of it"
[05:15:11] <ynoP> I swear, this happens to me every time I use Castle Learning for anything: http://imgur.com/a/Vew5t
[05:15:35] <SaultSteMarie> guh
[05:15:42] <Sombra> That should hold true to the fallout universe, being that they are... just human beings.  The more powerful, and great the weapons of war become, the much more tenative people would be to use them.
[05:15:43] <Regulus> But in 120 years of "new" history, things may change. And again, it's fiction. If you go looking to poke holes in it, you'll most certainly succeed in doing so, but also in ruining your enjoyment of it.
[05:15:45] <SaultSteMarie> Fallout wasn't really meant to be taken that seriously.
[05:16:03] <Sombra> But as I had said, I can still enjoy it, knowing that it's fictional.
[05:16:24] <Sombra> Or, I can still enjoy it knowing that it is a different divergence.
[05:16:38] <Regulus> You seem to forget the number of times during the cold war the US and the USSR almost nuked the world.
[05:17:08] <Sombra> All of which happened to either faulty electronic systems, or poor communications.
[05:17:08] <Regulus> A person is smart. People are stupid, panicky creatures.
[05:17:24] <Regulus> Or people who desired war.
[05:17:45] <Sombra> Fundamentally nothing would have happened (except by acident) because neither the US or the USSR wanted to be anihiliated.
[05:17:47] <SaultSteMarie> also fallout's always been kind of zany and not about serious worldbuilding
[05:17:48] <Regulus> War is good for business. 
[05:18:14] <Regulus> Gaps in world building are good
[05:18:41] <Regulus> That's where innovation and future narrative can grow from.
[05:18:45] <Sombra> I feel it's important to note that the universe is fictional though, least people somehow believe that the development of nuclear power is somehow related to the fall of humanity.
[05:19:17] <ynoP> Oh, so Fallout's the subject here
[05:19:32] <SaultSteMarie> fallout's pretty much a pastiche of disjointed popculture references
[05:19:47] <Sombra> Which is fine, as long as it's fun, and the story is engaging.
[05:19:50] <Regulus> Sombra, nuclear war is not rational. It is entirely logicless, and some people don't care.
[05:20:24] <SaultSteMarie> http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/9/93/Federation_FO2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090809000432 i mean
[05:21:42] <Sombra> In this instance, making a fun game is much more important that making a fully realistic story.  Plasma rifles, laser rifles and microfusion reactors and all that.  whatever they want to do is fictional is fine, just make sure it's fun and enjoyable as a video game.
[05:21:55] <Sombra> And truth be told, I enjoy picking apart stories.
[05:22:26] <Sombra> I can do that, and then have fun playing the game, because the idea of world exploring long dead places is a very entertaining one.

[21:59:15] <Cloud_Zephyr> windows optional updates have attempted to apply windows 10 spyware to me before. so iâ€™m always cautious
[21:59:45] <Cloud_Zephyr> unless microsoft is super evil important updates are fine. (and canâ€™t be bothered to read the changeling)
[21:59:52] <Cloud_Zephyr> change log*
[22:00:04] <wobniaR> Just so you know, metrics without consent is annoying but not considered spyware
[22:00:41] <wobniaR> And microsoft has windows remoting home on every OS usually returning some sort of metrics, this is before 10
[22:00:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> tru, but should ask for consent
[22:01:21] <wobniaR> What makes windows 10 such a big deal is that the install default has all the metrics options on
[22:01:54] <wobniaR> Which again is annoying, but they aren't scanning your hard disk for your secret fanfics or passwords
