[10:08:37] <RandomNinja> http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20140421.png
[10:08:45] <RandomNinja> nah that would be man-skirts
[10:08:54] <RandomNinja> dresses are full-body clothing
[10:09:45] <LightSpeed> well not always. some dresses are from the waste down
[10:10:11] *** Joins: Pi (Mibbit@Pony-a5j.1vd.53.122.IP)
[10:10:15] <LightSpeed> they cover the length of your legs tho where skirts only cover part way down
[10:10:32] <RandomNinja> those are just long skirts
[10:11:01] <LightSpeed> i've heard them called dresses tho :/
[10:11:09] <RandomNinja> "A dress (also known as a frock or a gown) is a garment consisting of a skirt with an attached bodice" - wikipedia
[10:11:28] <LightSpeed> i've been lied to my whole life v.v
[10:11:40] <RandomNinja> your whole life is a lie
[10:12:37] <LightSpeed> no its not XD
[10:13:08] <LightSpeed> i just always thought that a long skirt was a dress. doesn't really impact my life that much
