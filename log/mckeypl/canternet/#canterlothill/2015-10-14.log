[01:59:00] <thereallynewmop12100_> Regulus: I am watching it after Fresh off the Boat
[01:59:06] <Regulus> I've lost track of time
[01:59:09] <RandomNinja> most parts that aren't directly related to the Zoom plot is pretty meh
[01:59:11] * Regulus flails 
[01:59:19] <RandomNinja> actually it's wednesday
[01:59:25] * RandomNinja violently timezones
[02:00:04] <MikeM> Sounds like a movie night, Hamtramck 
[02:00:33] <Hamtramck> Yeah I can use this to get out of going to Team Dinner with coworkers I don't like tomorrow
[02:00:34] <One-Trick> amazon prime is loving that i got sick
[02:00:40] * RandomNinja confuses Regulus further
[02:01:03] <Regulus> nuuuu 
[02:02:39] <RandomNinja> mm, light buzz
[02:02:49] <RandomNinja> the best stage of drunkness

[02:04:57] <DinkyBot> Stop trying to hit the Ballmer Peak, and failing that, nothing happened.
[02:05:23] <MikeM> Lies. Everything happens at the Ballmer Peak.
[02:05:52] <Hamtramck> Man that reminds me, I got the most hilarious propaganda from corporate today
[02:05:57] <RandomNinja> yeah but you won't intentionally hit it

[02:06:47] <RandomNinja> nuuu this shirt is showing signs of elbow tear
[02:06:48] <One-Trick> but, time for gentoos
[02:06:48] <Eywind> better or worse than a celebration party with popcorn and a celebration countdown for an entire month about "EOFP" - Every Other Friday Pay, something that messes with the budgeting and life of the people who are affected by it (lowest earners, the hourly pay)
[02:07:02] <Hamtramck> rn I had a bunch of shirts that did that. Desks in the old office chewed them up
[02:07:16] <RandomNinja> it's only the right one though
[02:07:19] <MikeM> Most people could use more romance in their life.
[02:07:29] <RandomNinja> probably due to pen writing
[02:08:00] <One-Trick> whats a pen?
[02:08:09] <MikeM> That laughing "Manooolooo...hold on, I'm coming"
[02:08:27] <One-Trick> Quake has met the woman that voiced her
[02:09:09] <One-Trick> no, wait, he met the chick that voices La Muerte

[02:10:18] <One-Trick> also, another reason why channing tatum annoys me
[02:10:44] <MikeM> Besides being an uber-mensch when it comes to physical appearance?
[02:11:09] <One-Trick> his roles always seem to make me like him less
[02:12:18] <RandomNinja> One-Trick I do math, computers are impractical

[21:49:46] <thereallynewmop12100> Hello, EM-C 
[21:50:02] <EM-C> Hey thereallynewmop12100.
[21:50:02] <Inucroft[NLR]> Cloud_Zephyr I shall never click ur links again
[21:50:11] <Inucroft[NLR]> I am, very, disapointed in you
[21:50:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> but they are dank
[21:50:16] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: How are you?
[21:50:35] <EM-C> Well...I kinda got some unwelcome news about an hour ago.
[21:50:46] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Tell us
[21:50:50] <EM-C> Yesterday my mother and I went to our cardiologist for purely routine tests and a visit.
[21:51:14] <EM-C> Today I got a phone call saying after looking at my stress test, he wants me to come back next week for a CAT scan for my heart.
[21:51:20] <EM-C> Not Mama; just me this time.
[21:51:29] <EM-C> That's never happened before.
[21:51:56] <EM-C> Probably not anything too big.  May just want to prescribe me a blood pressure medication or something.
[21:52:10] <EM-C> Better it be me than Mama anyway.  So that's good.
[21:52:20] <EM-C> He said other than that we were both in good shape.
[21:52:56] <EM-C> But I was looking forward to a week without anything on the schedule.  Now this test is scheduled for next Tues. at 9am.
[21:52:59] <Inucroft[NLR]> EM-C i think they just want to make sure things are ticking ok.
[21:53:11] <EM-C> And I can't have anything with caffeine for **24 hours** beforehand.
[21:53:13] <Inucroft[NLR]> Sometimes this happens and eveything turns out alright
[21:53:20] <EM-C> Yeah.
[21:53:24] <Inucroft[NLR]> Ah yes, the evil caffeine
[21:53:36] <EM-C> Mama's been going to a cardiologist for seventeen years.  I only started going a couple years ago.
[21:53:44] <Inucroft[NLR]> Only in tea or cola do i consume that vle substance
[21:53:59] <EM-C> Only in cola and chocolate for me.
[21:54:20] * Cloud_Zephyr applies lattes to Inucroft[NLR]
[21:55:31] <EM-C> We were hoping for a quick visit yesterday morning but were there a long time.  We were both worn out when we came in.
[21:55:58] *** OctaveSymphony is now known as Octave|Bed
[21:56:07] <EM-C> They injected a radioactive isotope into each of us and we had to wait an hour to be tested.  Then we had to wait *another* hour to be tested again.
[21:56:33] <EM-C> And I didn't find out till we were down there that we had an office visit scheduled as well.  We usually don't do that on test days.
[21:57:08] <EM-C> Well...I was toying with the idea of getting into "Star vs. the Forces of Evil" there for a while but now I don't think I will.
[21:57:33] <EM-C> They showed the season finale the other day and it wasn't quite the big deal I had been led to expect.
[22:00:30] <EM-C> Well...think I'll look for something to watch on YouTube.
