[00:02:37] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[00:02:37] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about All About That Bass Cannon (Vinyl Scratch) - Elite3
[00:04:05] <StrykerVylon> Where im at we had someone go missing before the monsoon here in Texas started. This isnt making it any better in finding him.
[00:09:09] <Flurshy> Austin's creek turned into a river
[00:09:34] <Flurshy> you know it's intense when suddenly there's a river flowing where a football field once stood
[00:09:40] <StrykerVylon> From what ive heard Austin is mostly submerged.
[00:10:10] <StrykerVylon> One things for sure though. Texans will remember the great monsoon of 2015.
[00:10:14] <Flurshy> I think it's starting to drain a little. My friend's at UT austin right now and said they're fine on campus
[00:10:27] <StrykerVylon> Ah. That's good then.
[00:11:11] <Flurshy> which makes me happy too, because I'm gunna go visit to watch them perform in a play :D

[00:12:19] <Flurshy> you don't hear of floodwater deaths in Texas very often. it just doesn't happen

[00:17:05] <StrykerVylon> Flurshy: Im pretty sure all of texas was under drought water restrictions.
[00:17:21] <Flurshy> east texas wasn't
[00:17:58] <StrykerVylon> Okay. Most of texas then. 
[00:18:02] <Flurshy> we get the rain coming from everybody else's water reservoirs
[00:19:16] <Flurshy> Austin has a new river and Houston is now a lake
[00:20:03] <StrykerVylon> My town is just wet. We dont have much standing water and what standing water we do have is mostly in drainge ditches. 
[00:20:14] <Flurshy> we don't have much either
[00:20:15] * RandomNinja wibbles violently
[00:20:24] <Flurshy> our thing this weekend was mostly tornadoes
[00:20:46] <StrykerVylon> Where im at tornadoes are pretty common though none have ever hit us. =/
[00:20:59] <Flurshy> same!
[00:21:08] <StrykerVylon> XD
[00:21:09] <Flurshy> though one almost landed within earshot once
[00:21:20] <Flurshy> you could hear it but it didn't hit the ground
[00:21:57] <StrykerVylon> I think one landed a couple miles outside of town and then just went around us or they start going above us and then land outside of town heading away from us.
[00:23:26] <Flurshy> it's scary nonetheless
[00:23:29] <StrykerVylon> People like to joke it's becuase of some Native American thing but it's actually the geography of the town. The only way one will ever hit us is if it forms and lands right in town. Which none has ever done in the years this town has been here.
[00:23:43] <StrykerVylon> OH yeah it is. But im more worried about other people and not me.
[00:23:45] <Flurshy> why is that?
[00:23:50] <Flurshy> about the geography
[00:24:00] <Flurshy> in a valley?
