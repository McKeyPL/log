[22:46:03] <Eywind> Weird
[22:46:12] <Eywind> there it has updated
[22:47:15] <Copper-Cap> one thing has made me wonder...when are they going to use the Old Castle in the show again...
[22:47:21] * Eywind shrug
[22:47:39] <Copper-Cap> we last seen it in...the Comic book episode...right?
[22:47:57] <Inucroft[NLR]> Scamper_FR not tis "Don't crush the children with your car/lorry/coach/tanker
[22:48:57] <Eywind> I feel like there's a very obvious use for the old castle
[22:49:44] <Eywind> mmm black raspberry chocolate chip ice cream
[22:50:16] <Copper-Cap> mhm...its going to be something with those 8 objects of...that pony mentioned by Starlight Shimmer
[22:50:30] <Eywind> Meh
[22:50:32] <Copper-Cap> im guessing anywasy
[22:50:36] <Copper-Cap> anyways*
[22:50:38] <Eywind> I don't think those are gonna show up
[22:50:54] <Eywind> that was only mentioned to support the fraud aspect
[22:51:20] <RandomNinja> ponies?
[22:51:50] <Copper-Cap> Starlight Shimmer knows of the objects and she is MIA
[22:51:54] <Snapai> There's a better use for the old castle
[22:51:56] <RandomNinja> this is true
[22:52:00] <Copper-Cap> so...its a possibility

[22:52:24] <RandomNinja> Unixkitty, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpPwW0z5CNE
[22:52:25] <Eywind> YAY
[22:52:55] <Snapai> I had an idea that is totally irrelevant to anything, but would be neat
[22:52:58] <Eywind> (now only $49.99 at your local Toys R Us Snapai?)
[22:53:11] <RandomNinja> Snapai is only $49.99?
[22:53:15] * RandomNinja buys 2
[22:53:23] <Eywind> lol
[22:53:43] <Snapai> If the castles of harmony (Canterlot, Crystal Kingdom, Ponyville, Everfree) all naturally had teleport transit between them.
[22:53:47] <Snapai> Like a stargate or something ;p
[22:53:51] <EM-C> Is there anyone here who can give me advice about a computer problem?
[22:53:53] <Copper-Cap> hmmm
[22:53:56] <Eywind> fast travel signs
[22:54:00] <Eywind> obv
[22:54:15] <Eywind> that would be sweet though
[22:54:16] <RandomNinja> "the Armageddon Souffle - A dessert that's not only a tasty end to any meal, but a tasty end TO THE WORLD"
[22:54:20] <RandomNinja> I love this show
[22:54:25] <Copper-Cap> EM-C about every other pony here can try asking first ^_^
[22:54:38] <Snapai> A specific recess in the castle, that allows transit between them by teleportation. Dunno what the requirements would be, alicorn-only, easy for any unicorn, any EoH bearer, etc....
[22:54:43] <Eywind> RandomNinja are you watching Fighting Foodons or something?
[22:54:47] <Snapai> But y'see...what would be funny about that.
[22:54:50] <RandomNinja> Eywind, Dave the Barbarian
[22:54:51] <Eywind> :P
[22:54:54] <Eywind> Yeah I know
[22:55:08] <Snapai> It's been ages since such a system would need to be used. Twilight's castle is brand new, Everfree is abandoned, Crystal Kingdom was lost for forever
[22:55:21] <RandomNinja> Eywind, https://youtu.be/HpPwW0z5CNE?t=6m48s
[22:55:25] <Snapai> So if such a thing existed, the one in Canterlot is probably being used as a closet XD
[22:55:46] <Copper-Cap> hmmm, Canterlot has that underground Crystal Caves...
[22:55:48] <Eywind> that's quite a baked bad RandomNinja
[22:55:53] <RandomNinja> indeed
[22:55:58] <Crystal> HEY
[22:56:00] <RandomNinja> this show is wonderfully stupid
[22:56:09] <Crystal> some one keep pinging my name
[22:56:27] <RandomNinja> probably because your name is a common adjective in poneworld
[22:56:27] <Crystal> everytime some says Crystal 
[22:56:51] <Snapai> So like imagine Twilight tries to use it - after finding documentation in the library collection from Everfree, and....she either teleports the contents to her castle, or teleports into a mess in Canterlot.
[22:56:56] <Eywind> then change your name or turn pings off or something lol
[22:57:22] <Copper-Cap> Sorry Cryst-al
[22:57:28] <Snapai> So like....she winds up in a mop closet in Canterlot, and the guards have to let her out. Or, she teleports two VERY embarassed looking royal guards to her castle. :x
[22:57:33] <Sombra> Question
[22:57:37] <Eywind> Haha

[23:21:10] <Sombra> But only because they have stuff in common.  But, Celestia, it's more of an opposites attract sort of thing, so it's interesting in that way.
[23:21:32] <Snapai> I liked Tree Hugger. She made Ponyville seem even MORE like Asheville ^^;
[23:21:38] <Sombra> He only didn't like her because he came between him and fluttershy.
[23:21:49] <Sombra> Which is understandable, I'd hate anyone that came between me and fluttershy.
