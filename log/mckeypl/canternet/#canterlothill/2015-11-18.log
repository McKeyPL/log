[03:02:23] <EM-C> Oh.  I was hoping you were saying is a regular here and I just didn't know it.
[03:02:52] <EM-C> Is there going to be a "Bronies React to Friendship Games?"
[03:02:54] <Eywind> I mean I'm sure he's okay or something
[03:03:10] <Eywind> If there's not already one, probably not?
[03:03:21] <EM-C> Oh.  Well there isn't one.
[03:03:37] <EM-C> I find it difficult to believe they don't plan to ever do one.
[03:03:51] <Eywind> if it comes out in a year, is it really them reacting?
[03:04:12] <Eywind> I mean, isn't the whole thing really just how many overly ridiculous faces people who are popular because of things they did three years ago can do?
[03:04:20] <EM-C> Well, that's the name of the series.  I meant just a FG installment.
[03:04:26] <MikeM> And flipping the cereal table.
[03:05:02] <wobniaR> Let them enjoy their silly faces and brownies
[03:05:08] <EM-C> I'm really sorry I didn't get to go to that convention that one time.  Of course, no one big would have been there, but I would have met a few bronies in person.

[03:05:33] <wobniaR> Tumblr in a nutshell
[03:05:34] <EM-C> Bronies seem to have so much fun when they actually get together.  And I can't find another one anywhere around here.
[03:05:39] <Eywind> I've been seeing this on twitter enough
[03:05:43] <Eywind> that it sums up my reaction there obv
[03:05:49] <wobniaR> Because it sums up everything 
[03:06:03] <Eywind> well I think people should be able to enjoy it
[03:06:07] <Eywind> but not that they actually should
[03:06:16] <Eywind> they should have the ability to watch some faces that saberspark does or something
[03:06:21] <Eywind> but not actually care what he does
[03:06:31] <Hamtramck> I've seen brony meet-ups around Columbus
[03:06:38] <Eywind> yea I went to one because someone was in town for it

[03:07:27] <Flightless> Hey, Shad0wMeister
[03:07:29] <Hamtramck> Brony meetups in columbus are probably like "Hey so wanna get lunch at Bibibop and then wander aimlessly around Hot Topic for an hour?"

[03:11:16] <MikeM> That's as good a method as any.

[03:13:57] <Hamtramck> Anything more and it's invariably overpriced. Anything less and the quality's getting suspect.
[03:14:13] <wobniaR> That's about as much as I spend on lunch everyday

[12:47:07] <Unixkitty> By the way, I've heard that if your game stutters at times or has framerate drops, setting shadow draw distance to medium helps quite a bit
[12:47:21] <RandomNinja> is medium the lowest? I keep it at that
[12:47:36] <RandomNinja> also, force disable godrays and DOF
[12:47:49] <Unixkitty> It is
[12:48:05] <Unixkitty> And no, I do like godrays, but certainly not DOF which I disable in every game it has

[12:48:21] <RandomNinja> oops
[12:48:34] <Unixkitty> And yes medium is the lowest, at least in the launcher
[12:48:39] <RandomNinja> up to 40% lower framerate has been reported from only godrays
[12:48:50] <RandomNinja> it's somehow stupidly heavy
[12:48:59] <RandomNinja> like, SSAO is less intensive
[12:49:15] <Unixkitty> Otherwise everything on ultra and my fps seems to only veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery rarely dip below 60
[12:49:55] <RandomNinja> I need to play around with settings now that the actual framerate killers have been determined
[12:50:07] <RandomNinja> I've been running at medium with maxed draw distances for the most part
