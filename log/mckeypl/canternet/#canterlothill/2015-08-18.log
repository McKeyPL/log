[22:02:42] <RandomNinja> Thanks, Obama
[22:02:43] <wobniaR> Teen titans go is more comedy than the more edgy original
[22:02:57] <One-Trick> i like both for different reasons
[22:03:05] <One-Trick> i would *love* for the original to still be on
[22:03:08] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> But the original Teen Titans also had comedy and were well-executed...
[22:03:10] <RandomNinja> haven't watched much of the original show, but was it really edgy?
[22:03:11] <One-Trick> especially with how they left Terra
[22:03:29] <wobniaR> Yeah but the focus of the original wasn't comedy
[22:03:37] <wobniaR> I'm exaggerating in comparison RandomNinja
[22:03:41] <RandomNinja> yeah but more like JLA and stuff
[22:03:41] <PinkieShy> A friend told me Canada has teletoon is that the same as cartoon network
[22:04:04] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Also, CN has developed a hatred for classic shows form the 90's :I
[22:04:17] <wobniaR> They have boomerang dude
[22:04:31] <wobniaR> Which airs the original teen titans reruns and other 90s shows
[22:04:31] <One-Trick> they dont hate them, people changed the channel cuz they didnt wanna watch it
[22:04:33] <RandomNinja> what? Cartoons with good stories and character development? Can't have that
[22:04:34] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Boomerang took off the majority of classic shows as well, wobniaR :/
[22:04:39] <One-Trick> dont blame the show, its the vapid audience
[22:04:45] <One-Trick> ratings == shows
[22:04:51] <RandomNinja> sadly
[22:04:57] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> The audience has no respect for classic shows :/
[22:05:00] <RandomNinja> see: Firefly
[22:05:18] <One-Trick> those of us that appreciate awesome tv shows like that are a small majority
[22:05:25] <wobniaR> Ratings go down as people switch to stuff like netflix & on-demand television shows
[22:05:37] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> >Netflix
[22:05:51] <wobniaR> Just an example
[22:06:01] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Netflix is too pricey. But yes, I know what you meant
[22:06:03] <One-Trick> i am fairly sure mlp:fim wouldnt have extended this long if it didnt have such a huge audience
[22:06:18] <RandomNinja> Jon-The_Bronynerd, do you get the US netflix tho?
[22:06:22] <wobniaR> Mlp would've died at like, season 2 ending
[22:06:22] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> But its not just the audience, its the channel itself for pulling the majority of good shows off the air
[22:06:29] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> RandomNinja; I don't use Netflix :P

[22:07:42] <RandomNinja> it just happened to be awesome as well
[22:07:42] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> And the shows that were on Boomerang are modern shows, nowhere close to being classics
[22:07:49] <One-Trick> no, its the audience- its the same reason why Discovery, History, Science, etc... sucks also. they have channels where theres a small audience so they put stupid shows like PawnStars on it so people watch it, then all the informative and useful shows get jammed into 'buy on itunes'
