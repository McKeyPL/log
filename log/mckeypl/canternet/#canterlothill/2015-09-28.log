[19:06:10] <wobniaR> I only really use it for test stuff and handling windows malware
[19:06:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> i wanna new macbook pro, too bad i bought a desktop instead
[19:06:28] <wobniaR> The desktop is better if you're at home
[19:07:20] <wobniaR> Macbook is more like "hey i got a lightweight laptop so i can browse internet while travelling and look like a hipster"
[19:07:52] <wobniaR> Macbooks aren't really hipster anymore but they sure are priced like they are
[19:07:56] <RandomNinja> remember to bring your fake glasses and local microbrewed ale
[19:08:37] <Cloud_Zephyr> appul is superior for laptops, if you have teh money
[19:08:55] <RandomNinja> not necessarily
[19:09:18] <RandomNinja> most people saying that are comparing macbooks to windows laptops at half the price
[19:09:18] <wobniaR> I wouldn't do any heavy gaming on it, or on a laptop in general
[19:09:29] <RandomNinja> obviously the macbook will win every time
