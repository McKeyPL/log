[02:43:01] <pinkpearlapple> #meatcake
[02:43:01] <Marbi-Z> I will say this... Sharia law is kinda tradtitional in those countries and I don't think we are justified in trying to change them.
[02:43:03] <Kemy> Wow
[02:43:08] <Trail_Blaze> its a meat cake
[02:43:11] <Flarecobra> Doesn't need to be wrapped in bacon. Good meat doesn't need it

[02:43:34] <pinkpearlapple> if i had the money i'd get all 4 season sets for charity

[02:43:56] <RedCard> ...according to Siri
[02:44:03] <Flarecobra> My math says 2.267
[02:44:20] <ricardofr-200> just gogle it, 2.267
[02:44:22] <Marbi-Z> Thats how they've always been Hooliicious there not gonna change .
[02:44:24] <RedCard> Flarecobra, siri rounded that up
[02:44:25] <Screwball> check out the charity here peeps http://www.manliestbrony.com/blog/?p=1531
[02:44:33] <Hooilicious> Sharia law is why women get executed for being raped...  Yes, We sure do have a need to intervene.
[02:44:37] <Flarecobra> I kind of did it on paper. ^_^V
[02:45:00] <Snap_Shot> hmm?
[02:45:06] <Marbi-Z> You think Celestia would interfere with other countires in her world? I don't think so?
[02:45:21] <RedCard> I second Marbi-Z's point
[02:45:21] <CoolBreeze-Caper> that's a thick book
[02:45:32] <Hooilicious> That is kinda too bad.  We are civilized people, and civilized people stop evil and barbarianism...
[02:45:37] <CoolBreeze-Caper> cant wait till i get my auotobio published
[02:45:38] <Flarecobra> I'd actually be ok with getting Dusty's version.
[02:45:43] <Hooilicious> Actually, Celestia does,
[02:46:00] <Marbi-Z> If they attack us then its our buisness otherwise we have no reason to be there.
[02:46:01] <Hooilicious> And there is not another country in Equestria where women get executed for being raped.
[02:46:10] <Hooilicious> Balogna.

[02:58:59] <Flarecobra> Burnout can occur
[02:59:08] <Hooilicious> Thank You Dusty
[02:59:08] <Marbi-Z> Thats what Nintendo does and patence does pay off.
[02:59:25] <pinkpearlapple> i was told it was to finish finalizing season 5, season 6, and equestria girls. 
[02:59:25] <Flarecobra> I'd rather wait and get a quality product, then get a rush job and have it be junk.
[02:59:27] <Metro_Detrot_Bronies> The only good kinda burnout is Burnout Revenge. 
[02:59:32] <Snuggle_Trumpet> I am totally FOR hiatuses.  I actually am a little worried that season 6 and the movie is coming out short times away from each other
[02:59:34] <RedCard> 2017 MLP Feature
[02:59:40] <Flarecobra> Or a victory burnout. :P
[02:59:44] <Transgamer> It is worth the wait

[02:59:48] <Hooilicious> Half Life 3,  Duke Nukem forever... LOL,  Time does not ALWAYS make things better.
[02:59:49] <StatManDan> They have a lot on their plate:  S5, S6, EqG, 2017 movie!
[03:00:03] <ricardofr-200> *stands up and claps*
[03:00:03] <DirtyKitten> XD
[03:00:03] <Flarecobra> Not to mention they got other shows.
[03:00:07] <LocDogX86X> i'm just a little mad that there was no Trixie appearence yet in S5
[03:00:07] <RedCard> 27 seasons will NOT happen
[03:00:11] <Marbi-Z> The sad part is the critics are always the most vocal.
[03:00:14] <pinkpearlapple> i'm just happy we're getting 6 seasons. almost every show lauren has worked on has had 6 seasons!!
[03:00:21] <StatManDan> Unless your SpongeBob, Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, ad naseum
[03:00:28] <Kemy> Given what we saw of season 5 part 2 at SDCC, it's going to be even better than the first half
[03:00:32] <DirtyKitten> or Looney Tunes
[03:00:39] <Kemy> That takes *a lot* of time and effort
[03:00:41] <RedCard> 27 seasons is like 27-30 years....TOO MUCH

[04:26:41] <Flurshy> what's a good brand for earbuds?
[04:27:29] <Hamtramck> http://www.amazon.com/Brainwavz-Delta-IEM-Earphones/dp/B00FSA8VQ2 I really like these although I'd recommend replacing the tips with foam ones.
[04:27:40] <Hamtramck> The stock ones give it this kind of metallic buzz.
[04:28:10] <Hamtramck> Although earbuds I guess really interact with your inner ear anatomy a lot and whether they sound right to one person doesn't mean they're going to sound at all right to someone else???
[04:29:35] <Flurshy> true indeed
[04:29:45] <Flurshy> I'll probably just go in-store and buy something that looks good
[04:32:55] <Flurshy> I'm probably getting a new phone this week and would like new earbuds to go with
[04:33:05] <Flurshy> if the included earbuds are good then I'll use those, but they probably aren't
[04:34:17] <Flurshy> anyone here have an Lg G4?
[04:35:27] <LightningCrash> I've used one?
[04:35:40] <Flurshy> eh, I'm wondering about the earbuds that come with it
[04:36:11] <LightningCrash> In the USA, I know it depends on your carrier, what earbuds you get.
[04:41:50] <wobniaR> inb4 >earbuds
[04:42:08] <wobniaR> I used some generic samsung ones for a while, they were good while they lasted
[04:43:05] <MikeM> I had some JVC earbuds that sounded good. Better than a set of Skullcandy's
[04:43:20] <Eywind> I got some Sony earbuds on clearance at Target for like $12
[04:43:26] <Eywind> they've been fantastic for mobile listening

[04:43:45] <DerpyBot> May I take your hat?
[04:43:46] <DinkyBot> I'm wearin' a muffin hat, momma!
[04:43:53] <Flurshy> I'm thinking about actually paying for my own service now to be honest
[04:44:02] <Eywind> they're nowhere near the Klipsch I used to use with foam tips but those shorted out every 4-6 months so I wasn't gonna keep paying $80 a year for earbuds
[04:44:11] <Flurshy> if I wait for my mom to pay the bills so I can upgrade I'll never get a new phone
[04:44:58] <wobniaR> Mobile carriers get away with highway robbery
[04:45:13] <Flurshy> it's horrible
[04:45:26] <Eywind> It's not highway robbery is everyone is willing to pay for it
[04:45:36] <wobniaR> They'll sell you free or lowered price phones but lock you into contracts, if you want to buy a decent phone separate from carrier it's several hundred dollars for a phone
[04:46:04] <wobniaR> And 4g verizon charges me like $40 a month for it
[04:46:10] <Flurshy> what's this... $85 a month... for phone service...
[04:46:24] * Flurshy goes to other sites to look
[04:46:32] <Eywind> that sounds about right for a solo plan
[04:46:33] <Flurshy> goodbye sprint, it was nice never using you
[04:46:35] <wobniaR> But yeah people are willing to pay soo
[04:47:56] <Flurshy> Eywind: it's not that everyone is willing to pay for it
[04:48:14] <Flurshy> it's that you have to pay for it or you're without one of the modern world's most vital tools
[04:48:32] <wobniaR> Smartphones aren't essential but extremely conveinent
[04:48:35] <Flurshy> it's like charging $10 for a bottle of water
[04:48:42] <Flurshy> depends on who you are of course
[04:48:44] <wobniaR> That's reality already Flurshy
[04:48:54] <Eywind> pls
[04:48:56] <wobniaR> Unless you got an ice cold watah guy on the corner
[04:48:58] <Eywind> ice cold water is only $1
[04:49:21] <Flurshy> is there no such thing at $40 a month phone service?
[04:49:32] <Eywind> only if you bring your own phone or are okay with super old phones
[04:50:04] <wobniaR> Yeah if you want strictly phone service and maybe text that can be provided at a minimal price
[04:50:18] <wobniaR> Throw in 4g and something with an actual OS and it gets expensive
[04:50:50] <wobniaR> I took a mobile phone programming class once, it was all java and horrible
[04:51:06] <Eywind> I know someone who develops phone apps lol
[04:51:24] <Eywind> He is Pony_75091
[04:51:29] <wobniaR> It wasn't new smartphone apps it was like old school java apps
[04:51:41] <wobniaR> On cell phones from the 1990's
[04:51:46] <Eywind> oh ok
[04:52:03] <wobniaR> Used netbeans to run an emulator of it, it was ugh
[04:52:23] <wobniaR> Now you have android studio and whatever appul uses for its developers

[14:15:09] <Trildar> Cloud_Zephyr: There's a difference between bits and bytes. Also, your drive's read/write speeds are probably quite a bit slower than either of those network speeds.
[14:18:56] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: 8 bits (b) = 1 byte (B)
[14:19:20] <JockeTF> Also you'll very rarely get the maximum speed. :P
[14:20:03] <Trildar> Yes, also that. :P
[14:20:20] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: Also WiFi is VERY sensitive to distances and interference.
[14:20:34] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: Write is better if possible.
[14:21:07] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: Another reason is that most home routers are pretty bad when it comes to matching their specs.
[14:21:11] <Cloud_Zephyr> but when downloading files form the internet i get up tp 8MB/S
[14:21:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> im transferring things form my own network at 3MB/S
[14:21:31] <Cloud_Zephyr> from*
[14:22:00] <Trildar> Slow read speed maybe.
[14:22:00] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: How are you transferring the files, then? Which tools are you using?
[14:22:07] <Trildar> Also, WiFi both ways.
[14:22:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> im using finder (macs version of windows explorer)
[14:23:09] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: More about the protocol. Is this to a "windows network"?
[14:23:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> its to a windows computer
[14:24:10] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: Over SMB then, which OS X has a different implementation of. :P
[14:24:10] <Zuthal> may be slow because two different filesystems?
[14:24:22] <Cloud_Zephyr> maybe
[14:24:41] <JockeTF> Zuthal: Not likely. File systems have little to do with this since it's over network.
[14:24:46] <Zuthal> hm
[14:24:54] <JockeTF> Unless one of the machines have slow disk access in general.
[14:25:07] <Zuthal> Cloud_Zephyr: what kind of disk do you have in both machines?
[14:25:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> both have hard drives, my macs drive is about 80MB/S and I don't expect the windows to have a too slow drive
[14:25:42] <JockeTF> (3MB/s would be extremely slow for any HDD or SSD.)
[14:26:09] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: I'd try simply using something other than SMB (windows file sharing) first.
[14:26:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> mkay
[14:26:40] <JockeTF> Cloud_Zephyr: If that doesn't improve things I'd look into getting better performance on the network level (try with a long ethernet cable, for example.)
[14:27:23] <Trildar> Don't think he has cables able to do that.
[14:27:36] <Trildar> He keeps complaining about having to use Wifi. :P

[14:27:50] <Cloud_Zephyr> but yuh i'd rather keep portable devices to using wifi
[14:28:08] <JockeTF> Probably not. That's how you would track down the issue though.
