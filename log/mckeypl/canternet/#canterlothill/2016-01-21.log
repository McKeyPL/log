[00:23:21] <MikeM> haha...You're gonna brew yourself right out of your house.
[00:23:29] <RandomNinja> what do you mean? :P
[00:23:47] <MikeM> Storage space
[00:24:10] <RandomNinja> it's fine, I rent a basement storage room
[00:24:27] <MikeM> ahh
[00:24:41] <RandomNinja> It will go there and not see light for 15 months
[00:28:31] <RandomNinja> $20 for 5 gallons of lambic is a pretty great deal :3
[00:29:18] <MikeM> Sure is. And plenty for sharing with friends.
[00:29:25] <RandomNinja> yes... sharing...

[01:04:10] <RandomNinja> !decide nibbles scritches
[01:04:10] <DinkyBot> THE GREAT DINKY SAYS ITS scritches
[01:04:55] <Regulus> If cat-people are in Elder Scrolls, I think they need wolf and fox people 
[01:05:07] <RandomNinja> there are mods for this
[01:05:12] <Regulus> Yus
[01:05:18] <RandomNinja> also werewolves are a thing
[01:05:23] <Regulus> Just needs to be canon now.
[01:05:35] <RandomNinja> something something Sheogorath
[01:05:43] <Regulus> And yeah, but werewolves are kind of a cop-out 
[01:06:04] * RandomNinja applies Fatamorgana to MikeM 
[01:06:25] <Flurshy> so uhh
[01:06:30] <Flurshy> anyone here played Fallout 4?
[01:06:36] <RandomNinja> only like half the chat
[01:06:37] <MikeM> It's a floating thing
[01:06:53] <RandomNinja> it's also one of the prettiest beer bottles around
[01:07:10] <Flurshy> so, I did the quest with Travis
[01:07:15] <Flurshy> and his radio stuff hasn't changed
[01:07:32] <MikeM> That is a nice looking bottle
[01:07:35] <RandomNinja> did you do it in a way that encourages confidence?
[01:07:39] <Flurshy> I've even heard the "I'm gunna be better" thing on the radio but everything else is still nervous, awkward Travis
[01:07:45] <Regulus> It takes a bit usually 
[01:07:53] <RandomNinja> could also be a bug
[01:07:59] <Flurshy> I sure hope it's not a bug
[01:08:14] <Regulus> No, I've had it take like up to a week in game
[01:08:24] <Flurshy> I'll give it longer then
[01:08:41] <Regulus> Sometimes doing another quest that produces a headline on the radio forces a change 
[01:09:04] <Regulus> Like clearing Vault 81 or murdering all of Covenant 
[01:09:28] <RandomNinja> just spend the week converting your massive purified water emporium into monies
[01:09:33] <RandomNinja> capitalism, ho!
[01:09:35] <Regulus> Well, post-quest murdering them
[01:09:36] <Flurshy> what happens if you kill Travis :O
[01:09:46] <RandomNinja> can you even?
[01:09:56] <Regulus> I think he's un-killable
[01:09:58] <RandomNinja> this is Fallout 4
[01:10:02] <RandomNinja> not New Vegas
[01:10:10] <Flurshy> what's that suppposed to mean
[01:10:18] * Flurshy hasn't played New Vegas
[01:10:26] <RandomNinja> you can kill literally every adult
[01:10:27] <Flurshy> this is the only Fallout game I've ever played
[01:10:44] <Flurshy> I killed a trader, does that count?
[01:10:53] <Flurshy> I thought I was sneaking into a raider camp
[01:11:03] <RandomNinja> turns out it was a caravan?
[01:11:14] <Flurshy> no, it was a trader just camped out in an underpass
[01:11:31] <RandomNinja> sounds like an exceedingly dumb thing to do
[01:11:39] <Flurshy> he never saw me
[01:11:48] <RandomNinja> but did you saw him?
[01:11:49] <Flurshy> silenced pistol, pssing!
[01:12:02] <Flurshy> on the bright side, I got whatever I wanted from him without paying
[01:12:10] <RandomNinja> capitalism, yay
[01:12:12] <RandomNinja> wait...
[01:12:16] <Regulus> In most of my saves, I made previously passive traders hostile
[01:12:45] * RandomNinja boopulates Regulus 
[01:12:46] <Flurshy> I mostly stay on the side of just killing Raiders and Gunners and those that shoot at me
[01:12:57] <Regulus> Killing that scaver group in the Constitution quest kinda ticks them off.
[01:13:11] <Flurshy> don't know what quest you're talking about
[01:13:19] <Flurshy> might not want to know, I like not knowing what to expect
[01:13:24] <RandomNinja> acquire power armor and extended ripper, kill muties, become spehs muhreen
[01:13:34] <Regulus> Not my fault their grunt caught me stealing the guidance chip
[01:13:38] <Flurshy> I also like how if you clear out a building and come back a few days later, someone else has set up camp
[01:13:49] <Regulus> I wanted it. Therefore it was mine.
[01:13:52] <RandomNinja> there's a heavily modded 18th centure battleship stuck on top of a bank building
[01:13:58] <RandomNinja> find it and do the quest, it's top tier
[01:14:03] <Flurshy> I didn't need to know that Ninja
[01:14:06] <Flurshy> like really
[01:14:12] <RandomNinja> lies
[01:14:18] <Flurshy> I would have enjoyed it better to find it without having heard about it
[01:14:29] <Flurshy> I like those 'wtf' moments
[01:14:56] <RandomNinja> sorry
[01:15:28] <Flurshy> so now when I find a battleship on top of a bank instead of saying 'wtf' I'll be saying "dangit Ninja"
[01:15:46] <MikeM> He's in your head now.
[01:15:57] <Flurshy> oh yeah, and I only yesterday realized that you can fortify the red rocket truck stop
[01:16:17] <Flurshy> and that maybe that's why I kept having to deal with travelling enemies when I wanted to make guns
[01:16:43] <Flurshy> if an enemy destroys your turret do you have to replace it?
[01:16:59] <RandomNinja> I love my massive wall of turrets
[01:17:06] <Flurshy> I just have massive walls
[01:17:10] <Flurshy> and then turrets on the roof
[01:17:17] <Flurshy> I can take enemies out from the roof of the truck stop
[01:17:26] <Flurshy> I've got barricades up there for cover
[01:17:35] <Flurshy> and a sniper's post
[01:17:50] <RandomNinja> you know those prefab parts with one wall missing?
[01:18:03] <Flurshy> I think?
[01:18:14] <RandomNinja> stack 4x3 of those and put 2 turrets in each o3o
[01:18:38] <Flurshy> can enemies open your doors?
[01:18:41] <RandomNinja> because overkill is best kill
[01:19:00] <RandomNinja> I think all humanoids can
[01:19:10] <Flurshy> the dog can too and it annoys the hell out of me
[01:19:12] <RandomNinja> because for some dumb reason locks don't exist
[01:19:41] <Flurshy> I'll have to work on making better defenses, but I don't have a lot of the parts needed for turrets
[01:20:14] <HamtRamKc> are turrets like ferrets
[01:20:21] <RandomNinja> you can buy a decent amount of fairly cheap junk from Myrna
[01:20:35] <Flurshy> I wish you could just set up camp somewhere, like clear out a raider camp and make it your own
[01:20:35] <RandomNinja> no turrets are those automatic gun things that murder people who get too close
[01:21:17] <RandomNinja> although now I got a picture of a ferret with a tank turret attached to its back
[01:21:29] <Flurshy> I wanna see it
[01:21:30] <Flurshy> link pls
[01:21:38] <RandomNinja> no a mental image
[01:21:54] <Flurshy> :P but you said you had a picture
[01:21:57] <MikeM> And a crazy grin?
[01:22:04] <RandomNinja> how do I english?
[01:22:34] <Regulus> Flurshy, you just repair damaged turrets 
[01:22:46] <Flurshy> ah
[01:22:49] <Flurshy> good then
[01:22:52] <Regulus> It's cheaper than building, but still costly
[01:22:54] * RandomNinja applies mental boops to MikeM 
[01:23:08] <Regulus> They're best when elevated and recessed
[01:23:11] <Flurshy> I haven't really been defending any of my settlements either
[01:23:20] <Flurshy> maybe I should go build defenses for the other places
[01:23:24] <HamtRamKc> yeah build horowitz ferrets
[01:23:25] <Regulus> You also have to repair damaged crops
[01:23:29] <Flurshy> oh screw that
[01:23:30] <HamtRamKc> like ferrets with horowitzes on their backs
[01:23:33] <Flurshy> they can starve
[01:23:37] <HamtRamKc> so you can shoot the aeroplaijns down
[01:23:40] <Flurshy> what do I even need them for
[01:23:43] <RandomNinja> especially Marcy
[01:23:45] <Flurshy> the settlements I mean
[01:23:46] <Regulus> Otherwise no infinite adhesive
[01:23:50] <RandomNinja> ^
[01:23:58] <RandomNinja> sweet, sweet adhesive
[01:24:08] <Flurshy> I haven't even been able to do much gun modding
[01:24:10] <Flurshy> need more levels
[01:24:13] <Regulus> Corn, tatoes, mutefruit
[01:24:21] <RandomNinja> do you even 6 int?
[01:24:25] *** Toothie is now known as SilverSky
[01:24:28] <Flurshy> what I really want is to put a suppressor on my combat rifle
[01:24:31] <Regulus> 3 of each and some water nets you 5 adhesive 
[01:24:35] <Flurshy> I have level 2 gun mods
[01:25:04] <RandomNinja> Combat Rifle is so OP
[01:25:04] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (Zeta@batpones.are.for.snuggles) (Quit: Ping timeout: -1 second)
[01:25:12] <Flurshy> but for that suppressor you need level 4 gun mods
[01:25:16] <Flurshy> at least on the combat rifle
[01:25:22] <Regulus> Flurshy, purchase/scavange guns with desired parts, mod on the base level part, attach desired mod to desired weapon
[01:25:34] <Flurshy> oh wait what
[01:25:36] <Regulus> Same for armor
[01:25:42] <Flurshy> like just take the mod off of it and put it on the...
[01:25:46] <RandomNinja> yes
[01:25:50] <Regulus> mmhmmm
[01:25:50] <Flurshy> I didn't know you could do that!
[01:25:55] <Regulus> You can
[01:25:58] <RandomNinja> it's one of those things that are too obvious to consider
[01:26:05] <RandomNinja> took me a while too
[01:26:17] <Regulus> It's how my melee character has a .50 cal supressed recon rifle
[01:26:27] <RandomNinja> booo
[01:26:30] <RandomNinja> that's not melee at all
[01:26:35] <Flurshy> I haven't even found a 50 cal weapon
[01:26:44] <Flurshy> melee I just use brass knuckles
[01:26:47] <RandomNinja> what level are you?
[01:26:48] <Flurshy> fast and effective
[01:26:51] <Flurshy> level 15
[01:26:52] <Regulus> And how 1 Strength Tony Stark gets his heavily modded combat armor 
[01:27:07] <RandomNinja> I think .50 starts spawning in the early 20s?
[01:27:17] <Regulus> Sounds about right
[01:27:21] <Regulus> 25 maybe
[01:27:33] <RandomNinja> also then there's hilariously overpowered Gauss
[01:27:44] <Regulus> It's usually 3-4 levels before you can unlock the corresponding gun nut level 
[01:27:50] <Flurshy> 50 cal must pack a hell of a punch
[01:27:58] <Regulus> Not too much
[01:28:06] <Flurshy> can you mod a gun to take 50 cal?
[01:28:08] <HamtRamKc> I saw some guy pulling wires out of his pants on the bus and got freaked out
[01:28:09] <RandomNinja> yes
[01:28:10] <HamtRamKc> does that make me racist
[01:28:26] <Flurshy> cause I noticed you can modify the chamber w/e
[01:28:28] <Regulus> Pipe bolt pistols and hunting/sniper rifles
[01:28:31] <RandomNinja> hunting/sniper rifle can be modded from .308 to .50
[01:28:38] <MikeM> No, it's rational to worry about random dudes pulling wires from their pants.
[01:28:53] <Regulus> They can also be downgraded to .45
[01:29:09] <RandomNinja> also, eventually upgrade your combat rifle to .308 for even more OPness
[01:29:21] <Flurshy> I could into a 50 cal bolt action sniper rifle
[01:29:37] <RandomNinja> http://images.carlsguides.com/carlsguides/gamepictures/fallout4/quests/minutemen/defend-castle-nuclear-option/unlimited-gauss-rifle.jpg
[01:30:00] <RandomNinja> what is game balance?
[01:30:12] <Regulus> Pipe pistols are .38 or .45, Pipe revolvers are .45 and .308 I think, and pipe bolt pistols are .308, .50 and .38
[01:30:12] <Flurshy> I thought .45 is more effective than .308?
[01:30:12] <RandomNinja> .45 is a pistol round
[01:30:15] *** Joins: star_moon (Starry@the.little.cloud.colt)
[01:30:28] <RandomNinja> it's wider but a lot shorter and the cartridge holds less powder
[01:30:33] <Flurshy> my suppressed pipe rifle uses 308 I think, I have a suppressed 10mm with tactical scope too
[01:30:46] <Flurshy> those are my weapons of choice, because of the suppressors. I like my stealth
[01:30:57] <RandomNinja> sneaky sneaky
[01:31:08] <Regulus> Flurshy, best legendary weapon you can get is a Kneecapper's pipe pistol
[01:31:22] *** Joins: Crimson_Tail (Zeta@batpones.are.for.snuggles)
[01:31:22] <Flurshy> the only legendary anything I have is the Martyr's right... arm?
[01:31:28] <Flurshy> slows down time when you're low on health
[01:31:44] <Flurshy> I know where to find legendarys raiders but have yet to take the rest of them on
[01:31:48] <Flurshy> legendary*
[01:32:03] <Regulus> Add a powerful automatic reciever, large quick eject mag, and supressor and you win the game
[01:32:25] <RandomNinja> best weapon http://i.imgur.com/osaJJHU.jpg
[01:32:25] <Regulus> They're only slightly tougher than normal enemies
[01:32:40] <Flurshy> I actually don't like automatic
[01:32:47] <HamtRamKc> can you put a scope on it
[01:32:47] <Flurshy> all the weapons I used are single-shot
[01:32:54] <RandomNinja> the game mechanics favor slow hard-hitters
[01:33:13] <Regulus> You get so many .38 rounds that an auto kneecapper's pipe pistol breaks both a target's legs in less than 10 seconds usually 
[01:33:27] <RandomNinja> if you have 2 weapons with the same dps on paper the one with lower fire rate will deal more damage almost always
[01:33:50] <Flurshy> you waste ammo most of the time with automatic weapons, because they are less accurate
[01:33:56] <Flurshy> and because recoil
[01:33:56] <Regulus> Just keep it hip-fire frendly and it turns any enemy into a pushover
[01:34:13] <RandomNinja> they're really powerful with certain legendary effects though
[01:34:22] <Flurshy> I'm a fan of headshots from stealth
[01:34:33] <Regulus> Seriously though, it's basically the equivalent of the dart gun from fallout 3
[01:34:46] <RandomNinja> like explosive, you get +25 damage per bullet, regardless of ROF
[01:34:52] <RandomNinja> making miniguns hilarious
[01:35:03] <Regulus> Can confirm
[01:35:09] <Regulus> I have one
[01:35:12] <RandomNinja> also shotguns, which triggers the effect on every pellet
[01:35:22] <Flurshy> you know
[01:35:30] <Flurshy> I've found that the combat shotgun actually wastes my ammo
[01:35:37] <RandomNinja> I have a wounding combat shotgun. It kills mirelurk queens in a few seconds on survival
[01:35:38] <Regulus> Put a tri-barrel on an explosive minigun and everything dies
[01:35:51] <RandomNinja> I love my shotgun
[01:35:52] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: I am playing Pocket Mortys. a parody of Pokemon

[01:36:03] <Regulus> Flurshy, the combat shotgun is better than the double barrel 
[01:36:06] <Flurshy> Ninja wat
[01:36:25] <RandomNinja> wounding gives 15 bleed damage (damage over time)
[01:36:31] <Regulus> It actually has more powerful reciever options and higher ammo capacity
[01:36:33] <Flurshy> I need to go take out that mirelurk queen at the castle
[01:36:51] <Regulus> Oh, easy

[01:37:25] <RandomNinja> get a flamethrower or a ripper
[01:37:29] <Regulus> Just get a bunch of melee enhancing drugs and a heavy sledge, and you'll do like +1000% damage
[01:37:40] *** Quits: starry (Starry@Pony-u4v.ifu.198.112.IP) (Connection closed)
[01:37:43] <Flurshy> I don't even melee
[01:37:46] <Regulus> Easy 2 hit kill
[01:37:47] <RandomNinja> I like ripper because you can just hold down attack and walk forward 
[01:38:03] <Regulus> Even a non-melee character can use my method 
[01:38:05] * DerpyBot puts some carrot muffins in DinkyBot's bag and wakes her up for school
[01:38:05] * DinkyBot hides her head under the blankets and grumbles. "5 more minutes, momma!"
[01:38:06] <RandomNinja> very effective against ghouls and weak animals
[01:38:29] <Sombra> Still waiting on the geck...
[01:38:33] <RandomNinja> remember, kids, the way to success in life is performance enhancing drugs!
[01:38:33] <Flurshy> oh right, I have a dose of addictol, maybe I could hype up on everything I've got for a good fight
[01:38:40] <Flurshy> and I've got a mini nuke!
[01:38:43] <Regulus> Kneecapper's automatic weapons are better against mirelurk queens, RandomNinja 
[01:38:43] <RandomNinja> use that
[01:38:46] <Flurshy> no launcher though
[01:38:47] <RandomNinja> but less fun
[01:39:30] <RandomNinja> hm, can you shoot mini nukes in 4, Regulus?

[01:39:30] <Flurshy> there's a mini nuke launcher
[01:39:42] <RandomNinja> because in 3 and NV you could put mini nukes on the ground and shoot them, they act as mines

[01:39:55] <Flurshy> awesome
[01:39:58] <Flurshy> so
[01:40:00] <Flurshy> mini nukes
[01:40:05] <RandomNinja> if that works you could place it where you know the queen walks
[01:40:10] <Regulus> There's lots if them
[01:40:10] <Flurshy> when they blow up, is it just like when a car blows up in the game?

[01:46:34] <Zuthal> RandomNinja: One or two single nukes or one or two of those insane bursts?
[01:46:38] <RandomNinja> also do all the quests to find best waifu
[01:46:55] <Regulus> Flurshy, it's basically a double damage combat rifle 
[01:47:08] <RandomNinja> the MIRV attachment adds a bit of damage but splits it among all 8 nukes
[01:47:14] <RandomNinja> a single large one does more

[01:47:59] <Flurshy> Regulus: accuracy/range?
[01:48:07] <Regulus> Very good
[01:48:15] <Flurshy> vs a sniper rifle
[01:48:27] <RandomNinja> less but good enough for 95% of scenarios
[01:48:46] <RandomNinja> Regulus, curie is best waifu
[01:48:52] <RandomNinja> this is fact
[01:48:54] <Flurshy> can you hold breath in a scope on an ordinary rifle? haven't tried
[01:49:07] <RandomNinja> any sniper scope
[01:49:16] <RandomNinja> even on handguns
[01:49:33] <Regulus> A 2-shot .45 combat sniper with the best barrel, stock and scope will outpreform a standard .50 cal sniper in damage, but only slightly underpreform in range and acuracy
[01:49:46] <RandomNinja> pretty much
[01:50:12] <Sombra> 45 is a wierd ass bullet to use in a sniper rifle
[01:50:28] <Regulus> Any scoped weapon will allow breath holding, as long as it has "short", "medium", or "long" in the name
[01:50:34] <RandomNinja> and don't forget it's still a combat rifle, so you get that sweet rate of fire
[01:50:50] <RandomNinja> yeah I'm not sure why they didn't use 5.56mm
[01:50:53] <Flurshy> put a sniper scope on an automatic
[01:51:02] <Regulus> If you make it a full auto .45 combat sniper, it's crazy broken 
[01:51:04] <Flurshy> :P
[01:51:04] <RandomNinja> useless because recoil
[01:51:22] <Sombra> .O
[01:51:24] <Sombra> bleh
[01:51:29] <Flurshy> are pipe sniper rifles any good?
[01:51:38] <Sombra> Wierd that 5.56 is around as often as it is.
[01:51:39] <Flurshy> I find a lot of them but meh
[01:51:40] <Regulus> Though, the .308 2-shot combat sniper is good enough to replace a standard sniper rifle 
[01:51:43] <Sombra> Especially in a maxim style gun.
[01:51:49] <RandomNinja> they're pretty good at the time you unlock them, because you can't mod hunting rifles well yet
[01:51:56] <Regulus> Flurshy, mostly early game
[01:52:32] <RandomNinja> maxim gun?
[01:52:42] <Regulus> Automatic pipe pistols with good effects are about the only pipe weapon that holds up
[01:52:45] <Sombra> that's what the assault rifle is based off of in fo4
[01:52:58] <Sombra> A watercooled machine gun.
[01:53:24] <Flurshy> I have pipe weapons right now as my backups
[01:53:41] <Regulus> Kneecapper's, irradiated, wounding, and endless variants are very useful 
[01:53:44] <Flurshy> suppressed pipe rifle for rifle stuff, combat rifle that needs a suppressor (I want my stealth dangit)

[01:54:13] <Regulus> Explosive and incendiary are decent too
[01:54:24] <Flurshy> haven't experimented with unconventional guns

[01:54:44] <RandomNinja> the Gamma Gun is OP against ghouls

[01:55:58] <DinkyBot> Photo Finish is soo rad :B
[01:56:05] <RandomNinja> !t radical
[01:56:05] <Sombra> Well I would have much rather had one of those in 303 or 308
[01:56:07] <DinkyBot> RandomNinja: Switch the word "patriot", it was using most of the bed is calling.. you can be king of the hill is a rather radical group.... tend to control the intensity of thusand suns!
[01:56:09] <Sombra> That would have been ballin
[01:56:27] <Regulus> Flurshy, a pipe autopistol with a stub barrel, muzzle break, sharpshooter grip, and glowing sights has nearly 0 recoil in hip fire
[01:56:44] <Flurshy> I don't use autoooo
[01:56:44] <Regulus> That's gun nut level 2, tops
[01:56:55] <Regulus> It's useful, trust me
[01:57:09] <Sombra> Especially if you get the 2 shot
[01:57:11] <Regulus> You find waaaaaaaay too much .38 ammo
[01:57:17] <RandomNinja> for when you need to fill your enemys face with as much lead as possible
[01:57:17] <Flurshy> in most situations where a panic spray would be useful I am using a shotgun
[01:57:23] <Regulus> I have like 10,000 rounds
[01:57:27] <Sombra> my two shot assault rifle is preeeetty much op
[01:57:49] <Regulus> 48 rounds of .38 from that thing is pretty useful 
[01:57:51] <Flurshy> see these are the weapons I sell or scrap
[01:58:22] <Regulus> Trust me, get that variant, or one with a large bayonet 
[01:58:32] <RandomNinja> get scrapper level 2
[01:58:42] <RandomNinja> scrap pipe guns into screws and useful things
[01:58:46] <Regulus> It is extremely useful until you can get a full auto assault rifle 
[01:58:52] <Flurshy> I don't have the ability to get scrapper level 1 yet
[01:59:02] <Flurshy> I had an assult rifle. I sold it...
[01:59:06] <Flurshy> assault*
[01:59:27] <Sombra> Find it again Flurshy
[01:59:29] <RandomNinja> I'm with flurshy tho, single shot rifles are much better than full auto
[01:59:39] <Flurshy> I've got about 150 rounds of each type of ammo
[01:59:48] <Sombra> Then drop it on the ground, open the console, click on the rifle, then type "attachmod 001cc2ad"
[01:59:58] <Regulus> Also, a pipe autopistol with a finned barrel, muzzle break/supressor, and recoil compensating stock has absolutely 0 recoil and has long range capabilities 
[02:00:01] <Flurshy> Sombra wat, pls, I'm on console
[02:00:10] <Sombra> Oh
[02:00:19] <Sombra> ps4?
[02:00:20] <Flurshy> and by console I mean PS4
[02:00:23] <Flurshy> yeah
[02:00:27] <Sombra> You should still have access to the console.
[02:00:36] <Regulus> I usually have 2 automatic weapons
[02:00:41] <Flurshy> not something I've heard about
[02:00:49] <Regulus> A bullet and an energy weapon
[02:01:07] <Flurshy> my laser pistol is auto, now that I think about it
[02:01:21] <RandomNinja> lasers really need to be auto 
[02:01:25] <Regulus> Those aren't as useful 
[02:01:30] <Sombra> I'm just not a huge fan of lasers.
[02:01:33] <Flurshy> they don't have much recoil compared to ballistic weapons
[02:01:36] <RandomNinja> mostly because covering the screen in red beams looks cool
[02:01:36] <Sombra> Energy dam, vs ballistic dam
[02:01:37] <Flurshy> I just have it as a last resort
[02:01:40] <Regulus> They're much less accurate 
[02:01:46] <RandomNinja> but SCIENCE
[02:01:49] <Regulus> And have smaller clips

[02:02:22] <Regulus> RandomNinja, 2-shot institute autoshotty
[02:02:32] <RandomNinja> so many lasers
[02:02:37] <RandomNinja> inferior blue ones tho
[02:02:42] <Flurshy> they make lasre shotguns? o.o
[02:02:45] <Flurshy> laser*
[02:02:47] <Regulus> Blue everywhere for like 5 seconds, than reload
[02:02:50] <Flurshy> automatic shotguns even
[02:02:52] <RandomNinja> technically a beam splitter
[02:02:54] <RandomNinja> but yes
[02:02:59] <Flurshy> wow, I want one
[02:03:10] <Regulus> Beam splitter + automatic barrel 
[02:03:16] <Regulus> And no you don't 
[02:03:24] <RandomNinja> they're pretty awesome for about 10 seconds until you realize how little they do
[02:03:24] <Regulus> They're unwieldy 
[02:03:29] <RandomNinja> but they look neat
[02:03:39] <Regulus> The recoil makes them unusable 
[02:04:01] <Flurshy> I still don't understand recoil on a laser gun
[02:04:06] <Sombra> Minigun+rapid fire
[02:04:14] <Sombra> laser gattling gun+rapid fire
[02:04:26] <Flurshy> I've seen the laser gatling in loading screen
[02:04:30] <Flurshy> it looks pretty cool
[02:04:41] <Regulus> UNLESS you have an endless variant, then you can compensate for the recoil, and then it's useful

[02:09:25] <Regulus> The junkyard is north of it. There's a defective Sentry Bot in there that's powered down, but can be powered up in a non-attack mode and easily killed for 2 fusion cores too.
[02:09:37] <Sombra> Does that sentry bot respawn?
[02:09:47] <Regulus> I don't think so
[02:10:10] <Regulus> It can be toggled between attack and standby modes though
[02:12:23] <Regulus> Also, suites of power armor with fusion cores in them can be entered by enemies or settlers, Flurshy, and if whoever is in them dies, kiss the armor goodbye until the area resets.

[02:23:48] <Regulus> Heavy, leaded combat armor is even better
[02:25:31] <Regulus> Oh, one more thing they don't explain well Flurshy, modded armor covers up what grade it is. Every type has 3 grade levels. Normal, sturdy, and heavy. The special mod removes the tier prefix, but the material mod does not. 
[02:26:34] <Regulus> So "Leaded Shadowed _____ armor" might be normal, sturdy, or heavy tier.
[02:28:42] <Regulus> Only way to tell is to remove the special mod or to look at the stats

[05:56:26] <Regulus> They're good for that, but it's overkill 
[05:56:27] <Flurshy> 6% chance of hit in vats, didn't matter >:D
[05:56:44] <Flurshy> yes well
[05:57:03] <Flurshy> also yus, Castle comes with wiring and lights and stuff. just needed a few generators
[05:57:12] <Regulus> Yup
[05:57:23] <Regulus> And it has a water system too
[05:57:32] <Regulus> You just need food
[05:58:02] <Regulus> Just wait until you get the armory open
[05:58:39] <Regulus> And until the trader there opens up shop after you get the armory.
[05:59:09] <Flurshy> what does the switch do?
[05:59:24] <Regulus> By the workbench?
[05:59:36] <Flurshy> it's like, just outside a window, in the courtyard
[05:59:52] <Regulus> It's just an easy access point to power everything on that side of the caste
[06:00:23] <Regulus> That's your generator hookup point if you haven't scrapped any wires/connectors
[06:00:40] <Flurshy> ohhh
[06:00:50] <Flurshy> I put my generator in a back room
[06:00:55] <Regulus> The armory side isn't connected to it though
[06:01:01] <Flurshy> I'll move it if I remember to, so the switch actually works
[06:01:06] <Flurshy> yeah I'm not sure how to open the armory >.<
[06:01:11] <Regulus> How'd you hook up the antenna then?
[06:01:19] <Flurshy> two standalone generators
[06:01:33] <Regulus> You get a quest for it later from Preston 
[06:01:58] <Regulus> Usually about an hour after you clear it out initially 
[06:02:06] <Flurshy> I have a lot of free power currently there
[06:02:06] <Regulus> BUT
[06:02:12] <Flurshy> should probably set up some turrets
[06:02:18] <Regulus> Be VERY prepared 
[06:02:23] <Regulus> And no, don't 
[06:02:27] <Flurshy> I have a settler at Red Rocket now too :D
[06:02:51] <Flurshy> he's standing guard on a raised guard post at the wall
[06:02:52] <Regulus> You have to build artillery at the castle and there's 3 free laser turrets in the armory

[06:03:04] <Flurshy> ooh okay then
[06:03:22] <Regulus> That's like 20 or 30 free/mandatory defense 
[06:03:35] <Regulus> You know how to get settlers, ya?
[06:03:42] <Flurshy> set up a radio post thingy
[06:03:46] <Regulus> Yup
[06:03:50] <Flurshy> I would assume you need food to keep them
[06:04:08] <Regulus> Very easy to do, and yes. Food and water and defense and beds.
[06:04:21] <Flurshy> I'm not very good at the food thing. I should go buy some fruits, or maybe pick all the stuff at Sanctuary and plant it at red rocket >.<
[06:04:41] <Regulus> 1 bed, food and water for each settler, 1 defense for each food and 1 for each water
[06:05:03] <Flurshy> and if I neglect them?
[06:05:27] <Regulus> That's an option, otherwise taking quests from Preston gets you more settlements, some of which have established food

[06:10:44] <Flurshy> assuming I can*
[06:10:50] <Regulus> Otherwise it will despawn
[06:10:56] <Flurshy> I guess I have no reason not to take on that station now, then
[06:11:04] <Flurshy> objectives for tomorrow
[06:11:07] <Regulus> They have a ☆ next to their name
[06:11:16] <Flurshy> a what?
[06:11:21] <Flurshy> the symbol won't work for me
[06:11:25] <Regulus> That denotes legendary. A star
[06:11:28] <Flurshy> ah
[06:11:33] <Flurshy> what about a skull?
[06:11:45] <Regulus> That just means high level 
[06:11:57] <Flurshy> see
[06:12:09] <Flurshy> when I saw that legendary, I had just nearly died from another legendary raider mutating
[06:12:11] <Regulus> Like, NOPE, find someone else to kill high level 
[06:12:22] <Flurshy> I killed someone with a skull
[06:12:31] <Flurshy> like just now

[06:12:53] <Flurshy> this one actually had a name
[06:13:06] <Regulus> That's unique, not legendary 
[06:13:13] <Flurshy> and a skull
[06:13:24] <Regulus> That's high level 
[06:13:46] <Regulus> Think of it like a warning that it will probably oneshot you
[06:14:12] <Flurshy> I think the final shot was in vats. he was using a submachine from afar, and I was using a sniper on him, so I sorta had an advantbage
[06:14:16] <Flurshy> advantage*
[06:14:29] <Regulus> But yeah, look for shadowed armor 
[06:14:33] <Flurshy> also, I now possess a suppressed submachine gun :D
[06:14:37] <Regulus> That's best for stealth
[06:14:47] <Regulus> Useless
[06:14:53] <Flurshy> I'll have to keep that in mind about shadowed armor
[06:15:21] <Regulus> The SMG does the same damage at max upgrade as the best auto pipe pistol
[06:15:36] <Regulus> It's a waste of .45 ammo
[06:15:54] <Flurshy> duly noted
[06:16:22] <Regulus> An automatic combat rifle is better as an automatic. 45 platform, and .38 ammo is more readily available

[10:45:41] <Trildar> Yeah, early.
[10:45:43] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> xD
[10:45:55] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I just woke up about 30 something minutes ago :p
[10:46:07] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> No wait, add an hour to that.
[10:46:18] <Trildar> That's better than I manage most days.
[10:46:26] <Trildar> When I'm not required to wake up early at least.
[10:46:34] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Well, I'm at university atm. :p
[10:46:51] <Trildar> I still have like a month more of break.
[10:47:01] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Was kinda expecting other people from my group here. But noone has showed up yet >.>
[10:47:02] <Trildar> It's kind of insane how long the year end break is.
[10:47:29] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Huh? I don't have such break until summer :/
[10:47:39] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Unless you have had it since summer of cause.
[10:47:46] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Then I don't have such breaks at all.
[10:48:21] <Trildar> Well, this is pretty much the Australian summer break.
[10:48:34] <Trildar> Even though I'm not in Australia.

[10:49:48] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> It is winter everywhere, right?
[10:50:15] <Trildar> Suuuure.
[10:51:06] <Trildar> I don't even have seasons here, but it's still winter. As long as that makes you feel better.
[10:51:26] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Hmm. Interesting.
[10:51:42] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So you don't really have snow?
[10:52:26] <Trildar> Nope, if it ever snowed here it'd probably be a "world is ending" thing.
[10:52:40] <Trildar> Or world as we know it at least.
[10:53:25] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> :O
[10:53:43] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> What is the lowest recorded tempeture where you live?
[10:54:30] <Trildar> Not sure. Never bothered to know.
[10:55:14] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Here, the lowest was -31.2 degrees celcius. Highest is 36.4 ^^
[10:55:15] <Trildar> Probably nowhere even near 10 degrees celsius. Being in the tropics will do that.
[10:55:24] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Yea.
[10:56:33] <Trildar> Oh, well, technically we've gotten like almost 5 degrees. But that's in the highland areas. >.>
