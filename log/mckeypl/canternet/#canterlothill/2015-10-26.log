[17:10:39] <wobniaR> RandomNinja what antivirus do you use?
[17:11:01] <wobniaR> Asking cause reasons
[17:12:05] <RandomNinja> MSE
[17:12:10] <RandomNinja> mostly because lazy
[17:12:26] <RandomNinja> also regular MWB scans
[17:13:07] <wobniaR> I'd like to prevent infection rather than repair after, i have mcafee right now but it slows down my computer sometimes
[17:13:15] <RandomNinja> MSE does that though
[17:13:17] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t Tahun 
[17:13:19] <DinkyBot> Tahun: Would you say I'm crazy? :>
[17:13:30] <RandomNinja> sure most 3rd party are better but still
[17:13:40] <wobniaR> The only feature from mcafee i like is the uh
[17:14:06] <RandomNinja> didn't NOD32 use to be great?
[17:14:14] <wobniaR> The site advisor that blocks malicious domains and scans downloads before they complete
[17:14:43] <wobniaR> Malwarebytes premium has a similar feature, and so do other most modern paid antivirus
[17:15:00] <RandomNinja> chrome also does that
[17:16:04] <thereallynewmop12100_> I have the site advisor on Firefox..
[17:16:06] <wobniaR> Chrome is chrome, i doubt its scanning features and malicious domain lists are as comprehensive, or scan sites as you visit them

[17:17:03] <wobniaR> I could be wrong, either way i prefer firefox
[17:17:34] <Unixkitty> Antivirus? What's that?
[17:17:46] <wobniaR> A thing for nerds
[17:17:54] <RandomNinja> either way you get by pretty well with only some critical thinking
[17:18:07] * wobniaR confiscates Unixkitty's nerd badge
[17:18:18] <RandomNinja> wobniaR is now double nerd
[17:18:20] <Unixkitty> I'm fairly certain that would be exactly the opposite, wobniaR 
[17:18:43] <wobniaR> Any site can be compromised RandomNinja and deliver malicious malware through redirects or javascript
[17:18:55] * RandomNinja violently noscripts
[17:18:57] <wobniaR> Adblock and noscript help a lot with that

[17:20:53] <RandomNinja> meh
[17:21:06] <RandomNinja> I trust MSE to handle whatever tiny amounts may slip though
[17:21:10] <wobniaR> It all depends on what you do, but i'm thinking ahead incase there is a time i want to enable a flash plugin on a site or allow it to run javascript to view the site
