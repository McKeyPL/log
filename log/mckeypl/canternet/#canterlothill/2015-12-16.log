[23:20:36] <RandomNinja> medium tier reality warping
[23:21:05] <Regulus> High tier reality warping
[23:21:12] <RandomNinja> SCP-239 is somewhat interesting as wel
[23:21:29] <Regulus> Just say "I believe" and bam, it's done.
[23:21:52] <RandomNinja> nah, high tier needs no speaking or anything, just will
[23:21:56] <RandomNinja> what if you go mute
[23:22:05] <RandomNinja> also slower
[23:22:23] *** Sour_Sweet|Mobile is now known as Sour_Sweet
[23:22:31] <Regulus> Fair enough, but accidental usage is pretty hard with this method X3
[23:25:35] <Regulus> None the less, as a writer, I'd have waaaay to much fun warping reality, RandomNinja

[23:50:32] <RandomNinja> I'm boiling wort with less than a cm of headspace
[23:50:35] <RandomNinja> this is slightly worrying
[23:50:54] <MikeM> Wrap aluminum foil around the top of the pot to make it taller
[23:51:21] <thereallynewmop12100> Hello, MikeM 
[23:51:21] <RandomNinja> great idea
[23:51:28] <RandomNinja> no way that could fail
[23:51:37] * RandomNinja throws mosaic hops at MikeM 
[23:51:39] <MikeM> I knew an engineer once.
[23:51:43] * Cloud_Zephyr noms some flac
[23:51:53] <RandomNinja> "trust me, I passed high school math"
[23:51:58] * MikeM hops out of the way of the hops
[23:52:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> so did i
[23:52:13] <thereallynewmop12100> RandomNinja: Or on Christmas Morning when the yule log airs on TV. Put the pot in front of the TV during the Yule Log
[23:52:30] <RandomNinja> MikeM, fancy hops for surprisingly cheap, yay

[23:53:20] <MikeM> I saw that. You've told us a few times.
[23:53:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> !t flac
[23:53:25] <DinkyBot> hacks flac radio of RandomNinja to wav and lq
[23:54:21] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: And also taking a break from Gmod until 2016 :(
[23:56:05] * RandomNinja steals Cloud_Zephyr's flacs
[23:56:12] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr, acquire HDTracks masters
[23:56:22] <Cloud_Zephyr> :P
[23:56:37] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: Because hl2.exe is missing and i have to reinstall it
[23:57:01] <RandomNinja> that takes like 10 minutes
[23:57:12] <MikeM> Yeah, that seems pretty easy.
[23:57:52] * RandomNinja applies 1.080 ipa to MikeM 
[23:58:04] <MikeM> Is that what you're making?
