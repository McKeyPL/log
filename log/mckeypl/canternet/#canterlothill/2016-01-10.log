[01:42:22] <Eywind> no
[01:42:26] <Coco`> ^
[01:42:28] <RandomNinja> then exercise
[01:42:32] <Coco`> ^
[01:42:47] <Coco`> Exercise can be fun
[01:43:00] <Silvy> You can come workout with me :P
[01:43:37] <RandomNinja> acquire bigger muscles, then you'll passively burn more calories and lose weight without eating less :P
[01:43:57] <Silvy> At that point, you'll need to eat more calories too.
[01:44:14] <RandomNinja> only to get bigger
[01:44:22] <Silvy> True.
[01:44:42] <RandomNinja> if your main goal is losing weight it's basically one long cut
[01:45:25] <Silvy> That is true, it's easier to do more reps to lose weight than to go to a bigger weight.
[01:46:19] <RandomNinja> although heavy lifts are fun ones :P
[01:47:37] <Silvy> Depending the lift in my opinion.
[01:47:38] <Silvy> :P
[01:47:53] <RandomNinja> 1RM deadlift best lift
[01:48:28] <Coco`> Isn't cardio better for weight loss?
[01:48:45] <Coco`> Or, like, aerobics
[01:48:46] <RandomNinja> actually not
[01:48:52] <Coco`> Hmm.
[01:48:59] <Silvy> Not really.
[01:49:03] <Coco`> I'm going off of information
[01:49:04] <RandomNinja> high intensity interval training is superior to sustained low intensity
[01:49:20] <Silvy> It's because your pushing your muscles to the limit for a short period of time.
[01:49:30] <RandomNinja> doesn't have to be lifting, something like incline sprints and stuff work as well and are also less boring
[01:49:31] <Coco`> Oh yeah that sounds about right
[01:49:46] <Silvy> Incline sprints suck/.
[01:50:12] <RandomNinja> cardio does help with endurance and recovery though, which in turn helps your HIIT
[01:50:31] <RandomNinja> hill running and such yeah, I was thinking more 100m sprints on minor inclines
[01:51:32] <wobniaR> There's a sprint track around where I live but having to get there is a walk itself
[01:51:37] <RandomNinja> run there

[01:51:52] <wobniaR> You know I'm lazy
[01:52:09] <RandomNinja> :P

[01:52:43] <RandomNinja> reward yourself with cookies for each mile
[01:53:04] <wobniaR> I took a mile and a half walk today and rewarded myself with a cheesesteak sandwich
[01:53:15] <RandomNinja> >walk
[01:53:23] <wobniaR> I don't walk slow
[01:53:48] <wobniaR> One does not live in a big city and walk slow, only tourists
[01:53:49] <RandomNinja> no but I mean that's not an effort

[04:24:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> I just really let myself veg out over the Holidays. I'm sitting on at least 4 other blog drafts, including one on the CMC's Hot Topic figures.
[04:24:52] <Hamtramck> Funko ones?
[04:32:44] <thereallynewmop12100> The chat is still quiet
[04:33:41] <Muffin_Spectacles> Hamtramck: Eeyup. I may try to combine them with my Maud and Cheese review.
[04:34:11] <Muffin_Spectacles> I'm still feeling that we should have gotten Funko figures of Zecora and Cheerilee by now.

[04:47:37] <Hamtramck> I feel like a lot of funko's pones are kind of chipmunky.
[04:47:50] <Hamtramck> Like Cadance looks fine.
[04:47:58] <Hamtramck> But I think Maud kind of has it going on
[04:51:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> Maud's face works good. Though I think the last three sculpts I really love, are Maud, Scootaloo, and Applebloom. 
[04:51:45] <Muffin_Spectacles> Applebloom just seems to work in 3 dimensions, and the detail in Scootaloo's swirly hair worked... sadly, Sweetie Belle didn't work out. :(
[04:52:28] <Hamtramck> I only have shining and cadance. they're, uh, sitting on top of my desktop PC tower case. with some other plastic horses.

[04:55:21] <MikeM> Forewarned is forearmed.
[05:00:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> Hamtramck: The sculpting was a bit average, but the paint job on the eyes was really off in places. And Sweetie Belle to me, is meant to trump Applebloom...but the Funko figure reminded me of the first time we ever saw AB onscreen.

[23:48:04] <LittlesToyCompany> Yeah James went on about happy holidays with his dumb cat in his arms and then had him push the button to start the clip. Made me want to punch the cat even more
[23:48:05] <Sombra> Or I guess in terms of villainousness, who's the better villain?
[23:48:06] <RandomNinja> worse as in bad or dangerous?
[23:48:14] <Sombra> Dangerous
[23:48:21] <Sombra> Most uh... evil, best at all of that.
