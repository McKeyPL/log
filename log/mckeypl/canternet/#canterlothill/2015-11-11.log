[04:31:33] <Jer> sounds like someone in the show got a pic on their Skype lol
[04:31:36] <EM-C> The appointment was for 2:30.  The doctor finally comes to the room at 4pm, looks in my mouth for about three minutes, said "Yeah, that needs to come out," and was done.  Fifty-five bucks.  Just for that.

[04:34:08] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Oh. good luck
[04:34:11] <EM-C> It was $55 bucks just to drive all the way up there and wait ninety minutes just to hear him say that.

[04:34:44] <EM-C> As I said, they make you come first for a "consultation" before they even make an appointment to actually do anything.
[04:35:27] <EM-C> The extraction is scheduled for next Monday morning.  Why did it take a special trip and a $55 fee just to basically make an appointment with them???

[04:38:02] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Guys, you should check out the video -- OBS is being all "I DUN WANNA" about showing it.  Epilepsy warning, tho.
[04:38:08] <EM-C> Actually, no.  I'm more upset about having to have a special extra five minute meeting today just for the doctor to tell me what I already knew.
[04:38:26] <Jer> -slowly fades back into the shadows-
[04:39:03] <EM-C> I saw the dentist yesterday.  That should have been enough.  There's simply no need having a "consultation" for five minutes and $55 before getting the tooth out.
[04:39:44] <EM-C> I used to be scared of the dentist because I thought I'd get bawled out for never taking care of my teeth.  Apparently they don't do that, and I'm glad.
[04:39:57] <EM-C> I imagine they know that I already know.
[04:40:37] <EM-C> They did ask today if I wanted to be put to sleep, laughing gas, or novocaine.
[04:40:47] <EM-C> I didn't even think they used laughing gas any more!
[04:41:20] <EM-C> Anyway, I told them no way I wanted to mess with that stuff.  Of course, if I thought I would actually see Pinkie, I might have tried it.
