[00:42:05] <Cloud_Zephyr> dumb cold can't taste anything
[00:42:11] <Cloud_Zephyr> i might as well be drinking hot water
[00:43:00] <RandomNinja> drink alcohols
[00:43:02] <FruitNibbler> It would be so cheap to not have taste
[00:43:15] <RandomNinja> but food would suck
[00:43:24] <FruitNibbler> Just drink water and eat the most basic nutrient-rich food
[00:44:04] <FruitNibbler> Not having to care about craving some bad food would be a plus too
[00:44:06] <RandomNinja> the entire point of taste is to find nutritious and calorie-dense food though
[00:44:28] <RandomNinja> also, avoid eating poison
[00:44:46] <FruitNibbler> Point is out of the window with current taste intensifiers
[00:45:02] <RandomNinja> yeah but evolution is slow
[00:45:36] <RandomNinja> !t evolution
[00:45:37] <DinkyBot> oh thats what that means! Midnight Madlibs! The one and only show you did a evolution on yourself.
[00:45:52] <FruitNibbler> Artificial sweeteners, chemical taste intensifiers those trick body into thinking the stuff is more nutritional than it is
[00:46:09] <FruitNibbler> Artificial sweeteners can cause diabetes 2 btw
[00:46:25] <RandomNinja> more than cane sugar?
[00:46:37] <RandomNinja> in proportional amounts, that is
[00:46:55] <FruitNibbler> Because body goes into the insulin shock each time you eat art.sweetener, but not get /any/ actual sugars to digest
[00:47:04] <RandomNinja> hm true
[00:47:26] <FruitNibbler> So with time body developes "insulin insensitivity"
[00:47:45] <FruitNibbler> And that is wxactly the diabetes type 2
[00:47:50] <FruitNibbler> exactly*
[00:48:12] <FruitNibbler> Luckily it is curable by changing back to healthy food
[00:48:52] * RandomNinja nibbles asparagus
[00:49:18] <FruitNibbler> Also there are a couple of studies that proved that diet soda is more likely to make you fat, and also diabetic along with that

[00:51:21] <FruitNibbler> Yeah I had made a mistake of drinking diet cola once
[00:51:35] <wobniaR> It has sugar and high fructose corn syrup
[00:51:38] <RandomNinja> ah
[00:51:46] <FruitNibbler> Had nothing else to drink after a very greasy döner kebap

[01:45:48] <FruitNibbler> I never thought there is some good beer left in Germaneigh

[01:45:55] <FruitNibbler> But I was proven wrong
[01:46:01] <RandomNinja> of course there is
[01:46:14] <RandomNinja> the cheap crap is just more widespread, like everywhere else
[01:46:23] <FruitNibbler> My old favourite "Köstrizer" is back to its former tasty glory
[01:46:33] <RandomNinja> I like Bocks
[01:46:34] <FruitNibbler> And I discovered "Franziskaner"

[01:46:55] <FruitNibbler> I guess hefe
[01:47:10] <FruitNibbler> Man that beer is like god's nectar
[01:47:14] <RandomNinja> yeah there's a dunkelweisse
[01:47:23] <FruitNibbler> Yup that one
[01:47:31] <FruitNibbler> It is very good
[01:47:41] <RandomNinja> also, weiss, weisse, weizen?
[01:47:46] <RandomNinja> is that dialectal or something?
[01:47:55] <RandomNinja> cuz I've seen all three
[01:48:48] <FruitNibbler> Weiss is just "white", weisse (Bier) relates to beer noun, thus other ending
[01:49:19] <FruitNibbler> Weizen means "wheat"
[01:49:31] <RandomNinja> ah

[01:51:18] <Hamtramck> is that bottle art sfw>:T
[01:51:29] <FruitNibbler> "Köstrizer" made out of run-of-the mill components is just an exceptionally bitter black crappy beer
[01:51:35] <RandomNinja> why wouldn't it?
[01:52:35] <FruitNibbler> It needs a specific wheat brand, and a specific grain size to get the taste it is known for

[20:32:03] <Violet_Twist> The whole 100th episode was several kinds of epic..
[20:32:04] <Lycan> This is an extended version of that, and it is awesome!
[20:32:26] <Violet_Twist> When I first watched it I had to keep pausing cause of moments of 'WHAT?!'
[20:32:34] <Lycan> Violet_Twist, it was awesome if you either 1. Got the references, or 2. Went and looked them up
[20:32:45] <Violet_Twist> I got the references.. for the most part xD
[20:32:54] <Violet_Twist> The bowling ones I didn't get till I watched the Bronies React to it.
[20:33:03] <Lycan> Watching it otherwise, it was still an awesome episode
