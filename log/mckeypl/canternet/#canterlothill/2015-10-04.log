[14:32:48] <RandomNinja> ew
[14:34:47] * RandomNinja accelerates Zuthal 
[14:35:21] <Zuthal> One of the worst things is groups of girls (it's ALWAYS girls) on campus, blocking the entire path/hallway/stairs just standing and chatting
[14:35:52] <RandomNinja> girls on campus? what's that?
[14:35:55] * RandomNinja violently STEMs
[14:36:00] <sunsetwubs> RandomNinja: is top nerd
[14:36:09] <sunsetwubs> aways will be top nerd P
[14:36:28] <Zuthal> Well, my university also has a faculty for economics and social studies
[14:36:32] <Zuthal> so they will be studying that
[14:36:32] <RandomNinja> also, in doorways
[14:36:39] <Zuthal> yup
[14:36:54] <Zuthal> in any of those cases, my standard solution is to just keep walking straight at a brisk pace
[14:36:57] <Zuthal> and push through
[14:37:09] <RandomNinja> we have that too, but it's located (read: quarantined) to the other end of campus
[14:37:26] <Zuthal> well, our campus is pretty small
[14:37:34] <RandomNinja> this is where being big pays off :P
[14:37:48] <RandomNinja> ours is like 1 km across
[14:37:50] <Zuthal> about, I dunno... 800 m by 200 m?
[14:38:15] <RandomNinja> yeah something similar
[14:38:29] <Zuthal> soft science is on one side of the canal that runs through, along with the main lecture halls, STEM, library and food place are on the other side
[14:38:36] <RandomNinja> then again there's a ton of women in biology
[14:38:54] <Zuthal> The softest of the natural sciences
[14:39:20] <Zuthal> then again, I'm studying bioengineering, and there's, like, under 10% girls in our course, iirc
[14:39:37] <RandomNinja> yeah that's because of the engineering suffix :P
[14:39:53] <Zuthal> heh
[14:40:11] <Zuthal> also, we're third semester and have I think lost, like, at least a fifth already
[14:40:56] <RandomNinja> we were 1 out of 12 at the start of first year
[14:41:13] <Zuthal> oh dear
[14:41:33] <RandomNinja> as in literally 1 of 12, not those proportions
[14:41:42] <Zuthal> At the start of the first semester, one of our professors outright said that "people who want it easy should go study Gender"
[14:42:36] <RandomNinja> well objectiveness is hard
[14:43:11] <RandomNinja> 2+2=4, can't argue around that
[14:43:18] <Zuthal> Yup.
[14:43:29] <RandomNinja> also electromagnetism is evil <.<
