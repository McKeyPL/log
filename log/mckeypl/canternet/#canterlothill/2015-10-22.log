[03:23:09] <Eywind> which is how I'd totally respond to that
[03:23:09] <MikeM> Yeah, that works, too.
[03:26:55] <MikeM> LPT: If you're traveling, and the shower is doesn't seem to get hot, turn on the cold faucet. Some places have them mixed up.
[03:27:09] <Eywind> TIL people don't know hot from cold
[03:27:40] <MikeM> If you hold hot in one hand, and cold in the other, it's hard to tell.
[03:27:55] <Eywind> I just feel my heart and compare
[03:27:57] <Eywind> if it's warmer than that, it's hot
[03:28:03] <MikeM> hahaha
[03:28:04] <Eywind> if it's colder than that, impossible
[03:29:00] <MikeM> The 3K of random space.
[03:29:09] <Snapai> And interlaced hot and cold sensations will set off your pain/burning receptors
[03:29:24] <Eywind> oo nice
[03:30:04] <Snapai> Like, get actively warmed comb-shaped pieces of metal, and put the tines together but not touching, and if you put your hand on it, you'll reflexively draw back like you touched a hot stove
[03:30:38] <Snapai> Despite them not having to be very different from ambient temperature
[03:30:46] <Snapai> Just "warm to the touch" and "cool to the touch" on their own

[03:31:52] <Hamtramck> man
[03:32:05] <Hamtramck> My foot's been jacked up all month but I still can't get over my walking addiction >:TTT
[03:32:12] <Eywind> probably why your foot is jacked up
[03:32:53] <EM-C> thereallynewmop12100: Well, the insurance is settled.  We both get our c-t's next Wed. at 9am.
[03:33:09] <EM-C> I'll be so glad when it's over with.
[03:33:16] <thereallynewmop12100> Yay, em-c
[03:33:23] <Hamtramck> oh that reminds me
[03:34:12] <Hamtramck> Company health insurance enrollment is going on. They offer this 1700USD per year plan. There's a similar plan that's only like 1300USD per year with a higher deductible but it's kind of a better deal. Only that one's hidden by default.
[03:34:26] <Eywind> Depends if you expect to use it or not
[03:34:42] <Eywind> Being someone who charges 70K in medical bills a year I always pay high payment low deductable lol
[03:34:52] <Hamtramck> Well yeah
[03:35:26] <Eywind> If you don't expect to use more than 400 more than the high payment's deductable+coinsurance then it's a better deal, assuming everything else is the same
[03:35:43] <Hamtramck> Yes.
[03:35:45] <EM-C> Next monday someone's coming down to shampoo the rugs.  I don't know where to go that day.  I'll just be in the way here.
[03:36:01] <EM-C> I have another appt but it's at 1pm that day.
[03:36:23] <Hamtramck> They had some other plans that were high deductible, low cost that weren't good deals.
[03:36:31] <Eywind> yeah just worth calculating out
[03:37:39] <Hamtramck> It's just weird cause hidden plan's /generally/ going to be the better deal unless you KNOW you're going to want the lower deductible
[03:37:46] <Hamtramck> so I'm not sure why they hid it by default.
[03:38:10] * Eywind shrug
[03:39:04] <Hamtramck> Then again there's basically zero internal websites at work that AREN'T garbage
[03:39:09] <Eywind>  yupp
[03:39:16] *** Joins: firestream (vinylderpy@Pony-8t4kl3.dsl.bell.ca)
[03:39:27] <Eywind> our insurance plans didn't change... except they jumped the deductible and coinsurance by 250 each
[03:40:43] <Hamtramck> Also I've still been having taxes withheld to Dublin all year without realizing it
[03:41:14] <Hamtramck> so I guess payroll's trying tofix that. Sounds like everyone is with holding taxes to Dublin.
[03:41:18] <Eywind> lol
[03:41:26] <Eywind> that sucks, but it'd get fixed during your local taxes anyways
[03:41:35] <Hamtramck> Yeah I'd just file for Columbus and pay.
[03:42:15] <Hamtramck> It's just annoying because I didn't feel like filing them this year because it's annoying to do so
[03:42:22] <Eywind> lol
[03:42:39] <Eywind> I'm not looking foward to taxes this coming year
[03:42:54] <Eywind> I mean I guess I kinda am
[03:42:56] <Hamtramck> (I THINK you don't have to file if you're paying the correct amount. Tax website's also jank)
[03:43:06] <Eywind> I have to file every year cuz it's always wrong
[03:43:06] <Hamtramck> Does your insurance payment affect tax returns?
[03:43:09] *** Away|Vigilant_Watch is now known as Vigilant_Watch
[03:45:30] <Eywind> no
[03:45:30] <Eywind> insurance is pre-tax
[03:45:30] <Hamtramck> Oh okay
[03:45:30] <Eywind> I'm more concerned about: Interest paid YTD	$5,423.86
[03:45:30] <Eywind> from my mortgage lol
[03:45:30] <Hamtramck> I still have no idea how taxes work
[03:45:38] <Hamtramck> I'm paying more in taxes than my mom even though I max like 600 less a month than her but it's okay because I always get ilke 2k back in tax returns and she has to pay more taxes when filing
[03:46:00] <Hamtramck> I'm assuming withholding amounts are decided by a random number generator and it just gets figured out later
[03:46:30] <MikeM> There's a calculator that's pretty accurate if your pay is steady.
[03:47:26] <Eywind> well it's some withholding # you provided when you started
[03:48:23] <Hamtramck> I think we got to pick that
[03:48:34] <Hamtramck> Like I vaguely recall getting three options and I just selected to withhold the most.
[03:48:40] <Hamtramck> Does that sound right?
[03:48:45] *** Parts: EM-C (xftjgmqvvcx@Pony-5s2tj9.mem.bellsouth.net) ()
[03:49:26] <Eywind> yeah that's probably why
[03:49:36] <Eywind> they're withholding more from your check for taxes, and that's why you get more back
[03:49:49] <Hamtramck> That sounds like what I would select if I had the option.
[03:49:58] <Eywind> It's a psychological thing
[03:50:01] <Hamtramck> I'd rather pay more up front and consistently get a return than have any /nasty surprises/ show up.
[03:50:03] <Eywind> you see less, and then you get more back at the end
[03:50:11] <MikeM> That's what I do.
[03:50:15] <Hamtramck> Also the IRS is from the 60s and you have to fax stuff to them because they're insane.
[03:50:31] <Hamtramck> So paying a hundred dollars a month extra in taxes so I don't have to deal with faxing things is worth it to me.
[03:50:45] <MikeM> Faxes? 
[03:51:33] <Eywind> you have faxed things?
[03:51:39] <Hamtramck> Wait no that was for Columbus.
[03:51:43] <Eywind> lol that makes no sense
[03:51:46] <Eywind> I've never had to fax anything for taxes
[03:52:21] <Hamtramck> You can mail it in but this was for an audit and I didn't want to deal with the extra time for mailing it

[03:55:40] <Eywind> you know, enjoyed some conversation, played a few games of chess
[03:55:40] <Eywind> etc.
[03:55:44] <Hamtramck> If you're having an affair with someone's mom
[03:55:50] <Hamtramck> and your primary concern is stealing their tax documents
[03:55:54] <Hamtramck> you need to get your priorites straight
[03:55:56] <Eywind> I'm an accountant
[03:55:59] <Eywind> let's be realistic here
[03:56:07] <Hamtramck> I think I mentioned this once but I got mailed something by the IRS once related to a bank account I wasn't aware I even had and basically the packet I got for them was in this open envelope with a bunch of stuff just spilling out
[03:56:18] <Eywind> hah
[03:56:21] <Eywind> that's weird
[03:56:25] <Hamtramck> So my first thought was like "Wait is this a scam?" Anyway I filed an extension becuase I was doing business travel at the time
[03:56:36] <Hamtramck> And they approved my extension like a month after I filed the thing they wanted anyway.
