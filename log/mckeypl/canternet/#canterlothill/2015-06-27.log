[20:33:46] <Lycan[LDB]LIVE> ^
[20:33:51] <Lycan[LDB]LIVE> Yeah, this is an amazing song
[20:33:52] <SpectraMusic> hmm, sounds a bit autotuned though
[20:33:59] <MikeM> Quite
[20:34:00] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> I think that was the idea X3
[20:34:21] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> I think it makes it seem creepy :'D
[20:34:38] <Buffalo> autotune is life
[20:34:45] <Buffalo> im an untalented crawfish
[20:34:58] <Buffalo> this is a direct quote from someone describing me hehe
[20:35:10] <SpectraMusic> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLMvyX5yqXI reminds me off this too
[20:35:10] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Daylight's End
[20:35:41] <DrelvanianGuard> XD
[20:35:42] <SpectraMusic> *of
[20:35:55] <Lycan[LDB]LIVE> Such a good song to finish our theme on
[20:36:01] <Buffalo> i would rather an autotuned version than an off pitch natural song
[20:36:31] <SpectraMusic> I suppose, and she has enough power in her voice to make it sound good too
[20:36:38] <wobniaR> Woo requests
[20:36:46] <DrelvanianGuard> FritzyBeat[LDB]Live isnt changing lyrics to someones song technically copyright infringement?
[20:37:05] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> nope, unless you take the original instrumental and try to sell it

[20:37:14] <wobniaR> This is the original
[20:37:15] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> it's like what Weird Al does
[20:37:17] <Buffalo> es pretty
[20:37:20] <SpectraMusic> It's just sometimes I'm not too keen on people marketing themselves as singers but using autotune
[20:37:23] <SpectraMusic> but whatever
[20:37:37] <DrelvanianGuard> i guess thats true..
[20:37:38] <DrelvanianGuard> so i guess I have to learn blackhole sun then..
[20:37:43] <Buffalo> autotuning is part of music
[20:37:51] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> lol, yeah, I didn't think Lycan would find the remix. It's only on Soundcloud after all
[20:37:54] <Buffalo> its like an edm artist saying im a musician
[20:37:58] <Buffalo> kek inb4 flamewar
[20:38:00] <DrelvanianGuard> Kanye West... because autotune cant fix everything
[20:38:05] <ChordCatcher> I like the idea of autotune but not how badly it get's abused
[20:38:25] <Buffalo> most people who sing use melodyne anyway
[20:38:31] <DrelvanianGuard> Autotune should be used for special effects in electronic songs...
[20:38:33] <wobniaR> Yeah that's true, soundcloud has the download link
[20:38:44] <Buffalo> as long as it sounds good, it shouldnt matter what the person uses
[20:38:45] <wobniaR> https://soundcloud.com/thomashoodmusic/backtoliferemix
[20:38:49] <DrelvanianGuard> thats how it was used in the 80s, thats how its suppose to be used
[20:38:52] <SpectraMusic> we could probably find somewhere else to continue this discussion unless everyone wants us to keep talking about it here

[20:39:29] <DrelvanianGuard> technically in essence of the word "Musician" it means someone skilled with music
[20:39:33] <Buffalo> an awesome example would be Whatcha Say by Jason Derulo
[20:39:37] <DrelvanianGuard> EDM requires some skill
[20:39:46] <Buffalo> autotune over 9000 but its sounds awesome
[20:39:49] <DrelvanianGuard> just less skill than say, Guitar, or Bagpipes
[20:40:09] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> I wouldn't say that
[20:40:10] <SpectraMusic> DrelvanianGuard: well, different kind of skill really
[20:40:15] <ChordCatcher> Whatcha say is a good example of autotune overuse
[20:40:16] <Buffalo> so autotune and melodyne require no skill? lol, even those have some technical know how
[20:40:26] <DrelvanianGuard> i have seen some pretty talented EDM artists.. but alot of them do pretty easy work
[20:40:40] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> I'd say they're pretty equal as far as skill goes, it's just that working in a DAW gives you more access to artificial instruments.
[20:40:40] <One-Trick> melodyne still requires someone with tech knowledge, its not that smart
[20:40:44] <DrelvanianGuard> requires alot of quick finger work and an ear for music i guess
[20:41:02] <DrelvanianGuard> i watch vids of people using launchpads sometimes..
[20:41:05] <wobniaR> Garage band is da bes DAW

[20:41:31] <ChordCatcher> just, yes
[20:41:31] <Lycan[LDB]LIVE> bwahaha
[20:41:32] <SpectraMusic> often producing music involves the post-production skill as well
[20:41:33] <One-Trick> without melodyne, whoever has to sit through my scratch vocals would prolly kill themself

[20:42:10] <wobniaR> Yay
[20:42:11] <DrelvanianGuard> I think Garage Band is nice, but I prefer Grunge Band or Hardrock Band

[20:44:23] <Buffalo> but sounded good nonetheless
[20:45:28] <DrelvanianGuard> If you use Autotune, you would be considered either an electronic artist, or a beginner singer that likes computers
[20:45:29] <DrelvanianGuard> a pro singer is what you would be called.. by yourself, if you are Kanye West
[20:45:59] <Buffalo> but jason derulo can sing without autotune
[20:46:04] <DrelvanianGuard> buffalo will be at a convention like "BlackGryph0n, I'mma let you finish, but Beyonce iss one of the best brony artists of all time"
[20:46:09] <Buffalo> he just chose to use it cause it sounded nice

[20:47:11] <DrelvanianGuard> I wonder if the singer in this is using Autotune.. >_>
[20:47:20] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> HAHA
[20:47:22] <wobniaR> It's intentionally used
[20:47:32] <wobniaR> More for the effect 
[20:47:42] <SpectraMusic> for a vocal effect yeah, she also sings without it though
[20:47:46] <wobniaR> Autotune adds that metallic voice effect
[20:47:48] <DrelvanianGuard> *stares at one hand* Buffalo *stares at other hand* Buffalo Brony.. wiat is that you
[20:48:03] <DrelvanianGuard> if so nice flow bro
[20:48:08] <Buffalo> now im wondering if pony rap god went through >.>
[20:48:24] <Buffalo> the version on youtube is no bueno
[20:48:31] <Buffalo> i put a better version of entropy on bandcamp
[20:48:47] <Vaceslav> it's possible to get similar effects with other plugins
[20:49:10] <Vaceslav> but there is autotune on her voice for sure
[20:49:17] <DrelvanianGuard> I think ill stick with natural sound..
[20:49:25] <DrelvanianGuard> til I can fix my electric guitar and get an amp anyway
