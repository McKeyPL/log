[03:37:29] <Eywind> wat
[03:37:29] <FruitNibbler> Although I've been to Germany longer than I've been anywhere else so far...
[03:37:30] <Scootaloo> Unless you like graduation ceremonies
[03:37:37] <Eywind> it's your graduation
[03:37:47] <Eywind> I'd probably go to that
[03:37:48] <Sombra> Eywind
[03:37:50] <Eywind> it'll only happen like 2-3 times
[03:37:53] <Night_Killer> Lol
[03:37:55] <Eywind> Sombra, how is the con?
[03:38:02] <Sombra> I think I made a mistake
[03:38:05] <Eywind> ?
[03:38:07] <Eywind> what'd you do?
[03:38:24] <Sombra> Also I met someone wearing a full sombra fursuit

[03:38:50] <Eywind> Nice
[03:38:54] <MikeM> Where's the mistake?
[03:38:54] <Night_Killer> Ok and graduation is at 3pm est
[03:38:59] <Sombra> Also I think I made a mistake coming here
[03:39:08] <Night_Killer> I think I can do both
[03:39:09] <Eywind> sounds like you've had a decent time so far
[03:39:19] <Eywind> umm Night_Killer when do you have to show up though?
[03:39:26] <Eywind> I had to get there really early
[03:39:26] <Sombra> Not really, I bought the thing but it wasn't very exciting
[03:39:42] <Night_Killer> I have to be there by 3pm and it starts at 4pm
[03:39:43] <MikeM> Sombra, you're gonna be there for Larson's "Uncomfortable Panel"
[03:39:43] <Sombra> Also I don't know anyone to socialize with
[03:39:56] <Eywind> Just umm
[03:39:59] <Eywind> Yeah IDK that's hard
[03:40:01] <Sombra> And that seems like the main reason people come here

[03:40:16] <Sombra> That's what I heard
[03:40:17] <Eywind> It's good to meet people if you're an extrovert
[03:40:23] <Sombra> But I don't think it is.
[03:40:25] <Eywind> Sombra, have you been going to the panels and stuff?
[03:40:28] <Regulus> !t two feet
[03:40:30] <DinkyBot> so i feel like you were typing with your feet nor a ball
[03:40:32] <Sombra> I went to a few
[03:40:41] <Eywind> Have you tried the game room or something like that?
[03:40:53] <Sombra> I don't play the card game
[03:41:01] <Eywind> they don't have a video game room?
[03:41:07] <Sombra> No
[03:41:15] <MikeM> What about finding someone who laughs at the same things you do. At a panel.
[03:41:15] <Night_Killer> Can I get someone to read a background story and critique it please
[03:41:38] <Sombra> You can't really talk during a panel
[03:41:52] <MikeM> But after...
[03:42:07] <Sombra> Yeah I still don't know anyone after
[03:42:26] <Eywind> talk to people? :/
[03:42:33] <Eywind> maybe try the commons areas?
[03:42:46] <Eywind> I don't know man I'm not great with social stuff 
[03:42:48] <Sombra> That's usually where I've been hanging out between panels
[03:43:04] <Scootaloo> You don't strike me as an extrovert Sombra, my advice is go to a few panels, enjoy what you can then go to you hotel room/home
[03:43:31] <Sombra> There was some musicy type thing in the mane room, I was in there for a few minutes but it was pretty boring
[03:43:39] <Eywind> ah the concerts?

[03:44:15] <Sombra> I didn't know the music, and its not like there was dancing or anything except for a few people up front
[03:44:38] <Eywind> well you don't have to like the music to enjoy it
[03:44:45] <Eywind> err

[03:45:23] <Sombra> I don't know what I was supposed to do
[03:45:29] <Eywind> Just stand/sit and listen?
[03:45:32] <Eywind> Just do what you want man
[03:45:50] <Sombra> It's really hard to pay attention to.
[03:45:52] <Eywind> oh wait minnesota is central, so it should be d.notive
[03:45:57] <MikeM> Or, and it might be late, but ask the con staff if they need any volunteers.
[03:46:04] <Eywind> I was looking for Friday instead of Saturday
[03:46:25] <Sombra> I guess
[03:46:32] <MikeM> Then you're working with people who have common interests and goals.
[03:46:46] <Sombra> Couldn't hurt to ask
[03:46:56] <Eywind> just know that you'll have a lot of expectations
[03:47:23] <Eywind> Sombra you live in the area, right?

[03:52:01] <Night_Killer> It's something I've been working on since I first became a brony

[03:55:18] <Eywind> enough of that

[03:55:51] <Sombra> Most original back story

[03:56:21] <MikeM> I made reservations
[03:56:27] <Regulus> Ha
[03:56:37] <Night_Killer> Critiques make me better
[03:57:11] <Eywind> Well is your OC supposed to be your fanfiction dreams or a realistic representation of a character in equestria?
[03:57:19] <Night_Killer> If you saw what NK started off to what he is now you'd see a huge change in him
[03:57:21] <Eywind> If it's the former then you're not going to get anywhere with critiques because it's really whatever you want to be
[03:57:36] <Regulus> I make it a habit not to proof-read for anyone but close friends/acquaintances 
[03:57:37] <Eywind> but if it's the latter then you're not going to ever get facetime with Princess Luna, especially not that kind of face time

[03:58:31] <Regulus> And bad narrative...
[03:58:33] <Sombra> How are you going to do that?
[03:58:50] <MikeM> Night_Killer, do you mean "Into the show" as really, actually, in the show?
[03:59:11] <Night_Killer> Yes actually in the actual hasbro mlp show
[03:59:19] <Eywind> There's a 0% chance that will happen

[03:59:28] <Eywind> Sorry, but it's literally not something they can do
[03:59:34] <Regulus> What Eywind said
[03:59:38] <Night_Killer> Correction there's a 5% chance
[03:59:48] <Regulus> 0%
[03:59:53] <Sombra> Do you personally know anyone who works in the show?
[03:59:54] <Regulus> Legal reasons
[04:00:09] <Sombra> Or anyone who works at Hasbro?

[04:01:21] <Sombra> Unless you know someone who works at Hasbro anyway
[04:01:25] <Night_Killer> It's called giving up my rights to the character
[04:01:34] <Eywind> Night_Killer it's not worth their money going through the legal actions for that
[04:01:36] <Regulus> Still a hastle
[04:02:01] <Regulus> They have a strict policy on that subject
[04:02:04] <Eywind> ^
[04:02:42] <MikeM> But, hey, mail your ideas to Hasbro. What do you have to lose?
[04:02:53] <Regulus> Not sure who, but someone on staff said they're prohibited from even browsing fanfiction to avoid legal challenges. 
[04:03:01] <Night_Killer> Nothing to lose
[04:04:17] <Eywind> Remaining continuously delusional is just going to let you down later
[04:04:29] <Eywind> Instead of just understanding now it's not possible and working towards making something more organic for yourself
[04:04:30] <Regulus> Besides, best advice I can possibly give is this: don't write because you want something from someone. Write because you want something from yourself.
[04:04:40] <MikeM> ^
[04:05:08] <MikeM> That's advice for just about anything. Except for sales. Then you better figure out what other people want.
[04:05:29] <Regulus> It generates better content that you're more satisfied with.

[04:06:11] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> o_o
[04:06:18] <Eywind> wat
[04:06:24] <Regulus> Because in the end, writing is personal. If you remove that element, it's like the soul of the work is gone.
[04:06:27] <MikeM> And the "What other people want" thing is important here. Why does Hasbro want what you have?

[04:06:54] <MikeM> Why can't they just make up some guard and backstory as necessary, if necessary?

[04:15:37] <Regulus> Or people I've got common interests with

[04:16:21] <Sombra> I don't know who that is
