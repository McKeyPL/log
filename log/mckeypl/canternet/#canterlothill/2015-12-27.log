[00:00:29] <Winter_Nights> Just a random idea, but hear me out. Equestria... Isn't real. It's all made up by an eeeeeevil corporation who're trying to take over the world. A bit like the Truman show, but larger.

[00:01:09] <Silver-Spoon> Did anyone else notice that Luna seemed to age really quickly when she got back? 
[00:01:23] <Muffin_Spectacles> Silver-Spoon: Simple: Gravity.
[00:01:25] <wobniaR> There was an appearance change, not rapid aging
[00:01:29] <RandomNinja> Magic withdrawal, not even once
[00:01:47] <wobniaR> They basically decided "Hey we're gonna change Luna's appearance for her s2 debut"
[00:01:55] <Silver-Spoon> She went from teen filly appearance to adult. Seems aging to me.
[00:02:06] <wobniaR> Then it was written off as "She regained her magic powers" or whatever
[00:02:19] <wobniaR> It's an unofficial thing
[00:02:25] <wobniaR> But about as official as it can get
[00:02:33] <Winter_Nights> Tbh, I like that explanation 
[00:02:47] <wobniaR> AKA someone asked the writers of the show that same question and they were like "Yeah sure"
[00:03:11] <RandomNinja> When in doubt, use more magic
[00:03:14] <wobniaR> ^
[00:03:16] <Silver-Spoon> I liked cute young Luna, but confused older Luna is just as good.
[00:03:17] <wobniaR> And SCIENCE
[00:03:26] <RandomNinja> Science the magic
[00:03:46] <Silver-Spoon> Equestria Twilight trying to science friendship is like "what did you forget everything are you ash ketchum omg"
[00:04:31] <RandomNinja> Pretty sure you can actually science friendship tho
[00:04:35] <wobniaR> She's a magical horse that tries to science things
[00:04:45] <wobniaR> Because magic is a science
[00:05:02] <wobniaR> It's just a really hard to figure out science

[00:05:19] <RandomNinja> Almost certainly
[00:05:20] <Muffin_Spectacles> That could be a plotpoint: 'buying friendship.'

[04:19:10] <FruitNibbler> Might have other meanings I don't yet know
[04:19:21] <Toby_SC> excuse me is ursäkta mig
[04:19:29] <Toby_SC> excuses is ursäkter
[04:19:54] <FruitNibbler> Isn't it used as "excuse me" in spoken language though?
[04:20:18] <FruitNibbler> It's just englishmen do not say it without "me"
[04:20:45] <Araxnus> Ohh "Playing With Fire" this will be fun

[04:30:59] <LetsEatHay> that's cool :)
[04:31:18] <Araxnus> I can hear it by the start already
[04:32:04] <Toby_SC> woah nice choice draft

[04:34:45] <Toby_SC> everytime I dream I believe have smoked something
[04:34:59] <FinalDraft> I love that song
[04:34:59] <LetsEatHay> lol why
[04:35:02] <FinalDraft> very uplifting
[04:35:26] <Araxnus> This is how I can tell the better stufs has hit
[04:35:48] <FinalDraft> Boom Jinx up and released a killer album this yeaer
[04:36:00] <FinalDraft> These next tracks are vocal hits
[04:36:27] <Not3worthy> Only in Texas can you have a Tornado Watch and a Blizzard Warning less than 100 miles away from each other
[04:36:46] <Araxnus> Vocal Trance has to be my fav.
[04:37:02] <LetsEatHay> ^
[04:37:17] <Not3worthy> I like music trance.  Vocal, especially if I'm really trying to chill after a long day, needs to be subdued and calming
[04:37:30] <Araxnus> Indeed.
[04:38:08] <FinalDraft> I put this one at 12 because of the vocal harmonies and trance driving feel
[04:38:29] <Not3worthy> I don't know a lot about the genre, but my impression so far is that it's meant to calm and relax, as well as get my creativity that might have gotten beaten up by the day stimulated
[04:38:33] <Araxnus> Well earned.
[04:38:44] <LetsEatHay> those harmonies are sweet
[04:39:34] <Not3worthy> I'm also a *VERY* finicky music listener.  I give tunes that I get from EqD twenty-thirty seconds to impress me.  They fail, I don't finish listening to it/add it to my playlist
[04:40:02] <thereallynewmop12100> How many songs are currently left?
[04:40:12] <FinalDraft> lol this is rank 12
[04:40:13] <FinalDraft> guess
[04:40:25] <LetsEatHay> reminds me of sarah mclaughlin or however you spell it
[04:40:34] <Not3worthy> Now, now, Drafty-kun, remember we live in the day of Common Core and new math XD

[04:41:43] <Not3worthy> I say that lovingly
[04:41:52] <Eywind> This guy
[04:42:46] <Not3worthy> Sorta reminds me of Approaching Nirvana
[04:44:48] <FinalDraft> I love this song, and it's appropriate because the next one begins the top 10!
[04:45:16] <LetsEatHay> 5 against 4
[04:45:36] <LetsEatHay> or it was 6 i guess

[22:33:13] <thereallynewmop12100> techniponi: Hello. 
[22:33:16] <DinkyDoo> I hear there will be thereallynewmop12100
[22:33:19] <techniponi> ohai
[22:33:45] <thereallynewmop12100> techniponi: Is your show playing on PVFM tonight? 
[22:34:35] <techniponi> yep, in about... 26 minutes
[22:35:08] <thereallynewmop12100> techniponi: Okay... 
[22:35:19] <thereallynewmop12100> techniponi: But i gotta listen to your show later on, okay?
[22:35:20] <RandomNinja> JoJo: yes, there's a menu included for pretty much all the things
[22:35:30] <JoJo> Oh cool
[22:35:42] <RandomNinja> including customizing difficulty affecting things like damage and drop rates
[22:35:52] <JoJo> I might do that, I have to look into setting up controller play on steam 
[22:35:53] * DerpyBot sits down with DinkyBot to go through her homework with her
[22:35:53] <DinkyBot> Momma, this is hard stuff! Can I have a muffin, pwease?
[22:36:08] <RandomNinja> many controllers are just plug and play
[22:36:35] <JoJo> I use the dualshock 4, which works with steam but some games I think need to be set up
[22:36:37] <RandomNinja> I don't really use controllers but the few games I've tried have worked instantly
[22:36:45] <RandomNinja> 360 controller tho

[22:37:09] <JoJo> Like the game I was playing yesterday said it supported controllers but wouldn't read mine
[22:37:16] <RandomNinja> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/luG4WpIzl5A/maxresdefault.jpg
[22:37:25] <JoJo> so I think I might have to get motioninjoy
[22:38:10] <RandomNinja> I think there are free programs for controller mapping
[22:41:28] <JoJo> the ps4 controller is usually ready to go on steam

[22:54:44] <RandomNinja> Eywind: any idea about what's happening with Razor Radio?
[22:55:01] <Eywind> Not 100% sure; I thougth I had it on the schedule for today but apparently I don
[22:55:03] <Eywind> don't
[22:56:10] <RandomNinja> this radio channel suffers from severe iron deficiency
[22:56:34] <Eywind> I sent him a skype seeing what's up.  He's got things working properly now
