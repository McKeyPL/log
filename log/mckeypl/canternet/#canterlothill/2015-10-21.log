[20:27:32] <FruitNibbler> I suspect you can't make a real 30/70 torque split with gears
[20:27:56] * RandomNinja splits FruitNibbler 
[20:28:36] <FruitNibbler> Most transmissions seem to be just clutches that release the part of the drivetrrain that is slipping
[20:29:26] <FruitNibbler> The thing is: you convert speed into torque or vice versa
[20:29:56] <FruitNibbler> So you can't have different torque in front and rear wheels and have them spin at the same speed

[20:59:47] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: Wow
[21:01:01] <JockeTF> GNOME Shell always need some fixing since they disabled all plugins after upgrades. :)
[21:01:12] <JockeTF> I use quite a few of those, so it takes a little while. :)
[21:03:29] <FruitNibbler> So to make differential biased to one side and allow a reductor on one side,, you need to connect outputs...
[21:03:46] <FruitNibbler> And add another lockable differential to it :S
[21:04:06] <FruitNibbler> Damn AWD or 4WD snowballs fast when you start to ratio
[21:05:08] <Zuthal> Solution: Do away with the differential altogether, have an efficient reciprocating or gas turbine engine driving an alternator and an electric motor for each wheel
[21:05:15] <Zuthal> also gives you full torque over the whole speed range
[21:05:37] <Zuthal> and probably better fuel efficiency since the prime mover can always operate at peak efficiency
[21:05:47] <FruitNibbler> Having 4 individual electric motors in all wheels is the best soution
[21:06:03] <FruitNibbler> But we don't have good enough batteries yet
[21:06:44] <Zuthal> Well, you won't need that much battery storage
[21:07:01] <Zuthal> since you'll have a combustion engine powering a generator to produce the power
[21:07:02] <FruitNibbler> The way most AWD cars redistribute torque between wheels today is by the means of clutch plates
[21:07:46] <FruitNibbler> Each wheel has its own clutch, and as it starts to slip, the clutch disengages and torque is available ony to wheels with traction
[21:07:57] <Zuthal> hmm, interesting
[21:08:10] <Cloud_Zephyr> i decided to update java
[21:08:12] <FruitNibbler> Not exactly a rocket science
[21:08:20] <Zuthal> though with an electric AWD you could of course simply smoothly reduce power as wheels begin to slip
[21:08:27] <FruitNibbler> And has heat losses, but it just works
[21:08:30] <Zuthal> and have much finer control
[21:08:33] <Cloud_Zephyr> luckily i'm too clever for their yahoo toolbar
[21:08:45] <FruitNibbler> Kind of reversely-complementary system to ABS
[21:08:58] <Zuthal> Mhm, makes sense.
[21:09:16] <Zuthal> I mean... you'll prolly still want batteries as a buffer for transients
[21:09:24] <Zuthal> (e.g. starting from a standstill)
[21:09:26] <FruitNibbler> The differential systems are still used though
[21:09:39] <Zuthal> but electromotors would of course also allow easy regenerative braking
[21:09:46] <FruitNibbler> In real offroaders with like 6x6 arrangement for example
[21:10:11] <Zuthal> 6x6? As in, three wheels on each side?
[21:10:25] <FruitNibbler> 4 in the back and 2 in front
[21:10:36] <FruitNibbler> much like your lorries or trucks
[21:11:55] <Zuthal> ahh
[21:12:09] <FruitNibbler> Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG 6x6 has 5 differentials in it to have 31/42/27 torque distribution between axles
