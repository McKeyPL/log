[03:11:42] <EM-C> Feeling a little better than I was.  Holidays are very depressing to me now.
[03:12:01] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Why?
[03:12:14] <EM-C> It got really hot here today.  I had to put the house thermostat on the summer setting.
[03:12:47] <EM-C> Oh.  My little family is so small and my life has been a disaster.  Holidays are mileposts to oblivion to me now.
[03:12:53] <EM-C> Not literally, but that's how it feels.
[03:13:03] <EM-C> And I'm in bad physical shape of course.
[03:13:19] <EM-C> My life is just a wash-out.  And holidays make it worse.

[03:14:36] <EM-C> I'm actually so much better off that so many people, but I'm in bad shape, my mother is aging, and as I said, my life just didn't turn out like I wanted it to.
[03:14:48] <EM-C> And holidays remind us how fast time is passing.
[03:15:10] <EM-C> Just my mother, sister, and brother-in-law.  Such a tiny little family left.

[18:52:03] <Hamtramck> Mostly I'm thinking the reason I quit playing it the first time -- right after you do that mission with the ghouls going into space -- was because of how huge/empty/one note the maps started getting, also all the little skill level gates.
[18:52:09] <RandomNinja> inb4 Communism Prime
[18:52:25] <Zuthal> prolly, like, pictures and statues of Mao everywhere since this will be modeled after 1950s red china then
[18:52:48] <RandomNinja> yeah that's probably the biggest issue NV has, too much empty space
[18:53:16] * Zuthal places RandomNinja on the Infinite Featureless Plane of Death
[18:53:38] * RandomNinja applies Chairman Cheng to Zuthal 
[18:53:46] *** Joins: Gladiolus (uid110916@the.truth.is.out.there)
[18:53:47] <Zuthal> yay?
[18:54:04] <Hamtramck> Also not really digging the combat much, everything seems super-jerky if you're trying to manually aim?
[18:54:16] <RandomNinja> the chinese military and possibly political leader
[18:54:28] <RandomNinja> check your mouse acceleration
[18:54:36] <Hamtramck> I turned that off in the config files
[18:54:48] *** Joins: MikeM (A@watcher.in.the.water)
[18:55:02] <wobniaR> I find fallout 4 feels weird when it comes to manual aiming
[18:55:03] <RandomNinja> hm
[18:55:11] <RandomNinja> !t MikeM 
[18:55:12] <DinkyBot> ships MikeM to space
[18:55:23] <MikeM> Yay!
[18:55:24] <wobniaR> It has slowed down iron sights/scoped movement speed compared to new vegas
[18:55:32] <Hamtramck> Also something with te hitboxes feels off too?
[18:55:40] <RandomNinja> that's good though imo
[18:55:53] <RandomNinja> feels more like a proper fps
[18:55:55] <Hamtramck> Yeah I wsh the iron sights was slower in NV. That's my problem with it
[18:56:04] <wobniaR> It's more "realistic" but good i disagree
[18:56:17] <Hamtramck> It's not a quesiton of realism its easier to aim when you're moving slower
[18:56:46] <Hamtramck> or do fine mouse movements
[18:56:47] <wobniaR> It's easier to aim if you don't move at all and crouch
[18:57:08] <Hamtramck> But yeah like when enemies are attacking you in melee it feels they're going inside of your hitbox an it's hard to hit them?
[18:57:11] <RandomNinja> you could probably adjust that in config
[18:57:23] <Hamtramck> It's like that thing in Vice City where if you shot someone at point blank you'd shoot through them and it wouldn't actually register.
[18:57:29] <wobniaR> Oh the new vegas melee is definitely borked
[18:57:43] <wobniaR> Same with 3
[18:57:44] <RandomNinja> 4 is even worse tho
[18:57:53] <RandomNinja> I can hit enemies in vats 10 meters away sometimes
[18:58:09] <wobniaR> One word: bethesda
[18:58:27] <wobniaR> Still better than skyrim melee
[18:58:36] <Hamtramck> Oh I was gonna go somewhere but it started raining, oh welpers
[19:00:16] <wobniaR> I'll go back to 4 eventually but i'd rather spend my time finishing witcher 3 and its dlc first
[19:00:24] <RandomNinja> skyrim: mostly based around melee. melee is bad
[19:00:26] <RandomNinja> welp
[19:00:46] <wobniaR> Pls skyrim melee is junk when you have the mighty sneaky sneak bow & arrow
[19:00:58] <RandomNinja> stealth archer op
[19:01:22] <wobniaR> Godmode through the game with stealth archer, heavy armor melee and magic is for milk drinkers
[19:01:50] <RandomNinja> breton + elemental resist armor is basically godmode as well
[19:01:55] <RandomNinja> you get like 95% resistance to all
[19:02:22] <wobniaR> Breton stealth archer confirmed best dragonborn
[19:03:24] <RandomNinja> can pretty much walk up to powerful spellcasters and punch them to death
[19:03:37] <wobniaR> Really what killed skyrim for me after a few playthroughs is how nothing rewarding exists in most of the dungeons
[19:03:47] <wobniaR> Which are filled with generic enemies anyway
[19:03:53] <RandomNinja> also I like that Fallout 4 power armor gives bonus unarmed damage
[19:04:23] <wobniaR> Bandits draugr and those falmer make up most of your enemies encountered
[19:04:32] <RandomNinja> what do you mean, aren't you excited about dungeon #318 full of Draugr?
[19:04:47] <wobniaR> My favorite
[19:05:09] <wobniaR> Time to stealth roll through and noscope every one of them down
[19:05:37] <RandomNinja> I got about 100 hours out of Skyrim, definitely got my moneys worth at least
[19:05:57] <wobniaR> I got 157 so i'm not complaining about that
[19:06:00] <RandomNinja> just that I got, like, 300 out of NV and it still doesn't feel exhausted yet
[19:06:54] <RandomNinja> also 75 hours of fallout 4 and it feels like I barely scratched the surface
[19:07:06] <wobniaR> Well it is new
[19:07:16] <RandomNinja> yeah but game time
[19:07:28] <RandomNinja> at 75 hours in skyrim I felt done
[19:07:54] <RandomNinja> I wonder how much time I put into Oblivion though
[19:08:27] <RandomNinja> quite possibly over 1000
