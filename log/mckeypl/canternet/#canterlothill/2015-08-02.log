[05:29:00] <RandomNinja> what period?
[05:29:44] <Hickory> Come to think of it...
[05:29:45] <RandomNinja> Fallout is late 23rd century in an alternate timeline diverging in the 1950's
[05:29:52] <Hickory> Fallout, the bombs dropped in 2077
[05:31:13] <Hickory> 1950's?

[05:31:42] <Hickory> designed earlier than that.
[05:31:58] <RandomNinja> Fallout is culturally stuck in the 50's, as well as 50's futurism happening
[05:32:20] <RandomNinja> most other things are fairly similar, especially early
[05:32:32] <Hamtramck> Wasteland felt decidedly 70s.
[05:32:37] <Hamtramck> I wanna see a fallout game do that tbh

[05:32:48] <Hickory> m249 was designed in 1976
[05:32:51] <RandomNinja> but why though?
[05:32:55] <Hickory> So I'd call an m60 much more period correct.

[07:42:27] <Vulpor> Ronda Rousey has won tonight
[07:42:33] <Vulpor> in 34 seconds
[07:43:08] <Eywind> Sorry chat is dead, and hi
[07:43:15] <Eywind> and yeah that was expected she'd dominate
[07:43:56] <Hamtramck> I had a dream that Hulk Hogan died like a week or two ago
[07:45:03] <Vulpor> Shhhhhhhhhhhh
[07:45:22] <Vulpor> Don't jinx it Hamtramck
[07:45:36] <Vulpor> Celeberty deaths all go in threes
[07:45:44] <Eywind> or they don't.
[07:45:51] <Eywind> Or it's just trying to find patterns in things
[07:46:10] <Vulpor> So let us all hope that our favorites live a bit longer
[07:46:42] <Vulpor> I still say Vince Mcmahon is gonna outlive everyone
[07:46:53] <Vulpor> and by everyone I mean everyone
[07:47:07] <Vulpor> He will be the omega man
[07:47:34] <Vulpor> Anyway I was happy my girl won and happy I did not pay to see it'
[07:47:43] <Vulpor> I went to a bar
[07:47:47] <Eywind> meh you never have to actually pay to watch a fight
[07:47:50] <Eywind> either go to a bar or stream it
[07:48:04] <Vulpor> Because I lived through Tyson
[07:48:12] <Vulpor> I do not pay for fights
[07:48:29] <Vulpor> 34 seconds is not worth 40 dollars
[07:48:39] <Eywind> you get all the fights for the night
[07:48:41] <Eywind> not just the marquee
[07:48:42] <Eywind> but yeah I agree
[07:49:09] <Vulpor> Which by the way Ronda is under 30 minutes for her total fight time in UFC

[07:51:27] <Vulpor> Since this is a music themed chat Ponyphonic has put out a new song
[07:51:37] <Vulpor> Although not Pony related
[07:51:48] <Eywind> well it's not really 'music-themed', although it's more centric than most chats
[07:52:18] <Vulpor> I highly reccomend it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcMmrw4lWq0
