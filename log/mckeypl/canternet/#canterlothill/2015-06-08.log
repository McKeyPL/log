[01:21:45] <Sombra> Kinda bad to be honest.
[01:21:53] <LunaticHell> Except maybe watch Neon Evangelium Genesis, I won't do that.
[01:22:30] <LunaticHell> What's nibbling on your tail, then?
[01:22:58] <Sombra> Yesterday my cz-75 broke

[01:23:44] <Sombra> Probably, that's gonna cost too much though.  Hopefully CZ will just send me a replacement spring
[01:24:13] <LunaticHell> Oh, the spring, I see.
[01:25:01] <Sombra> Hopefully they're not going to make me send it in to get the replacement, then it's gonna be weeks.  I that's the case I'll just fork up 7$ plus shipping and get the american made music wire spring
[01:25:34] <LunaticHell> Well, all I do know is that WoeGriphon actually is a gunsmith, if he's online, he might give you some advice.
[01:25:36] <DecodeHunter> I don't blame you for not wanting to watch it
[01:25:44] <DecodeHunter> though I have watched NGE like 7 times
[01:26:10] <Sombra> I don't think it'll be a problem, I already got the gun apart and removed the spring, and I know how to put it back together.

[01:27:00] <LunaticHell> Well, maybe he knows a place to get a replacement for a lower price?
[01:27:12] <DecodeHunter> NGE is psychological more than anything
[01:27:26] <LunaticHell> Yeah those things aren't technically robots, but...things cut from another thing.

[01:32:46] <RandomNinja> Hamtramck, The Thing!
[01:32:47] <LunaticHell> Well at least I know for sure part of the books are canon.
[01:32:50] <Sombra> !t nerds
[01:32:51] <DinkyBot> nerds we are,
[01:32:55] <LunaticHell> Also the author is awesome.
[01:33:08] <Sombra> I have plenty of better things to read.
[01:33:13] <LunaticHell> Seriously, Berrow rocks da house.
[01:33:26] <wobniaR> Anderson wrote FF #17
[01:33:31] <wobniaR> inb4 the inb4
[01:33:39] <LunaticHell> She not only signed my book, but she gave me the book, too.
[01:34:00] <LunaticHell> Which is good, because I did not come with a book to sign in the first place. xD
[01:34:39] <wobniaR> I haven't read any of berrow's stuff, not really interested in just writing pony-wise
[01:34:44] <LunaticHell> Anderson? Huh alright, this supposed to set some kinda flag or what?
[01:34:55] <wobniaR> If you don't know you're better off not knowing
[01:35:06] * LunaticHell shrugs "ok"
[01:35:16] <LunaticHell> I like cookie, or however her name is.
[01:35:30] <wobniaR> I see the books and comics as official fanfiction
[01:35:32] <Sombra> I can never go back to cookies, they bring back too many bad memories.
[01:35:35] <wobniaR> But that's just me
[01:35:59] * wobniaR applies flashbacks to Sombra

[01:36:52] <wobniaR> Unless the show connects with material from the book, either with a direct or indirect reference it's not really "canon"
[01:36:53] <LunaticHell> Some selected parts, according to the lady herself, are given to her to be put into the book, by the writing staff of the episodes. Orr something like that.

[01:38:38] <Sombra> Pure coincidence.
[01:38:43] <wobniaR> Yeah that book about Pinkie she wrote hinted at a 3rd sister
[01:39:09] <LunaticHell> She directly states that she was told to put it in, by the guys who make the canon canon.
[01:39:20] <wobniaR> Well yeah so the material's in line with the show
[01:39:24] <wobniaR> The comics are the same way
[01:39:37] <wobniaR> They try not to contradict each other
[01:39:51] <RandomNinja> it's second tier canon, canon until the show disagrees

[01:39:55] <LunaticHell> You can get some nice forshadowing from some of the books, if you read them early enough, that is.
[01:40:18] <LunaticHell> Also there is a pony named "Plot Twist", no really.
[01:40:24] <wobniaR> There's already too many season 5 spoilers out
[01:40:25] <RandomNinja> dat twist
[01:40:32] <wobniaR> The whole episode list was revealed
[01:40:44] <LunaticHell> It's G.M. Berrows ponysona/OC/whatever.
[01:40:45] <RandomNinja> remember kids, no spoilers
[01:40:49] <RandomNinja> or we throw you out
[01:41:00] <wobniaR> And next week's episode has 5 minutes available for watching in clips already, it's getting dumb
[01:41:08] <LunaticHell> I don't spoiler, at least not this show.
[01:41:38] <wobniaR> I enjoy getting a synopsis and a 1 minute clip or so the night before the episode airs

[02:26:35] <DinkyBot> RandomNinja clearly it's the best MMO I've played
[02:26:41] <StrykerVylon> Clearly
[02:26:48] <RandomNinja> !t Elder Scrolls Online
[02:26:49] <DinkyBot> Elder Scrolls best RPG.
[02:27:00] <RandomNinja> it's not bad
[02:28:09] <StrykerVylon> ^
[02:28:16] <Eywind> !link not bad
[02:28:17] <DerpyBot> https://derpiboo.ru/535574
[02:28:27] <RandomNinja> as an RPG though, there's lots of better ones around
[02:28:30] <Eywind> wat
[02:28:41] <MikeM> ded
[02:28:49] <Eywind> oh right space means new tag query, unlike on derpibooru
[02:28:51] <RandomNinja> hue
[02:28:55] <Eywind> where you need the AND operator
[02:29:06] <StrykerVylon> RandomNinja: Im mostly a JRPG kinda guy. FF, Golden Sun, stuff like that.
[02:29:16] <Eywind> Isaac, Garet, Don't die!
[02:29:22] <Eywind> -line I will never forget for how stupid it was
[02:29:35] <StrykerVylon> The fact that Eywind knows what Golden Sun is kinda surprises me.
[02:29:39] <Eywind> Pls
[02:29:58] <Eywind> I played it on my Game Boy Advance after I was supposed to be in bed with one of those crappy gba flip out lights
[02:29:59] <StrykerVylon> :P
[02:30:06] <RandomNinja> we already established Eywind is an old man
[02:30:10] <StrykerVylon> You too?
[02:30:56] <Eywind> Yeah, as well as not so good games
[02:30:58] <Eywind> like dragonball z card game
[02:31:07] <Hamtramck> I like Golden Sun but Shining Force 3 was Camelot's real masterpiece :T
[02:31:13] <StrykerVylon> That was a thing?
[02:31:31] <Eywind> That didn't get ported, did it?
[02:31:40] <StrykerVylon> Also I havent played any of the Shining Force series so I cant say anything of their quality.
[02:31:52] <Eywind> I did like Shining Force RDD
[02:32:00] <Eywind> not as much as the other tactical rpgs though
[02:32:13] <Eywind> Fire Emblem 7 <3
[02:32:17] <Hamtramck> There were three Shining Force 3's. The first one got a US release, but the other two didn't, although they WERE fantranslated.
[02:32:24] <Eywind> oh ok
[02:32:28] <Hamtramck> Also yeah it was only on Saturn, no ports.
[02:33:01] <StrykerVylon> Eywind: Which Fire Emblem was 7?
[02:33:05] <Eywind> first one
[02:33:07] <Eywind> "Fire Emblem" on GBA
[02:33:09] <StrykerVylon> =/
[02:33:13] <Eywind> with Lyn and Hector and Eliwood
[02:33:13] <StrykerVylon> Ah.
[02:33:16] <StrykerVylon> Okay.
[02:33:21] <Eywind> that one was soooo good
[02:33:21] <StrykerVylon> Sacred Stones was better. :P
[02:33:27] <Eywind> Ew
[02:33:31] <Eywind> Sacred Stones was easy mode
[02:33:32] <Regulus> !t Eywind 
[02:33:32] <DinkyBot> Eywind: Won't pick up anything.
[02:33:36] <Eywind> Hector was freaking awesome
[02:33:39] <StrykerVylon> You're ew.
[02:33:57] <StrykerVylon> Honestly I found 7 easier than Sacred Stones.
[02:34:05] <Eywind> Really?
[02:34:19] <StrykerVylon> Yeah.
[02:34:22] <Eywind> I guess I did a lot of variant runs
[02:34:31] <StrykerVylon> THen again.
[02:34:42] <Eywind> HHM (Hector Hard Mode) was actually quite a fun playthrough
[02:34:43] *** Joins: Toothpaste (uid63062@Pony-tbaiid.charlton.irccloud.com)
[02:34:44] <StrykerVylon> I did play SS when I was young and just recently was able to play 7.
[02:34:52] <Eywind> HHM Royalty-Only playthrough was fun
[02:35:09] <Eywind> or lords-only, but then you could play royalty-only and add some of the other characters that were technically royalty
[02:35:28] <StrykerVylon> So I may have had an easier time with 7 considering I had played the series for a lot longer than I had when I played SS.

[03:39:43] <RandomNinja> Kelazi5 have you tried increasing FOV, it helps a lot of people
[03:39:52] <RandomNinja> also, framerate
[03:40:10] <Kelazi5> no since I've never bothered buying any
[03:40:27] <nitr0beatz> ^ Yeah... for some people, changing to a 120fps monitor can help... try it out first though with a friend's setup or a gaming PC store or something
[03:40:31] <Kelazi5> except for stanley parable
[03:40:37] <DecodeHunter> not every game allows changes to the FOV
[03:40:39] <nitr0beatz> you need a very beefy GPU to keep up that rate though
[03:40:54] <DecodeHunter> and framerate isn't something you can just change, it's based on graphics settings/ pc specs

[03:41:25] <nitr0beatz> did I just say a 120fps monitor? I meant 120Hz...

[04:28:27] <DecodeHunter> mmmm, not a solution I'm willing to do :P
[04:28:32] <DecodeHunter> my pride forbids it
[04:28:34] <RandomNinja> I like my theme
[04:28:36] <RandomNinja> :3
[04:28:39] <One-Trick> change yer blue value
[04:28:45] <One-Trick> surely yer client has that ability
[04:28:49] <One-Trick> mirc does
[04:28:52] <DecodeHunter> lol I was already wondering if that was possible
[04:29:03] <DecodeHunter> it just needs to be a bit brighter.. I'll do that
[04:29:24] <DecodeHunter> wow ya, your blue is way brighter than mine, RandomNinja
[04:29:40] <RandomNinja> it's slightly jarring, but entirely readable
[04:29:48] <One-Trick> i picked colors that werent so terrible on the webirc client
[04:30:04] <One-Trick> since those people are not-so-inclined-to-know
[04:30:55] <One-Trick> plus, RandomNinja is pink on my screen

[04:34:22] <RandomNinja> eh, the general layout isn't that great either
[04:35:26] <One-Trick> weechat or irssi
[04:35:47] <One-Trick> weechat is a bit more nice to the user
[04:36:10] <One-Trick> both can be used over an ssh, which is why
[04:36:15] <One-Trick> .. i use it, i mean

[22:47:03] <RandomNinja> biscuits of doom?
[22:47:47] <DinkyBot> !moo
[22:47:47] * DerpyBot chews on some hay and moos at DinkyBot
[22:47:48] * DerpyBot pours her muffin a glass of milk
[22:47:48] <DinkyBot> Mmm! Thank you, momma!
[22:47:49] <MikeM> If you overwork the dough and cook them a little too long, yes
[22:48:24] <MikeM> It'd be like something from a strange land forced on Pinkie.

[22:55:49] * DinkyBot hides her head under the blankets and grumbles. "5 more minutes, momma!"
[22:58:08] <Sombra> Something really wierd just happened
[22:58:25] <MikeM> You saw a cat walk across the hall twice?
[22:58:36] <Sombra> I was out in the general public, and at random I saw another brony.
[22:59:39] <MikeM> Did you give him a surreptitious brohoof?
[22:59:48] <Sombra> No, I didn't talk to him.
[23:00:48] <MikeM> Still cool to see another one out and about.
[23:01:02] <MikeM> Hey, what happened to your pistol?
[23:01:41] <Sombra> It's still broken, I have my warranty information in que
[23:01:50] <MikeM> What broke?
[23:02:02] <Sombra> The trigger spring
[23:03:09] <MikeM> That's unexpected. Springs are usually pretty long-lasting.
[23:03:30] <Sombra> Yes, especially in CZ's, they said it was probably due to a bad heat treating process.
[23:03:34] <Sombra> Also not something very common.
[23:04:13] <MikeM> Heat treating makes sense. Hope they get it fixed quickly.
[23:04:37] <Sombra> .I hope they just send me a new spring and I don't have to send it in.
