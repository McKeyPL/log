[00:01:26] <Flurshy> because I've recently been reminded that my phone never tells me anything about a number that's not in my contacts, other than the number itself
[00:01:58] <Regulus> mine at least tells me the state the caller is from
[00:02:15] * RandomNinja flails in Regulus' general direction
[00:02:37] * Regulus snickers 
[00:03:09] <Regulus> Remember RandomNinja, I can't tell you anything. What you choose to be is entirely up to you. 
[00:03:20] <Flurshy> I'm trying to figure out how to get it to tell me who the number is registered to, similar to the phones where I currently work
[00:03:34] <MikeM> Isn't there an app that does that?
[00:03:38] <Regulus> But in the face of ambiguity, I'll keep calling you a cat
[00:03:51] <Regulus> Possibly 
[00:04:07] <Regulus> Actually caller ID is NOT a free service though
[00:04:10] <MikeM> Wait, is RandomNinja choosing a fursona?
[00:04:24] <Flurshy> that's frustrating
[00:04:24] <RandomNinja> no, Regulus wants me to
[00:04:44] <Regulus> I'm just putting ideas into his head :p
[00:04:48] * RandomNinja nerds MikeM 
[00:04:56] <Flurshy> any idea why? like, is there actually a cost to provide the service, or is it like how phone companies charge you to make your phone a wifi hotspot?
[00:04:59] * MikeM maths
[00:05:05] <RandomNinja> pls math is kool
[00:05:10] <Regulus> A little of both
[00:05:36] <Regulus> It's cheap, but there is a cost to getting that data
[00:06:56] <Flurshy> whitepages has an app
[00:06:57] <Regulus> That's why looking up a number via any website, or using a reverse lookup service costs money.
[00:07:37] <Regulus> Getting a number for a name is easy. Going the other way usually isn't as easy.

[00:46:28] <Hamtramck> o/` just to be the man who walked 500 miles and then 500 more o/`
[00:46:36] <RandomNinja> I mean I can't argue with a good deal
[00:47:03] <Regulus> $10 a hoodie is too good to pass up.
[00:47:09] <Eywind> I'd buy it

[00:48:09] <Hamtramck> aren't hoodies a one way ticket on the gettin' hassled by the cops express?
[00:48:09] <Regulus> Curse or desired effect?
[00:48:20] <MikeM> It comes with cat class and cat style.
[00:48:20] <RandomNinja> depends on how you wear them
[00:48:36] <Regulus> Not if they're cute with animal ears
[00:48:41] <RandomNinja> so wearing them makes a cool cat?
[00:48:46] <RandomNinja> makes you*
[00:48:57] <Hamtramck> sometimes i step into timeless zone and i lose my way
[00:49:03] <Hamtramck> i discover ears of a cat in the timeless zone
[00:49:07] <RandomNinja> that's probably unrelated to the hoodies

[01:00:47] <Hamtramck> I can get why people want foxes as pets.
[01:00:58] <Hamtramck> I don't get why people would want big cats though
[01:01:00] <RandomNinja> they're not good pets tho
[01:01:08] <Hamtramck> Like imagine if your housecat was as big as a lion
[01:01:10] <Hamtramck> it'd murder you
[01:01:39] <RandomNinja> foxes are as independent as cats except 3 times the size
[01:01:54] <Eywind> so RandomNinja you're saying you're a better pet than Regulus?
[01:02:11] <RandomNinja> my grandmother had a fox around for 2 years or so, he was pretty chill as long as you didn't approach him first
[01:02:21] <Flurshy> so
[01:02:28] <Flurshy> my mom fixed this dish
[01:02:36] <Flurshy> it's like, yankee attempt at texmex
[01:02:42] <Flurshy> the recipe is, I mean
[01:02:59] <Eywind> so it's like white rice + can of salsa from kroger + cheese melted on top?
[01:03:21] <Flurshy> hamburger meat, cream of chicken, velveeta cheese and tomatoes
[01:03:27] <Eywind> ah yeah somewhat close hah
[01:03:48] <Eywind> is it good?
[01:03:49] <MikeM> Sounds like bad enchiladas.
[01:03:54] <Hamtramck> Also I was refering to domesticated foxes.
[01:03:58] <Hamtramck> From like projects to do so.
[01:04:04] <Flurshy> see this is texas, we knew the moment we opened the lid that whoever made the recipe has never had real texmex
[01:04:18] <Eywind> well yeah
[01:04:19] <Flurshy> it's decent. would be better with tortilla chips to dip
[01:04:25] <Eywind> yeah I could imagine that
[01:04:33] <Eywind> It's obviously not authentic texmex but it was at least food heh
[01:04:54] <Flurshy> yep
[01:04:58] <RandomNinja> Hamtramck yeah to be fair that was a wild fox that just hung out there
[01:04:59] <Flurshy> kinda bland, needed seasoning
[01:05:04] <Flurshy> I put some red pepper in it
[01:05:07] <Eywind> ah nice

[15:19:15] <Flurshy> I'm not even patriotic
[15:19:24] * Unixkitty snickers
[15:19:46] <RandomNinja> there's proper units vs freedom units
[15:19:49] <Flurshy> 87F yesterday. The F stands for Freedom
[15:19:55] <Regulus> I'd love to use Celsius, but I'm just so used to Fahrenheit for ambient temperature 
[15:20:05] <Unixkitty> "87 Freedoms yesterday"
[15:20:15] <RandomNinja> 87 degrees of freedom*
[15:20:40] <Unixkitty> Soo... Celsius "C" would stand for... Communism instead?
[15:20:48] <Flurshy> I have so little exposure to centigrade as a unit of measurement that I can only understand it with a conversion to fahrenheit
[15:21:29] <Unixkitty> 36'6 is human body temperature, below 0 water freezes
[15:21:34] <RandomNinja> commie units?
[15:21:36] <Unixkitty> It's not that complicated
[15:21:38] <Flurshy> because this is texas and the only people here who use it are scientists
[15:21:46] <Regulus> I know 4 points of conversion
[15:21:51] <Flurshy> Unix, I mean like for knowing how hot or cold it is outside
[15:22:04] <Unixkitty> Oh, okay
[15:22:11] <Regulus> Water boiling, water freezing, room temp, and -40
[15:22:17] <Flurshy> I personally think that celsius is better for science and fahrenheit is better for describing the weather
[15:22:32] <RandomNinja> Kelvin is the only acceptable unit for science
[15:22:44] <Regulus> Yes and no
[15:22:49] <RandomNinja> at least physics
[15:22:50] <Flurshy> human body temp is not room temperature
[15:22:58] <Regulus> Quantitative science, yes
[15:23:02] <Unixkitty> "room temp" is actually a static variable?
[15:23:07] <Flurshy> not really
[15:23:08] <Regulus> Qualitative science, no
[15:23:14] <Regulus> 23 C
[15:23:26] <Flurshy> well
[15:23:27] <Unixkitty> I've never even heard of that before
[15:23:37] <Flurshy> "lukewarm" is not a constant
[15:23:41] * snitch567 gives Unixkitty cap nip
[15:23:41] <Flurshy> because lukewarm is relative

[15:24:24] * snitch567 gives Unixkitty cat nip :3
[15:24:37] <Unixkitty> And this I'm simply allergic to
[15:24:40] <Regulus> It's an approximate round number 
[15:24:55] <Regulus> Like saying room temp is about 70F
[15:24:59] <Unixkitty> I always assumed perfect room temperature had been 21'C
[15:25:09] <Unixkitty> Or maybe because to me it is
[15:25:13] <Flurshy> although I just stepped outside at 69F and it was a little chilly
[15:25:13] <Regulus> I've heard that too
[15:25:14] <RandomNinja> 21 is warm to mee
[15:25:19] <RandomNinja> I want like 18
[15:25:38] <Regulus> that might actually be the number
[15:25:48] <Unixkitty> We have 19'C in our IT room
[15:25:59] <Flurshy> it's variable based on your recent exposure to temperatures
[15:26:11] <Flurshy> room temp is lower in the winter than it is in the summer
[15:26:29] <Unixkitty> Also I think that would be because outside air actually moves, Flurshy, in response to that 69F sentence
[15:26:37] <RandomNinja> !t nerds
[15:26:38] <DinkyBot> nerds Unixkitty with chili
[15:26:59] <Flurshy> no, it's because down here we're still getting highs in the 80s

[15:27:11] <Unixkitty> "Nerd with chili"? What in the world would that even mean
[15:27:35] <RandomNinja> dunno, but it sounds tasty

[15:31:41] <Flurshy> checking out
[15:31:55] <Flurshy> and I saw these puppy snacks that said "Pup-kin spice latte"
[15:32:09] <Regulus> .....
[15:32:10] <Unixkitty> Coffee for dogs?
[15:32:16] <Regulus> So much no...
[15:32:27] <RandomNinja> there's an idea
[15:32:28] <RandomNinja> coffee
[15:32:29] <Flurshy> here I'll show you

[15:32:59] <Flurshy> I would have bought them but am low on money
[15:33:03] <Unixkitty> But why is it called Latte
[15:33:24] <Unixkitty> It says pumpkin and vanilla flavour, I don't see how that relates to coffee
[15:33:46] <RandomNinja> that's not coffee though
[15:33:56] <RandomNinja> much like the actual Starbucks drink
[15:34:10] <Regulus> Oi
[15:34:28] <RandomNinja> it's not coffee when there's 50% sugar and cream
[15:34:29] <Flurshy> like
[15:34:32] <Flurshy> I really want to try it
[15:34:35] <RandomNinja> that's a dessert
[15:34:37] <Regulus> Their pumpkin spice suryp actually has dairy in it.
[15:34:49] <Flurshy> not the starbucks, I mean those puppy snacks
[15:35:22] <Regulus> PSA right there. If you know coffee lovers with a dairy allergy, pass that along.
[15:35:41] <RandomNinja> you mean the latte?
[15:35:46] <Regulus> Yes
[15:35:53] <RandomNinja> or just the pumpkin spice part?
[15:35:57] <Unixkitty> Goodness, all this talk about dairy and coffee made me want exactly that.
[15:36:06] <Flurshy> starbucks' pumpkin spice latte is unbelievably unhealthy, for the record
[15:36:16] <Regulus> Starbucks Pumpkin Spice drinks can not be non-dairy
[15:36:16] <RandomNinja> Unixkitty, there's a very easy solution to wanting coffee

[15:37:09] * Unixkitty boops RandomNinja's nose
[15:38:02] <RandomNinja> pls
[15:38:06] <RandomNinja> coffee is like 10 kcal
[15:38:48] <RandomNinja> wait no, even 0 according to USDA
[15:38:50] <Unixkitty> Coffee is actually rather healthy if you're modest enough with it's consumption, and it helps with metabolism
[15:38:53] <RandomNinja> so <5 kcal
[15:39:06] <Unixkitty> So if anything, I certainly don't see it's relation to fat

[15:39:31] <RandomNinja> because those cream-pumped pumpkin spiced lattes are sugar and fat bombs
[15:39:48] <RandomNinja> plain coffee is basically water and caffeine
[15:40:39] <Flurshy> coffee doesn't wake me up so I don't have any use for it
[15:41:00] <Unixkitty> I don't see anyone having said anything about that
[15:42:22] <Unixkitty> But to expand on that, I've heard that the only coffee that helps somewhat with that would be the type to come from beans directly, not the cheap powdered stuff they sell in grocery stores
[15:42:35] * Regulus throws a bundle of hay at RandomNinja 
[15:42:56] <Flurshy> powdered coffee doesn't wake you up
[15:42:57] <Flurshy> ?
[15:43:00] <Flurshy> then why drink it?
[15:43:05] <RandomNinja> instant coffee is usually Robusta beans tho, which contains much more caffeine
[15:43:16] <Unixkitty> Exactly. Well some people like it's taste 
[15:43:40] <RandomNinja> I refuse to believe anyone likes instant coffee
[15:43:40] <Regulus> Some people just have a high tolerance for caffeine 
[15:43:57] <Unixkitty> My mother does, RandomNinja 
[15:44:01] <RandomNinja> madness
[15:44:14] <RandomNinja> also you do mean actual instant coffee and not just powdered, right?
[15:44:41] <Flurshy> I'm actually ADHD, which means coffee doesn't do me any good
[15:44:48] <Unixkitty> Well no, something like this RandomNinja https://www.nescafe.co.uk/upload/300g_CLASSIC_STANDARD_new_1952.png

[22:18:44] <MikeM> What does the brute force thing do?
[22:19:41] <wobniaR> Wordpress login brute force attack probably
[22:20:46] <MikeM> That's what I thought. For those times you forget your password.
[22:21:02] <wobniaR> Of course
[22:22:53] <wobniaR> What's neat about the scan feature is the output will list vulnerabilities found, versions of wordpress they work on, and references to each exploit
[22:24:21] <MikeM> Seems pretty useful from a pro-security standpoint.

[22:38:02] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Have you noticed some airsoft mechanics are more advanced than real guns?
[22:38:11] <RandomNinja> yes
[22:38:29] <MikeM> Makes sense.
[22:38:44] <RandomNinja> airsofts can't rely on blowback in the same way
[22:38:58] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Take the fact on some airsoft aegs the first pull of the trigger arms the gun
[22:39:31] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Just shove a battery in your scar-l it wont be used as much either
[22:39:47] * RandomNinja cheers with MikeM 
[22:39:56] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Compared with an airsoft one as the bullets make the fire... Not the gun

[22:45:58] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> RandomNinja 1911 silver or black?
[22:46:05] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Or mirror
[22:46:17] <snitch567> owwww
[22:46:20] <RandomNinja> which one is the silver?
[22:46:30] <RandomNinja> if brushed steel, then that
[22:46:39] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> A h
[22:46:44] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Ah*
[22:47:42] <RandomNinja> I need to buy more sweatpants
[22:48:22] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> This is what i meant by mirror finish http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KrDL7dbmtks/maxresdefault.jpg
[22:49:37] <RandomNinja> nah
[22:49:38] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Alot of people dont like this but i do
[22:49:53] <RandomNinja> it gets stained really noticably though
[22:50:28] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> http://www.hunt101.com/data/500/medium/1911_Mil_Spec_008.JPG
[22:51:06] <RandomNinja> yeah that's better
[22:51:07] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Is that what you mean by brushed steel?
[22:51:11] <RandomNinja> yeah
[22:51:19] <RandomNinja> shiny, bot not excessively
[22:51:52] <Regulus> Needs moar black, matte finish
[22:51:52] <RandomNinja> although if you're going to use it for combat I'd go black for visibility purposes
[22:52:06] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Yee
[22:52:18] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> But uk for airsoft needs two tone so
[22:52:29] <RandomNinja> wut why?
[22:53:28] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Legal purposes
[22:53:42] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Unless you have a ukara liscense
[22:53:50] <Regulus> Go black and sky blue then.
[22:54:03] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> I cant just pick a colour
[22:54:25] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Besides the site i want mine from only does green anyway
[22:54:28] <RandomNinja> as long as it's reasonably dark and matte you're good 
[22:55:05] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> I cant
[22:55:13] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> But the paint comes of easily
[22:55:17] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> So its good
[22:55:40] <RandomNinja> black spray paint?
[22:55:52] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> The legals are bright blue, green, orange, purple... Etc
[22:55:57] <RandomNinja> buttz
[22:56:09] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> But ill have to disassemble the gun wont i?
[22:57:08] <RandomNinja> yeah
[22:57:23] <RandomNinja> so it assumes you don't suck at mechanics
[22:57:43] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> But i know ill get it wrong putting it back together
[22:57:58] <RandomNinja> you can generally strip it down fairly well without getting to sensitive parts though
[22:58:51] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> With 1911s anyway
[22:59:07] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> And the grips i think are painted too with green
[22:59:14] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Lemmie get a pic
