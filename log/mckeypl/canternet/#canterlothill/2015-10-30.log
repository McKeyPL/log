[00:54:35] <ynoP|Historying> No
[00:54:40] <ynoP|Historying> Well, sort of
[00:54:46] <Inucroft[NLR]> ...
[00:54:50] <Inucroft[NLR]> wut
[00:55:18] <ynoP|Historying> I get college expemption of needing to take basic college US History before doing more advanced stuff
[00:55:24] <ynoP|Historying> But I don't get actual credit
[00:55:40] <Inucroft[NLR]> Oh... US and your unusal freedom
[00:55:47] <Hamtramck> Oh man I took a couple AP history courses in college
[00:55:53] <Hamtramck> Basically got me a semester finished before I started
[00:55:55] <Inucroft[NLR]> We simply choose our focus and we are given manditory moduals
[00:55:56] <Eywind> okay mr lollypop man
[00:55:58] <ynoP|Historying> So, if I don't take ANY history in college, it was somewhat good for nothing
[00:56:03] * Inucroft[NLR] noms Eywind
[00:56:05] <Hamtramck> Which meant I could graduate in four years but more importantly I could move into a single dorm after my first semester
[00:56:50] <ynoP|Historying> But hey, I got a 5 on my AP US test from last year so at least I can say I was in the top 15%
[00:56:55] <Eywind> u da bes
[00:56:58] <Eywind> best I got on an AP test was like a 3
[00:57:06] <Eywind> but that's cuz my school was crap
[00:57:17] <Eywind> an AP class would maybe cover half of the test
[00:57:22] <Hamtramck> I got a 3 on physics, and then I think 4s on two of the englishes and maybe one five.
[00:57:35] <Eywind> oh wait no I got a 4 one year on math I think it was
[00:57:36] <Hamtramck> which was good enough for where I went
[00:57:37] <Inucroft[NLR]> what is an AP class?#
[00:57:49] <Eywind> advanced placement.  There's tests and you can get college credit at some colleges depending on what you get
[00:57:55] <Inucroft[NLR]> oh
[00:58:00] <Hamtramck> The best thing about AP classes at my highschool is that they were on a five-point scale, meaning an A got you a 5.0 and a B got you a 4.0
[00:58:08] <Inucroft[NLR]> so basicaly a foundation year
[00:58:14] <Hamtramck> And they weren't THAT much harder so as long as you were getting B's in them, you were getting 4.0s
[00:58:18] <Eywind> yeah ours if you passed it you got a 0.05 added to your adjusted GPA
[00:58:25] <Eywind> however that adjusted GPA didn't mean anything to a lot of schools
[00:58:28] <Eywind> so it was risking your GPA for those
[00:58:44] <ynoP|Historying> AP test scores are graded relative to other testers
[00:58:45] <Hamtramck> This was just part of our normal GPA
[00:58:47] <Inucroft[NLR]> I feel the UK system is alot more simple :/
[00:58:59] <Eywind> Of course you do
[00:59:01] <Eywind> you live in the UK
[00:59:05] <Hamtramck> Basically I got free tuition because I kind of gamed my GPA by taking AP classes.
[00:59:13] <Inucroft[NLR]> Eywind touché
[00:59:17] <Eywind> yeah that's not how the colleges I applied to handled GPA
[00:59:24] <Eywind> you submitted your adjusted GPA and your actual GPA
[00:59:30] <ynoP|Historying> You can't just do great, to get a 5 you have to to better than mostly everyone else... or they just have to all do really baD
[00:59:39] <Hamtramck> What's an adjusted GPA :V
[00:59:49] <Eywind> the ones where an A was 5.0
[00:59:54] <Eywind> that was your "adjusted" GPA
[00:59:56] <Hamtramck> oh

[01:00:16] <Eywind> I mean it was like stanford and northwestern and stuff that didn't care about that
[01:00:22] <Hamtramck> I never saw a non-adjusted GPA though
[01:00:26] <Eywind> also they got it on your transcript anyways
[01:00:59] <Hamtramck> Anyway BGSU gave me full tuition by GPA and ACT scores
[01:01:06] <Eywind> yea
[01:01:09] <Eywind> OSU did the same thing
[01:01:17] <ynoP|Historying> I'm still waiting for my PSAT scores to come back
[01:01:18] <Eywind> I had a full ride there but I wanted freedom for some reason
[01:01:23] <Hamtramck> OSU was not giving much scholarship money wehn I was applying to schools
[01:01:50] <Eywind> I had a full ride to OSU or UC
[01:01:56] <Eywind> and then most to clemson and virginia tech
[01:02:09] <Eywind> what was your ACT? lol
[01:02:13] <Hamtramck> 32?
[01:02:15] <Hamtramck> I was not impressed with OSU the year I went there
[01:02:20] <Eywind> ah ok
[01:02:22] <Hamtramck> I got a job out of it at least.
[01:02:22] <Eywind> I mean 32 isn't bad
[01:02:47] <Hamtramck> I think BGSU is full tuition with like 3.75GPA and 30 ACT?
[01:02:51] <Eywind> was that cumulative or once?
[01:02:55] <Hamtramck> Once.
[01:03:00] <Eywind> I forget which counted cumulative

[01:06:05] <Inucroft[NLR]> bear in mind, US Universities are basicaly Post-grad level to British 
[01:06:06] <Eywind> just because you're smart doesn't mean you automatically can skirt by at a top 10 school
[01:06:27] <Inucroft[NLR]> ^
[01:06:38] <ynoP|Historying> They don't care about smart, they care about learning obsession
[01:06:56] <Eywind> nah they care about someone who actually goes to class and isn't mired in massive depression that the guidance counselors write off as being lazy
[01:07:43] <Inucroft[NLR]> and don't foroget about that insane amount of money they are requesting
[01:08:06] <ynoP|Historying> How could they not want your money anymore?
[01:08:14] <Eywind> cuz if you drag down their averages
[01:08:18] <Eywind> then they look bad
[01:08:25] <Eywind> plus they can just admit one more person
[01:08:25] <ynoP|Historying> Truy
[01:08:32] <Inucroft[NLR]> UK cost ~$19K annualy (inc accomidation/food)... how much does it cost in the US?
[01:08:38] <Eywind> depends on the school
[01:08:47] <Eywind> is that 19K usd conversion or gbp?
[01:09:05] <Eywind> I'd say average private school tuition and board is like 35-40k
[01:09:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> UK £1 to US $1.50
[01:09:20] <Eywind> Northwestern ended up being about 60k
[01:09:25] <Inucroft[NLR]> 0_o
[01:09:51] <Inucroft[NLR]> and our undergrad loans don't event count as bedt and ~60% is written off
[01:09:55] <Inucroft[NLR]> *debt
[01:10:05] <Eywind> yea a lot of ours are written off cuz people get so much in debt and then don't get jobs
[01:10:39] <Eywind> still ruins the kids credit
[01:10:54] <Inucroft[NLR]> Ours only start charging when you earn over £20K (~$30K) annualy- (like $5 dollars out of your paycheck).
[01:11:02] <Eywind> yeah that's reasonable
[01:11:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> Doesn;t count towards our credit rating here, it's classed as an outgoing
[01:11:10] <Eywind> sometimes you can defer if you don't have a job but yeah
[01:11:25] <Inucroft[NLR]> and after 25yrs years it's automaticaly written off (whatever is left)
[01:12:27] <Inucroft[NLR]> all I can say is, US, wtf is wrong with your funding system? It's like, you only want children from rich families attending
[01:13:03] <Eywind> The average kid out of HS doesn't understand the situation and how the 'normal' path isn't really normal anymore
[01:13:06] <Eywind> or feasible for all families
[01:13:34] <Inucroft[NLR]> (my course was only ~$10K annualy (inc food/accomidation)before tution fees rose) Yea, that.. just sad.
[01:13:38] <Eywind> going high school > private 4 year college > getting a job isn't really going to work
[01:13:40] <Eywind> at least anymore
[01:13:58] <Eywind> job market is mediocre, private schools cost a lot, and not everyone actually even needs to go to a 4 year degree for their profession
[01:14:05] <Inucroft[NLR]> Germany & Nordic countries, Tution fee £0

[23:16:27] <One-Trick> yes
[23:16:34] <One-Trick> RandomNinja: i just hate the curly cord
[23:17:08] <RandomNinja> how comfortable are they over several hours?
[23:21:10] * RandomNinja boops a One-Trick 
[23:21:24] <One-Trick> hmmm
[23:21:51] <One-Trick> i can wear them for about 3 hours without issue, the only real issue i have is my ears get sweaty after that time
[23:22:16] <RandomNinja> isn't that inherent to them being closed though?
[23:29:14] <One-Trick> these seem to the the only ones ive had, thus far, that dont breath very well. but, i will say, that when i flew to germany, they blocked out the airplanes noise so well that i was able to sleep very nicely
[23:31:42] <RandomNinja> you use the standard leather pads?

[23:56:47] * DinkyBot hides her head under the blankets and grumbles. "5 more minutes, momma!"

[23:57:52] <RandomNinja> my oak aged barleywine appears to be done carbonating by now, time for a test soon methinks
