[05:35:04] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Here's a classic J-pop song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk8zjK1qO1s 
[05:35:04] <DinkyBot>  [ Ken Hirai - Pop Star - YouTube ]
[05:35:30] * Flurshy boops Ninja
[05:35:33] <Flurshy> this Nathan Drake guy
[05:35:34] * RandomNinja is booped
[05:35:35] <Flurshy> I like him
[05:35:37] <Flurshy> he's funny
[05:36:06] <thereallynewmop12100> Flurshy: That's Ken Hirai
[05:36:18] <Flurshy> I've been playing Uncharted
[05:36:26] <Flurshy> I got the PS4 remaster to play through
[05:36:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I give the song a 9 3/4
[05:36:54] <RandomNinja> does it run at proper framerate now?
[05:37:40] <Flurshy> it runs at 60fps, yeah
[05:37:45] <RandomNinja> neat
[05:37:51] <Flurshy> uncharted 4 won't
[05:37:58] <Flurshy> it'll be locked at 30
[05:38:07] <RandomNinja> boo I say
[05:38:17] <Flurshy> still probably play better than the "30fps" that assassin's creed supposedly had
[05:38:23] <RandomNinja> you mean 17?
[05:38:26] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Here's a parody: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahEB2C3npk
[05:38:27] <DinkyBot>  [ I wanna be a ☆VIP STAR☆ - YouTube ]
[05:38:36] <Flurshy> Unity's version of 30fps is more like "10fps with bits of 20fps here and there"
[05:38:50] <RandomNinja> it's like a teenager at the liquor store
[05:38:53] <Flurshy> sometimes dipping into the single digits
[05:39:13] <RandomNinja> it claims to be 30 but everyone involved knows it's a lie
[05:39:19] <Flurshy> yep
[05:39:30] <SaultSteMarie> http://www.tidningenridsport.se/Global/Scaled/520x2000x2/Global-Bilder%20oktober%202012-Dalah%C3%A4st.jpg neat!
[05:39:36] <RandomNinja> hah
[05:39:45] <Flurshy> when they first announced it I was like "Okay, that's fine, still higher than I'm used to"
[05:39:57] <Flurshy> when I started playing I was like "This isn't even 20fps"
[05:40:04] <RandomNinja> have fun going back to 30 after this :P
[05:40:22] <Flurshy> I did that before
[05:40:29] <SaultSteMarie> I'm used to integrated graphics
[05:40:35] <Flurshy> cause the remaster for The Last of Us was 60fps
[05:40:46] <SaultSteMarie> so going from Intel HD3000 to idk an R9 380X is like oh god why is everything moving so fast stop
[05:41:15] <RandomNinja> but then you get used to it and low framerates become physically painful
[05:41:19] <Flurshy> ^
[05:41:29] <Flurshy> 30fps makes me miss shots now
[05:41:32] <Flurshy> or
[05:41:37] <Flurshy> I notice that I'm missing shots more
[05:41:49] <RandomNinja> it's even worse with a mouse
[05:42:21] <Flurshy> of course in Uncharted I miss shots because your shots land within a target zone but at random spots in the zone, so it's basically impossible to not miss
[05:42:41] <RandomNinja> yeah try hitting people in CS with 30 fps
[05:42:51] <Flurshy> especially shooting blind which I've found is immensely useful when someone starts walking up to my cover
[05:42:58] <Flurshy> I hate those walking tanks >.<
[05:43:13] <RandomNinja> did you play Mass Effect 1?
[05:43:15] <Flurshy> "ratatatatatatatata--why aren't you dead yet?!?"
[05:43:19] <Flurshy> no
[05:43:51] <RandomNinja> Krogan chargers were super tanky, hit like trucks, and heal
[05:44:05] <thereallynewmop12100> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Do you heard the parody of POP STAR? 
[05:44:07] <Flurshy> no, I'll tell you what's frustrating me in this series. Making a headshot, seeing it land, and they--afterwards, mind you--duck their head and move to cover, unharmed
[05:44:15] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> It is okay
[05:44:22] <RandomNinja> that's called Cinematic Action :P
[05:44:30] <Flurshy> cinematic action?
[05:44:50] <Flurshy> no like I'm sneaking up, bang! you should be dead now, why are you still moving
[05:45:20] <RandomNinja> probably because the game uses unreasonably slow projectiles instead of hitscan
[05:45:41] <RandomNinja> or just that they are too tanky?
[05:46:09] <Flurshy> well I can understand that with the actual walking tanks (the ones walking up with a shotgun covered in full body armor)
[05:46:20] <Flurshy> but people without helmets on do it too
[05:46:28] <RandomNinja> that's dumb
[05:46:32] <SaultSteMarie> Saints Row 2 definitely feels weird to me if it's not clamped to like 30FPS though.
[05:47:13] <SaultSteMarie> Like it feels jittery at higher framerates for some reason idk
