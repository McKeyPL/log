[00:03:01] <TipsyBOT> Star Wars has shiny swords and laser guns.
[00:03:15] <TipsyBOT> Star Trek was more about about exploration and diplomacy.
[00:03:24] <MikeM> Yup.

[00:04:04] <TipsyBOT> By diplomacy I mean Kirk pretty much had his way with any female alien he encountered.
[00:04:17] <TipsyBOT> He was the Paris Hilton of Space basically.
[00:04:52] <MikeM> But without the Chihuahua in his manbag.
[00:07:00] <TipsyBOT> Indeed.
[00:07:42] <TipsyBOT> Not to offend anyone but I always found Star Wars to be an aligory between Judism and Islam.
[00:08:11] <BerryPunch> Oh he was packing something in his manbag :|
[00:08:14] <TipsyBOT> Jedi being Judism and Islam being Sith. Nothing to do with radicalism or what's being done today but the conflict between the two is the same.
[00:08:27] <MikeM> haha...if only the pants were a little tighter...
[00:08:56] <TipsyBOT> TLDR Kirk is what Zapp Brannigan is despite being a moron.
[00:09:14] <BerryPunch> Considering Zapp Brannigan was made as a Kirk parody ...
[00:13:20] <TipsyBOT> We're going in circles..back on the correlation between religions and Star Trek.
[00:13:44] <TipsyBOT> Is my theory..accurate at all?
[00:13:55] <TipsyBOT> Star Wars**
[00:14:37] <MikeM> There are lots of conflicts between lots of religions, and a big discussion is probably outside the scope of here.

[03:42:52] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: I like Rankin-Bass and their classic cartoons. 
[03:43:15] <EM-C> Yep, they're pretty good.  They also made the 1977 version of "The Hobbit."
[03:43:42] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Really?
[03:43:49] <EM-C> Yep.
[03:45:07] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C:  I know :D
[03:45:25] <thereallynewmop12100> Without Rankin-Bass. There will be no rudolph.. 
[03:45:43] <EM-C> Rankin-Bass made a lot of holiday themes specials.
[03:46:15] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Like Rudolph, Frosty The Snowman and others..
[03:46:43] <EM-C> Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, etc.

[20:28:18] <Unixkitty> I'm not sure I'd want to do so without mods though, are there any mod "compilations" or guides like this one for Skyrim for an initial playthrough? http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936/?

[20:29:47] <wobniaR> It's a compilation mod for new vegas that adds a bunch of stuff it should have
[20:29:59] <RandomNinja> also makes it harder, in the good way
[20:30:00] <wobniaR> It also makes the game more difficult but in a fair way

[20:31:35] <wobniaR> You can also combine project nevada and tale of two wastelands to play fallout 3
