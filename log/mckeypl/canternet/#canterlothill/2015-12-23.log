[22:07:40] <Unixkitty> Oh there will be

[22:08:10] <Unixkitty> It's just that I'm not really a party person, so I'm not sure how I will be feeling about it.
[22:08:27] <Unixkitty> Not the alcohol, the party itself
[22:08:33] <Eywind> corporate parties are meh
[22:08:48] <Eywind> unless it's at a location and you can hang out with a few of your friends
[22:08:56] <Unixkitty> Our company is actually rather small, and most do have fun
[22:08:58] <Eywind> all I did for our christmas party was play racing games at the arcade vs my friend from work lol
[22:09:16] * JockeTF isn't a party person either. Especially not for the ones with a lot of alcohol.
[22:09:29] <Eywind> I like an adequate amount of alcohol
[22:09:36] <Unixkitty> Many know each other and or related one way or another, so people feel relatively close I suppose
[22:09:39] <Eywind> but 'a lot' should be reserved for the after party at a close bar
[22:09:49] <Eywind> Ah that's a lot different than my workplace
[22:09:52] <Eywind> I'm sure it'll be fine Unixkitty
[22:10:32] <Unixkitty> I'm just afraid that I will be awkward while everybody else dances and gets crazy really
[22:10:37] <Eywind> eh
[22:10:39] <wobniaR> I stood for like an hour and a half and left our corporate holiday party early
[22:10:51] <wobniaR> I'm not a fun person
[22:11:00] <Eywind> Unixkitty if you're worried about that just have someone call you like 45 min in
[22:11:11] <RandomNinja> wobniaR: best way
[22:11:19] <JockeTF> We didn't even have a Christmas party. :P
[22:11:30] <Eywind> if you're not having fun just say your water heater burst or your cousin's dogsitter's neighbor died or something
[22:11:33] <JockeTF> Last year we went to an enormous Julbord.
[22:11:36] <JockeTF> That was very nice. :D
[22:12:17] <RandomNinja> "my dog's water heater died"
[22:12:21] <Eywind> hah
[22:12:27] <Unixkitty> I certainly doubt I would lie
[22:13:10] <Eywind> you don't have to lie, but it makes life a lot easier
[22:13:55] <RandomNinja> it's even easier at the party since alcohol boosts charisma for speech checks
[22:14:03] <Unixkitty> Haha RandomNinja :P
[22:14:19] <Eywind>  jand decreases opponents
[22:14:21] <Eywind> and*
[22:14:24] <wobniaR> Lowers your int tho
[22:14:49] <Unixkitty> At least I know for a fact that I can take some alcohol, but maybe I should plan for getting back
[22:14:51] <wobniaR> !t whiskey
[22:14:52] <DinkyBot> probably early, 12 oz whiskey is a lot faster
[22:14:59] <Eywind> yes 12oz of whiskey
[22:15:04] <Eywind> you should definitely go for that
[22:15:30] <wobniaR> It'll make everything go a lot faster
[22:15:38] <wobniaR> Like time
[22:16:18] <wobniaR> Oh man i was listening to some remix of the magic inside and it transitioned perfectly to Asgore's song
