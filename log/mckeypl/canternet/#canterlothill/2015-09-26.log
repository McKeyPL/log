[19:27:02] <keekle> i guess the fundraiser is doing pretty well
[19:27:05] <Lycan> My show is on in 30 minutes :)
[19:27:08] <wobniaR> Yeah the mane6 project went mainstream and is getting plugged all over the gaming world
[19:27:22] <keekle> nothing like having the queen of pony on board
[19:27:24] <wobniaR> Most reviews are like "yay"
[19:27:26] <Trildar> It's at 40% of the goal last I checked
[19:27:33] <Boxer> ooo.
[19:27:40] <keekle> i am so glad they turned it around and made it their own, literally
[19:27:55] <wobniaR> Yeah good for them, but I lost interest a while ago
[19:27:59] <keekle> ultimate irony would be if hasbro hires them to make a pony fighting game
[19:28:01] <RandomNinja> how long did it take to hit 40%?
[19:28:18] <keekle> it got like 100k the first day 
[19:28:19] <Trildar> About 4 days I think
[19:28:24] <RandomNinja> wow
[19:28:29] <keekle> out of the goal of like 350?
[19:28:31] <wobniaR> It took them way too long to turn it around, and even if they get funded it's gonna be a while before we get a functional game
[19:28:51] <keekle> which is too bad because they were so far along on the pony one
[19:29:03] <keekle> but they at least are never gonna give it up

[23:51:54] <RandomNinja> also SkippeZ_ShadoW, elementary school sucks
[23:51:59] <RandomNinja> it keeps getting better
[23:52:10] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Im not in elementary
[23:52:30] <RandomNinja> isn't 13 8th grade?
[23:52:37] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> I nearly contemplated suicide back then
[23:52:38] <Midli> which is middle school
[23:52:43] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> 13 here is year 9
[23:52:50] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Being uk and all
[23:52:59] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Year 7 is secondary
[23:53:16] <RandomNinja> different term, same idea though
[23:53:22] <Midli> N/A Elementary is normally grade K-6, Middle school 7-8, Highschool 9-12
[23:53:32] <RandomNinja> when you get to pick and choose your subject it gets more interesting
[23:53:43] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> I alreadyhave
[23:53:54] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> You pick at end of year 8
[23:53:59] <RandomNinja> all of them?
[23:54:03] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Im one step ahead boiyo
[23:54:07] <Midli> Tho in Canada alot of places have highschool at grade 7-12 but the 7-8s are split in a different section
[23:54:09] <wobniaR> It was K-5, 6-8 and 9-12 for me
[23:54:12] <RandomNinja> darn crazy UK
[23:54:17] <Midli> wobniaR what the f
[23:54:21] <Midli> that's insane
[23:54:29] <wobniaR> Yeah I did not like middle school
[23:54:34] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> I got to pick five too, not three like alot of schools
[23:54:40] <Midli> Yeah I wouldn't like the concept of middle school
[23:54:49] <Midli> I like hwo I went from elementary to a highschool.
[23:54:51] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> We start school at 4
[23:55:05] <Midli> just for 7-8 we werent' allowed leaving the school premsises for lunch and such
[23:55:28] <wobniaR> In my middle school they were allowed to leave for lunch up until the year I came in
[23:55:33] <RandomNinja> we have 1-9 then you get to pick a program for 10-12
[23:55:51] <RandomNinja> kinda like university but slightly more general
[23:55:55] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> YR y1 y2 infants, y3 y4 y5 y6 junior, y7-11 is secondary
[23:55:57] <wobniaR> Then for like 2 months in 8th grade we were allowed to go out for lunch, which ended quickly cause stupid kids brought people into the school from outside
[23:56:11] <wobniaR> Basically a few people ruined it for everyone else
[23:56:37] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Per usual wobniaR
[23:57:14] <wobniaR> US public school is prison for kids
[23:57:42] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> How? Private school is more solitary confinement here
[23:57:59] <wobniaR> Solitary confinement or prison, choose your poison
[23:58:04] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Public school is an open, semi low security one
[23:58:06] <Winter_Nights> hah
[23:58:16] <Winter_Nights> try English boarding school sometime.
[23:58:36] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> I didnt know boarding school existed here?
[23:58:48] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Is that alkatraz or something?
[23:58:52] <RandomNinja> I should point out that UK and US hav different meanings for Public School
[23:59:12] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Oh?
[23:59:34] <RandomNinja> US Public School = UK State School
[23:59:46] <RandomNinja> from what I can tell
