[05:06:47] <Flurshy> it's a mic stand that hasn't been extended for setup and use

[05:06:55] <Eywind> Yes, I got that
[05:06:59] <Flurshy> but like

[05:08:17] <Eywind> I know my grandma couldn't figure out how to twist the thing in the middle
[05:08:20] <Eywind> to extend it out
[05:08:37] <Eywind> or however you'd do the new one
[05:08:46] <Eywind> Not everyone who has a mic stand is a professional
[05:08:49] <Flurshy> it's always going to be "twist the thing in the middle"
[05:09:06] <Flurshy> just like for any pole, stick, broom handle etc

[05:09:30] <Eywind> I get what you're saying, but let's be realistic

[05:11:07] <Eywind> yeah the one you linked earlier, looks pretty sweet
[05:11:30] <nyditch> As a sound tech, I can tell you how to turn a 3 foot stand int oa 5 foot one.....
[05:11:36] <nyditch> Sell 3 foot stand, buy a 5 foot one.
[05:11:51] <Eywind> words of wisdom
[05:12:01] * Flurshy writes down notes
[05:12:07] <Eywind> also it's sad that the person only needs it to be 5 feet tall
[05:12:21] <nyditch> Hah, that's what they think.
[05:12:45] <Flurshy> I wish it weren't so expensive
[05:12:50] <Flurshy> though, the price is justified
[05:13:02] <Flurshy> just... want.
[05:13:12] <nyditch> Nice road cases are worth their price usually.
[05:13:17] <Eywind> Well christmas is coming up soon :P
[05:13:30] <Flurshy> I could easily put a feedback destroyer and a power conditioner in the bottom racks, and mixer on top
[05:13:35] <Flurshy> not to mention the laptop shelf
[05:13:46] <Regulus> Yus. I now have a patrol on the roof with a .50 cal rifle, RandomNinja 
[05:14:03] <Regulus> My base is working out spectacularly 
[05:14:51] <nyditch> I built my own collapsible DJ station out of plywood, 2x4, hinges, pins, and casters.
[05:15:01] <nyditch> It cost about $200 in materials.
[05:15:01] <Flurshy> run all my mixer lines under the laptop shelf
[05:15:13] <Flurshy> I would use this for tech mixing
[05:15:27] <Flurshy> it's currently on my "maybe in the future" list
[05:15:39] <nyditch> Yeah, looks good for that.
[05:16:22] <nyditch> Though honestly, I've also done a collapsible card table with a nice black cloth thrown over it for a live gig.
[05:16:34] <Flurshy> turns out there are rack mount DJ controllers
[05:16:40] <nyditch> Indeed
[05:17:01] <Flurshy> that's more far fetched for me. I would need to practice DJing
[05:17:05] <Flurshy> and I keep procrastinating that
[05:17:28] <Flurshy> probably should stop procrastinating, though it's hard to practice with no audience. and I can't stream over this internet
[05:17:55] <Flurshy> okay. official. I need to practice as of the point where I move, which I'm planning for April, when I'll have unlimited internets
[05:17:58] <nyditch> Here's the brutal truth: for most events, people won't care if you actually mix or not, as long as you play catchy music that they mostly know.
[05:18:09] * Flurshy nod
[05:18:37] <Flurshy> the good events are the ones where people care though :P
[05:18:42] <Flurshy> or, good in my opinion
[05:18:52] <Flurshy> that's also probably because I care, and notice when a DJ is being lazy
[05:19:18] <Flurshy> I'm looking at you, excessive low-pass filter
[05:20:17] <nyditch> For regular parties, I like to do about a 50% mix of popular stuff that I approve of the quality of, and 50% stuff that I can fit in with the current genre that they probably don't know but is catchy and I think they'll like.
[05:20:48] <nyditch> Some may think me crazy for not playing only the top 100.
[05:21:12] <Flurshy> honestly, I find that people who ONLY like the top 100 are boring
[05:21:14] <nyditch> but I'm gonna introduce people to music they've not heard.
[05:21:27] *** cocobed is now known as Noodles
[05:21:32] <Flurshy> like... music is an art to be appreciated as such
[05:21:38] <nyditch> Out of the top 100, I probably only would play maybe 15-20 of them.
[05:21:48] <nyditch> The rest I won't.
[05:21:59] <Flurshy> I would cherrypick the ones that go well with a dancey vibe

[05:35:20] <nyditch> Hah, yeah since I've started doing payed events I've been building up that collection. Probably about $500 in.
[05:35:28] <Flurshy> is it okay to play it at a paid event?
[05:35:30] <nyditch> Hah, yes.
[05:35:48] <nyditch> Hmm....
[05:35:54] <nyditch> For a private event, yeah.
[05:35:59] <Flurshy> I do at least wish free download soundclouds had a patreon or something
[05:36:31] <nyditch> For private events, all you need is a legal copy of the music you are playing to be legit.
[05:36:47] <Flurshy> for public events you need a license aye
[05:36:56] <Flurshy> license to play copyrighted music
[05:37:05] <nyditch> I've also contacted a few people on soundcloud who didn't have a track up for downlad and asked if I could use it. Most folks are really chill and say yeah.
[05:37:26] <Flurshy> said license is prohibitively expensive for an individual to afford, if the venue isn't the sort to have one

[05:37:39] <DinkyBot> Hi, momma!
[05:37:53] <Flurshy> well I had the idea to see about bringing local bands to food truck parks for performance
[05:38:06] <nyditch> Yeah, it's the same things you run into with radio, which takes a heck of a licensing scheme.
[05:38:19] <Flurshy> Austin's a musical town. bands get visibility, food truck parks get visitor interest, everybody wins
[05:38:35] <Flurshy> as is, the bands that play would only be able to play their own songs
[05:38:46] <nyditch> Yeah
[05:39:00] <Flurshy> unless I talked parks into paying for a license. Which I know they won't.
[05:39:22] <Flurshy> if I paid for a license, I'd be financially crippled and it wouldn't pay for itself
[05:39:31] <nyditch> I had my million dollar idea, which would cost that much to set up probably.
[05:39:35] <Flurshy> so... now I'm not sure how to go about this, really
[05:40:10] <Flurshy> any ideas?
[05:40:15] <nyditch> Download of music similar to iTunes/Amazon, etc. Difference being, you can get it in high quality formats. Legally.
