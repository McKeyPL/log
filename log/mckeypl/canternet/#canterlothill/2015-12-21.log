[02:13:38] <RandomNinja> I can just copy and paste
[02:13:48] <Sombra> First copy it onto your library, then make sure you have icloud turned off, THEN turn off blankedy blank
[02:13:55] <RandomNinja> meanwhile itunes requires you to ^
[02:14:10] <Sombra> THEN it copies all your music from your harddrive onto a DIFFERENT folder on your harddrive 
[02:14:20] <Sombra> (because the old folders you had it in weren't good enough)
[02:14:27] <RandomNinja> Sombra, why are you even using iTunes?
[02:14:29] <Sombra> So now you have two copies of your music taking up space on your harddrive.
[02:14:33] <Sombra> Because my mom gave me a free iphone.
[02:14:36] <RandomNinja> oh
[02:14:44] <RandomNinja> I know your pain
[02:14:55] <Sombra> I think I got amnesia about how bad itunes was to deal with.

[20:30:32] <ponyshouldponypony> thereallynewmop12100: well, the rest of the year I guess
[20:30:51] <Sketchy_Sounds> That reminds me of the portal network that a friend of mine built on a Minecraft server
[20:31:16] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldponypony: Good luck. Give me a screenshot of your tunnel
[20:31:21] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: Portal Network?
[20:31:25] <Sketchy_Sounds> He basically figured out how to map Nether portal co-ordinates to regular world co-ordinates and thus where to build portals.
[20:31:49] <Sketchy_Sounds> And then in the nether we had a load of minecart tracks in contained tunnels leading to portals.
[20:32:01] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: sounds fun
[20:32:25] <Sketchy_Sounds> So if you wanted to visit a friend's place, then rather than walk all that way you could just go into your handy portal and take a cart over to their portal.
[20:32:48] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: Actually I'm not vuilding ONE tunnel, but a system of tunnels that contain a dialer system for enderpearl teleporters ;)
[20:33:17] <Sketchy_Sounds> I was rather pleased with what I did with mine, because I built a floating palace of obsidian in the sky and the portal was behind a set of concealed swith-operated shutters.
[20:33:27] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldponypony: Your tunnel looks like a portal network
[20:33:32] <Sketchy_Sounds> **switch

[20:34:24] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: Or did you use a wither to farm it?

[20:35:41] <Sketchy_Sounds> Wither? What?
[20:35:49] <Sketchy_Sounds> I dunno what that is.
[20:35:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> Mine just relied on lava, water, and redstone.
[20:35:58] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: how did you autofarm it without a wither?
[20:36:08] <Sketchy_Sounds> Simple.
[20:36:09] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: Oh, that old thing
[20:36:13] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah :p
[20:36:31] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: I think that was patched a loooooooong time ago ^^
[20:36:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> I dunno what a wither is, which suggests it's something that came in long after I stopped playing. And maye, I dunno. Does redstone still require a block of empty space above it?
[20:37:21] <ponyshouldponypony> Sketchy_Sounds: umm, no, did it?
[20:37:28] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah, it used to.
[20:37:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> That was how that worked, because redstone was counted as a block.
[20:37:43] <ponyshouldponypony> intersting, didn't know that
[20:37:52] <thereallynewmop12100> Sketchy_Sounds: How to build your portal network? 
[20:38:08] <ponyshouldponypony> thereallynewmop12100: using math i guess ;)
[20:38:21] <Sketchy_Sounds> So the lava would land on top of the space the redstone was supposedly occupying, and then turn into a block of obsidian. It meant you lost the Redstone, but you got Obsidian as a result :p
[20:38:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> thereallynewmop12100: I didn't. A friend of mine who was insanely good at mapping co-ordinates did.
[20:40:28] <ponyshouldponypony> Minecraft is the best game to play while watching videos on the second screen ;)

[20:40:51] <Sketchy_Sounds> What?

[20:41:11] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well yes.

[20:41:19] <Sketchy_Sounds> Or at least, it used to be.
