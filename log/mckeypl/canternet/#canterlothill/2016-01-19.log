[20:53:17] <RandomNinja> LD50 of caffeine is 100-150mg/kg

[20:53:44] <Unixkitty> In other news, I may or may not have acquired a nerdbook
[20:53:48] <Zuthal> so you need about 10g to kill an average human
[20:53:57] <Unixkitty> Cloud_Zephyr would probably be proud
[20:54:03] <RandomNinja> your average 12oz/35cl coffee contains maybe 100-200 depending
[20:54:09] <RandomNinja> espresso is like 250-300
[20:54:17] <Cloud_Zephyr> yus
[20:54:19] <Zuthal> For the same size?
[20:54:27] <RandomNinja> yeah I think so

[20:54:35] <RandomNinja> this is off the top of my head
[20:54:37] * Unixkitty nerds Cloud_Zephyr :P
[20:54:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> macbooks superior laptops
[20:55:14] <Zuthal> so if you distill espressodown zo 1/40th the volume one cup can kill you
[20:55:20] <RandomNinja> a triple brewed espresso could possibly push a gram
[20:55:24] <Unixkitty> Not so superior in terms of price, but I suppose that would be it

[20:56:26] <RandomNinja> those things are thiiick but still quite drinkable
[20:56:38] <Unixkitty> First question! Why does pressing Delete button having a file or folder selected makes a "dun" sound instead of doing what it's supposed to
