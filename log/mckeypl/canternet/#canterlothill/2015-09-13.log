[17:17:42] <RandomNinja> oh all of them then
[17:18:02] <Flurshy> so Ninja, do you know of any PC sound cards with 5.1 opticla INPUT?
[17:18:21] <Flurshy> optical*
[17:18:53] <Flurshy> like for DAC
[17:19:26] <RandomNinja> no idea
[17:19:41] <RandomNinja> but I'd try looking at Asus Xonar series

[17:25:14] <RandomNinja> does it have to be internal?
[17:25:24] <Flurshy> well I just figured out a different way to do it
[17:25:26] <Trildar> Technically, it supports 5.1, but only in compressed form
[17:25:36] *** Quits: Mongoosie (Goosie@thanks.gun.god) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[17:25:41] <Flurshy> simplest possible method, only need 3 items plus cables

[17:26:35] <RandomNinja> "optical in: 1xToslink"
[17:26:41] <Flurshy> that's probably 2.0
[17:27:02] <RandomNinja> yeah maybe
[17:27:10] <Flurshy> would have to check reviews

[17:30:20] <Flurshy> I probably won't, but it's worth a shot
[17:32:34] <Trildar> Doesn't the Xonar D1 only have digital output?
[17:33:21] <RandomNinja> apparently not https://www.asus.com/Sound-Cards/Xonar_D1/specifications/
[17:33:52] <Flurshy> I found a $30 sound card with 5.1 out
[17:34:00] <RandomNinja> out isn't hard to find

[17:35:14] <Flurshy> sound card for PC optical out, 3-way optical switch to switch between PC, 360 and PS4. switch leads to the DAC, which outputs in 3.5mm 5.1 analog to the subwoofer's inputs
[17:35:30] <Flurshy> three items, cables, boom, surround sound.
[17:35:44] <RandomNinja> does it have to be optical though?
[17:35:50] <RandomNinja> why not digital?
[17:36:10] <Flurshy> because the 360 and PS4 have optical outputs...
[17:36:44] <RandomNinja> ah
[17:36:55] <Trildar> Optical is digital. Isn't it?
[17:37:01] <Flurshy> mhm
[17:37:08] <Flurshy> optical is toslink is digital
[17:37:25] <Flurshy> I assume Ninja is referring to coaxial, which uses the same connector as RCA I think
[17:37:32] <Flurshy> but is digital
[17:37:56] <RandomNinja> I'm not entirely sure, sound isn't my thing
[17:38:27] <Flurshy> optical is one of the two main forms of digital sound. coaxial is the other that I've seen, but I've never seen it in use

[20:24:44] <RandomNinja> dat 1:1 response tho
[20:25:15] <FruitNibbler> Instead of making a universal acceleration modifier it should be a modifiable curve, where user can tweak behaviour as they please
[20:26:51] <FruitNibbler> I tend to lower my dpi whenever I need small movements, but I need my cursor to be able to traverse all screen when I make a larger, faster swing
[20:27:53] <RandomNinja> you need a mouse with "sniper button"
[20:28:16] <FruitNibbler> Windows acceleration is a flat curve ratio, I'd rather have it as a small ratio change between sub-cm and bigger than cm movements, but ultimately flat lines left and right fromt hat point
[20:28:40] <FruitNibbler> No, sniper button is not the solution

[20:44:14] <FruitNibbler> The more time you have the more likely you are to come up with a solution

[20:45:33] <Flurshy> I like both of the recent versions, hehe
[20:45:39] <RandomNinja> quicksilver doesn't nearly come close tho
[20:46:19] <FruitNibbler> Ha this article is exactly my gripe with superpowers
[20:46:22] <RandomNinja> he breaks the sound barrier, Flash hits decent fractions of light speed
[20:47:08] <FruitNibbler> Even /IF/ hulk can be that strong, momentum and surfaces around him will not allow hulk to swing a tank like he did
[20:47:41] <FruitNibbler> He'd sink into the ground and rip a part of the tank out
[20:47:49] <RandomNinja> IIRC current canon about superman is that he's subconsiously telekinetic

[20:47:51] <DinkyBot>  [ X Men Days Of the Future Past QuickSilver Scene - YouTube ]
[20:48:08] <RandomNinja> he is that strong, but makes the world around him not break when he uses it
[20:48:57] <FruitNibbler> Well yeah, it would require to have some leverage other than mere friction to handle this much power, torque and acceleration

[20:53:42] <FruitNibbler> Nice effects with this quicksilver scene, but, but that hat would shred from such acceleration, bullet should deform, and any object he encounters should penetrate quicksilver, because at that speed any stationary object is a bullet to him
