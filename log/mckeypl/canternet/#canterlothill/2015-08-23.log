[04:52:19] <Moon_Solace> Don't worry about it

[04:55:08] <Regulus> That's a good way to do it.
[04:57:21] <Regulus> I've been around a while. I've seen artists start from nothing and work up to greatness. I've seen authors go from unknowns to exceptionally popular. The thing that makes them all succeed is a willingness to accept criticism and a drive to always improve.

[07:02:37] <ynoP> I went to Canada yesterday and was really astonished at the difference between Niagara Falls Canada and Niagara Falls New York. NF Canada is actually nice, with a lot of business and things to do. Niagara Falls New York is a dump in comparison. It's sad really.
[07:02:45] <Eywind> indeed
[07:02:52] <whovian4452> yea i cant watch baseball it board me no offense
[07:03:06] <Eywind> ynoP because it's not somewhere people in Canada travel to

[07:03:22] <ynoP> I know
[07:03:29] <ynoP> They go around NF
[07:03:50] <ynoP> And end up in North Tonawanda/other surrounding areas

[07:06:54] <whovian4452> well there alot of towns bein abandon in the states plus drought

[07:10:24] <ynoP> That's a LOT of water you're talking about
[07:10:33] <Kelazi5> it would take a lot of energy to get the salt out and make it drinkable
[07:10:56] <ynoP> It's doable, and it is being done, but not here
[07:11:10] <whovian4452> yeah but the ocean are rising becasue of the ozone and the ice caps i mean if we drain some we could keep the water level down but there would be no money in it i belive'
[07:11:38] <ynoP> You can only move so much water
[07:12:11] <whovian4452> i mean plus it could also be sent over seas to help out other nations but there to buisy making weapons and tryin to advance that tech
[07:12:46] <whovian4452> i know its a shame but in time they will see i feel bad for the people who had that river polluted

[15:16:17] <FruitNibbler> What was the site where you compare headphones by the sound quality again
[15:16:44] <FruitNibbler> My sister wants "beats by dr.Dre" and believes that they are top quality
[15:18:49] <RandomNinja> this for frequency response charts http://www.headphone.com/pages/build-a-graph
[15:21:02] <RandomNinja> here's a good comparison http://graphs.headphone.com/graphCompare.php?graphType=0&graphID[]=2851&graphID[]=4313&graphID[]=1383&scale=30
[15:24:22] <RandomNinja> you'll want something like WhatHiFi for reviews and Head-Fi for forums
[15:25:29] <Hamtramck> There's apparently like one mode of Beats that are good.
[15:26:00] <RandomNinja> they're good if you like bass, bad if you like the rest of the audible spectrum
[15:26:42] <Hamtramck> Honestly, and I've said this a bunch, but I use my BrainWavz Deltas and Koss KSC75s mainly now, which are like, budget-line headphones.
[15:26:46] <Hamtramck> I just really like how they sound.
[15:27:02] <Hamtramck> (The KSC75s moreso than the Deltas, although the latter are better for certain genres).
[15:27:15] <RandomNinja> I use ATH-AD500 http://graphs.headphone.com/graphCompare.php?graphType=0&graphID[]=113&scale=30
[15:27:22] <RandomNinja> look at that delicious midrange
[15:27:57] <Hamtramck> Vocals sound weird on the MH50Xs to me.
[15:28:10] <Hamtramck> Like I was watching one of the RoosterTeeth podcasts and it was like "everyone sounds like they have a cold."
[15:28:42] <RandomNinja> probably the bass http://graphs.headphone.com/graphCompare.php?graphType=0&graphID[]=1023&graphID[]=4313&scale=30
[15:28:56] <Hamtramck> oh god
[15:29:30] <Hamtramck> I never looked at that graph that's entirely how they sound XD
[15:29:45] <RandomNinja> for reference http://graphs.headphone.com/graphCompare.php?graphType=0&graphID[]=1023&graphID[]=4313&graphID[]=2571&graphID[]=1383&scale=30
[15:29:59] <RandomNinja> just look at those disgusting earphones
[15:30:26] <Hamtramck> Earphones already tend to sound bassier to me cause the plugs.
[15:31:52] <Hamtramck> Also I think being closed-back contributed to the congested sound the MH50xs had to me. Whatever Sennheisers I have had this like weird internal echo thing that made certain songs sound really distant
[15:31:54] <Hamtramck> It was weird.
[15:32:06] <RandomNinja> that's the point though
[15:32:23] <Hamtramck> ?
[15:32:49] <RandomNinja> giving the illusion of being outside or in a large venue rather than having everything up close
[15:33:13] <Hamtramck> It wasn't soundstagey distance, it was like
[15:33:21] <RandomNinja> oh okay
[15:33:34] <Hamtramck> It was like I was listening to something distant through an old-timey ear cone :P
[15:33:36] <RandomNinja> cuz soundstage is sweet :P

[15:33:44] <RandomNinja> which headphones tho?
[15:33:53] <Flurshy> definitely the HD800
[15:34:01] <RandomNinja> I want them
[15:34:06] <RandomNinja> but that's not happening
[15:34:24] <Flurshy> yeeeah...
[15:34:45] <Hamtramck> http://en-us.sennheiser.com/over-ear-headphones-hd-202 I see these get recommended a lot but I did noooot like them.
[15:34:46] <DinkyBot>  [ Sennheiser HD 202 - Over Ear Headphones - Stereo HiFi  ]
[15:34:50] <RandomNinja> I was blown away by the AKG K812, which is in a similar price range
[15:35:00] <Hamtramck> (I mean as like budget headphones, not high quality ones)
[15:35:02] <RandomNinja> and apparently HD800 is noticably better
[15:35:36] <Hamtramck> I should probably get an amp or a USB DAC for my laptop or something
[15:36:17] <RandomNinja> Hamtramck yeah makes sense as Sennheiser is pretty much the benchmark of $100-150 range open back headphones
[15:36:20] <Flurshy> isn't the HD202 a $70 pair?
[15:36:26] <Hamtramck> No.
[15:36:31] <Hamtramck> They're msrp 35 but usually 20
[15:36:39] <RandomNinja> I've heard bad things about their budget range, but also good things, so I'm not sure
[15:36:40] <Flurshy> I would go for the HD280 or HD380 personally
[15:37:05] <Flurshy> I have sennheiser earbuds that started out as $70
[15:37:11] <Flurshy> they're pretty nice, for earbuds
[15:37:24] <RandomNinja> how much did you pay?
[15:37:28] <Hamtramck> Someone I know was speaking postiviely about the momentums recently
[15:37:35] <Flurshy> $30
[15:37:37] <RandomNinja> neat
[15:37:59] <RandomNinja> Momentum is mostly just overpriced though, aren't they?
[15:38:06] <RandomNinja> they're still fine headphones
[15:38:12] <Flurshy> been thinking about getting myself the AT M50x for xmas
[15:38:23] <RandomNinja> AD700x tho :P
[15:38:26] <Flurshy> in white
[15:38:39] <Hamtramck> flurshy as I said I thought they were ridiculously tight
[15:38:45] <Flurshy> because they actually come in white, and white is fashionable :D
[15:38:51] <Flurshy> hmm
[15:38:57] <Hamtramck> Like I pretty much can't wear my pair at all.
[15:39:09] <Flurshy> do you have a large head as far as headphones go?
[15:39:14] <Hamtramck> Not realy.
[15:39:14] <RandomNinja> btw ATH-500x is $80 on Amazon
[15:39:20] <Flurshy> hm
[15:39:26] <RandomNinja> so if you want some sweet entry level open backs Hamtramck :P
[15:39:35] <RandomNinja> they're also not tight at all
[15:39:55] <Hamtramck> The tightness in the Mh50s is for isolation which doesn't matter for open backs anyway :P
[15:40:09] <Hamtramck> Anyway I have like, company reward points I can use at our company store so I might see what's there.
[15:40:10] <RandomNinja> yeah but seeing as you don't like that
[15:40:17] <Hamtramck> Wait don't like what?
[15:40:24] <RandomNinja> tight
[15:40:27] <Hamtramck> Yeah.
[15:40:35] <RandomNinja> they're also hilariously huge http://media.tumblr.com/0861648c390fa0f5e5ce8681d514c69e/tumblr_inline_msr2s2aHQK1qz4rgp.jpg
[15:41:35] <Flurshy> hold on
[15:41:38] <Hamtramck> I don't think I'd go closed back again unless I really NEEDED isolation.
[15:42:04] <Flurshy> are the M50s the sort that use cushion squeeze to stay in place, rather than hanging from the headband?
[15:42:14] <Hamtramck> Yes.
[15:42:24] <Hamtramck> ... Wait, I think?
[15:42:33] <RandomNinja> depends on how your head is shaped
[15:42:41] <Flurshy> as in you could get it to stay in place without the headband touching your head
[15:42:49] <Hamtramck> Oh I don't know.
[15:43:04] <RandomNinja> ask Cloud_Zephyr 
[15:43:11] <RandomNinja> he uses those
[15:43:12] <Hamtramck> I had mine set as small as they'd go, I could try making them bigger and see if that would work.
[15:43:15] * Flurshy pokes Cloud_Zephyr
[15:43:20] <Flurshy> you wat
[15:43:26] <Hamtramck> That didn't seem to make them clamp less tough?
[15:43:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> greetings
[15:43:54] <Flurshy> did you at any point try adjusting them Hamtramck?
[15:44:52] <RandomNinja> Step 1: find object slightly larger than your head. Step 2: Place headphones there for 2 days. Step 3: Profit?
[15:44:59] <Flurshy> indeed
[15:45:06] <Hamtramck> I did that and it wore off really fast
[15:45:09] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr, read through the last few minutes of conversation
[15:45:13] <Cloud_Zephyr> kk
[15:45:38] <RandomNinja> the part about M50x fitting, specifically
[15:45:40] <Hamtramck> The main issue is that the drivers have this nubby part that sticks out and that jabs my ear
[15:45:44] <Hamtramck> No matte what I did with it
[15:45:50] <RandomNinja> ah that sucks
[15:45:50] <Flurshy> Cloud_Zephyr: do the ATH M50x headphones squeeze from the earmuffs or do they use the headband to support their weight?
[15:45:53] <Hamtramck> Stretching them out made them not smash my TMJ so much
[15:46:08] <Hamtramck> I had to use the headband to support the wait when I just tried them
[15:46:23] <RandomNinja> Hamtramck, acquire AKG K1000 :P http://www.headfonia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/akg_k1000_04.jpg
[15:46:45] <Hamtramck> woooooooah, that's WAY too the future man
[15:46:52] <Cloud_Zephyr> I think it's mainly the headband because the pads don't have that much pressure
[15:46:53] <RandomNinja> it's actually from the 60's
[15:46:57] <RandomNinja> so retro-future?
[15:47:27] <Flurshy> Hamtramck says they were too tight for him... though apparently he had them on the smallest size setting >.>

[19:34:01] <RandomNinja> indeed, there are small colorful horses here
[19:35:04] <Mike_Coltfield> RandomNinja: Yes.
[19:35:46] <RandomNinja> Mike_Coltfield, see FN's corundrum
[19:36:00] <RandomNinja> what would you recommend as a similarly priced alternative?
[19:37:29] <Mike_Coltfield> Which Beats? The $150, $300, or $500 ones?
[19:37:36] <RandomNinja> FN ^
[19:38:44] <Mike_Coltfield> Because something that beats all of those for $170 are the Sennheiser Momentum for $160-ish
[19:39:10] <Mike_Coltfield> Or, if you're not a basshead, the AKG K553 Pro have the soundstage of open-back headphones for ~$140 on B&H
[19:39:41] <RandomNinja> I recommended this earlier http://i.imgur.com/0gRrcm2.png
[19:39:45] <Mike_Coltfield> If you really, truly must spend $300, get the Sennheiser HD 600, and if you want to boost that up to still-under-$500, get it an amp
[19:40:27] <Mike_Coltfield> The Audio-Technica ATH-M50X are what Dre actually uses. If you're listening to more acoustic pieces, their direct competitor, the Shure SRH-440 are a better option.
[19:40:44] <RandomNinja> as in better midrange?
[19:41:09] <Mike_Coltfield> More defined, but I only recommend those if you're using them for live monitoring. The AKG K553 Pro beat them in most regards
[19:41:47] <RandomNinja> only tried K551, but those were solid
[19:42:26] <Mike_Coltfield> Also, if you don't mind funny looks and want the most up-front sound around? Grado. They use the same transducer across the entire SR lineup, so those all sound similarly.
[19:42:44] <Mike_Coltfield> In the same price range as Beats, however, are the Grado RS2e, which could actually take on my Sennheiser HD 600
[19:42:44] <RandomNinja> grado only offers on-ear in that price range though, don't they?
[19:43:14] <Mike_Coltfield> Grado only really offers on-ear as-is, but they also sell the around-ear earpad that's compatible with their entire lineup
[19:43:21] <RandomNinja> if not I'm seriously considering buying a pair
[19:44:19] <RandomNinja> also are you sure you meant RS2e? Beause those are 2.5x the price of HD600 
[19:45:20] <Mike_Coltfield> Huh? I thought they were $270...
[19:45:26] <Mike_Coltfield> Okay, must have been an Amazon sale
[19:45:59] <RandomNinja> about $600, yeah
[19:46:25] <Mike_Coltfield> ~$500 from B&H...but yeah
[19:46:32] <RandomNinja> FN, are you reading?
[19:46:41] <Mike_Coltfield> That's still Sennheiser HD 650 money, and the 650 *is* the better headphone
[19:47:32] <RandomNinja> HD650 is $350 here
[19:48:11] <Mike_Coltfield> But yeah, RandomNinja,if you want around-ear Grados, get just about anything in the SR line, read the modding guides on how to turn them into any other headphone in the SR line, and get the G-Cush ear cushions

[23:53:58] <MikeM> Or stick around, and broaden some horizons.
