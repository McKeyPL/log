[02:20:40] <RandomNinja> very much so
[02:20:42] <wobniaR> I need an adult
[02:20:45] <RandomNinja> !t MikeM 
[02:20:46] <DinkyBot> MikeM i thought it did. Acquired taste?

[02:21:01] <MikeM> For most people, Dinky.

[02:21:53] * DerpyBot wraps her front hooves around DinkyBot in a tight embrace

[02:23:56] * RandomNinja drops spaghetti on MikeM 
[02:24:19] * MikeM applies alfredo sauce.
[02:24:28] <MikeM> Creamy.
[02:25:25] <RandomNinja> sounds good
[02:25:38] * RandomNinja applies curry chicken wok to MikeM 
[02:26:29] <MikeM> Mmm. Curry chicken. I should make some.
[02:27:25] <RandomNinja> yeah that's one of my new staple recipes
[02:27:29] *** Joins: Playstation (Playstation@Playstation.Pone.64)
[02:27:36] <RandomNinja> it's ridiculously good
[02:28:04] <RandomNinja> the key is using absurd amounts of butter
[02:28:28] <MikeM> Butter makes everything better.
[02:29:03] <RandomNinja> yeah
[02:29:15] <RandomNinja> speaking of which, I just acquired MyFitnessPal

[02:30:02] <Playstation> That's good
[02:30:03] <One-Trick> im almost out of curry ketchup
[02:30:11] <Playstation> !t curry ketchup
[02:30:12] <DinkyBot> I dislike curry
[02:30:16] <Playstation> waaaat
[02:30:22] <RandomNinja> it's being passive agressive about my fat consumption
[02:30:32] <MikeM> Oh?
[02:30:40] *** DARK is now known as Duncan
[02:31:06] <RandomNinja> wait no, it stopped
[02:31:19] <RandomNinja> apparently it got calories and weight of fat mixed up
[02:31:28] <RandomNinja> my daily fat intake was like 600g
[02:31:39] <RandomNinja> which is obviously ridiculous from a single meal
[02:31:58] <MikeM> Are you eating sticks of butter?
[02:32:29] <RandomNinja> I mean
[02:32:47] <RandomNinja> I had like an entire stick in 3 servings of curry chicken wok
[02:33:05] <RandomNinja> also I regret nothing, it was delicious
[02:33:06] <Playstation> RandomNinja: Have you ever had fried butter?
[02:33:08] <Playstation> Me neither
[02:33:24] <RandomNinja> depends on your definition of fried butter
[02:33:33] <Playstation> Fried butter sticks
[02:33:38] <Playstation> like
[02:33:40] <Playstation> fried
[02:33:40] <RandomNinja> seeing as I use butter as my main cooking fat
[02:33:52] <Playstation> use margerine
[02:33:57] <RandomNinja> why?
[02:33:59] <Playstation> you wouldn't believe it's not butter
[02:33:59] <RandomNinja> it's inferior
[02:34:01] <MikeM> Margarine is garbage.
[02:34:02] <RandomNinja> pls
[02:34:06] <RandomNinja> ^
[02:34:09] <Playstation> I'm kidding butter is better
[02:34:13] <Playstation> better
[02:34:14] <Playstation> butter
[02:34:17] <Playstation> eyyy
[02:34:33] <RandomNinja> only exception is olive oil for when you want to scorch things really hot
[02:34:39] <RandomNinja> like wok for example
[02:35:27] <Playstation> mhm
[02:35:58] <RandomNinja> why does this channel keep turning into cooking general?
[02:36:04] <RandomNinja> not that I mind, but still
[02:36:30] <MikeM> Needs more Epic Cupcake Time.
[02:36:36] <Playstation> no that's old
[02:36:38] <Playstation> very old
[02:36:40] <Playstation> ooooold
[02:37:03] <MikeM> It lives on in spirit.
[02:37:07] <Playstation> ^
[02:37:12] <Playstation> but it's oooold
[02:37:13] <RandomNinja> also I like the fact that the angriest and most srs business arguments in here are about the proper cooking of fine steak

[04:38:00] <Eywind> that song was sweet wobniaR
[04:38:08] <Eywind> the one you linked
[04:38:13] <wobniaR> Yeah I was surprised to hear a hype song in Modells
[04:38:25] <wobniaR> Usually it's generic top 25 pop stuff
[04:39:20] <wobniaR> Just gonna put this all on my phone I need da muziks for that ride
[04:39:35] <Eywind> You could just listen to canterlot hill radio for 13 hours ;)
[04:39:51] <wobniaR> That too but I need to get the app for that
[04:40:14] <wobniaR> I don't think the default android app supports music streams

[04:41:14] <PinkieShy> Guys i have a question what do you think would be a goodname for irc channel of tech (on another network) out of these i list: SouthernTech, RockingTech, PirateTech, TechyTech, WinTech?
[04:41:18] <wobniaR> Cause kids won't get off your lawn
[04:41:23] <Regulus> O.o
[04:41:39] <wobniaR> You'd be the better judge of that PinkieShy
[04:41:41] <PinkieShy> I just want an opinion.. if thats okay.
[04:41:57] <PinkieShy> ok
[04:42:03] <Eywind> !dice 1d5
[04:42:04] <DinkyBot> You rolled 1d5 for 3 (3)
[04:42:15] <Eywind> PirateTech sounds a bit sketchy actually
[04:42:19] <MikeM> Which one describes your purpose? Are you starting a channel about technology for pirates?
[04:42:20] <Eywind> luckily he's not on for me to ping

[04:42:59] <PinkieShy> i don't support piracy
[04:43:23] <wobniaR> Oh neat didn't know there was VLC for android

[04:43:32] <PinkieShy> I know a lot about windows.. I broke windows 8.1 enough to know what to do and what not to do, and how to fix

[04:44:11] <PinkieShy> wobniaR i broke windows 8.1 once by deleting random stuff in regedit.exe LOL
