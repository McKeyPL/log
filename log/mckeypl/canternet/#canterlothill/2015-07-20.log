[09:21:57] <MikeM> Powernaps rule.
[09:22:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: The heat here just makes me want to sleep. So, woke up to have some veggie spread on Texas toast, and some Sharp cheddar.
[09:22:30] <MikeM> Mmm. Sounds like a good snack.
[09:22:30] <Muffin_Spectacles> Had a pretty decent weekend. Won a Back to the Future costume contest on Saturday, and saw 3 hours of Looney Tunes on a big screen earlier Sunday.
[09:23:01] <MikeM> Dude, congrats on the costume win! Any pics?
[09:23:11] <Muffin_Spectacles> The contest was sadly, a slam-dunk. I was the only one who went all-out on his costume, as 2015 Doc Brown. Was hoping someone would do me one better, though once again, it proves I'm the only Doc Brown cosplayer in this giant city.
[09:23:48] <MikeM> Omaha?
[09:24:17] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Chicago. This City has no taste in entertainment like I do. Then again, wearing the costume, only a handful of people know who Doc is.
[09:24:42] <Muffin_Spectacles> The young kids these days have no clue...well, the majority of them. The minority who recognize Doc are the cool kids to me :)
[09:24:44] <MikeM> Chicago...wow. I'm surprised there weren't more Doc's there.
[09:25:30] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: If I was in California, I'd probably find more. I'm gong to a major BTTF event in October, and there's a costume contest then too. Plan to be Doc again, to be among a supposed group. There's got to be more Docs there!
