[18:48:22] <DanielWaterhorse> Ah. Okay

[18:49:04] <DanielWaterhorse> I'm watching videos from a coursera course the one guy was really good at explaining things, and then this lady just jumps through all this math without explaining a dang thing
[18:49:10] <RandomNinja> transform a superposition, split the transform up, transform back
[18:49:19] <DanielWaterhorse> And it doesn't even sound like something you'd learn in standard linear algebra, necessarily

[18:54:33] <DanielWaterhorse> I know Cloud_Kicker. But math definitely suffers from obscuration by language in a way that isn't always necessary when explaining it to scientists and engineers
[18:54:55] <DanielWaterhorse> Usually, examples can help you understand what the variables mean and why
[18:55:05] <RandomNinja> not necassary, but it does make it much easier to work with
[18:56:06] <DanielWaterhorse> I mean... I'm sure in higher level math you need all of the very precise definitions to formulate proofs and get from one place to the next

[19:02:20] <RandomNinja> darn
[19:02:23] <DanielWaterhorse> Yeah. I understand set theory in terms of using it for programming, but I never had a class on it so sometimes there are terms that have no meaning to me
[19:02:34] <DanielWaterhorse> That can almost always be explained in a way I will understand it tho
[19:03:25] <DanielWaterhorse> For example... one thing I'm trying to figure out now.
[19:04:06] <DanielWaterhorse> A time series is just a function over time, but instead of being continuous it's the set of values you get over a range of discreet time points for t?
[19:04:23] <RandomNinja> basically in these contexts, if a function or series is part of the set of functions/series with this property, you can do this

[19:06:49] <DanielWaterhorse> Er... when, not until
[19:07:18] <DanielWaterhorse> So if something is like, "This is a time series" I'm like what the hay is a time series
[19:07:37] <DanielWaterhorse> And then I'll go look that up but it will be explained with 8 paragraphs of math jive
[19:08:01] <DanielWaterhorse> That over complicate the definition of it that would be useful to me

[19:08:31] <DanielWaterhorse> I do like math, but stuff like that makes it pretty painful :I
[19:08:44] <RandomNinja> it also keeps you from having to write long definitions of concepts everywhere
[19:09:33] <RandomNinja> instead of "the rate of change of a time-dependant function" you just put f'(t)

[19:11:19] <DanielWaterhorse> In a directed sort of fashion
[19:11:40] <wobniaR> Probably not possible

[19:13:18] * wobniaR sends a http brew method to RandomNinja's coffee pot
[19:13:54] <RandomNinja> there's a difference between getting an intuitive grasp of a concept and understanding how it really works tho
[19:15:13] <DanielWaterhorse> Sure, sure. But like... when you have to learn very multi-disciplinary subjects, sometimes you just have to get a good enough grasp of it to keep moving, and let the full understanding come over time as you use it

[19:16:54] <DanielWaterhorse> Like... I have no clue how to solve differential equations (which is something I need to learn for CCN fo' sho). But I understand what the equations mean when I look at them, and for the moment that's good enough
[19:17:24] <DanielWaterhorse> And then later on, I'll learn more about actually solving them and understanding them on a deeper level

[22:36:40] <Sombra> Noob, and also nub.
[22:37:10] <RandomNinja> but srsly what's the point of chili if it doesn't burn both ways?
[22:37:21] <wobniaR> I like sriracha sauce, it's like a spicy sweet sauce
[22:38:29] <RandomNinja> sweet works, as long as it's hot as well
[22:38:32] <Sombra> Some garlic salt, sea salt, ground pepper, chili pepper, cheyne pepper, jalapeno pepper.
[22:38:48] <Trildar> All teh peppers
[22:39:08] <Sombra> And uh, what am I missing... cumin powder.
[22:39:19] <Trildar> RandomNinja: Have you actually experienced it burning on the way out? :P
[22:39:34] <RandomNinja> I have
[22:39:40] <Sombra> Well, there's really only one way for it to come out.
[22:39:47] <wobniaR> It's like, mild spicy
[22:39:47] <RandomNinja> that one was actually painful to eat tho
[22:39:53] <Sombra> Actually that's not true.  You know sometimes how you throw up in your mouth a little bit?
[22:39:59] <RandomNinja> not enough stouts to balance it out
[22:40:07] <wobniaR> Spicy enough to have a kick in large amounts but in small/medium it's good
[22:40:15] <Sombra> That happened to me once right after I ate that spicy chilie, except I snorted some so it came dripping out my nose, and boy, it burned all the way up and down.
[22:40:48] <RandomNinja> that sucks
[22:41:43] <RandomNinja> but yeah pretty much everyone at the table felt a bit weird in their stomaches after eating. Delicious tho.
