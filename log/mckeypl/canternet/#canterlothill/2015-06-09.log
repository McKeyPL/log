[02:32:55] * Twilightlicious is eating Papa Johns right now
[02:33:18] <Sombra> But that's only because I eat cheap pizza, I haven't had papa murphys or pizza hut in a long time.
[02:33:22] <KooK> Maybe I'll get some Vegan Pizza
[02:33:37] <Twilightlicious> I got a Vegetarian Pizza :3
[02:33:49] <StrykerVylon> Pizza Hut is okay. Not good, not bad. 
[02:33:50] <KooK> If you get Vegan Pizza, it's weird stuff
[02:33:52] <Sombra> Although there is a 5$ pizza around that actually makes their pizzas fresh as you order them.  So I'd say it's a step up from little cae-tsars
[02:33:58] <StrykerVylon> Personally I like Dominos.
[02:34:23] <Twilightlicious> i like Pizza Hutt when they're clean and taken care of
[02:34:29] <Twilightlicious> my local pizza hutt is awful
[02:34:37] <StrykerVylon> The Papa John's ive ate at have never been good. It's like the wendy's of the pizza chains.

[04:47:02] <Sabreman> I just want to make sure that the api is working how I think it's working
[04:47:13] <Eywind> Umm
[04:47:14] <Eywind> What
[04:47:27] <Sabreman> when i do a call to getVoteStatus, no matter what trackid i pass it, it always returns the status for the currently playing song
[04:47:31] <Sabreman> I think
[04:47:33] <Eywind> Correct
[04:47:43] <Sabreman> then whats the point of the trackid?
[04:48:05] <Eywind> I don't even see trackid in the api documentation for getvotestatus
[04:48:25] <Sabreman> oh shoot you're right
[04:48:31] <Sabreman> it was set vote i was thiking off
[04:48:34] <Eywind> Yeah
[04:48:38] <Sabreman> that was always setting my vote for the current track too
[04:48:44] <Sabreman> no matter what id i gave it.
[04:48:49] <Eywind> Hmm
[04:49:18] <Eywind> Yeah IDK if we have the trackid working for setvote since we really don't have it enabled on the site other than for the current song
[04:49:29] <Sabreman> hmm
[04:49:48] <Sabreman> Who would I talk to to make sure it works? Also possibly getting a trackid parameter for getVoteStatus?

[05:48:01] <KooK> Why do mechanical keyboards make you sound like you're typing faster than you really are?
[05:48:19] <Eywind> because the clicks are mid-press? idk
[05:48:20] <MikeM> Double-action clicks?
[05:48:34] <Eywind> Plus they make you actually type faster

[06:03:47] <KooK> So I assume you went to school for accounting
[06:03:51] <Eywind> Nope
[06:03:54] <PinkieShy> Wanda how are you?
[06:04:12] <KooK> Well, working accounting at a big bank, I assume you graduated college?
[06:04:18] <Eywind> Not when I started
[06:04:33] <KooK> But when you did graduate, what was your major
[06:04:43] <Eywind> associate of arts from community college :P
[06:04:54] <KooK> 2 year degree then
[06:05:14] <Eywind> Yep for now
[06:05:22] <KooK> Just wasn't sure what you wanted to be doing
[06:05:28] <Eywind> make money
[06:05:31] <Wanda> I'm good playing formula 1 :D
[06:05:38] <KooK> Which is the end goal for most
[06:05:45] <Eywind> Not necessarily
[06:05:52] * Twilightlicious throws pennies at Eywind 
[06:05:59] <Eywind> There's people who have a passion which is also marketable and helps them pay the bills
[06:06:01] <Wanda> I'm a big fan of the racing game and show
[06:06:09] <Eywind> and then there's people who have a skill in an area they don't necessarily enjoy but can get a niche they tolerate
[06:06:19] <Eywind> and just need to enjoy the rest of their life that much more
[06:06:23] <KooK> Yeah, but to be put into a position that matches your passion tends to be kind of rare.
[06:06:57] <KooK> A lot of people settle for, like you said, a niche they tolerate
[06:07:04] <Eywind> I woudln't say it's "settling"
[06:07:14] <Eywind> Some people just don't have passions that are marketable
[06:07:22] <KooK> eh, potato potatoe
[06:07:39] <Eywind> Well no
[06:08:15] <KooK> could you elaborate?
[06:08:32] <Eywind> I kinda already did, but I'll try to rephrase
[06:08:42] <KooK> Please and thank you
[06:09:18] <Eywind> There's people who have a passion for something and can make a job of it.  Those people enjoy their work, but don't necessarily make as much money often and are usually struggling on the rest of their lives.  Of course, there's exceptions, but a lot of the people I know who are "living their dream" put in a buttload of hours and have a constant strain, especially early in their careers.
[06:09:28] <KooK> You are a quick typer :P
[06:09:56] <Eywind> There's people who don't necessarily have a passion for something that they can make a job of, or like something but treat it more of a hobby and have a more marketable skillset.  They're usually more well-off in their life, but their job isn't as fulfilling so they have to get more pleasure out of the rest of their lives.
[06:10:00] <Eywind> That's how I got my job, actually.
[06:10:08] <Eywind> Crushed my skills assessment at a temp agency
[06:10:27] <KooK> What was your cwpm?
[06:10:53] <Hamtramck> I don't feel like I have much passion for anything.
[06:11:00] <Eywind> Depends on where I'm testing, but generally transposing on text I'm like 100-130
[06:11:06] <Hamtramck> I don't really like my job but I can't honestly think of anything I'd rather be doing
[06:11:08] <Eywind> and comparable on the numpad
[06:11:14] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Eywind
[06:11:15] <DinkyBot> Eywind : just 15 mins ago or so
[06:11:17] <KooK> Eywind - cwpm or wpm?
[06:11:23] <Eywind> idk what cwpm is
[06:11:38] <KooK> corrected.  It decreases your count by 5 for every misspelt word
[06:11:49] <Eywind> Oh I always count 100% accuracy
[06:12:11] <Eywind> If I do typing tests or whatever I make sure I go back and change everything since it's the most realistic way you'd be gauging your speed
[06:13:25] <KooK> Hamtramck - Mostly a sign that you need to go out and try more new things :P

[06:17:58] <KooK> I want Isle of Man TT to happen, but I might be stuck with cars.  Which is a good place to be in my book.
[06:18:09] <KooK> Still fun
[06:18:29] <MikeM> Motorcycling is a smaller field, for sure.

[06:19:24] <KooK> down*
[06:19:57] <MikeM> Which is practically guaranteed on Isle of Man.
[06:20:26] <KooK> Eh, less than you might think.
[06:20:38] <KooK> But, yeah, there's always somebody that biffs it.
[06:22:05] <KooK> Man I love watching this.  It's such a symphony of man and machine meeting the road.

[06:48:17] <MikeM> idk. I bet it's Microsoft's doing.

[06:51:12] <Twilightlicious> i dont even know if it supports Streaming content
[06:51:20] <One-Trick> yes, it does
[06:51:28] <One-Trick> there was a huge fight over that
[06:51:53] <One-Trick> http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/drm-in-html5-is-a-victory-for-the-open-web-not-a-defeat/
[06:52:53] <Twilightlicious> There's also the issue of Licensing for Netflix.
[06:53:02] <Twilightlicious> Getting approval to show some video on Mobile devices, Etc.
[06:53:17] <One-Trick> thsy already do
[06:53:19] <One-Trick> they*

[06:54:07] <One-Trick> i dont see how the technology used to move the video has anything to do with being played on a device or not
[06:54:23] <One-Trick> its all drm, it knows what its playing on, thats part of the mechanic
[06:54:53] <One-Trick> if you dont have the keys, you font get the castle
[06:54:58] <One-Trick> dont*
[06:55:03] <Twilightlicious> If it's HTML5, you could easily play it on pretty much any device :P
[06:55:24] <One-Trick> nevermind. the point of html5 drm video is being missed
[06:55:25] <Twilightlicious> Sounds like a good thing to Consumers, but perhaps not so good for Netflix.
[06:55:57] <Twilightlicious> Besides, they'll switch to something else eventually :P
[06:56:07] <One-Trick> html5 is the something else

[21:27:33] <miss> Unixkitty: could it be that i need to signed up because you're not from the U.S.A. and it's in another language than English?
[21:27:52] <Unixkitty> There were downloads available on any language Microsoft officially supports
[21:28:40] <Unixkitty> In fact, it seems to be still available, here miss http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso

[21:32:24] <RandomNinja> huh
[21:33:31] <RandomNinja> well, it's not out yet, it probably only applies to final version
[21:34:22] <Unixkitty> I suppose unless they have or will state that officially, we'll just have to see
[21:35:09] <miss> never mind, i read you article, but it's an insider previeuw iso,  when i clicked on windows insider program, there came an article in my language, which from what i read is an program that makes you to help the experts, it-pr's ,.... to develope windows 10. i think that this isn't quite the same as what i received from microsoft update/ upgrade Unixkitty 
[21:36:04] <Unixkitty> No no no miss, I know for a fact this is a fully fledged and working Windows 10, it's just called that
