[18:07:23] <Pony_9490> what was hk 47 the sith droid like that and im glad han and chewy are back
[18:07:48] <Pony_9490> the droids are one of the koolest things in starwars
[18:07:59] <Pony_9490> but the new saber does look interesting
[18:08:20] <RandomNinja> also dumb
[18:08:44] <Pony_9490> what?
[18:08:52] <RandomNinja> http://screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/Star-Wars-7-Crossguard-Lightsaber.jpg
[18:09:16] <RandomNinja> so the tiny lasers at the side are obviously supposed to act as a crossguard, yes?
[18:09:20] <Pony_9490> i like it but i wish they went a diferent route with it
[18:09:35] <RandomNinja> what do you think happens when someone cuts the metal part?
[18:09:47] <Pony_9490> i guess pardon my french but it remind me of the old englend bastard sword
[18:10:13] <RandomNinja> yeah but regular sword logic doesn't apply with lightsabers

[18:10:21] <Pony_9490> honestly i think it would be useless
[18:10:56] <Pony_9490> true my favorite saber tho is obi wans from when hes older from ep 2 3 4 
[18:10:58] <RandomNinja> it would be useless at best, likely actually dangerous
[18:11:02] <Pony_9490> and yodas 
[18:11:02] <wobniaR> Didn't they have swords in the old republic thay could parry lightsabers?
[18:11:14] <RandomNinja> maybe?
[18:11:22] <Pony_9490> true its like taking a scotish broadsword and making it a sabre
[18:11:38] <RandomNinja> even so if that's the case you'd be better off having the entire crossguard out of metal
[18:11:53] <Pony_9490> hang on umm vibraninum blade that can stand against a lightsaber

[18:13:12] <Pony_9490> i think its in the old republic there are metal sword that can be use against a saber without being cut in half

[19:01:37] <RandomNinja> but it does matter when those people run most of media
[19:01:47] <Pony_2345> eyup
[19:02:00] <Pony_2345> heck its kinda like espn in a way
[19:02:15] <Pony_2345> they yell about a rule alot of time and the nfl changes it
[19:02:25] <RandomNinja> http://politikfakta.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SVT_partisympatier.jpg
[19:02:44] <RandomNinja> top is national television, bottom general population
[19:02:54] <RandomNinja> the green one is the environmentalists
[19:05:55] <Pony_2345> ahh
[19:05:55] <Zuthal> what are the two blocks that are tallied separately?
[19:05:55] <RandomNinja> left vs right, -ish
[19:05:55] <Zuthal> ah
[19:05:55] <Zuthal> and which are all the parties?
[19:05:55] <Pony_2345> kinda reminds of the song land of confushion
[19:06:10] <Cloud_Zephyr> K I wanna move to Canada now
[19:06:35] <RandomNinja> V = leftists, S = social democrats, SD = social conservatives, MP = environment, C = center aka unreliable turncloaks, FP = "liberals", M = right, KD = christians
[19:06:48] <Cloud_Zephyr> The new prime minister agrees with most of my beliefs and likes deadmau5
[19:07:10] <RandomNinja> I say "liberals" because they used to be but are hard to place nowadays
[19:08:03] <Cloud_Zephyr> I say eh a lot as well
[19:08:31] <Pony_2345> true the world of today is nuts
[19:09:00] <Pony_2345> heck over here we got cops shootings here or there or a campus or school shooting
[19:09:03] <RandomNinja> Zuthal also, the environmentalists are against nuclear power, but for buying carbon based power from other countries as needed
[19:09:24] <Zuthal> <.<
[19:09:30] <RandomNinja> yeah.
[19:09:59] <Zuthal> Our government also made plans to shut down all nuclear plants after fukushima and wants to go renewable
[19:10:09] <Pony_2345> look were in 2015 i dont think we need fossil fuels or nuclear energy or find a way to break the cells down with a chemical or somthing so we can dispose of the nuculear waste 
[19:10:19] <Pony_2345> thats good
[19:10:23] <RandomNinja> *cough* next gen nuclear reactors
[19:10:44] <RandomNinja> Pony_2345, that's pretty much what you get with modern nuclear ractors
[19:10:46] <wobniaR> We must science this harder at once
[19:10:55] <Pony_2345> lol i mean i kinda feel the fall out games are actually going to happen you know
[19:11:07] <Zuthal> *cough* molten salt *cough* pebble bed *cough* thorium fuel cycle
[19:11:40] <RandomNinja> isn't thorium still experimental?
[19:11:45] <Pony_2345> also with the droughts are they using the ocean water?
[19:12:32] <RandomNinja> neglectible amounts
[19:13:20] <Zuthal> Pony_2345: water desalination takes a LOT of energy
[19:13:51] <Pony_2345> i mean the ice caps are melting i dont know why they just take enought water filter it many time to kill the germs ahh but they could use that water to send to countrys with drought or help with the wild fires
[19:14:10] <Zuthal> I once did the math, and I think to desalinate enough water to suppy just california would require quite a bit more power than the entire US produces
[19:14:20] <Pony_2345> so there trying to find a beter fuel sorce
[19:14:20] <RandomNinja> it's not about bacteria, that part is easy
[19:14:29] <Zuthal> Pony_2345: The ice caps melting produces salt water, because that water immediately mixes with the ocean

[19:15:09] <Pony_2345> but couldnt we take the salt aswell
[19:15:12] <Zuthal> and taking salt out of water requires either boiling it off (which takes a lot of energy) or reverse osmosis, plants for which are kinda expensive, and also takes not quite as much, but still a lot of energy
[19:15:17] <RandomNinja> no, we don't want that
[19:15:23] <RandomNinja> that's the point of desalination
[19:15:45] <Zuthal> you can take it out, but you cannot simply filter it, because the salt is chemically dissolved in the water
[19:16:28] <Pony_2345> dang you know if could have the countrys of the world come together they could produce the energy to help other countrie but i dont see that happening with russia and iraq i think it was and china doing there own thing

[19:17:57] <RandomNinja> also, you seem to underestimate how effective nuclear power is https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/log_scale.png
[19:18:55] <Pony_2345> well there another way then for to help but i dont think there going to do that
[19:19:05] <RandomNinja> what?
[19:19:21] <Pony_2345> they could use the weather machine but the goverment will probally use it for war purposes
[19:19:35] <Zuthal> California uses ~1.1*10^10 m^3 of water per year.
[19:19:46] <RandomNinja> weather machines are a sci-fi dream
[19:19:52] * wobniaR falls
[19:20:16] <Pony_2345> if i remeber corectly a man came up with a weather device to help with theh worlds problems the us goverment never funded it but when the man die im not sure on this part they funded the project and went to his house and took the blueprints
[19:20:38] <Zuthal> Seawater desalination takes about 5 kWh/m^3, so we have 5.5*10^13 Wh/yr
[19:21:00] <Pony_2345> haarp
[19:21:17] <RandomNinja> sounds to me like they figure "might as well take a look at it" even though they didn't expect it to be feasible
[19:21:24] <Zuthal> Or about 6.3*10^9 W power usage
[19:21:31] * RandomNinja zaps Zuthal

[21:10:51] <wobniaR> Geben sie mir ihre aufmerksamkeit und respekt, sie nerd
[21:11:02] <ryaxnb21> sweetie belle no longer has her special singing voice and is no longer the only CMC able to sing
[21:11:07] <ryaxnb21> retcon@
[21:11:10] <ryaxnb21> retcon!
[21:11:11] <wobniaR> Yes it was a thing
[21:11:25] <ryaxnb21> and they also retconned the implied marks the CMC would get from show stoppers
[21:11:26] <wobniaR> They all could always sing
[21:11:39] <ryaxnb21> scootaloo always sucked at singing
[21:11:43] <wobniaR> Sweetie belle's especially good at singing
[21:11:56] <wobniaR> Their talents weren't retconned either
[21:12:01] <ryaxnb21> also sweetie belle's singing sounds like a black lady in s1, because it is in fact that 
[21:12:02] <Cloud_Zephyr> yush! home alone
[21:12:10] <ryaxnb21> i support the retcon
[21:12:21] <ryaxnb21> but it's definetely one of those "changes" the show makes
[21:12:21] <wobniaR> In season 1, ab's singer was singing for sweetie belle
[21:12:39] <wobniaR> She didn't sing like a "black lady" either
[21:12:45] <ryaxnb21> er, anyway
[21:12:46] <RandomNinja> creber?
[21:12:52] <Cloud_Zephyr> almost acquired girlfriend...in gta
[21:12:54] <ryaxnb21> she sang very different than current sweetie belle
[21:12:54] <Cloud_Zephyr> :P
[21:12:58] <wobniaR> Yes RandomNinja
[21:12:59] <ryaxnb21> and scootaloo sounded different too
[21:13:00] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr pls
[21:13:03] <ryaxnb21> she sounded worse
[21:13:09] <wobniaR> Because they got older ryaxnb21
[21:13:09] <ryaxnb21> very offkey
[21:13:18] <RandomNinja> show singing doesn't carry over to musical singing though
[21:13:26] <RandomNinja> this is true for pretty much all shows
[21:13:27] <wobniaR> You..don't seem to be keeping up with show trivia
[21:13:29] <ryaxnb21> well, in s1, scootaloo's singer was told to sing badly
[21:13:38] <ryaxnb21> and they didn't use autotune
[21:13:46] <RandomNinja> !t autotune
[21:13:47] <DinkyBot> that autotune though
[21:14:07] <ryaxnb21> i'm pretty sure 'Belle and scootaloo use autotune nowadays to keep them in harmony
[21:14:13] <ryaxnb21> Probably not applebloom
[21:14:18] <ryaxnb21> since Creber is a natural singer
[21:14:58] <wobniaR> They all sing quite well, michelle has more practice obviously
[21:15:25] <ryaxnb21> also, whereas "hearts as strong as horses" was a obvious out-of-character musical number, this is one of those things where you can't say the musical numbers didn't happen
[21:15:33] <ryaxnb21> it's like when twilight goes "pinkie stop rapping!"
[21:15:41] <ryaxnb21> indicating that pinkie was clearly rapping
[21:15:42] <RandomNinja> madeleine peters is a singer apparently
[21:15:44] <wobniaR> They have harmonic tracks of recent cmc songs isolated on youtube where you can hear their differences
[21:15:56] <RandomNinja> as in Scootaloos VA
[21:16:00] <ryaxnb21> since post-rapping twilight was aware it was happening and it's the plot
[21:16:03] <wobniaR> She is RandomNinja, probably as strong if not stronger than michelle
[21:16:07] <ryaxnb21> ah ok
[21:16:09] <ryaxnb21> well
[21:16:20] <ryaxnb21> they probably just directed her to sing badly in s1 then
[21:16:26] <ryaxnb21> like twilight's singer in Rainbow Rocks
[21:16:29] <wobniaR> You..said that yourself ryaxnb21
[21:16:33] <ryaxnb21> yeah
[21:16:43] <ryaxnb21> anyway, the point is, its a retcon basically
[21:16:48] <ryaxnb21> in s1 scootaloo couldn't sing
[21:16:50] <ryaxnb21> now she can
[21:16:56] <RandomNinja> musicals don't count
[21:16:59] <wobniaR> It's not a retcon

[21:24:57] <ryaxnb21> after using ps/2 ones for decades
[21:24:58] <JockeTF> Figured IRC was a good place to try it out on.
[21:24:58] <wobniaR> You keep claiming every little detail is a retcon though
[21:25:08] <thereallynewmop12100> Hello, JockeTF !
[21:25:10] <wobniaR> And you're going off on wild tangents every sentence
[21:25:13] <ryaxnb21> okay
[21:25:15] <ryaxnb21> well
[21:25:32] <ryaxnb21> i think scootaloo's singing is a pretty big character trait (or lack thereof) in s1
[21:25:35] <JockeTF> ryaxnb21: Ah, I don't have a PS/2 port... So... :P
[21:25:36] <RandomNinja> JockeTF, did you see the link yesterday?
[21:25:42] * JockeTF does have a serial port though.
[21:25:47] <ryaxnb21> JockeTF: PS/2 ports are great
[21:25:57] <ryaxnb21> historically ps/2 keyboards and mice are cheaper
[21:26:09] <JockeTF> Well, yeah.
[21:26:09] <wobniaR> Yeah she was forced to sing badly for show stoppers to work, but she can sing for every musical season 2 and on
[21:26:17] <JockeTF> The brown switches are pretty nice.
[21:26:18] <ryaxnb21> and you can get used ones at goodwill for like a $1 each
[21:26:28] <JockeTF> Though, I do hope my neighbors don't complain. ;P
[21:26:39] <Snapai> In S1 Sweetie belle couldn't use magic too ;P
[21:26:41] <ryaxnb21> wobniaR: i thought the first musical number containing scootaloo was "Hearts as Strong as Horses"
[21:26:47] <ryaxnb21> in S4.
[21:26:49] <Snapai> She learned. :p
[21:26:56] <ryaxnb21> it's possible she learned, yeah
[21:26:59] <wobniaR> Scoots was in hearts & hooves day
[21:27:21] <ryaxnb21> i for some reason did not notice her contribution
[21:27:23] <wobniaR> They all join in on the stallion song
[21:27:26] <Snapai> She's had five years of spouting random musical numbers with her best friends - and those are just the ones we see. That's plenty of practice XD
[21:27:33] <ryaxnb21> but that changes things, yeah
[21:28:05] <ryaxnb21> perhaps she learned off screen between s1 and s2
[21:28:08] <Snapai> Seems the show isn't quite realtime tho'
[21:28:15] <ryaxnb21> for those "uplifting musical numbers"
[21:28:21] <wobniaR> You have to listen carefully to show songs, vocals are mixed
[21:28:22] <ryaxnb21> that pinkie loves
[21:28:54] <wobniaR> To give you an idea, many of the equestria girls songs have 5 vocalists mixed
[21:29:05] <wobniaR> Or 6, might be 6
[21:29:05] <ryaxnb21> worth noting that's more evidence the musical episodes actually happen in the show
[21:29:14] <Snapai> I wonder, if music theory and dance and general improvisation was taught globally as a life skill to kids, if people would start doing spontaneous musical numbers in real life <.<
[21:29:34] <wobniaR> That would be glorious Snapai
[21:29:45] <ryaxnb21> that pinkie talks about uplifting musical numbers, and gilda says they're banned, and pinkie mentions cheering up towns with them
[21:29:54] <ryaxnb21> pretty much proves they actually happen :P
[21:29:59] <wobniaR> Nothing like a few hundred people breaking out into LET IT GOOO on every street corner
[21:30:33] <Snapai> Actually, I think in places where people live tribally, random music jams actually do happen fairly frequently.
[21:30:52] <ryaxnb21> music is good
[21:31:00] <wobniaR> Social & close community with little else to do
[21:31:10] <Snapai> Singing during work, doing rhythm with daily actions together, etc.
[21:31:12] <ryaxnb21> also not usually more than one person does the lyrics, if that.
[21:31:18] <ryaxnb21> unless it's a very well known hymn
[21:31:27] <ryaxnb21> because synchronizing the rhythym for that is very hard
[21:31:33] <Snapai> o.o
[21:31:46] <ryaxnb21> usually, iirc, the join-in on those random musical numbers is rhythym-based.
[21:32:10] <Zuthal> Actually, I think stuff like at least sea shanties and such are often sung synchronised.
[21:32:16] <ryaxnb21> mmmm
[21:32:17] *** Quits: Braixen (eksdocnrqty@Hoofy.is.cutest.mare) (Connection closed)
[21:32:19] <Zuthal> And the rhythm helps to coordinate the work
[21:32:22] <Snapai> I said a hip, hop, the hippi, the hippi to the hip hip hop, you don't stop bouncin' til the bang bang boogie, said up jump the boogie, and I bounce to the boogie the beat.
[21:32:25] <ryaxnb21> that's probably practiced though
[21:32:39] <ryaxnb21> like synchronized swimming
[21:33:05] <ryaxnb21> which works, with plenty of practice you can get a great routine down
[21:33:05] <wobniaR> I've heard that Snapai it sounds so familiar but i can't remember from where
[21:33:16] <wobniaR> It's killing me
[21:33:17] <ryaxnb21> and you don't really need skill, just do it again and again until you all sync up
[21:33:36] <Snapai> It's a song called Rapper's Delight, by the Sugarhill Gang.

[21:37:12] <Snapai> This is the source of the bassline for Rapper's Delight
[21:37:13] <ryaxnb21> her VA still sounds the youngest of the three, even though she's the same age as Applebloom
[21:37:21] <Snapai> But I'm pretty sure Daft Punk has used it too.
[21:37:39] <wobniaR> I never noticed or cared for the squeaking until i started becoming involved in the fandom
[21:37:44] <ryaxnb21> sweetie's VA has a young-sounding voice
[21:38:04] <wobniaR> A squeak sound shouldn't define her character
[21:38:08] <ryaxnb21> even though, irl, her age is basically identical to appleblooms' slightly more mature voice

[21:41:35] <wobniaR> Old? Teenager is old?
[21:41:56] <ryaxnb21> well, compared to the target audience
[21:42:05] <ryaxnb21> they're imitating like a 12 or 13 year
[21:42:14] <wobniaR> Target audience of  mlp is 5 year old girls
[21:42:19] <ryaxnb21> er, not target audience
[21:42:23] <ryaxnb21> target age of the character
[21:42:26] <ryaxnb21> 10-13
[21:42:39] <wobniaR> Mane 6 & the rest of the cast are played by adults you know
[21:42:41] <ryaxnb21> whereas michelle creber is 16
[21:42:46] <ryaxnb21> yeah, well they're played as adults
[21:42:50] <wobniaR> I'm talking 20-50+
[21:42:53] <ryaxnb21> again, i meant target age of the character.
[21:43:12] <wobniaR> Real life age of the VA does not coincide with the character they play
[21:43:36] <ryaxnb21> for children, though,they tend to have trouble doing elementary voices as they get into late teens
[21:43:50] <ryaxnb21> luckily this problem is worse for boy VAs
[21:43:51] <ryaxnb21> ask the VA of Skippy Squirrel
[21:43:56] <wobniaR> What would be kids in cartoons are voiced over by adults
[21:44:03] <ryaxnb21> who was nearly unable to provide a childish sounding voice
[21:44:27] <ryaxnb21> and yes, he was a kid when he did his VA owrk for s1 of animaniacs
[21:44:27] <CocoPommel> That's what killed the show Chowder
[21:44:27] <ryaxnb21> he was a teen by the last seasons, and audio modifications were used
[21:44:30] <CocoPommel> The kids voice changed
[21:44:52] <ryaxnb21> because he could no longer do the skippy high-pitched squeaky chipmunk kid
[21:45:19] <CocoPommel> Wasn't skippy a minor character though? No pun intended
[21:45:27] <RandomNinja> lies
[21:45:31] <ryaxnb21> he's done interviews and he talks about the difficulties in playing child roles as he got older (his first role was like a three year old)
[21:45:45] <ryaxnb21> CocoPommel: yeah, but fortunately, his problem was overcome with audio manipulation software
[21:45:48] <ryaxnb21> which was mature by the 90s
[21:45:56] <ryaxnb21> they just tuned the voice to sound good enough
[21:46:18] <CocoPommel> Oh yeah, pitch changing
[21:46:21] <ryaxnb21> they didn't need to use it when he was young, but when he got older, they used it and it worked and they kept including the character
[21:49:04] <CocoPommel> That's the risk you take when you cast a child va
[21:49:04] <CocoPommel> Yet the trend seems to continue
[21:49:04] <ryaxnb21> unlike Chowder, Skippy was meant to sound cartoony
[21:49:04] <ryaxnb21> like a little chipmunk or squirrel
[21:49:04] <ryaxnb21> so the artificialness of pitch-shift wasn't a problem
[21:49:04] <wobniaR> I don't think the CMC va's are going to have that issue as much as others
[21:49:04] <ryaxnb21> the kid never used anything that close to his normal speaking voice
[21:49:04] <CocoPommel> Isn't Steven universe an actual kid too? Guess that show will have a limited run
[21:49:04] <ryaxnb21> for girls it's not as much of a problem
[21:49:06] <ryaxnb21> girls can do high-pitched childish voices for a long time
[21:49:14] <CocoPommel> True
[21:49:15] <ryaxnb21> most guys can't unless that's their job
[21:49:29] <ryaxnb21> and you can't tell if they can until they get the adult voice
[21:49:38] <wobniaR> There's always the option of pushing the story forward & aging the characters more to match but that's rare
[21:49:40] <ryaxnb21> so most child VAs won't grow into a mel blanc
[21:49:54] <ryaxnb21> :P
[21:50:28] <CocoPommel> There's always people like Thurop Van Orman, who will always sound like a child
[21:50:41] <ryaxnb21> yeah and people who are adult VAs picked at adulthood for their vocal range
[21:50:44] <ryaxnb21> like mel blanc
[21:50:47] <CocoPommel> That's actually his normal speaking voice lol
[21:50:52] <ryaxnb21> who can do girls, men, young'n's
[21:50:56] <ryaxnb21> or could before he died
[21:51:03] <ryaxnb21> he was a natural talent
[21:51:04] <RandomNinja> also the guy who voices Zuko in Avatar
[21:51:13] <CocoPommel> Mel Blanc did a Disney movie
[21:51:22] <Snapai> Many female VAs also voice male childlike voices for cartoons.
[21:51:34] <CocoPommel> He was honest John's sidekick in Pinocchio, not even joking
[21:53:49] <CocoPommel> Yeah
[21:53:49] <ryaxnb21> bonus points to the single VA who does all the mane 6 in Friendship is Witchcraft
[21:53:49] <CocoPommel> Bart Simpson would be the stock example of that
[21:53:49] <ryaxnb21> she's a girl and makes each one significantly different.
[21:53:49] <ryaxnb21> without going too far into artificial voices

[21:53:49] <ryaxnb21> for a fan VA she has good range.
[21:53:49] <thereallynewmop12100> I got a fun fact
[21:53:49] <Snapai> http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0534134/
[21:53:49] <DinkyBot>  [ Tress MacNeille - IMDb ]
[21:53:49] <Snapai> Is that who voices Bart? >.>
[21:54:03] <Snapai> I believe she was also the voices of Chip and Gadget in Rescue Rangers.
[21:54:46] <thereallynewmop12100> Some MLP FIM Actors was voiced on Dinosaur Train
[21:54:56] <RandomNinja> !t nerd
[21:54:57] <DinkyBot> He's simply a nerd, it means they're accurate
[21:55:22] * thereallynewmop12100 applies 3-D Evil Uniktty to RandomNinja 
[21:55:29] <RandomNinja> :O
[21:58:09] <ryaxnb21> kathleen barr is fairly good at anything she does
[21:58:15] <Snapai> As well as Babs Bunny, and Dot Warner, Zipper....
[21:58:20] <ryaxnb21> before MLP she mostly did filler content for hasbro and canadian tv
[21:58:43] <ryaxnb21> she was often the only VA to put in a solid effort with her hammy villain voice or some other notable voice
[21:59:03] <ryaxnb21> she also was in g3, and did the best VA performance of any VA there.
[21:59:39] <ryaxnb21> that's the main thing about Barr is that she rarely phones it in... of course in MLP she does trixie and chrysalis
[22:00:17] <wobniaR> She plays them well
[22:00:20] <ryaxnb21> yeah
[22:02:00] <ryaxnb21> she's more notable honestly for doing an equally notable performance in efforts like Barbie: this and that and MLP G3 where some of the other VAs were clearly not trying.
[22:02:00] <ryaxnb21> and where the animation and writing was... bad
[22:02:00] <wobniaR> Writing & voice direction goes a long way
[22:02:00] <ryaxnb21> yeah
[22:02:00] <wobniaR> It's not all on the VA's
[22:02:00] <ryaxnb21> well, also morale
[22:02:00] <ryaxnb21> the shows were clearly not going anywhere..

[22:02:22] *** Quits: miss (WebChat@Pony-9vsnq3.access.telenet.be) (Quit: Page closed)
[22:02:23] <wobniaR> They did care, the show & movies were made to sell toys
[22:02:27] <wobniaR> To little girls
[22:02:39] <ryaxnb21> they didn't care enough to give g3 a substantial budget, a decent team, or a decent manager
[22:02:43] <ryaxnb21> it got less money than even g1 did.
[22:03:01] <ryaxnb21> g1 got a fairly decent animation budget, a decent music budget, a average team for a 80s kids show
[22:03:12] <wobniaR> Might've been flagshipping a different product at the time
[22:03:15] <ryaxnb21> and turned out average
[22:03:19] <ryaxnb21> yeah
[22:03:19] <wobniaR> G1 MLP was new
[22:04:50] <ryaxnb21> anyway i guess Barr is one VA who doesn't need voice direction to do her work, and part of that might be that in a lot of those works she does one or two of her most common typecast roles
[22:04:58] <ryaxnb21> (basically a Trixie type character would be one)

[22:05:16] <ryaxnb21> so she just takes that and runs with it, without direction, and it works.
