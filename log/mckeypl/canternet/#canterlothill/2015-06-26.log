[00:10:23] <Flurshy> there, I think I got it

[00:24:35] <Flurshy> but they're at different tempos

[05:01:23] * TokusatsuKuuga-RX is not here please leave a message and he will get to you later :P
[05:01:48] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Eywind: In Griffon the Brush Off, Gilda had a ruff accent to it, but in Griffonstone, her voice is strangely high-pitched and less rough
[05:01:59] <Eywind> Depends on the point in the episode
[05:02:11] <PowerPlay> Different voice actress?
[05:02:29] <Eywind> Meh it's been like what, 2 in-story years and 5 regular years?
[05:02:40] <keekle> i need to rewatch it.. it seemed sort of epic
[05:02:44] <Vigilant_Watch> And Gilda was a lot less... confident overall as a character.
[05:02:44] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> I guess the actress' voice got older, which made her voice change?
