[01:20:48] <Araxnus> Hey all :)
[01:20:50] <SkyHigh> Sombra: we took it as a .44 magnum
[01:20:58] <Sombra> Na
[01:21:06] <Araxnus> Cloud_Zephyr: Yay xD
[01:21:12] <Sombra> You don't want a solid projectile with .44, you want some form of JHP
[01:21:21] <SkyHigh> It's what's used in the classic vampire story
[01:21:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> i should have asked her out at the party. she was drunk as well so meh
[01:21:23] <RandomNinja> yeah exactly
[01:21:32] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> And make sure the silver stake has garlic on it.
[01:21:34] <RandomNinja> also, lead core
[01:21:34] <Sombra> For flat point
[01:21:38] <Sombra> *or
[01:21:43] <SkyHigh> Oh my god.
[01:21:47] <SkyHigh> I'm done.
[01:21:56] <SkyHigh> Never freaking read what I say.
[01:21:56] <Sombra> Oh
[01:22:02] <RandomNinja> silly fillies
[01:22:06] <Sombra> Vampires? Man what was I thinking, the answer is obvious.
[01:22:18] <RandomNinja> garlic buckshot?
[01:22:29] <SkyHigh> Also, Sombra, HP
[01:22:33] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yes garlic buckshot
[01:22:34] <Sombra> Bullets with crosses on them http://www.underwoodammo.com/44-remington-magnum-220-grain-xtreme-penetrator-box-of-20/
[01:22:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> hmm even i nightclub would do. oh wait im not old enoufgh for that
[01:23:02] <RandomNinja> Sombra, high penetration tho
[01:23:15] <Sombra> Doesn't matter, cross=instant death
[01:23:20] <RandomNinja> true
[01:23:39] <RandomNinja> doesn't it have to be dipped in holy water as well?
[01:23:44] <Araxnus> il be like here. So I guess ping me if you need me ;)

[01:24:54] <Sombra> .44 magnum +p+
[01:25:02] * TokusatsuKuuga-RX idea: liquid garlic, silver
[01:25:06] <RandomNinja> pretty much yeah

[01:25:28] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Shell
[01:25:31] <Hamtramck> wargh hot
[01:25:34] <RandomNinja> Sombra: garlic filled hollow point
[01:25:39] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yes

[01:28:25] <SleepingHigh> Regulus: HP.
[01:28:28] <RandomNinja> you want the bullet to stay in the vampire for maximum exposure
[01:28:37] <Regulus> Bah
[01:28:48] <Regulus> Headshot or go home.
[01:29:00] <SleepingHigh> ...
[01:29:02] <RandomNinja> but it's a vampire
[01:29:09] <Cloud_Zephyr> tune onto the radio
[01:29:11] <SleepingHigh> We're not using a sniper on a human.

[01:33:29] <Sombra> There is nothing "regular" about a flamethrower.

[01:33:36] <RandomNinja> this is true

[01:34:50] <Regulus> May as well just load up a railgun with a silver slug engraved with a cross 
[01:34:51] <Sombra> Ya know, you might want to stick with 10mm with the vampires vs .44 magnum.
[01:35:05] <Sombra> I mean, are you going to be able to get quick follow up shots with 1500ft/lbs of energy?
[01:35:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> wait! it was almost an hour ago since i first tweeted
[01:35:44] * thereallynewmop12100_ is wet 
[01:35:52] <Cloud_Zephyr> O.o
[01:35:52] <Sombra> I think not.  Stick with a 650-700ft/lb round penetrator in 10mm.  
[01:36:06] <RandomNinja> auto shotgun
[01:36:22] <Sombra> Of course then the problem is finding a decent gun to shoot it out of.  I guess you're pretty much stuck with either a glock 20 or a delta elite.  Maybe a rock island but I can't attenst to their reliablity.

[01:39:25] <RandomNinja> the obvious choice ^
[01:39:31] <Sombra> Then you're gonna have to spend ten minutes getting the fuel to oil ratio right, revving it up, starting the choke.
[01:39:51] <RandomNinja> yeah that's what prep time is for
[01:39:51] <Sombra> Unless you use an electric chainsaw and that's gonna do a great job at tickling them.

[05:17:31] <MikeM> This is the statement that had to be made.
[05:17:38] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> This is true, Hennet303!
[05:17:42] <ForestRain> Wasn't your parody made for the Fillycast?

[05:17:56] <Mike_Coltfield> Misha: Because my cloud is awesome and has many hidden features, like the massive D&B Audiotechnik J-series concert speakers hanging down from it, the Yamaha CL5 mixer to keep them sounding good, and a other things.
[05:18:00] <ForestRain> The Fillycast is about awful.

[05:21:40] <MikeM> I can't sufficiently describe my happiness at hearing this song.
[05:21:46] <ForestRain> Bus stop, wet day, she's there, I say~
[05:21:59] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Please share my umbrella
[05:22:05] <ForestRain> Parchment_Scroll[CH]: Yes.
[05:22:09] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Dangit, Forest I CANNOT leave a song lyric unfinished!
[05:22:14] <Mike_Coltfield> Parchment_Scroll[CH]: He said that Yoda is a parody of Lola, and used both names so the youngins in the crowd would recognize the song.
[05:22:17] <Misha> There's something about Luna I wonder...

[05:23:12] <Misha> Did she take on her role as the protector of dreams (or whatever her title is) because she hated the reactions during Nightmare Night?
[05:23:22] <Angel_Bunny> was her role from before probably
[05:23:22] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Shortly before or after one of my favorite old songs, Little Old Lady from Pasadena
[05:23:26] <kingqueso> It's crazy how many brony musicians I know now.
[05:23:34] <Angel_Bunny> Hi kingqueso
[05:23:36] <Snowblitz> ForestRain, Parchy is older than all of us. Of course he knows the song. :P
[05:23:37] <Misha> kingqueso, it happens quickly and usually unexpectedly
[05:23:40] <Angel_Bunny> Yep
[05:23:48] <ForestRain> He's not older than Larscis.
[05:23:49] <ForestRain> ;p
[05:23:52] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Snowblitz, thank you for not saying "put together". :P
[05:24:03] <ForestRain> lol
[05:24:03] <Misha> He's not older than Luna. :>
[05:24:05] <kingqueso> I literally just found out about these guys when paleo releases the top 10 of April
[05:24:12] <Mike_Coltfield> I'm actually not older than Luna.
[05:24:14] <Snowblitz> Why, are you even older than Larsic? :P
[05:24:17] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> ForestRain, remind me to tell you about the Old Dragons' Home gag.
[05:24:21] <One-Trick> i had a badge that said musician. i dunno how i got that cuz all i do is dj

[05:25:11] <Snowblitz> Ha!
[05:25:16] <ForestRain> Oh, she's doing this justice
[05:25:18] <kingqueso> Eh, not really. Also, I don't have money or a car to get there. Still live with my parents :/
[05:25:26] <Misha> oh man
[05:25:27] <Mike_Coltfield> Also, One-Trick, the dry recordings I did from that mixer showed off your awesome crossfade. Sorry I didn't do that live!
[05:25:29] <Misha> goosebumbs
[05:25:34] <Misha> forest I have goosebumps
[05:25:36] <ForestRain> And I thought the mixer was about to totally ruin her vocals there for a second.
[05:25:38] <MikeM> ....This concert keeps getting more better
[05:25:42] <One-Trick> Mike_Coltfield: haha awesome
[05:25:48] <Snowblitz> Not bad

[05:25:59] <kingqueso> I guess the closest would be in Minnesota, unless there's one in MI that I'm not aware of.
[05:25:59] <Misha> xD
[05:26:00] <ForestRain> The one thing EFNW does really well is take care of their musicians.
[05:26:05] <StandingLeaf> ^
[05:26:10] <Mike_Coltfield> Well, you were arguably the most professional DJ up there
[05:26:11] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> :( I think this would be better with less delay
[05:26:34] <Mike_Coltfield> (Anything Larscis says is not the view or policy held by the convention...or if it is, they aren't going to be official about it)
[05:26:34] <One-Trick> Mike_Coltfield: yay! its only cuz Sleepy didnt hah
[05:26:34] <Misha> oh man
[05:26:36] <Misha> oh god
[05:26:37] <kingqueso> Does she have her own channel?
[05:26:41] <Snowblitz> ForestRain: yes and no
[05:26:49] <StandingLeaf> Yes, more hardcore.
[05:26:55] <Misha> if I ever wanted to marry a voice, this is it
[05:26:58] <Mike_Coltfield> Holy Luna, this version of the song.
[05:27:15] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Oh wow, this is getting more awesome.
[05:27:20] * Mike_Coltfield hides behind ForestRain from it, is afraid he'd make a hash of it on the mixer.
[05:27:28] <EFNW_Stream> Yeah sorry about audio... Issues with Dante has us currently running on FOH mix and not broadcast mix, though broadcast is still tracking in PT
[05:27:33] <Snowblitz> That fursuiter. :P
[05:27:51] <Misha> well, he can't headbang
[05:27:54] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Dude, mad props to anyone who 'suits in a concert, especially right up front like that.
[05:27:56] <Misha> that would end horribly
[05:28:11] <Mike_Coltfield> EFNW_Stream: No worries! still sounds good to me.
[05:28:15] <MikeM> No, it sounds good, EFNW_Stream. Maybe a little one-channeled, but good.
[05:28:17] <ForestRain> That explains a lack of lead guit. The amp's probably overpowering your whole system.
[05:28:21] <Snowblitz> Agreed, it must be so hot in there.  That's commitment.
[05:28:21] <One-Trick> i know after i do that i wanna burn my suit

[05:30:32] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Oh, around your neck?
[05:30:34] <ForestRain> Mmm that snare rattle~
[05:30:36] <Misha> yeah
[05:30:37] <Mike_Coltfield> I wear many things. And if I'm working with Vig, a Dashcam tends to happen.

[05:31:42] <Parchment_Scroll[CH]> Yeah, a couple times, but that projection!
[05:31:42] <StandingLeaf> kingqueso It did for a while, not it's okay.
[05:31:44] <Misha> just a hair. she heard it though

[05:33:12] <StandingLeaf> XD
[05:33:16] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> We're awful people.  I even have a recording of you saying how awful we are.
[05:33:17] <Snowblitz> That sax is sexy to me ears. :P
[05:33:18] <MikeM> Ohhh
[05:33:27] <Misha> is anyone else sliding across their rooms right now?
[05:33:48] <ForestRain> Intentionally?
[05:33:51] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> "Come see terrible people interview other terrible people.  We're terrible people; we'll murder your family" -ForestRain 2014
[05:33:51] <Misha> no
[05:33:52] <MikeM> It's pretty slidy, Misha 
[05:33:55] <Misha> it's just so smooth
[05:33:57] <kingqueso> The problem with covering this song is that Britt Mckillip's voice is just so perfect in the original it's hard to match.
[05:34:05] <StandingLeaf> It's so smooth I can't take it!
[05:34:10] <kingqueso> ^
[05:34:28] <ForestRain> Parchment_Scroll[EoH]: True, I believe I may have said that.
[05:34:49] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> I have video evidence Forest. :P You also called my wife out on Parchy abuse. :P
[05:35:05] <ForestRain> And now "The Smile Song" done entirely with xylophone and sax.
[05:35:09] <Hennet303> hmm Parchment_Scroll[EoH] you know thinking about it they could probably use a polarizing filter on their cameras
[05:35:09] <StandingLeaf> Balloons! balloons everywhere!
[05:35:22] <ForestRain> For the back lighting?
[05:35:24] <Misha> The stream is not ready.
[05:35:30] <ForestRain> ^
[05:35:35] <kingqueso> So it is laggy rn?
[05:35:39] * ForestRain nods.
[05:35:40] <Misha> yar
[05:35:41] <kingqueso> Alright
[05:35:45] <kingqueso> Good and bad

[05:35:52] <StandingLeaf> Oh oh lag lag
[05:35:52] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Yeah, Hennet303, it would help a LOT.
[05:35:53] <Mike_Coltfield> My goldfish blames their CDN.
[05:35:58] <Angel_Bunny> "I LOVE" >pans to sax guy
[05:36:00] <kingqueso> More like a lot of lag
[05:36:01] <Hennet303> yeah would cut back on the backlighting flares we are swarmed with when it is zoomed in
[05:36:19] <thereallynewmop12100_> What's happening? 
[05:36:21] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> EFNW_Stream, have you tried turning the band off and restarting them?
[05:36:23] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> :P
[05:36:27] <Angel_Bunny> XD
[05:36:32] <Misha> it's not the band
[05:36:37] <Misha> have you tried rebooting the convention?
[05:36:38] <EFNW_Stream> I'd blame the hotel, supposedly got QOS priority, but still causing a bit of packet loss
[05:36:47] <kingqueso> Frozen way more often than not. Beginning to sound like a glitchy vocals song, or whatever they're called.
[05:36:57] <thereallynewmop12100_> EFNW_Stream: Is EFNW playing and link? 
[05:37:07] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> kingqueso, depends on the genre.  glitch____ where the _____ can be filled with whatever genre.
[05:37:11] <Snowblitz> Mike_Coltfield, tell your goldfish to quit messing with time again! :P
[05:37:22] <Mike_Coltfield> So, here's what we'll do. We'll grab my starship and park it over EFNW. It's right next to an airport, they shouldn't mind UFO, right?

[05:39:54] * Misha swats Forest

[05:40:21] <Snowblitz> He's*
[05:40:22] <kingqueso> I played trumpet in high school, and the fast stuff like that was always a nightmare.
[05:40:33] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Racist Barn was an old joke the first time I heard it. :(
[05:40:41] <Angel_Bunny> hundreds of years old
[05:40:46] <Mike_Coltfield> ForestRain, Snowblitz, Parchment_Scroll[EoH]: Raise this Mast?
[05:40:50] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> XD
[05:40:57] <Snowblitz> I played clarinet and our instruments are the same.
[05:41:00] <ForestRain> Together we can fix Deci's ...flank
[05:41:07] <ForestRain> Chat is so complicated.
[05:41:16] <Snowblitz> Mike_Coltfield: I admit I sucked in that song. :P
[05:41:18] <Misha> yeah
[05:41:24] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> So earlier, I linked my wife to Kung Fury and she didn't watch it.  Then one of her listeners linked it to her and she watched it and sent me THE EXACT SAME LINK.  XD
[05:41:34] <Misha> From now on we'll reference the proper name of the ship.
[05:41:39] <ForestRain> Bwahaha, good job Parchy
[05:41:41] <Misha> The Deci'sAss
[05:41:47] <Hennet303> Did I just see a photographer down in the pit with a flash sitting on his camera? Please someone walk up there and smack him upside his head and tell him to remove that crap. there are plenty of lights he don't need that thing
[05:41:48] <ForestRain> Deci Sass.
[05:41:48] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Deceasus!

[05:42:21] <ForestRain> Mast.
[05:42:26] <Misha> No.
[05:42:29] <Misha> That's her new name.
[05:42:33] <Misha> The FillyCast has proven this.
[05:42:34] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Technically, it's online RIGHT NOW, tho.
[05:42:37] <Misha> Deci Sass.
[05:42:38] <MikeM> New Donn DeVore!
[05:42:42] <Snowblitz> ForestRain: That song was not for me to sing. :P
[05:42:45] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Because y'know, live EFNW stream
[05:42:52] <StandingLeaf> Fluttershy!<
[05:43:00] <Misha> oh man
[05:43:02] <Misha> oh no
[05:43:12] <SteelChords> The whole thing was too freaking epic guys lol
[05:43:18] <MikeM> This is a thing that was a thing.
[05:43:43] <kingqueso> Not sure if those are the right notes. It sounds a bit odd.
[05:43:57] <Snowblitz> You want my honest opinion? :P
[05:44:00] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> I think she's tired.
[05:44:02] <MikeM> They're the right notes...it just sounds a bit off.
[05:44:11] <Misha> Parchy, partially.
[05:44:16] <kingqueso> there's a disconnect somewhere
[05:44:22] <Misha> Haley Williams is a tough vocalist to emulate
[05:44:22] <DinkyBot> !play

[05:44:23] <DinkyBot> Ooooh! Now I'm hungry, momma!
[05:44:40] <Misha> I should know... I try.
[05:44:50] <Snowblitz> She sounds very tired. The notes are there, but she's losing air with every note.
[05:44:57] * Araxnus boops ForestRain

[05:45:18] <Angel_Bunny> hopefully
[05:45:18] <thereallynewmop12100_> Hey, Snowblitz 
[05:45:19] <Misha> Yeah.  Like I said, Haley is hard to emulate.  When you pull it off the effect is great.
[05:45:24] <Snowblitz> Yo?
[05:45:27] <Misha> And she's got it
[05:45:28] <MikeM> Sooo...7 more months to Fluttershy?

[05:46:19] <Misha> yes
[05:46:20] <Snowblitz> Heh, if I was made of snow, then I'd be worried. :P
[05:46:34] <MikeM> The drummer always knows the score.
[05:46:41] <StandingLeaf> Hey hey everybody!
[05:46:49] <Mike_Coltfield> Poni.
[05:46:52] <kingqueso> Not Rainbow Rocks though?
[05:47:06] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> No, but EQG and RR are connected so we'll let it slide.
[05:47:12] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> We needn't nitpick EVERYTHING.
[05:47:13] <kingqueso> Fair enough
[05:47:15] <ForestRain> Good job on slowly bringing up the pace on that, guys.
[05:47:21] <StandingLeaf> ^
[05:47:21] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Yeah, very smooth.
[05:47:23] <kingqueso> Nitpicking is what I do best though
[05:47:26] <Mike_Coltfield> Parchment_Scroll[EoH]: We made a fandom career out of nitpicking, though...
[05:47:32] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Mike_Coltfield, this is true
[05:47:33] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> hmmm
[05:47:45] <Misha> okay wow
[05:47:50] * ForestRain always sings the Applejack line there.
[05:47:50] <Snowblitz> The drummer is my favorite in a band. It helps me know where I am in the song.
[05:47:55] <kingqueso> She seems out of breath
[05:47:57] <Misha> for a moment the pixelation made Donn's guitar look like a Guitar Hero guitar
[05:48:09] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> You're onto him!
[05:48:10] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah... she's really losing steam
[05:48:16] <StandingLeaf> kingqueso TRue
[05:48:20] <MikeM> As a bass player, the drummer is my best friend.
[05:48:20] *** Quits: techniponi_ (mediocrehor@Pony-qv36rs.sub-70-196-68.myvzw.com) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:48:21] <Misha> oh yeah
[05:48:24] <Misha> she can't oxygen
[05:48:40] <kingqueso> Much needed backup
[05:48:41] <ForestRain> It gets tough.
[05:48:43] *** Angel_Bunny is now known as Eywind
[05:48:49] <Eywind> I bet
[05:48:57] <Misha> She's learned the power of the crowd
[05:48:58] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> If I were her, I'd've take advantage of that backup to catch my breath, but she kept on pluggin'.
[05:48:59] <Misha> Use it
[05:49:01] <StandingLeaf> I think we lost her.
[05:49:03] <ForestRain> Singing in that range, breathing the smoke, jumping around, and doing one song after another, takes it's toll.
[05:49:07] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Gotta give her props for that.
[05:49:08] <StandingLeaf> ^
[05:49:30] <ForestRain> Someone get the girl some water.
[05:49:30] <Snowblitz> ForestRain, and a price.
[05:49:30] <Mike_Coltfield> She gets hugs.
[05:49:31] <MikeM> Yaaay!
[05:49:35] *** Mobi|Zero|EFNW is now known as Away|Zero|EFNW
[05:49:42] <kingqueso> Yeah, fair enough. I've never sung other than in the crowd in church or alone in my room.
[05:49:46] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> ForestRain, yes.  She desperately needs some.  And a breather of at least a minute. :(
[05:49:49] <StandingLeaf> In a convention, water is magic.
[05:49:50] <Misha> oh reary...
[05:49:55] <MikeM> Rainbow's Overrated?!
[05:49:58] <Snowblitz> She really needs to drink something. 
[05:49:59] <Misha> Yeah
[05:50:02] <Misha> That's exactly it
[05:50:32] <MikeM> Cats Millionaire would be great in this song.
[05:50:34] <ForestRain> At least this song is lower in her range-- gives her a chance to breathe a bit.
[05:50:39] <Misha> yeah
[05:50:41] <Eywind> Yeah
[05:50:45] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> True, and you can hear her recovering.
[05:51:17] <kingqueso> Is it just me, or do her lower notes sound a bit like AwkwardMarina?
[05:51:20] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Listen to that, she's getting her (third?  fourth?) wind back!
[05:51:24] <ForestRain> Helping Twilight Win the Crown is an exausting song to sing by itself, too.
[05:51:32] <StandingLeaf> I don't remember hearin that song before.
[05:51:38] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> No kidding!  It's an ensemble song!
[05:51:42] <ForestRain> ^
[05:52:00] <thereallynewmop12100_> EFNW_Stream: Is the rtsp stream for EFNW is working on WMP?
[05:52:18] <Snowblitz> Helping Twilight Win the Crown is easier when singing with people.
[05:52:34] * DerpyBot sits down with DinkyBot to go through her homework with her
[05:52:34] <DinkyBot> Momma, Im learnin' about linux today!
[05:52:40] <kingqueso> Any song is easier when singing with people because there's more room for error
[05:52:43] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> That's, um, what an ensemble is, Snowy B. :P
[05:52:50] <StandingLeaf> They need that break!
[05:52:52] <Teal> !t Snowy B
[05:52:53] <DinkyBot> B.a.s. Rockhimnusz = Rockanthem
[05:52:58] <Teal> ^
[05:53:03] <Snowblitz> I'm just the echo Parchy. :P
[05:53:05] <kingqueso> At least, I'd assume that's how it'd work
[05:53:07] <Misha> Standing ovation from the cloud.
[05:53:15] <Misha> But it's a cloud so you probably can't hear it
[05:53:15] *** Hennet303 is now known as Snap_Shot
[05:53:25] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> kingqueso, on the one hand, yeah, but that's not the reason.  The reason is breath control.
[05:53:35] <Snowblitz> Dinky knows me too well. It's scary. :P
[05:53:36] <Misha> also: dat double entendre
[05:54:00] <Snap_Shot> Only things i have to say so far is polarizing filter and removing the flash attached to that photographers camera. 
[05:54:11] <ForestRain> !t Snowblitz
[05:54:12] <DinkyBot> gotta keep it pristine for Snowblitz to burn down a hot topic in arizona so she said to try and throw it at myself, only because my girlfriend is the best client

[05:56:52] <Snowblitz> I cry from another dimension.

[05:57:07] <Misha> my crying transcends time and space
[05:57:38] <Parchment_Scroll[EoH]> Seriously, though.  Very little makes me cry even a tiny bit.

[05:59:05] <ForestRain> Sad to say your mic was inaudible for about half the set, Blu, but what we did hear sounded great. <3
[05:59:14] <Luna_Jax> hey SteelChords
[05:59:19] <Mike_Coltfield> Luna_Jax: Yes, Blu had to drag me, kicking and screaming, to a Wendy's.

[06:01:23] <Snowblitz> Yup, it's midnight here.
[06:01:24] <ForestRain> That's when all the electronic stuff starts, it looks like.
[06:01:35] <kingqueso> I'll probably watch for another half hour or maybe an hour.
[06:01:38] <ForestRain> And we all know EoH & Electronic don't play well. ;p
[06:01:46] <kingqueso> Wait, where's the schedule?
[06:01:48] <Mike_Coltfield> ForestRain: They're making me stay up for Garnika's set...
[06:01:51] <Misha> Forest, I have to work 6pm-6am tomorrow into Sunday so I'm trying to stay up as late as possible.  I think I may have hit my limit though.
[06:01:52] <ForestRain> Schedule: https://everfreenw.com/events/ponystock/

[07:19:52] <Eywind> It looks umm
[07:20:06] <PinkieShy> Eywind I saw reviews that stuff came broke from them a few times and they refused to replace it.. my dad ordered me a tablet, him a computer with screen, and 2 3ds and they didn't come broke
[07:20:16] <Eywind> Okay?
[07:20:19] <PinkieShy> Do you think the chances of a tv coming broke is likely?
[07:20:27] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Well guess I should get to looking for the soon to be old £1 coins before 2017.
[07:20:28] <Eywind> You're always going to see the reviews are only for issues
[07:20:39] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Eywind
[07:20:40] <DinkyBot> wow Eywind, so edgy
[07:20:40] <Eywind> Are you getting a better deal on there than you are just going to a store?
