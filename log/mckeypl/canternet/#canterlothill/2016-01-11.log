[17:20:07] <RandomNinja> there is fighting but it's intentionally clunky

[17:20:33] <RandomNinja> guns slow you down a lot though
[17:20:48] <RandomNinja> and in a game about parkour and speed you don't want that
[17:21:07] <wobniaR> A 9mm pistol isn't going to weigh you down much
[17:21:18] <wobniaR> Realistically
[17:21:32] <RandomNinja> it doesn't, but on the other hand you only have one mag and it doesn't do a ton of damage
