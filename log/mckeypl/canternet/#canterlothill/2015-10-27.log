[02:06:14] <MikeM> Nice vocal chopping
[02:06:38] <StrawberryDitz> So. I was wondering, did anyone else feel like human world Twilight's voice was a bit more nasal when she sang that Equestria's?

[02:07:34] <wobniaR> I think it's just you StrawberryDitz, I didn't notice a big difference
[02:07:36] <Eywind> I can't say I really noticed a difference, but I haven't rewatched like I should
[02:07:47] <wobniaR> Go watch it
[02:07:52] <wobniaR> I gave you a free 1080p
[02:08:00] * wobniaR slaps Eywind with a big red brick
[02:08:03] <StrawberryDitz> I'll tweak with ym MPC settings later, some of the songs sound better only at max volume and that shouldn't be a thing.
[02:08:23] <wobniaR> Everyone's ears are different
[02:08:28] <Eywind> yea it's sitting on my desktop
[02:08:54] <StrawberryDitz> Mine are going back to getting worse. I need to try for insurance again to see an ear doc to get them checked out again, might need new tubes. Or maybe for once I can get reconstructive surgery.
[02:09:15] <wobniaR> Reconstructive surgery on your ears? Did you damage them?
[02:09:27] <StrawberryDitz> My ears never developed fully. They don't drain like they should.
[02:09:38] <wobniaR> Ah ouch
[02:09:43] <StrawberryDitz> Instead, it builds up behind my eardrum and slowly it gets where I'm hearing everything ten feet underwater.
[02:10:14] <wobniaR> That would definitely affect your hearing
[02:10:17] <StrawberryDitz> But there was a girl on the Voice that talked about the same problem and how they did reconstructive surgery, so i think i got ripped off for 15 years of my life.
[02:10:45] <wobniaR> Sounds expensive
[02:11:12] <StrawberryDitz> Tubes via surgery like clockwork every year until they changed to ones that last 4, and then it was every 3-6 years. Depending on how they varied.

[02:28:35] <Hamtramck> Same for Katzinger's in German Village. Used to love both places, idk.

[02:30:01] <Hamtramck> That could be part of it!

[02:30:42] <MikeM> I'd make an exception for Mexican food.
[02:31:07] <Hamtramck> Also it could be seasonality of ingredients, idk.

[02:36:20] <StrawberryDitz> But I want to see eventually if they make ones with thinner frames. Wearing headphones with these is like "Please sempai torture me."
[02:36:38] <Hamtramck> Yeah that's part of the reason I can't do over-ear
[02:36:57] <StrawberryDitz> The whole ear thing makes me wary of using buds.
[02:36:59] <Hamtramck> and by that I mean the entire reason
[02:37:12] <Hamtramck> Weary of using buds..? Why?
[02:37:34] <StrawberryDitz> My ear is weird shaped inside!
[02:37:47] <Hamtramck> oh get foam tips then
[02:38:31] <Hamtramck> they're like memory foam
[02:38:34] <Hamtramck> remembering the shape of your ear

[02:42:26] <WildSoft> <--
[02:42:48] <StrawberryDitz> Wanna be my friend?
[02:42:50] * StrawberryDitz puppy-eyes.
[02:43:22] <WildSoft> Sure :> But I've been neglecting the heck out of it lately
[02:44:29] * StrawberryDitz just needs hearts. She got the Amazon Underground version and they removed the login features so none of her iPhone stuff on it. 0821 friendship code
[02:44:41] <WildSoft> [Tue-00:19:15] DinkyBot> WildSoft, where I had it a moment ago said "I saw you shipping Araxnus trees with Rarity, I wondered why they had James May test it.
[02:44:43] <WildSoft> Still trying to figure out this sentence :P Also, stop logging my interests DinkyBot xD
[02:45:23] * StrawberryDitz giggles.
[02:45:28] <WildSoft> I'm running the (Android) Play Store version
[02:45:41] <StrawberryDitz> Amazon is Android. Dunno if the social system cares or not.
[02:45:56] <StrawberryDitz> All Amazon does is I don't get told to buy this constantly, and can't buy gems because they slowly give me lots for free.
[02:46:26] <Eywind> I gotta bed
[02:46:32] <MikeM> See you later
[02:46:35] * StrawberryDitz is glad she found her purchased thing, because they removed it from their store.
[02:46:38] <StrawberryDitz> Sleep tight, Eywindsie.
[02:46:40] <WildSoft> If it weren't for me already grinding this thing for like the last 3 years? I would also go with that version from Amazon :P
