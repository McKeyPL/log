[01:48:03] <Eywind> bruh play some badmitton
[01:48:13] <Sombra> I've seen... everything.
[01:48:14] <wobniaR> Fair enough
[01:48:20] <wobniaR> I didn't know it was called that
[01:48:32] <Sombra> But here's the thing man.  The furry fandom (at large) isn't based off of any TV series, or childrens cartoon.
[01:48:41] <MikeM> It's only in your heart
[01:48:44] <Sombra> There's no "Furry" executives or professional voice actors.
[01:48:45] <Eywind> my heart
[01:48:46] <Eywind> of
[01:48:47] <wobniaR> Pretty much every disney animator is a furry
[01:48:57] <wobniaR> It's a conspiracy
[01:48:59] <Sombra> But most furry art isn't based off of disney characters.
[01:49:00] <Eywind> agreed
[01:49:07] <Eywind> Sombra you're barking up the wrong tree man
[01:49:19] <Sombra> And you woke the wrong dog
[01:49:32] <Sombra> But if you kill me you'll get a cool SMG called "The lead wind blows"
[01:49:33] <Eywind> I don't even know what point you're trying to make honestly

[01:50:06] <Sombra> I drift in and out of things.
[01:50:27] <Regulus> Clearly 
[01:51:01] <Sombra> I have about a quarter sized mass missing from my brain.
[01:51:06] <Regulus> Also, I think I've heard that some disney animators sneak their friends fursonas in as background characters
[01:51:14] <Sombra> A US quarter, not 1/4
[01:52:03] <wobniaR> Well we got pony OC's in the show
[01:52:11] <wobniaR> I wouldn't be surprised at that
[01:52:37] <Sombra> Is that one pony in a wheelchair from "rainbow falls" an oc?
[01:52:47] <Sombra> I mean, he's obviously an OC, but I mean a fan character OC.
[01:52:56] <wobniaR> tfw skype crashes
[01:53:09] <Eywind> That was more of a 'charity-added character'
[01:53:17] <Sombra> Whats the difference?
[01:53:35] <wobniaR> Terminally ill dude's OC
[01:53:51] <Sombra> So, it's a fan characters OC.
[01:53:55] <wobniaR> Yep
[01:54:09] <Sombra> Which other one's were OC's?
[01:54:48] <Sombra> I swear to glob if you say King Sombra...
[01:55:01] <wobniaR> Wild Fire 
[01:55:06] <wobniaR> Probably the most famous one
[01:55:08] <Eywind> Yep
[01:55:17] <Sombra> Oh yeah I remember that one.
[01:55:21] <Eywind> also the comics have a lot
[01:55:25] <Eywind> sometimes getting the artists in trouble lol
[01:55:31] <Sombra> The comics aren't in the show.
[01:55:34] <wobniaR> The comics are under less scrutiny
[01:55:35] <Eywind> but I can't say that one in here lol

[01:56:56] <wobniaR> There are others if you put a little research into it, they seem almost coincidental
[01:57:22] <wobniaR> Like random background OC's that show up for a few seconds, but you can see a very similar OC design on someone's deviantart
[01:57:31] <wobniaR> There's not many 
[01:57:59] <wobniaR> I think there was another in wonderbolts academy that was also designed after an OC
[02:00:03] <RandomNinja> !t OC
[02:00:04] <DinkyBot> my OC doesn't have a nose
[02:00:11] <Regulus> I know my OC won't show up in the show
[02:00:51] <Sombra> Is she EG cadance?
[02:00:55] <SaultSteMarie> Black Snackintosh or whateve
[02:00:56] <Sombra> Man I hate that... 
[02:00:57] <RandomNinja> interesting design choice there DinkyBot 
[02:02:38] <MikeM> Dinky's OC is a skeleton pony.
[02:02:51] <wobniaR> Or a ghost
[02:02:59] <MikeM> Or did too much coke.
[02:03:18] <Sombra> Too spoopy
[02:03:54] <Regulus> Her OC is Sans' younger sister, clearly 
[02:04:35] <RandomNinja> don't do coke, kids
[02:04:40] <RandomNinja> do pepsi instead
[02:05:18] <Sombra> no
[02:05:26] <Sombra> Pepsi has EDTA in it.
[02:05:29] <Sombra> Which causes prostate cancer.
