[04:07:37] <MikeM> There's that Russian one, too.
[04:07:46] <Regulus> Zootopia, Kung Fu Panda 3, Secret Life of Pets
[04:08:11] <thereallynewmop12100> Tree-Hugger: I will send it to you as aExclusive mashup premiere
[04:08:13] <Regulus> #YearoftheFurry2016
[04:08:19] <thereallynewmop12100> (Forget to add space) 
[04:08:26] <Eywind> yeah there's kung fu panda 3 ads inside my work building
[04:08:29] <Eywind> which is weird
[04:09:01] <wobniaR> I see Deadpool ads everywhere
[04:09:07] <wobniaR> Especially on buses
[04:09:08] <Eywind> inside your place of work?
[04:09:14] <wobniaR> That would be cool
[04:09:17] <Eywind> yeah that would
[04:09:22] <Regulus> I've just started seeing the TV ads for it
[04:09:30] <Regulus> I'm hoping it's good
[04:09:45] <Eywind> Well it releases in February
[04:09:58] <Eywind> and they started the ad campaign less than 3 weeks before it was released
[04:10:00] <Eywind> I think that means it's good
[04:10:28] <Eywind> I'd be concerned if it was released in May and they just started having ads for it
[04:10:45] <wobniaR> Don't watch Deadpool kids, it's for adults
[04:11:02] <Regulus> It's also not a romcom
[04:12:57] <HamtRamKc> I think HP used to do something with dreamworks
[04:13:03] <HamtRamKc> like I remember getting corporate propaganda about it

[07:04:58] <Snapai> The first one really irritates me, coz workforces keep getting smarter.
[07:05:27] <Snapai> So if they could do it 50 years ago, people REALLY could do it nowadays. I don't get where this obsession people seem to have with considering themselves dumb comes from.

[22:15:53] <Sombra> I disagree, I think you have to have talent otherwise practice and time are fruitless.
[22:16:19] <Toothpaste> You all know FritzyBeat? Yeah you do. I had to be silent for hours while he was recording the same song in the next room.
[22:16:29] <wobniaR> I disagree with your opinion
[22:16:44] <Unixkitty> It's hardly just the "talent" required, without an ear for music you simply aren't going to be able to follow notes properly
