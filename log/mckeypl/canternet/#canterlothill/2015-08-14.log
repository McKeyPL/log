[04:05:06] <RandomNinja> yeah I should
[04:05:42] <EM-C> Nope.  Now it's stopping again.
[04:05:51] <EM-C> Guys...how do I get flash back?
[04:06:03] <MikeM> What browser?
[04:06:08] <wobniaR> Flash player would probably take up more memory than the HTML5 player
[04:06:14] <EM-C> Firefox.
[04:06:21] <EM-C> All I know is that this isn't working.
[04:06:41] <EM-C> I've always used flash till now.  The one time I tried html5 I didn't like it.
[04:06:57] <wobniaR> Literally same functionality
[04:07:14] <EM-C> Look...I can't watch videos any more!  I just want my videos back!  Okay???
[04:07:26] <EM-C> I can't watch Claire's video about bronies!
[04:07:44] <EM-C> I could barely make it through this month's top ten list!

[04:08:43] <EM-C> ::Sigh::  Okay then.
[04:08:45] <MikeM> Ok, ok. Click on the options button, then click add-ons. Click plugins, and then look at the Shockwave Flash entry (Not sentry-heh).
[04:09:34] <EM-C> Hold on.
[04:09:48] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Or HTML5 is good...
[04:09:50] <EM-C> Okay?
[04:10:03] <MikeM> What does it say for flash?
[04:10:05] <EM-C> No it's not.  It's stuttering something awful.
[04:10:39] <EM-C> It says it's activated.  BUT...YouTube isn't using it.  It's using html5.
[04:11:19] <EM-C> It's set on "Always activate."
[04:11:33] <EM-C> But YT is using html5.
[04:11:49] <EM-C> I right click on a video and it tells me it's using the html5 player.

[04:11:58] <EM-C> Flash may not even be an otpion on YT any more.
[04:12:26] <MikeM> It is.
[04:12:40] <EM-C> Then how do I get it back?
[04:13:02] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C:  I don't know 
[04:13:35] <EM-C> Dang.  YT can't leave well enough alone.  Now it looks like I'm not gonna be able to play videos any more.  And I was watching whole movies just the other day.
[04:13:39] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t em-c
[04:13:40] <DinkyBot> em-c is not here. :P Weird...
[04:14:49] <MikeM> Are you sure it's not connection speed or something with your computer?

[04:15:10] <thereallynewmop12100> www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5MGrSOa_EE 
[04:15:35] <EM-C> Look...it was playing the other day.  They've changed it.  It doesn't look like it used to.  Everything's been reformatted or something.
[04:16:00] <EM-C> Why won't it lower quality to enable the video to play?  Even on "auto" it won't dip below 360.
[04:16:19] <MikeM> That's correct.
[04:16:37] <EM-C> That's why I want flash back!
[04:17:19] <EM-C> Really, I'm not trying to break the law or create cold fusion here.  Is it really that complicated?
[04:17:41] <EM-C> The page doesn't even have a flash option any more.
[04:18:13] <EM-C> Come on, people!  I don't want to lose YT!  What is the Internet without videos?
[04:18:49] <MikeM> I don't know what to tell you. I just turned flash on, and yt plays flash.
[04:19:02] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Turn Flash On!
[04:19:18] <EM-C> How do I do that?  According to my add-ons, it's on already!
[04:19:46] <EM-C> It's on "Always activate."  How do I turn it more "on" than that?
[04:20:13] <EM-C> Stupid YouTube.  I didn't like watching low quality videos, but it was better than being shut out of them altogether!
[04:20:24] <EM-C> They just couldn't leave well enough alone!
[04:20:39] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: I got a firefox add-on for that..
[04:21:03] <EM-C> Mop...I HAVE the add-on.  It is set on "Always activate."  But YT is using html5.
[04:21:20] <EM-C> Do you understand?  Why is every computer problem always such a major deal to solve?
[04:21:22] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: What add-on is that?
[04:21:29] <EM-C> Shockwave flash!
[04:22:17] <EM-C> It's set on "Always activate."  Doesn't that mean it's ON???

[04:23:19] <EM-C> You mean regular flash doesn't work now?  I have to have a special flash only for YT?  I don't get it, but I'll try it.
