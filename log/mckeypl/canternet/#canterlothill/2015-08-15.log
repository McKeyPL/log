[13:21:21] <Trildar> DOF in third person games can always get weird.

[13:22:05] <Trildar> True.
[13:22:31] <Trildar> Basically the game assumes no focus on distant objects.
[13:22:36] <RandomNinja> it's pretty dumb in general imo

[23:26:02] * RandomNinja applies radiation to wobniaR 
[23:26:13] <wobniaR> Radaway bruh
[23:26:14] <Zuthal> wobniaR: Fun fact, that explosion had about the same yield as the smallest nuclear bomb ever detonated
[23:26:24] <Zuthal> (the Davy-Crockett, 20 tons of TNT)
[23:26:45] <RandomNinja> isn't that the portable launcher one?
[23:26:52] <Zuthal> yup
[23:27:07] <Zuthal> also I think the one where the lethal radiation range is bigger than the weapon's effective range
[23:27:22] <RandomNinja> probably
[23:27:42] <RandomNinja> isn't it basically a city block buster
[23:27:58] <Hamtramck> random yeah i guess the tannins would make you barf hard
[23:28:05] <Hamtramck> like if you've ever had really concentrated iced tea?
[23:28:19] <RandomNinja> don't drink ice tea, so no :P
[23:28:22] <Zuthal> I think so, yeah
[23:28:43] <Zuthal> will destroy pretty much most buildings in a 120 m radius
