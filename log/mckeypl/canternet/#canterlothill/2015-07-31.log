[01:33:29] <wobniaR> That sounds really short for earthbound
[01:33:34] <Eywind> yeah, if you have a second file
[01:33:52] <Eywind> and you die in that file on stairs (cuz of status)
[01:34:02] <Eywind> when you load your other file you can clip through walls
[01:34:21] <Eywind> so then you do that and use the map to reset where you're at and you can travel to random places
[01:34:22] <wobniaR> Yeah that would shorten it a lot
[01:34:25] <Eywind> You can also manipulate the RNG
[01:34:28] <Eywind> like they beat the statue at lv9
[01:34:48] <Eywind> cuz you manipulate that it never hits you

[21:48:31] <EM-C> My mother and I visited my sister yesterday and watched a couple of really bad Italian 70s sci-fi (post-Star Wars).
[21:49:21] <EM-C> Before we left she gave me a present: a bottle of MLP-FiM shampoo and conditioner.
[21:49:27] <RandomNinja> sweet

[21:49:59] <DinkyBot> yes please, momma!
[21:49:59] * DerpyBot gives DinkyBot a muffin and gently pats her head
[21:50:07] <EM-C> I'll probably never use it, but it's the thought that counts.  It's on my bathroom sink so I can see it.
[21:50:15] <RandomNinja> now you too can smell like a pretty pretty pony
[21:50:35] <EM-C> I suppose.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid to try and get in the shower (I might fall).
[21:50:41] <EM-C> I have really bad mobility.
[21:51:00] <RandomNinja> get a shower chair
[21:51:18] <EM-C> My mother has one.  I could borrow it, but I'm afraid I might be too heavy for it.
[21:51:59] <EM-C> Apparently there was a lot of really bad sci-fi released after Star Wars first came out.
[21:52:06] <RandomNinja> well, technically any water proof stool should work, right?
[21:52:12] <EM-C> Hmm.
[21:52:35] <EM-C> Just don't want any legs digging into the tub floor.

[21:52:56] <EM-C> I have a shower mat.
[21:53:06] <EM-C> But it's hard to lift my legs to climb into the tub.
[21:53:17] <EM-C> And I'm afraid to try and stand in there.
[21:53:49] <EM-C> Who's psyched for bespectacled, nerd Twilight?
[21:54:01] <RandomNinja> ?
[21:54:11] <EM-C> You know, from the upcoming movie?
[21:54:21] <RandomNinja> oh, haven't watched trailers
