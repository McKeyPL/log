[03:46:35] <wobniaR> But yeah fallout beer
[03:47:03] <MikeM> Not Mountain Dew flavored?
[03:47:39] <wobniaR> Bethesda has partnered with beverage company Carlsberg to create a Fallout 4-inspired beer. Called Fallout Beer, it's a light-colored pilsner lager that claims to offer a "refreshing zesty hoppy taste and a floral aroma." It was brewed using a blend of malted barleys and "selected hops,"
[03:48:13] <wobniaR> It's 4% ABV
[03:48:44] <MikeM> Good for all-night gaming.
[03:53:52] <Snap_Shot> meh only 4%
[03:54:11] <RandomNinja> also supposedly £30/12
[03:54:15] <Snap_Shot> if im hardcore gaming and drinking like that i would prefer something closer to 7-8
[03:54:24] <RandomNinja> needs more Tunnel Snake Stout
[03:54:44] <MikeM> Noo...gotta keep it low to stay in the Ballmer Peak.
[03:54:55] <RandomNinja> there are 4% stouts though
[03:55:33] <MikeM> For lunch purposes, of course
[03:56:27] <RandomNinja>  "refreshing zesty hoppy taste and a floral aroma.",  blend of malted barleys and "selected hops,"
