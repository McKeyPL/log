[01:37:28] <Midli> Yeah
[01:37:29] <Midli> I caught that
[01:37:39] <Midli> It's cause im rebroadcasting it from my own computer
[01:37:47] <Renard> seems a bit hollow too for some reason
[01:37:57] <Midli> That's cause it's not from the direct source
[01:38:05] <Pony_8083> sounds good
[01:38:19] <Midli> I'm basically rebroadcasting the PVFM webplayer
[01:38:23] <Renard> weird, I wouldn't expect that to cause reverb or whatever
[01:38:26] <Midli> cause I have two laptops.
[01:38:47] <Renard> well, that not reverb, just a weird eq setting of sorts

[01:40:18] <Renard> less
[01:40:26] <Renard> I blame the cheap beer for my typos
[01:40:47] <Renard> muffled could be that I'm using the lq stream
[01:41:19] <Pony_8083> lol it koolit the first time tuning in how was brony con
[01:41:23] <Renard> eh, someone's playing with the audio setup

[01:41:39] <Pony_8083> how was it
[01:41:45] <Midli> was resetting the line gain and using the master gain instead

[09:29:34] * Ali snickers
[09:29:59] * Ali is either blind or stupid or both, but doesn't remember Eywind having admin powers
[09:30:14] <Eywind> was a somewhat recent change
[09:30:51] * Ali flops on Eywind then
[09:31:03] <Eywind> You and Dark both lol
[09:31:16] <Eywind> but oh my god those fetchlands
[09:31:20] <Eywind> also there's new dual lands
[09:31:32] <Ali> New ones?
[09:31:39] <Eywind> yea, come into play tapped unless you control 2 or more basic lands
[09:31:41] <Ali> Or are you refering to the full art ones
[09:31:46] <Ali> Those...aren't new
[09:31:51] <Eywind> ?
[09:31:55] <Eywind> http://media-dominaria.cursecdn.com/avatars/78/629/635764870632346310.png
[09:32:19] <Ali> OOoook, those ARE new
[09:32:31] <Eywind> http://media-dominaria.cursecdn.com/avatars/78/617/635764815735391550.png also the mutton chops are real
[09:32:34] <Ali> Swore there were lands like that before.
[09:32:43] <Eywind> There were quicklands that came into play untapped if you controlled three or less lands
[09:32:51] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Eywind
[09:32:52] <DinkyBot> Anyways I think Eywind is about to enroll.
[09:32:53] <Eywind> and also ones that came into play untapped if you had a land of the type they made
[09:33:07] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Dinky speaks the truth :o
[09:33:09] <Eywind> but these are actual basic land types, but not as good as shocklands or original duals
[09:33:27] <Ali> So fetches are gonna have some power
[09:33:33] * Ali needs to stock up on them then
[09:33:34] <Eywind> Yep
[09:33:37] *** Quits: Jon-The_Bronynerd (JonTheBrony@Element.Of.Gaming) (Quit: Leaving)
[09:33:40] <Eywind> I mean fetches are already going up
[09:33:47] <Ali> And my foil fetches are even more money!
[09:33:49] <Eywind> well since recently
[09:33:54] <Eywind> yep
[09:34:06] <Ali> I got a copy of each of the new 5 reprints
[09:34:13] <Eywind> Yea that's what you told me hah
[09:34:21] <Eywind> I've seen at least one of each; they look pretty great
[09:34:34] <Ali> I have a full set, and if those lands are ture
[09:34:37] <Ali> true*
[09:34:41] * Ali ca chings
[09:34:45] <Eywind> Well yea I mean
[09:35:05] <Eywind> the existence of dual lands that will come into play tapped doesn't mean a WHOLE lot to fetch values, since fetches will continue to go up anyways
[09:35:27] <Ali> Eywind, the main thing is that dual color decks will be easier to run
[09:35:33] <Ali> That and Zendikar Roil abuse
[09:35:40] <Eywind> dual color decks were pretty easy to run to begin with
[09:35:46] <Eywind> and Zendikar's Roil is garbage lol
[09:35:51] <Ali> Yes but you can now search them out
[09:36:03] <Ali> Eywind, Roil is only decent if you have fetches
[09:36:08] <Eywind> Roil isn't even good then
[09:36:12] <Ali> They're shitty 2/2s though
[09:36:15] <Eywind> exactly
[09:36:23] <Eywind> it's not like Omnath
[09:36:39] <Eywind> http://media-dominaria.cursecdn.com/avatars/78/587/635763812056003927.jpeg
[09:37:11] <Ali> Yeah, there's your fetch abuse
[09:37:17] <Ali> BUT
[09:37:29] <Ali> I know its terrible, but combo that with Roil
[09:37:32] <Eywind> lol no
[09:37:38] <Eywind> Well yes, it's terrible
[09:37:44] <Ali> What?  You get two 5/5 guys with Omnath
[09:37:51] <Ali> 2 from Roil
[09:38:01] <Ali> And I do believe Roil's creatures are elemental as well
[09:38:07] <Eywind> if I wanted to combo with Omnath, I'd use Amulet of Vigor (permanents enter play untapped) and Perilous Forays (1, sac a creature: get a basic land from deck into play tapped)
[09:38:16] *** Joins: reiuiji (reiuiji@Pony-pgksa9.ma.comcast.net)
[09:38:26] <Ali> They're reprinting Vigor?
[09:38:27] <Eywind> 1: deal 3 damage to target creature for player for each basic land in your deck
[09:38:34] <Eywind> Lol no, just more EDH stuff he
[09:39:08] * Ali boops Eywind on the nose
[09:39:10] <Eywind> My LGS doesn't do Standard
[09:39:22] <Ali> Cause they don't want to give up their moneycards?
[09:39:34] <Eywind> no, because they've tried like 4 different days and no one is interested
[09:39:40] <Ali> Ah
[09:39:41] <Eywind> and Columbus has like 8 card stores
[09:39:55] <Ali> I picked up a Foil Jace from Origins
[09:39:59] <Eywind> I mean, we have 15-25 per draft
[09:40:05] <Eywind> Yeah you told me that too; I've seen one, looks awesome
[09:40:11] <Eywind> foil DFCs are always pretty sweet
[09:40:17] <Ali> DFC?
[09:40:21] <Eywind> double faced cards
[09:40:25] * Ali derps
[09:40:30] <Eywind> nah it's cool, just jargon
[09:40:42] <Eywind> I had some foil reckless waifs in my cube for a bit and they were great
[09:40:48] <Eywind> then I cut her for Goblin Glory Chaser heh
[09:40:56] <Ali> I picked him up cause I heard he's being used in all formats for some odd reason
[09:41:07] <Ali> And he's only $50 for foil
[09:41:10] <Eywind> odd reason?  he's a merfolk looter that flips into a snapcaster mage that has to be attacked
[09:41:43] <Ali> And his -2 attack to a creature really makes it hard to get in for some damage
[09:41:46] <Eywind> More relevant in Standard (in actual decks) or modern (in combo decks), but the Legacy Jaceblade deck looked pretty cool
[09:41:51] <Eywind> That's correct, he protects himself a bit too
[09:42:08] <Ali> Once I heard he was played in all formats I scooped him up
[09:42:22] <Ali> He's no Mind Scupltor, but I'm not passing up on a future money card
[09:42:25] <Eywind> Yeah, he'll see some minor/moderate play in Modern
[09:42:49] <Eywind> can't see the legacy decks sticking around too much, but might see some play every so often
[09:43:04] <Ali> Never know
[09:43:16] <Eywind> he's a bit slow for Legacy
[09:43:22] <Ali> But even if he doesn't turn out to be overly pricy, I have my 2nd foil of a Jace
[09:43:29] <Eywind> hah yeah
[09:43:37] <Ali> I have the first Jace foiled
[09:43:48] <Eywind> 3 mana Beleren? Nice
[09:43:53] <Ali> Eeyup
[09:43:55] <Eywind> that one's been gradually increasing in price
[09:43:59] <Ali> I called him baby Jace
[09:44:03] <Eywind> yep baby jace
[09:44:10] <Eywind> this one is even younter now
[09:44:12] <Ali> Cause back then, a Baby Jace beat a big Jace everytime
[09:44:21] <Eywind> well people played baby jace to kill big jace
[09:44:23] <Ali> Due to the old legendary rule
[09:44:53] <Ali> I still loved Beleren
[09:45:44] <Ali> About the only decent Mythic Rare I've pulled from a pack foiled
[09:46:05] <Eywind> yea I haven't gotten a foil mythic before
[09:46:24] <Ali> I've pulled 3 or 4, maybe 5
[09:46:31] <Ali> Lux cannon I think I have foiled
[09:46:36] <Eywind> wow congratulations
[09:46:39] <Ali> Prime Time is foiled
[09:46:42] <Ali> Why?
[09:46:43] <Eywind> :P
[09:46:58] <Eywind> It's like getting a foil comet storm from MM2
[09:46:58] <Ali> Most of the time I do get the crap mythic's foiled
[09:47:05] <Ali> Ah I see
[09:47:15] <Ali> I got Prime Time foiled in MM2
[09:47:39] <Eywind> Yeah I saw some of those going for $16 on eBay, was pretty surprised.
[09:47:51] <Ali> Yeah its not the best, but far from the worst
[09:47:59] <Ali> OH I remember one awesome looking foil
[09:48:08] <Ali> Foil Time Warp from one of the M sets
[09:48:11] <Eywind> oh yeah
[09:48:22] <Eywind> time warp from m10
[09:48:28] <Eywind> could imagine that being a great foil
[09:48:40] <Ali> Yeah, got one foiled, looks awesome even if its a crap rare.
[09:49:00] <Eywind> crap rare?
[09:49:16] <Ali> Its probably worthless in price
[09:49:21] <Ali> Even though it looks cool
[09:49:21] <Eywind> foil time warp is $40
[09:49:25] <Ali> WELL NOW
[09:49:31] <Eywind> it says "take an extra turn"
[09:49:35] <Eywind> EDH is a format lol
[09:49:54] <Eywind> EDH: making junk rares $15 since 2009
[09:50:00] <Ali> Heh
[09:50:21] <Ali> I remember I couldn't ever find my first Commander foiled out.
[09:50:33] <Eywind> which was what?
[09:50:45] <Ali> Ugh, I can't spell her name for nothing
[09:50:53] <Ali> UWB Artifacts
[09:50:55] <Eywind> Merieke Ri Berit
[09:51:01] <Eywind> Oh
[09:51:03] <Eywind> Sydri?
[09:51:09] <Eywind> or Sharuum
[09:51:09] <Ali> blah blah blah, the Hedgemon
[09:51:26] <Eywind> Sharuum the Hegemon yea, Sharuum was hard to find foil for a bit
[09:51:39] <Ali> Well I got eventually the FTV Legends
[09:51:43] <Eywind> now it's yeah
[09:52:09] <Ali> I mean you get a foil Kozalek....or was it Ulamog?
[09:52:25] <Eywind> ulamog
[09:52:27] <Eywind> which just got reprinted
[09:52:30] <Eywind> in like a 5x better form
[09:52:47] <Ali> Costs less to play and fudges up more?
[09:52:48] <Eywind> http://media-dominaria.cursecdn.com/avatars/78/615/635764785137481695.png
[09:53:16] <Ali> Thats....downright unfair
[09:53:21] <Eywind> yeah it's sooo good
[09:53:33] <Eywind> don't get the anti-mill, but that's about i
[09:53:52] <Ali> I mean that's supermill
[09:53:59] <Eywind> it*, you get an extra permanent exile, and the annihilator 4 isn't usually relevant vs mill you for half your deck
[09:54:18] <Ali> Annihilaor was a horrible mechanic
[09:54:32] <Eywind> yeah I mean it was alright
[09:54:36] <Eywind> it was cool on It That Betrays
[09:54:59] <Ali> Worse in EDH if someone was playing one of those steal a creature from an oppenent's deck
[09:55:07] <Eywind> bribery yeah
[09:55:08] <Ali> OH LOOK I HAVE YOUR ELDRAZI
[09:55:35] <Eywind> wow, it that betrays is still selling for like $8
[09:55:41] <Eywind> it just got reprinted in the duel deck
[09:55:46] <Ali> Ouch
[09:55:48] *** Quits: matttheshadowman (mattthesha@the.shadowy.corners) (Quit: I will return to the shadows)
[09:56:07] <Eywind> the new duel deck is cool
[09:56:18] <Ali> Eldrazi vs what?
[09:56:39] <Eywind> Zendikar
[09:56:57] <Ali> So one is elemental themed vs Eldrazi themed
[09:57:15] <Ali> Though do drones return?
[09:57:31] <Eywind> Avenger of Zendikar, Primal Command, Stirring Wildwood vs It that Betrays, new stuff
[09:57:35] <Eywind> zendikar is more allies now
[09:57:40] <Eywind> drones, like eldrazi drones? yeah
[09:57:48] <Ali> Ramping to 10 now is gonna be tough in standard
[09:57:57] <Eywind> There have "Devoid", which means that even if they have colored mana they're colorless
[09:58:07] <Eywind> so there's colorless support cards
[09:58:14] <Ali> Interesting
[09:58:19] <Eywind> and instead of annihilator there's ingest, which is when it hits an opponent exile their top card
[09:58:30] <Eywind> (to go along with cards that work on cards in opponent's exile)
[09:58:41] <Eywind> cool carry-over vs the delve decks
[09:58:47] <Ali> So this set is gonna have some exile retriving abilities?
[09:59:06] <Eywind> there's a 5/8 mythic for 6, when you cast it, exile their top 4 cards, then put any lands in opponent's exile into play under your control
[09:59:19] <Ali> Heh
[09:59:30] <Ali> Didn't they say they were trying to slow down standard a bit?
[09:59:40] <Eywind> lol well speed vs power level
[09:59:50] <Eywind> standard is reasonably fast
[09:59:58] <Eywind> but not super high power level of cards

[10:00:22] <Ali> I like Gobo Glory Chaser, but I bet in standard he's crap
[10:00:32] <Eywind> yeah the mono red eck
[10:00:54] <Ali> I'll miss Stormbreath Dragon
[10:00:54] <Eywind> really good  in cube though
[10:01:03] <Eywind> yea stormbreath was good
[10:01:27] <Ali> When I was able to play standard, I was owning the area FNM with a Red Deck Wins
[10:01:36] <Eywind> yea you were telling me about it
[10:02:05] <Eywind> the bigger version of red would probably have a pretty bad abzan matchup
[10:02:17] <Ali> I will still swear that Generator Servant is the most underrated card in that deck
[10:02:31] <Eywind> yea turn 3 dragon
[10:02:49] <Ali> Eeyup, nobody is prepared for that
[10:02:57] <Eywind> well until abzan just plays ultimate price lol
[10:03:04] <Eywind> I need to go to bed :/
[10:03:06] <Ali> Which does?
[10:03:13] <Eywind> any black/x midrange deck
[10:03:28] <Ali> I mean what does Ultimate Price do?

[23:02:33] <Fantasma> My computer is busted
[23:02:51] <Fantasma> Massive popups and ads on chrome, IE, and steam browsers, can't even play BF4 anymore.
[23:03:20] <thereallynewmop12100> Fantasma: Use Adblock Plus
[23:03:48] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> godfuckindammit
[23:03:53] <Eywind> dat language lol
[23:04:38] <Eywind> Is it your broadcasting software that's causing the issue?
[23:04:43] <Eywind> I don't know anything about it or I'd try to help :/
[23:04:51] <Fantasma> I'm using adblock plus
[23:04:53] <Fantasma> To no affect
[23:05:14] <LocDogX86X> Yay  its working
[23:05:19] <MikeM> Something's happening
[23:05:19] <Eywind> Fantasma did you clear out the malware through like Malwarebytes or something?
[23:05:19] <Fantasma> It's clearly something inside of the system itself and not just one browser, otherwise it wouldn't be affecting across browsers.
[23:05:23] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> dunno, I think my drivers are causing the trouble for some eason

[23:41:59] <wobniaR> Excellent
[23:44:05] <Hamtramck> I like SoaD. They're the only nu-metalish band I like at all fwiw.
[23:44:41] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> the earlier Korn were decent too
[23:45:13] <Hamtramck> Toxicity had these Middle Eastern/Armenian folk/glam influences that really made it stand out to me though.
[23:45:48] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> yea SOAD are pretty cool. wonder if the will ever make another record
