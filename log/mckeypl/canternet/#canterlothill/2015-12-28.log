[11:05:00] <RandomNinja> Nerd
[11:05:08] <RandomNinja> Also bleh
[11:05:18] <RandomNinja> I think I'm skipping Christmas next year
[11:07:20] <Unixkitty> Is everything okay?
[11:08:45] <RandomNinja> Yeah I just forgot my stepmother is infuriating to be around for more than a day
[11:09:58] <RandomNinja> So, Christmas time, lots of things to be done, so I'm asked(read: expected) to help out. Sound reasonable, right?
[11:10:29] <Unixkitty> I guess

[11:14:57] <RandomNinja> But nope, obviously I was lazy and need to be confronted about it
[11:15:46] <RandomNinja> No but more with me by virtue of my sisters being younger
[11:16:48] <Unixkitty> My aunt does something like that as well, anyone who is not her direct child gets the "special treatment"

[11:19:50] <Unixkitty> Why not?
[11:21:10] <RandomNinja> Turns out the mentality of being high level municipal management carries over to everyday life
[11:21:50] <RandomNinja> She goes on passive aggressive rants at insubordination

[11:33:29] *** Quits: star_moon (Starry@the.little.cloud.colt) (Connection closed)
[11:41:38] <Sketchy_Sounds> This is one of the reasons I like the fact that my family is rather widely dispersed. It means the likelihood of feeling obligated to spend time with them all over Christmas is negated.
[11:42:49] <Sketchy_Sounds> Also one of the reasons I'm glad that currently I don't have a driver's licence or my own vehicle. Means they can't tell me I don't have a reason to just drive up/down to see them.
[11:44:03] <RandomNinja> It also means I can't go on a lonely drive to get away for an hour though
[11:44:23] <Sketchy_Sounds> There nowhere you could just go for a walk?
[11:44:40] <RandomNinja> Yeah but it's not really the same
[11:44:51] <RandomNinja> Also it's cold as balls
[11:44:59] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well yes, there is that downside.
[11:45:33] <RandomNinja> I'll just turn to drinking when I get back home, that works right?
[11:45:58] * Unixkitty boops RandomNinja 
[11:46:08] * RandomNinja ish booped
[11:50:28] <RandomNinja> Also Sketchy_Sounds my family lives 200 miles away, meaning close enough to visit but far enough to require the better part of a day and being uncomfortable
[11:51:08] <RandomNinja> It's the sweet spot of annoyance
[11:51:23] <Sketchy_Sounds> I think that's where the closest member of my family lives.
[11:51:50] <Sketchy_Sounds> Thereabouts, anyway. Somewhere around 150 to 200 miles away, either to the north or to the south. The rest are further.
[11:52:25] <RandomNinja> I need to move to a different county, then I can be left alone
[11:52:57] <Sketchy_Sounds> The furthest flung member of my family normally lives around 1100 miles away.
[11:53:19] <Sketchy_Sounds> That being my mum, who is usually in WV.

[11:56:38] <Sketchy_Sounds> Also we have one up on England, cos they have to pay for their prescriptions.
[11:56:40] <Sketchy_Sounds> We don't :D

[11:59:05] <Sketchy_Sounds> I have a 150Mbps connection currently.
[11:59:27] <Sketchy_Sounds> That's not the fastest you can get.
[12:00:14] <RandomNinja> Yay
[12:00:55] <Sketchy_Sounds> And honestly considering you're from Sweden, I daresay you'd find our climate quite mild.
[12:01:09] <RandomNinja> More rain I'm guessing
[12:01:25] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yes. Britain's kinda famous for the rain.
[12:01:32] <RandomNinja> But probably generally similar
[12:01:49] <Chase_Palomino> The Rain in Spain falls Mainly on Bri-Tain.
[12:02:09] * RandomNinja boops Chase_Palomino 
[12:02:25] * Chase_Palomino steals RandomNinja.
[12:02:29] <RandomNinja> Halp
[12:02:36] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well this is the thing, technically Britain should be much colder than it is - but it's not, because we get a lot of warm air blown over the country from the various wind currents coming in off the Atlantic.
[12:02:50] <RandomNinja> Yay, the gulf
[12:02:54] <Chase_Palomino> Gulf Stream! Yay!
[12:03:36] <Sketchy_Sounds> Yeah. A few years back, that wind current died down for some reason, and Britain got buried under a metre or so of snow.
[12:03:48] <Sketchy_Sounds> Like, literally the whole country was buried.
[12:04:09] <Sketchy_Sounds> Satellite imagery showed the whole country blanketed in white.
[12:04:19] <RandomNinja> Seriously though, considering Sweden's current situation it's probably easier finding housing in a different country
[12:05:22] <RandomNinja> We were short on houses even before the immigration crisis
[12:05:35] <Chase_Palomino> We're not doing so great either.

[23:10:17] <MikeM> haha...penalties for bad climbing
[23:12:59] <RandomNinja> I need a bigger place
[23:13:09] <RandomNinja> so I can craft stuff
[23:13:29] <Unixkitty> What kind of stuff would you want to craft?
[23:13:30] <MikeM> That would be handy. More room for the everything.
[23:13:46] <RandomNinja> various dabbling
[23:13:54] <RandomNinja> basic furniture, for one

[23:31:21] <Unixkitty> You seem to be quite talented, RandomNinja 
[23:31:26] <RandomNinja> ?
[23:31:43] <Unixkitty> Or interested in crafting/making things
[23:31:52] <Unixkitty> I wish I knew how to make anything
[23:32:03] <RandomNinja> I didn't know how to sew 6 months ago
[23:32:22] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja I approve
[23:32:29] <Unixkitty> Why did you decide to learn?
[23:32:34] <MikeM> There's a youtube or forum for practically everything.
[23:32:37] <RandomNinja> buy a few meters of cloth and a €25 starter kit 
[23:32:50] <Unixkitty> I'm not asking how :P
[23:32:51] * Regulus flops down
[23:32:54] <RandomNinja> needed to fix clothes for blot
[23:33:08] <Unixkitty> I see
[23:33:26] <RandomNinja> but it's pretty satisfying
[23:33:52] <RandomNinja> also, with furniture, you can customize a lot that would otherwise pay a ton for
[23:34:24] <Unixkitty> I'm sure it is, I'm just saying that I like the fact that you decided to do it on your own
[23:35:38] <RandomNinja> well I pretty much had to

[23:47:16] <TipsyBOT> The name is escaping me for some reason.
[23:47:18] <MikeM> I know the one you're talking about, but it doesn't interest me.
[23:47:25] <MikeM> The Purge, or something like that.
[23:47:35] <TipsyBOT> Do you think something like that could happen?

[23:56:57] <TipsyBOT> Definitely.
[23:57:29] <TipsyBOT> What I like about Trek over Star Wars is just about anyone can join Star Fleet..Star Wars you gotta be chosen to be a Jedi or Sith.
[23:58:04] <TipsyBOT> You may not make Captain or Science Officer but a red shirt is better then no shirt.
[23:58:05] <MikeM> All the TIE pilots are Sith?

[23:58:30] <TipsyBOT> There's also death but if you're careful and not an idiot you'd survive.
