[19:55:48] <Sombra> Sorry RandomNinja, this website requires me to turn off adblock, so... no.
[19:56:13] <Unixkitty> Pretty much the same thing, except a few select people in the group are secretly mafia members
[19:56:18] <Unixkitty> And are out to kill the others
[19:58:57] <RandomNinja> the role of president is passed around the table, each turn the president chooses a chancelor, and then the players vote on the current government
[19:59:27] <RandomNinja> if it passes the president draws 3 policies, discards 1, and give 2 to the chancelor, who then picks one
[20:00:09] <RandomNinja> the liberals win if they get 5 liberal policies, or if they assasinate Hitler, the fascists win by 6 policies or by getting Hitler voted chancelor after at least 3 fascist policies have passed
[20:00:37] <RandomNinja> so not entirely similar but some concepts apply, from what I can tell
