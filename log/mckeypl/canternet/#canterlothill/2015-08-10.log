[00:14:17] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Exumer "Fire & Damnation" (OFFICIAL)
[00:15:11] <Hamtramck> It kind of reminds me of the new Future album, but whereas that one took a lot of the cliches associated with that style of hiphop and messed with them and came up with this dark and apocalyptic... something, the Drake album just feels kind of phoned in.
[00:15:26] <Hamtramck> But I haven't listened to it much, so my opinion might change. I remember it got good reviews so
[00:16:15] <RandomNinja> I mean, I didn't like most of my favourite albums right away

[18:55:09] <JockeTF> Very frustrating, but I didn't have a choice.
[18:55:29] <JockeTF> Especially since I've been working on speeding things up a lot.
[18:55:41] <Eywind> gotta go fast
[18:55:46] <JockeTF> Still ten times faster compared to how it was when I started.

[18:57:57] <JockeTF> thereallynewmop12100: Don't really care much about the performance there, but it should be pretty fast since it doesn't actually compute anything. :P

[23:06:37] <RandomNinja> !t SCIENCE
[23:06:39] <DinkyBot> Marbi-Z: BTW, best way to get your name right each time I saw Shaico, it appeals to a different universe powered by innovation and SCIENCE! Six young ponies got superpoweres from bionic enhancements. They are Princesses :3
[23:07:02] <MikeM> Bionic princesses?
[23:07:20] <MikeM> The 8 million bit princess.
[23:07:29] <RandomNinja> this sounds like a show I want to watch
[23:07:57] <MikeM> "We can make her better, faster, stronger."
[23:08:38] <RandomNinja> lul pricing
[23:09:09] <RandomNinja> wait no it was different pricin
[23:09:22] <RandomNinja> differnent products, not pricing*
[23:09:27] <RandomNinja> !t brain
[23:09:28] <DinkyBot> my brain can't be bothered.
[23:09:49] <MikeM> All synapses are busy. Try back later.
[23:09:56] <RandomNinja> something like that
[23:10:51] <RandomNinja> I saw 375ml bottle for 97kr and 750ml for 107kr, which would be really silly
[23:11:09] <RandomNinja> cuz obviously you'd go for the large one
[23:11:17] <MikeM> Sounds like a bargain.
[23:11:45] <RandomNinja> yes but turns out to be different beers
[23:11:57] <RandomNinja> one geuze and one fruit lambic
[23:12:43] * RandomNinja biers MikeM 
[23:13:02] <MikeM> I'm not dead yet
[23:14:19] <RandomNinja> yay
[23:14:42] <MikeM> agreed
[23:15:14] <RandomNinja> !t schmetterling
[23:15:15] <DinkyBot> achtung schmetterling!
[23:15:20] <RandomNinja> jawohl!
[23:15:28] * RandomNinja schmetterlings Zuthal 
[23:15:33] <Zuthal> nuh
[23:16:47] * Zuthal applies a Panzerschreck to RandomNinja
[23:16:48] <MikeM> They'll help make your castle a home.
[23:16:56] <Zuthal> It schrecks Panzers
[23:20:37] * DerpyBot hugs her muffin and straightens her mane
[23:20:37] * DinkyBot fusses and frowns, but hugs her momma and shakes her mane out when she finishes. "Mooommmaaa! Staaaahp! Hhehe!"
[23:21:14] <RandomNinja> !t Zuthal 
[23:21:15] <DinkyBot> Frozen's reaction: Come on now Zuthal.
[23:21:29] <RandomNinja> yeah
[23:25:21] <RandomNinja> also MikeM good news, I may be able to make lagers using my picnic cooler as a fermentation chamber
[23:25:58] <MikeM> That makes sense. Just have to change the water for ice every day or so, right?
[23:26:27] <RandomNinja> I'm thinking large water buffer and circulating ice bags, but yeah
[23:26:32] <MikeM> I can see how brewing smaller batches makes things easier.
[23:26:42] <RandomNinja> it's mostly a size issue 
[23:27:03] <RandomNinja> not sure if I can quite fit it with a blowoff tube
[23:27:38] <MikeM> You plan on starting the lager during primary fermentation?
[23:28:09] <RandomNinja> it needs ~10C primary anyway
[23:28:18] <RandomNinja> I can lager in the fridge
[23:29:02] *** Quits: Pi (Pi@Pony-0hm.5cm.208.112.IP) (Quit: Lend us 10p for a cuppa tea?)
[23:29:24] <MikeM> Ohh, I see now. Seems like sanitization might be the big challenge.
[23:30:11] <RandomNinja> not really, business as usual besides tricky temperatures

[23:33:33] <RandomNinja> it's just brew - ferment at 10 C - lager at 5 C - bottle
[23:33:57] <MikeM> The waiting is the hardest part.
[23:34:22] <RandomNinja> good thing I have other beer
