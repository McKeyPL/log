[18:54:24] <RandomNinja> oh yeah that's dumb
[18:54:37] <RandomNinja> aren't there pedestrian roads though?

[18:55:00] <DinkyBot>  [ Imgur ]
[18:55:43] <SaultSteMarie> Honestly if they just relaxed that and let you use ped paths for the sake of road access I'd be really happy
[18:55:54] <RandomNinja> there's probably mods for that too, but yeah
[18:56:07] <SaultSteMarie> They're not. That's too hardcoded into the pathfinding stuff to change afaik

[19:03:06] <SaultSteMarie> (I'd love to use asset replacers if anyone bothered making asset replacers that used better assets without making morrowind, well, prettier than it should be)
