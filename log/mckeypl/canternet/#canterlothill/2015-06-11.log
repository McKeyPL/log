[21:59:22] <Sugar> :S 
[21:59:28] <Sugar> aw :( 
[21:59:38] <Sugar> But it is whatever is best for you
[22:00:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well, thinking on it, it's very likely my shift pattern once I start work will have me working til late on Thursdays anyway.
[22:01:15] <Sugar> Its okay my shifts have me out later now too, but not this late I would hope
[22:01:32] <Sugar> I'd catch an evening podcast easy
[22:02:06] <Sketchy_Sounds> Probably not as late as this, but there are likely to be some fairly late finishes.

[22:05:41] <Lrond> just for interest Sketchy_Sounds , why did you think about a daychange? Is it not possible anymore on Thursday due to little Place Circumstances, or do you just want to try something more comfortable with your Time Shedule?
[22:06:11] <Sketchy_Sounds> The job I'm now working is likely gonna have me working late shifts on Thursdays.
[22:06:22] <Sketchy_Sounds> i.e. starting at about 10am and finishing around 7pm.
[22:06:31] <Lrond> on thursday?
[22:06:50] <Sketchy_Sounds> This would mean not getting home until around 7:30pm for me, which would thus mean barely an hour and a half to unwind and then prepare to entertain people.
[22:07:01] <Sketchy_Sounds> I believe that is what I just said.
[22:07:22] <Lrond> ...i see, And a Time change youldnt do the Trick right, cause you have to get up on 10:00 am again
[22:07:47] <Sketchy_Sounds> Uhm, I already start the show as late in the day as I can.
[22:08:12] <Sketchy_Sounds> It's not the amount of sleep I'd get after the show that's a factor. If anything, it's actually not too bad.
[22:08:55] <Lrond> I see. Well i hope everything will be fine! But i have faith in Ye. Can i support you by any chance? Lets get this clear, i will not donate all my Money to you
[22:08:57] <Sketchy_Sounds> What is a factor is the amount of time I would have after finishing work in which to, say, get home, get comfortable, and then prepare myself to do a two hour show.
[22:09:11] <Sketchy_Sounds> Have you considered supporting me on Patreon? :p
[22:09:32] <Lrond> ...maybe you just make 1:30 h of awesomeness. Quite the relief
[22:09:42] <Lrond> No i didnt consider this.
