[23:56:01] <wobniaR> Ah lame, there anything fun to do in norway?
[23:56:11] <wobniaR> Other than visit your parents
[23:56:27] <RandomNinja> mooses aren't a risk as long as you don't try to carve your name into them
[23:56:59] <keekle> or hit them with your car
[23:56:59] <wobniaR> Only thing I know about Norway is that it's close to Sweden
