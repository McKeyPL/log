[15:34:02] <KooK> I have to look at e almost every day
[15:34:30] <KooK> e, ln, all the Greek letters, all the trig
[15:34:32] <Mono|Depressed> I love programming
[15:34:59] <RandomNinja> yay, math
[15:35:15] <Mono|Depressed> I know C And Python
[15:35:58] <RandomNinja> the best part is when you're not sure if you wrote a latin or greek letter
[15:38:05] <e> I am weird in a sense that I have deeper knowledge in areas seemingly not connected: engineering - mechanical and basic electric, applied construction thermodynamics, aeration/aspiration, anything construction related (architect stuff), limited linguistics (mainly applied semantics), coding for visual 3D stuff, 12 languages, acoustics, RC modelling and CNC machinery, machine language translation
[15:38:39] <e> Kind of a Jack of many trades, but not a specialist
[15:40:09] <e> I need to make lists of this stuff, I haven't recalled something (like refrigerating processes and gun smithery interest...)
[15:40:16] <e> Lists are adorkable
[15:40:24] <Mono|Depressed> Do you know programming too?
[15:40:36] <e> Only in relation to 3D space
[15:40:44] <KooK> Here's what I know, y''+2y = 0 will give you an imaginary number and you solve the differential equation using y = Ae^(lambda*t)cos(mu*t) + Be^(lambda*t)sin(mu*t) if it also has a real number or y = e^(rt) + te^(rt) if it's just the imaginary number
[15:40:51] <KooK> but maybe I'm not remembering that right
[15:40:59] <e> A very narrow in-program application: VB, C++, Ruby and Python
[15:42:07] <Mono|Depressed> Did you know that those kind of math can be used at coding
[15:42:18] <e> Mainly 3D Max, Sketchup and Rhino sub-programming (like making new tools I need and creating the shapes I need from math formulas aka "parametric design")
[15:43:15] <Mono|Depressed> Rhino is Java-ish
[15:43:27] <e> Funky stuff that architects usually do by hand, but why by hand if like 60-80% of the thing we draw is redundant anyway and can be scripted parametrically
[15:44:00] <e> Well Mono|Depressed, coding is math, just a very special way to write formulas 
[15:44:10] <RandomNinja> KooK: you're overcomplicating it a bit, just assume y=Ae^(kx), then y'' = (k^2)y
[15:44:12] <Mono|Depressed> e I know

[15:46:36] <e> Lojban is so perfect for coding I don't even
[15:47:49] <e> A definite advantage of it is that it can be translated if need be back to english perfectly, because lojban is unambiguous

[17:37:51] <Unixkitty> There is no such thing as a "linux computer"
[17:37:57] <Starthunder> Only because keyboards designed for Windows dominate the market. 9.9

[23:56:51] <Eywind> aww I don't think you're useless
[23:57:15] <Eywind> that's why I'm a Pegasus
[23:57:17] <Eywind> :P
[23:57:21] <One-Trick> your face is useless
[23:57:28] <RandomNinja> wait, Eywind's or mine?
[23:57:30] <One-Trick> cuz we're on the internet
[23:57:35] <Eywind> the answer to that is 'yes'
[23:57:37] <RandomNinja> darn
[23:57:57] <RandomNinja> !t One-Trick's face
[23:57:58] <DinkyBot> My face is stunned!!!
[23:57:59] <Eywind> but what if RandomNinja was mfw no face guy?
[23:58:07] <RandomNinja> the plot thickens
[23:58:14] <RandomNinja> Eywind should probably eat less cake
[23:58:48] <RandomNinja> also One-Trick's face confirmed DinkyBot's
