[16:12:12] <Hamtramck> And then it was a slur against homosexuals for awhile but now it... isn't really used as a slur anymore and has some other meaning pertaining to The broader non-straight community although I don't really know the nuance behind it.

[21:16:29] <wobniaR> I'm looking forward to your song(s) on this album, i'm gonna miss the first 2 hours of this premiere but i'll be home for the rest
[21:16:32] <Hamtramck> why do they say that
[21:16:43] <Hamtramck> what are they expecting the kids to find on disney.com that their parents would be upset about
[21:16:52] <wobniaR> And i'm gonna take a guess the album will be on bandcamp for listen & purchase
[21:17:24] <wobniaR> Because kids under 13 aren't supposed to be on the internet Hamtramck, because reasons
[21:17:24] <RandomNinja> they might find edgy teenagers on the forums
[21:17:24] <PlumCreekRhythmSection> Yepyep! I think you'll miss mine during the stream though, it's track 3 last I heard.

[23:28:46] <ExplodingPonyToast> yeah I would call this melodic dubstep
[23:28:52] <Silver_Scroll> Woot, this is the no. 1 station on PVL right now
[23:28:54] <TheNightcore> Glitch Hop? or what
[23:28:54] <LutariFan> probably yea
[23:28:58] <ThrasherOfficialMusic> omg,this track's amazing 
[23:29:03] <LutariFan> i think it's melodic dubstep or future bass
[23:29:04] <MagnaDrake> I like those ambient tiny 'wails' in the background
[23:29:09] <ProgressiveElement> whales
[23:29:16] <Creature> I believe the genre is music:)
[23:29:17] <Bonthore> every track in P@D is amazing Thrasher!
[23:29:22] <ph00tbag> Yeah, this is Melodic Dubstep. Has nothing to do with Complextro or Future House.
[23:29:24] <TheNightcore> its to lud for melodic dubstep
[23:29:25] <MagnaDrake> dunno what to call it but it sure sounds like whales wailing
[23:29:26] <Macrobud> does anyone here like Blackmill
[23:29:28] <Macrobud> he is god to me
[23:29:29] <Vaceslav> doesn't seem steppy enough to be dubstep...
