[03:49:35] <RandomNinja> onwards to ridiculousness
[03:49:44] <Eywind> My thought process for Hardstyle: "I can't really judge Hardstyle, but it wasn't offensive to my senses so it has to have been good" lol

[03:50:36] <Sine> yeah don't worry. hardstyle is not for everybody. its a new sound the fandom is not used to because it hasn't gotten much exposure like its trying to now, appearing on radio  stations on here and such.
[03:51:00] <Eywind> I wish it was a bit more well-received
[03:51:05] <Eywind> It doesn't get a lot of visibility on that

[07:59:19] <ynoP> Scary indeed
[07:59:21] <Hamtramck> And I had like 9AM class every other day too
