[02:39:49] <RandomNinja> remember, failing is the first step towards failing less
[02:39:50] <One-Trick> im stick with a single tempo for now
[02:39:50] <Flurshy> I can do a transition now... and that's it. no experience with coordinating tracks.
[02:39:54] <One-Trick> but yes
[02:40:09] <Flurshy> all my music is different tempos >.<
[02:40:39] <One-Trick> you wanna stay within 10% of your original tempo by majority
[02:40:55] <Flurshy> didn't know that
[02:41:11] <Flurshy> you can gradually raise the tempo over the course of a mix, right?
[02:41:27] <One-Trick> thats not a good idea
