[01:17:13] <RandomNinja> shouldn't you get more that that?
[01:17:33] <wobniaR> Wii U is superior to Xbox juan
[01:17:36] <Raxy> $180 for the One. $50 for the 360
[01:17:54] <Raxy> Also yeah. Wii U is the only console :3
[01:17:59] <Eywind> Yeah obviously you're not getting fullp rice if you're trading them in
[01:18:05] <RandomNinja> sell it on ebay for like $300?
[01:18:15] <Eywind> RandomNinja $300 on eBay becomes
[01:18:16] <Raxy> I was thinking about that
[01:18:18] <Eywind> 280 post shipping
[01:18:22] <RandomNinja> don't trade in stuff, you get ripped off
[01:18:23] <Eywind> like 15%
[01:18:26] <Raxy> Reason I don'y wanna^
[01:18:31] <Eywind> depends on how much convenience is worth
[01:18:37] <Eywind> you're gonna net like 230 on ebay
[01:19:04] <Raxy> eBay's cut then Paypal ans the shipping. Takes away a lot

[03:34:50] <Eywind> (there's five key decisions I think)
[03:34:57] <Eywind> but you can play without it
[03:34:59] <RandomNinja> not sure, something like that
[03:35:09] <RandomNinja> still fun to put 200 hours into the same character

[07:56:00] <Trildar> 5x or bust
[07:56:01] <Eywind> honestly it sounds like a bad katamari damacy song
[07:56:02] <GL1TCH> Sometimes when I find a song I REALLY like, I'll put it on repeat for a half hour or so.
[07:56:21] <GL1TCH> Then if I still like it after that, it's worth it's weight in gold
[07:56:48] <GL1TCH> .... however much data weighs

[07:56:59] <Eywind> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAA6hq9RL-4 first minute of the song is someone trying to sing the theme XD
[07:57:08] <Eywind> err of the album*
[07:57:26] <Eywind> to note Kamamari Damacy's OST is IMO one of the best ever made lol
[07:57:49] <Eywind>  also the game
[07:57:56] <Eywind> is one of the most fun games ever :P
[07:57:58] <GL1TCH> Actually, you could calculate that. Storage device divided by # of bytes it contains times # of bytes the song is.
[07:59:40] <GL1TCH> Thus you could de-value a song by putting it on a large-capacity micro SD card.
[07:59:58] <Eywind> yep
[08:00:15] <Trildar> Or compressing it :P
[08:00:19] <Eywind> My recommendation is storing it on a series of 72 5.25 floppies
