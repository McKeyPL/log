[13:36:31] <RandomNinja> 60
[13:36:50] <RandomNinja> The physics engine runs at 60-62
[13:37:09] <RandomNinja> You have to actively disable limiting though
[13:37:12] <Unixkitty> I used to do that as well

[23:23:44] <wobniaR> Oh so that's who owns silver spoon
[23:23:56] <Eywind> araxnus? lol
[23:23:59] <wobniaR> Yeah
[23:24:38] <Silver-Spoon> Which Silver Spoon?
[23:24:48] <wobniaR> --NickServ-- Information on Silver_Spoon (account Araxnus):
[23:24:50] <Eywind> Silver_Spoon is Araxnus
[23:24:51] <Silver-Spoon> Oh.
[23:24:56] <Silver-Spoon> I don't like the underscore thing anyway.
[23:25:08] <wobniaR>  --NickServ-- SilverSpoon is not registered.
[23:25:35] <Silver-Spoon> Multiple incarnations of the name were taken the week after the cutie marks episode.
[23:25:48] * Silver-Spoon has already registered this version.
[23:25:54] * Silver-Spoon also has Apple-Bloom/.
[23:25:57] <Silver-Spoon> without the /
[23:26:10] <wobniaR> If it's not taken, feel free to take it that's all I'm saying
[23:26:54] <RandomNinja> Or someone else will
[23:26:55] <Silver-Spoon> I don't want to become a name hoarder.
[23:26:59] <Silver-Spoon> I hate name hoarders.
[23:27:20] <wobniaR> Use a few, decide which ones you like the most, ungroup/let expire the ones you don't want to use
[23:27:21] * Winter_Nights has many names. He uses them all though.
[23:27:45] <Eywind> yours aren't a lot of canon pony names though
[23:27:50] <Silver-Spoon> I had PhotoFinish, Pinkie or PinkiePie (can't remember which), Applejack^, and a few others.
[23:28:15] * Winter_Nights has a few canon...
[23:28:46] <thereallynewmop12100> !t AppleBloom 
[23:28:47] <DinkyBot> AppleBloom <3 < 3 Notica
[23:28:53] <Winter_Nights> Cheese, Starswirl, Meadowbrook, Shining Armor... A few others.
[23:29:07] <Silver-Spoon> I just don't want to end up like some people who have like 300 assorted names, mostly canon, while I only logon as my internet alias.
[23:29:30] <Winter_Nights> 300 names? Wow.
[23:29:49] <Silver-Spoon> There were like 2 people for awhile who had just about every canon character as a name.
[23:30:05] <RandomNinja> Sound like dorks
[23:30:34] <Winter_Nights> Wow. Severe nerdery.
[23:31:01] <Silver-Spoon> You'd go to look up some background character you think is cute and nobody else seems to care about and it's like "Oh... Them."
[23:31:30] <wobniaR> Not all of them are taken
[23:31:50] <Winter_Nights> I was kinda surprised Cheese wasn't taken tbh.
[23:31:52] <wobniaR> Like I said, you don't have to nick hoard just choose a few and decide which ones you want to keep

[23:32:47] <Silver-Spoon> I'm really hoping for a Silver Spoon and Diamond Tiara specific episode in this rumoured final season.
[23:33:04] <Winter_Nights> Final season? Nuuuuuu
[23:33:12] <wobniaR> "Rumored"
[23:33:21] <Winter_Nights> Important word there.
[23:33:27] <RandomNinja> Final season has the potential to be the best tho
[23:33:30] <Winter_Nights> Everyone. Buy Hasbro's stuff.
[23:33:42] <RandomNinja> Because more character development
[23:33:52] <wobniaR> Don't worry about when pony is gonna end and enjoy it while it lasts
[23:33:55] <Winter_Nights> We need a Celestia episode.
[23:33:58] <Silver-Spoon> Seen a lot of people saying that s6 is going to be the last because it's the last confirmed one, and they're making that one FiM movie.
[23:34:08] <wobniaR> People say a lot of things on the internet
[23:34:18] <wobniaR> Do you trust what every random person says on the internet?
[23:34:20] <Winter_Nights> Very true
[23:34:22] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, how else can we accept when Twilight attains Celestia's place when she's killed off?
[23:34:25] <Eywind> ^
[23:34:28] <Eywind> lol
[23:34:36] <Eywind> kill all the alicorns
[23:34:41] <wobniaR> I mean EQD comments can't lie right?
[23:34:54] <Muffin_Spectacles> Celestia will go out like Optimus Prime, and then Twilight will come in, ala shades of Hot Rod.
[23:34:56] <Eywind> if I learned one thing from EQD comments it's that sea swirl and gilda are the entirety of season 6

[23:35:17] <Eywind> no one cares about her
[23:35:19] <RandomNinja> Inb4 it keeps escalating the finale and the movie ends up rated PG-13

[23:37:06] <Winter_Nights> That she's mute?
[23:37:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> Of course, it is sad that Sunset is probably never coming back to Equestria...stuck having to grow up and get a job, maybe a mortgage...
[23:37:14] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: Because your also my best friend too
[23:37:33] <Winter_Nights> But Muffin, that's why fanfics exist! :D
[23:37:34] <Silver-Spoon> That she never takes off the headphones.
[23:37:42] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: awww, best friends? awesome :)
[23:37:57] <Muffin_Spectacles> Winter_Nights: Well, I'm the one guy of the low percentage that doesn't read those...because they rarely ever become canon.
[23:37:58] <Winter_Nights> That too.
[23:38:18] <Winter_Nights> And she was pretty awesome.
[23:38:23] <RandomNinja> That's not the point of fanfics
[23:38:24] <Silver-Spoon> I play a game made by the guy that made Ponyfinder, and he said some of his fanfics got confirmed by the last episode of s5.
[23:38:31] <Winter_Nights> Seriously, look at that car.
[23:38:31] <ponyshouldriversong> !t scarf
[23:38:32] <DinkyBot> grabs his scarf and fedora.
[23:38:34] <Muffin_Spectacles> MAybe Vinyl is just deaf, and the reason the headhpones are so loud, is she's like Beethoven- turned them up so she can sense the vibrations through them.
[23:38:41] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: *smiles* 
[23:38:56] <Silver-Spoon> I'm pretty sure I've seen her talking to her friends in the movies?
[23:38:56] <Winter_Nights> Ooo
[23:39:07] <Winter_Nights> Possibly.
[23:39:11] * Muffin_Spectacles has toyed with doing a how it should have ended for the first EqG film.
[23:39:15] <Silver-Spoon> And didn't she talk in Episode 100, The Confirmation and Bane of Headcanons?
[23:39:27] <Winter_Nights> Have any of you been reading The Things Tavi Says by SS&E?
[23:39:34] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: Do you saw Series 4 of Doctor Who? 
[23:39:42] <RandomNinja> No but SS&E is quality
[23:39:42] <Winter_Nights> Nope, she didn't.
[23:39:46] <Silver-Spoon> Speaking of Vinyl, is there still no compilation of s5 music?
[23:40:16] <Winter_Nights> You should read it RandomNinja. It's really long now, but oh Luna is it glorious.
[23:40:19] <Muffin_Spectacles> I'm just still surprised that after all this time, we haven't had a Zecora Funko figure yet.
[23:40:53] <SaultSteMarie> Weven't?
[23:40:55] <RandomNinja> Haven't read fanfics in forever
[23:41:05] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: not yet, Just seen the episode where William Harnell doctor regenerated. Season 4 ist worst :( Almost all episode missing it seems :(
[23:41:30] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: Who is your doctor ? 
[23:41:43] <Winter_Nights> Then for the first time in forever RandomNinja... 
[23:41:53] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: *Doctor
[23:41:55] <Muffin_Spectacles> SaultSteMarie: Nothing in scale to Funko's vinyl, large pony figures...though at least they haven't burdened us with rehashes of the Mane 6.
[23:41:55] <Winter_Nights> A guy called O'Neill.
[23:42:06] <wobniaR> Rainbow power mane 6 vinyls
[23:42:08] <wobniaR> I'd pay for that
[23:42:14] <RandomNinja> I already have a ton of other stuff to finish tho
[23:42:20] <Muffin_Spectacles> I almost got Funko's Tim the Enchanter with killer rabbit, because the rabbit I would have considered perfect as an Angel Bunny stand-in.
[23:42:27] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: I meant. Who is your "favorite" Doctor? 
[23:42:35] <Silver-Spoon> My only Funko I've managed to want bad enough to get with my widdle money is Trixie.
[23:42:38] <RandomNinja> Winning Pony, This Platinum Crown, buncha other epics
[23:42:39] <Silver-Spoon> Who has no tail under her cape.
[23:42:47] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: I can't tell, I didn't see them all yet ;)
[23:43:22] <Winter_Nights> Starlight Over Detrot. It's utterly glorious.
[23:43:33] <Silver-Spoon> When I get employed, probably going for a 4DE Luna.
[23:43:59] <wobniaR> That doesn't exist Silver-Spoon
[23:44:08] <Silver-Spoon> Ohs. I thought I saw one?
[23:44:11] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, gonna clean up, and head out to get some stuff and food. Audi for nowie.
[23:44:16] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: My favorite is David Tennant, Matt Smith &  Peter Capaldi 
[23:44:20] <wobniaR> Yeah they just barely released their first line like a week ago
[23:44:28] <thereallynewmop12100> Muffin_Spectacles: See ya later. Byeee! *waves* 
[23:44:30] <wobniaR> Which does not include that one
[23:44:35] <Silver-Spoon> Maybe it was that Chinese company then.
[23:44:41] <RandomNinja> wobniaR: 4DE Luna or a job?
[23:44:45] <wobniaR> pls
[23:45:11] <Winter_Nights> LUNA
[23:45:14] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: David Tennant and Matt Smith were both great. Matt Smith had a weak start I think, but in the last few episodes he's gotten awesome too :)
[23:45:15] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: But nuuuu. http://www.vulture.com/2015/12/peter-capaldi-might-leave-doctor-who.html
[23:45:17] <DinkyBot>  [ Peter Capaldi Might Leave Doctor Who -- Vulture ]
[23:45:29] <Winter_Nights> That you even consider an alternative is HERESY
[23:45:44] <wobniaR> Luna is trash
[23:45:50] <Winter_Nights> GASP
[23:46:00] * Winter_Nights is shocked!
[23:46:04] <RandomNinja> Heresy!
[23:46:07] <Winter_Nights> *bzzzzz*
[23:46:15] <Winter_Nights> Burn the witch!
[23:46:17] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: I still have to watch yesterdays episode, so don't spoiler ;)
[23:46:28] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: Okay. :) 
[23:46:31] <Muffin_Spectacles> The reason why everyone loves Luna, is because she hasn't been as overblown as some other characters. The reason why Applejack isn't as popular is because AJ's EVerywhere!!
[23:46:48] <ponyshouldriversong> But yeah, that's sad, but they all regenerate sooner or later :D
[23:46:53] <Muffin_Spectacles> People see Luna, and they freak out! AJ shows up: "...oh...it's honest earth-pony."
[23:46:56] <Winter_Nights> AJ is still a fabulous character...
[23:47:03] <Silver-Spoon> I actually like Luna because she watches over the dreams of everyone. I sleep with my plushies, and I think having a Luna nearby would keep nightmares at bay.
[23:47:32] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: I am honestly watching the new Star Wars Movie. Yus!!
[23:47:37] <Silver-Spoon> And Applejack is my favourite Mane6... 
[23:47:42] <ponyshouldriversong> Silver-Spoon: Well, she'll infect you with Tantabus
[23:47:44] <Silver-Spoon> But I'm from Georgia, so that could be why.
[23:47:45] <Winter_Nights> I've always preferred the night, and would by choice be nocturnal, but (damnÃ©d society), I can't.
[23:47:54] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: have fun!
[23:48:00] <Muffin_Spectacles> My weakness: Chinese/French/Southern accents.
[23:48:26] <Muffin_Spectacles> Thanks to cartoons, those accents just push a good majority of my buttons.
[23:48:27] * Winter_Nights has six French people in the room right now.
[23:48:33] <Winter_Nights> So much French accents.
[23:48:34] <RandomNinja> Winter_Nights: the sunlight burns
[23:48:39] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: I will. 
[23:48:41] <Winter_Nights> Yes it does.
[23:48:52] <Silver-Spoon> Rarity is my second favourite Mane6. Mostly because I headcanon she's actually kinda from a poor family but has tried to make it for herself, especially after the way her parents look like people who live in an RV park. It also helps she seems to enunciate larger words, like she's concealing an accent like Applejack's.
[23:49:02] <Muffin_Spectacles> So if Cathy Weseluck did her Shampoo from Ranma 1/2 voice, Bell did AJ, and Tabitha Rarity with a French accent, all my money would be gone!
[23:49:26] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: I can't wait until tomorrow 
[23:49:27] <Muffin_Spectacles> And Rarity's parents are pretty horrible: didn't even show up for their daughter's Cute-cinera.
[23:50:02] <Winter_Nights> Eeyup.
[23:50:23] <RandomNinja> Rarity also has the best episodes
[23:50:34] <Muffin_Spectacles> "Honey, we were on a 3 week cruise. We could't drop everything just because you got a cutie mark."
[23:50:49] <Silver-Spoon> I doubt they were on a cruise.
[23:50:54] <Silver-Spoon> They look like trailer park trash.
[23:51:00] <Silver-Spoon> I say this as someone who has been trailer park trash.
[23:51:04] *** djazz is now known as MangoBloom
[23:51:11] <wobniaR> Wow harsh
[23:51:16] <Silver-Spoon> I kinda think Rarity saw how difficult her life was, and took Sweetie with her.
[23:51:24] <RandomNinja> Why do you think she lives alone with her sister in a different city?
[23:51:37] <wobniaR> Sweetie belle visits Canterlot boutique she doesn't live there
[23:51:43] <wobniaR> And her parents live in ponyville
[23:51:54] <wobniaR> Literally on the other end of town
[23:51:59] <RandomNinja> Huh I never noticed
[23:52:03] <RandomNinja> Derp
[23:52:12] <Silver-Spoon> Apple Bloom has a huge room. I feel like maybe the Apples are loaded, but don't flaunt it.
[23:52:25] <wobniaR> They have a lot of land
[23:52:25] <Silver-Spoon> Got that apple monopoly.
[23:52:32] <RandomNinja> ^
[23:52:46] <Muffin_Spectacles> Wait til' we find out the Apples secretly own Ponyville.
[23:52:48] <Silver-Spoon> Finding out that Diamond was being forced to act the way she did by her mother was like "WHAT?!"
[23:52:50] <wobniaR> Real estate is big business
[23:53:10] <wobniaR> They were the first ones to settle in ponyville Muffin_Spectacles
[23:53:21] <wobniaR> The family has a tremendous amount of influence and importance to the town
[23:53:32] <wobniaR> To both its history and survival
[23:53:48] <ponyshouldriversong> thereallynewmop12100: This scarf is gonna be epic http://ditzydoo.de/scarf.png (sorry for bad quality, just had my laptop webcam at hand)
[23:54:22] <Muffin_Spectacles> Yeah, it'll be part of the town's heritage, until a few generations in the future, they'll move the main apple-making portions to another town, killing off the town's livelihood, causing the town to whore itself out as a tourist attraction, "Twilight Sparkle Land."
[23:54:46] <wobniaR> Thanks Hasbro
[23:55:19] <RandomNinja> They'll outsource the farming to zebras
[23:55:56] <Silver-Spoon> Nobody beleives my headcanon that Granny Smith is a few centuries old.
[23:56:12] <RandomNinja> Darn zebras taking Equestrian jerbs
[23:56:17] <Silver-Spoon> But she remembers the founding of Ponyville, and being there and Twilight talks about the Winter Wrap-Up being a Ponyville tradition for centuries.
[23:56:17] <Winter_Nights> If this was real life, the Apples probably would own basically all of Ponyville.
[23:56:26] <Silver-Spoon> believes* 
[23:56:46] <wobniaR> Exact ages are irrelevant in ponyland
[23:56:49] <Winter_Nights> O_O
[23:56:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> That's because Granny is secretly an android...a gay, android! *bum-bum-buuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmm!!!!!!*
[23:57:00] <Winter_Nights> Witchcraft. Granny is ancient. Ye gods...
[23:57:25] <RandomNinja> Damn synths
[23:57:28] <wobniaR> They purposefully keep ages and measures of time vague
[23:57:39] <wobniaR> Which is why "moons" is used as a measurement of time
[23:57:53] <RandomNinja> !t moon
[23:57:54] <DinkyBot> well you get a decent connection on the moon for you
[23:58:14] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldriversong: Nice :) 
[23:58:56] * RandomNinja applies horse synths to wobniaR 
[23:58:59] <wobniaR> In other words Granny could be a few hundred years old Silver-Spoon, feel free to headcanon as you see fit
[23:59:26] <wobniaR> Celestia & Luna are over a thousand and look impossibly young
[23:59:39] <wobniaR> And it's just written off as "magic", because they're all magical talking horses
[23:59:54] <RandomNinja> They're a head taller tho
