[13:17:06] <RandomNinja> Cloud_Zephyr ye exactly
[13:17:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> lul
[13:18:14] <Unixkitty> It actually is, if you can't have a smooth and reliably feeling gameplay, what's the point playing something in the first place?
[13:18:26] <Unixkitty> of*
[13:18:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> why some devs lock it at 30 fps on pc? is there some secret way to make more money by doing that or something?
[13:18:39] <Unixkitty> Because money.
[13:19:01] <Cloud_Zephyr> but how?
[13:19:08] <Unixkitty> To expand on that though, I think it's because sometimes they don't want console peasants to feel underappreciated or something
[13:19:12] <RandomNinja> ^
[13:19:18] <RandomNinja> also, lack of optimization
[13:19:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> lul

[13:22:33] <Unixkitty> I'm not saying it isn't, silly, just that I'm fine enough with 1080

[13:24:11] <RandomNinja> yeah
[13:24:17] <RandomNinja> also because no vertical space

[13:55:02] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about In Flames - Moonshield [HD/HQ Lyrics in Video]
[13:57:40] <Flurshy> I have a genius idea
[13:57:45] <Flurshy> buy a new processor for my laptop
[13:57:53] <RandomNinja> you could
[13:57:58] <Flurshy> options are limited due to the socket though
[13:58:10] <Flurshy> I can only get a .3-.5 boost
[13:59:04] <Flurshy> that's GHz
[13:59:18] <RandomNinja> acquire .3 THz
[13:59:33] <Flurshy> however, it's only thirty bucks for nother processor of this socket
