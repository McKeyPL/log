[22:43:30] <Sombra> So I don't get it, like... why is it only open on certain days?
[22:43:39] <Sombra> Why can't someone else open their own server up to be on 24/7?
[22:43:47] <wobniaR> Code is not open-source
[22:45:03] <Sombra> Why don't they open it
[22:47:50] <wobniaR> A lot of reasons, the main two because they don't want to and because Hasbro

[22:50:34] <wobniaR> It is, but that's their problem
