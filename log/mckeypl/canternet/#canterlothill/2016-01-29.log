[04:12:28] <Toothpaste> I know one thing for sure-- kids will easily get attached to electronics if exposed early on. I never went onto the internet myself until about... 2010? I don't remember
[04:12:46] <Surreal_Nightmares> 8.55 out of 19.19 gigabytes downloaded for The Division Beta.
[04:13:08] <Surreal_Nightmares> I didn't listen to electronic music until a few years ago.

[04:14:57] <Toothpaste> I never really got into electronic music until I heard a beautiful new song called Blossom by Au5

[04:19:10] <Surreal_Nightmares> There's this huge red line going down my leg now.
[04:19:11] <Eywind> and based on the conversation we had I wouldn't expect to see him for a while either unfortunately
[04:19:14] <Surreal_Nightmares> Of course.
[04:19:50] <Night_Killer> ill be around every now and then,
[04:19:59] <Night_Killer> i enjoy the music
[04:20:29] <Toothpaste> So anyways, I listened to only two electronic musicians before Blossom happened. Adam Young and Almost Anyone will always be among my favorites <3
[04:21:02] <Regulus> I've been here for 4 years. Of the people in here right now, maybe 12 have been here that long, and of those 6 or 7 actually talk.
[04:21:04] <Surreal_Nightmares> I enjoy music that joins something from an orchestra with something from an electronic instrument. I'm not sure if that made sense but I'm just bored.
[04:21:20] <Eywind> I've only been here for 2.5yr
[04:21:45] <Surreal_Nightmares> How long have you existed for?
[04:21:47] <Regulus> I've seen people come and go
[04:21:53] <Surreal_Nightmares> Random question cause why not.

[04:31:31] <Toothpaste> Anyways, excuse me as I rave to some Scatman
[04:31:49] <Surreal_Nightmares> Tried playing CoD:WaW modded zombies with the Steam Controller and I did pretty decent for my first try.

[04:31:58] <Surreal_Nightmares> Ooh, Scatman.
[04:32:00] <Regulus> Of course, she has 1337 skillz
[04:32:09] <Eywind> yeah I wasn't sure, they look interesting, but a bit unnecessary
[04:32:26] <Surreal_Nightmares> It's fun, for me at least
[04:32:38] <Eywind> I guess I have a XBO
[04:32:46] <Eywind> so I can just hook up my controller
[04:33:05] <HamtRamKc> shouldn't that be "an XBO"
[04:33:08] <Surreal_Nightmares> To be honest, I felt like I was too slow when I played with an Xbox controller.
[04:33:10] <AFK_Flare> Haxx is better than 1337.
[04:33:14] <wobniaR> Xbone
[04:33:14] <Eywind> X is not a vowel
[04:33:26] <HamtRamKc> "Ecks" starts with a vowel sound.

[04:34:20] <Surreal_Nightmares> For no reason.
[04:34:50] <HamtRamKc> I cringe when I see people writing stuff like "an European pastry."
[04:34:57] <Regulus> So, yes "an XBO" is correct

[23:52:41] <KooK> White pizza or Mediteranean pizza?
[23:52:53] <Regulus> Ummm?
[23:53:01] <One-Trick> i dunno what mediteranean pizza is
[23:53:05] <KooK> You don't need to know the details, just pick one
[23:53:19] <Regulus> !decide white Mediterranean 
[23:53:19] <DinkyBot> THE GREAT DINKY SAYS ITS Mediterranean
[23:53:24] <One-Trick> neither- pizza has too many carbs
[23:53:25] <RandomNinja> I'll go with that for italy reasons
[23:53:36] <RandomNinja> but carbs are delicious
[23:53:50] <Regulus> But One-Trick... cheese!
[23:53:54] <KooK> I at least know the white pizza is Gluten-Free and Vegetarian
[23:54:11] <RandomNinja> ew
[23:54:24] <RandomNinja> definitely the mediterranean
[23:54:38] <KooK> That's probably gluten-free but with chicken
[23:54:49] <RandomNinja> still an improvement
[23:54:52] <KooK> Here
[23:55:03] <KooK> Mediteranean - Garlic Butter, Chicken, Arugula, Roma Tomato, Red Onion, Feta, Mozzarella and Olive oil.
[23:55:18] <KooK> White - Garlic butter brushed crust, mozzarella, asiago, ricotta, tomato, red pepper flake with olive oil drizzle. 
[23:56:04] <RandomNinja> yeah mediteranean sounds better imo
