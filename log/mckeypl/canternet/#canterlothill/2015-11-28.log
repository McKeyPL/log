[20:14:54] <thereallynewmop12100> FritzyBeat miss_ : I requested 2 sad songs. one from the LDB Album & the other one is a goodbye song for Matthew Moiser
[20:15:09] <StandingLeaf> !lycan SoaringFlight - Above Cloudsdale (Nicolas Dominique Remix)
[20:15:21] <FritzyBeat> Did Moiser leave? =P
[20:15:36] <Lycan> FritzyBeat, I think I have to close requests there!
[20:15:36] <FritzyBeat> I know he hasn't been around in a long while, but I assumed it was just the military 
[20:15:54] <FritzyBeat> or he had merely moved on to other stuff :P
[20:15:57] <Lycan> We have more than enough
[20:16:02] <FritzyBeat> haha, nice~
[20:16:16] <thereallynewmop12100> FritzyBeat: Because the theme is songs about the feels, whatever it is. So. i requested this one because it's sad. 
[20:16:34] <Lycan> thereallynewmop12100, that were the two fandom classics
[20:16:46] <Lycan> The theme is the season finale songs
[20:16:53] <FritzyBeat> remixed
[20:16:54] <FritzyBeat> ;3
[20:16:56] <Lycan> This is the season 1 finale remix
[20:17:02] <Lycan> yes, thanks FritzyBeat
[20:17:03] <Lycan> XD
[20:17:13] <StandingLeaf> My request is something I found earlier this week and wasn't in the radio's database. Araxnus added them not 3 days ago ^_^
[20:17:15] <Lycan> Next up is the BBBFF song

[23:03:39] <MikeM> It's after spoiler ban!
[23:04:43] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: We bid farewell to MLP: FIM S5. 
[23:05:07] <MikeM> Yup. 
[23:05:25] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: It's a shame to end but the season finale is awesome
[23:05:40] <Eywind> episode was cool
[23:05:44] <Eywind> liked the first 45-50 min
[23:06:49] <MikeM> I thought the ending was quick, but Jeff Burgess pointed out that Starlight's conversion happened after the sonic rainboom.
[23:06:49] <MikeM> So that made a little sense.
[23:07:09] <Eywind> yeah I suppose
[23:07:40] <Eywind> still, forgiving someone that multiple times took actions that ruin equestria just because one of their childhood friends moved on?
[23:08:13] <wobniaR> Quick to forgive, but punishment probably would not have helped in that situation
[23:08:17] <Eywind> yeah I know
[23:08:23] <Eywind> I mean it was probably their only option regardless
[23:08:24] <MikeM> Yeah. They did kinda gloss over the shallowness of her anger.
[23:08:29] <thereallynewmop12100> https://derpicdn.net/img/2015/11/27/1031356/medium.png
[23:08:41] <Eywind> she is the most powerful unicorn
[23:08:42] <wobniaR> Hey there are many real world examples of people festering in shallow anger
[23:08:48] <MikeM> True
[23:08:54] <wobniaR> It's as realistic as it gets
[23:09:17] <wobniaR> One little bit of jealousy can eat at your mind for many years and turn into something nasty
[23:10:35] <MikeM> Hmm...can't change the past, but you can change the future. Sounds familiar.
[23:11:00] <wobniaR> Oh they could change the past, but it ended up in something worse
[23:11:14] <Eywind> or better, depending on which princess you like :P
[23:11:33] <wobniaR> This is why you don't mess with the space time continuum kids
[23:11:57] <Eywind> also Screwball would have loved to have s6 be in the first au
[23:12:21] <wobniaR> Screwball the actual pony was in the background for a few seconds too when Discord's line popped up
[23:12:26] <Eywind> yea I saw that
[23:12:33] <Eywind> well I saw someone post that
