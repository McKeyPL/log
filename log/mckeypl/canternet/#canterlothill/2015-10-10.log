[00:00:11] <ExplodingPonyToast> would be nice if they did
[00:00:13] <Vaceslav> one day, we can dream
[00:00:17] <ph00tbag> I've heard the various elements of this song before, but it's a unique combination.
[00:00:19] <Lycan> Incoming Fritzy and Lycan banter
[00:00:24] <ForeverFreest> YAY
[00:00:26] <Creature> I dont think EQD will be aroun forever.
[00:00:26] <ExplodingPonyToast> They need somebody more focused on music
[00:00:33] <Eywind> neither will the fandom Creature lol
[00:00:34] <ExplodingPonyToast> rather than just seth doing it all
[00:00:35] <Lycan> !song

[00:01:06] <MikeM> Well, ya got me there.
[00:01:16] <Macrobud> i struggle to remix
[00:01:18] <RandomNinja> we will head to the stars and build a mighty imperium
[00:01:20] <Macrobud> id love to have the power to remix
[00:01:23] <Macrobud> id remix so much
[00:01:24] <ExplodingPonyToast> doesn't surprise me that this is fritzy's type of music haha
[00:01:27] <Eywind> unless the fandom lives in the akashic records or whatever
[00:01:28] <ExplodingPonyToast> remixing is easy
[00:01:29] <PegasYs> HAY Tea tho
[00:01:29] <ForeverFreest> fritzy knows EVERYONE :P
[00:01:30] <Silver_Scroll> Well, the EQD staff were actually invited to Germany for GalaCon just two months ago
[00:01:32] <ExplodingPonyToast> remixing well is hard
[00:01:36] <PegasYs> Hay Tea is bae
[00:01:39] <Creature> Two thumbs in the fourth dimension:)
[00:01:39] <ExplodingPonyToast> ye
[00:01:41] <Lycan> Silver_Scroll, we mix it up between 2 and 3 songs depending on length
[00:01:41] <PegasYs> I want to make a track with him
[00:01:43] <ph00tbag> EqD is, unfortunately, the only sourse of pony news for a huge majority of the fandom, so when they lose their music focus, so does the fandom.
[00:01:45] <Silver_Scroll> I got all their signatures
[00:01:45] <Hydra> Hay Bae

[00:03:15] <Macrobud> yeah id do it too
[00:03:18] <thereallynewmop12100> SpectraMusic|Working: That means. Cider Party is closed and disappeared?
[00:03:26] <ExplodingPonyToast> it's still there
[00:03:26] <Macrobud> I would start a new channel but theres no point as it would take so long to even get off the ground
[00:03:29] <ExplodingPonyToast> but no new uploads
[00:03:31] <ExplodingPonyToast> Yeah
[00:03:33] <ph00tbag> Spikey Wikey left pony for sonic? I'm not even sad for brony music anymore; I'm sad for him.
[00:03:33] <ExplodingPonyToast> That's the issue

[01:23:23] <SpectraMusic|ShouldBeDoingWork> But I'm not gonna go into it now
[01:23:24] <ph00tbag> I think the BP4 crew is the one that rubs people the wrong way.
