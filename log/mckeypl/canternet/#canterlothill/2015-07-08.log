[01:31:14] <Eywind> Snapai my roommate enjoyed your Moondancer book :)

[01:36:48] <LunaticHell> "Good Times" was a "virus" that was sent "by mail" by sending you a mail titled "Good Times", said mail claimed to warn you from the virus "Good Times", listing everything this virus would do to you, amongst others: Spoil your milk, send your boss voice mails with bad stuff and kick your dog. It also contained the line "Do not open any mails with the title "Good Ties." " - oh yes, this was a good one.

[01:42:46] <Cydie> Of course they used the random function
[01:42:47] <One-Trick> the problem with her current markov database is that its doesnt have any space to expand horizontally

[01:44:29] <Playstation> ;-;
[01:44:46] <Snapai> One-Trick, couldn't you simply change the parser and function, so /me (or ^001ACTION^001) is parsed and stored as a "word", and played back appropriately - unless people are very crafty she should never wind up with it having any probability except as a first word.
[01:44:49] <Eywind> and this is why the command got removed
[01:45:08] <One-Trick> her random function creates a 128bit guid and leverages odds and evens based on the crc total of the string
[01:45:09] <Twilightlicious> talk about The Simpsons predicting everything, Family Guy predicted something somewhat relevant to us. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgQ60DoNRJs
[01:45:21] *** Joins: QuantumPocket (uid71401@Pony-un9cbp.charlton.irccloud.com)
[01:45:35] <Snapai> I know relatively little about Markov so I don't know if it's capable of repositioning a word that only ever occurs at the beginning of a statement or not
[01:45:41] <Playstation> I thought the link just said =mlg
[01:45:49] <Playstation> Mom get the camera
[01:45:53] <LunaticHell> hahahahaha
[01:45:57] * Playstation says, "Get no scoped!"
[01:45:58] <One-Trick> Markov is rainbow tables for language
[01:46:14] <Snapai> That sounds pretty.
[01:46:15] <LunaticHell> This is the first time I heared someone describe Family Guy as "relevant".
[01:46:25] <One-Trick> its not intelligent, it just makes assumptions based on historical patterns
[01:46:37] <LunaticHell> Isn't Makarov the name of a pistol?
[01:46:42] <Playstation> Yes
[01:46:57] <Playstation> Russian I think
[01:46:57] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[01:47:08] <One-Trick> id have to allow Dinky to read actions from others and create a seperate database just for that, as it uses a different speech pattern than just saying something
[01:47:12] <Playstation> Makarov is a Russian pistol
[01:47:28] <LunaticHell> I'd rather use a Tokarev, couldn't hit a thing with a Makarov.
[01:47:31] <Snapai> One-Trick, yeah. THat's how I understood it - it looks at the logs and says "okay this word usually comes before/after these other words" and guesses based on probability
[01:47:51] <One-Trick> essentially, its also how you brute force passwords
[01:48:20] <Snapai> My point is, if '/me' is read in as a "word" by the log parser, and written out properly by the chain generator - she should only ever see that symbol at the beginning of a lnie.
[01:48:30] <LunaticHell> Oh, we're talking about decryption?
[01:48:44] <Snapai> Which- if she's only storing word-order-probability would mean the markov generator would never put it halfway through a line
[01:49:49] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t One-Trick
[01:49:50] <DinkyBot> One-Trick: She also did not have, though!
[01:49:54] <Snapai> I'm doin a lot of assuming, but if that's the case, then you don't have to create a new DB or migrate the existing one, just change the parse/generate functions to create a unique word for it.
[01:50:02] <LunaticHell> I heared the USA and Russia are trying to build supercomputers, with enough capacity, that they could break a password just by the merit of "brute force" or something.
[01:50:10] <Playstation> When Cloudy gets back
[01:50:12] <LunaticHell> Ok that info is already 5 years old.
[01:50:13] <Snapai> (ideally a word that contains characters IRC can't transmit, so no-one can screw it up)
[01:50:18] <Playstation> I need to ask him questions
[01:50:41] <Eywind> so tomorrow
[01:50:56] <Playstation> !t DinkyBot
[01:50:57] <DinkyBot> Ouch DinkyBot x3
[01:51:00] <One-Trick> ok, lemme rephrase what i was trying to say- since markov is not intelligent and only makes assumptions based on context. speaking and actions are two different styles of delivering a message, which means deriving an action from a statement is much harder to accomplish as they are presented differently. it would require a horizontally expressive database that can differentiate the ...
[01:51:06] <One-Trick> ... difference, which my code does not consider and, thus, isnt capable without having a seperate, independant database
[01:51:41] <Snapai> I see. So you mean a different db so she doesn't mix grammatical tenses (3rd person vs 1st person) in the body of the statement
[01:52:01] <One-Trick> if her database wasnt already hugenormous, i could just change the base code to consider actions
[01:52:28] <Snapai> Rather than the context of the transmission of a CTCP ACTION vs a privmsg. Which itself is trivial.
[01:52:37] <One-Trick> there are just soooooooo many relations in there already it took 27 hours just to delete all the dead-end chains where i removed bad words
[01:53:01] * Eywind says a bunch more bad words
[01:53:43] <RandomNinja> nerds
[01:53:49] <One-Trick> i think rylius did a better job implementing markov to handle actions but dinky makes more sense contextually 
[01:53:59] <Snapai> Huh. You did that as a maintenance task? Could you just create a garbage collection routine that runs whenever it hits a dead-end chain and removes that chain then restarts the generation process?
[01:54:14] <One-Trick> she also has a self-decaying memory which simulates short-term vs long-term memories
[01:54:37] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Eywind
[01:54:38] <DinkyBot> XD Awesome Eywind, thanks for cleaning up trash.
[01:54:56] <One-Trick> i didnt create the original code for the database- i would have just made a column for bad_words and marked it boolean
[01:55:16] <Snapai> So you could load her in a nsfw channel and have her swear like a sailor? XD
[01:55:26] <One-Trick> pretty much, yea
[01:55:48] <Twilightlicious> bad derpy
[01:55:48] <Eywind> np
[01:56:00] <Twilightlicious> or dinky, depending on who we're talking about
[01:56:06] <One-Trick> currently, she can make 64^16 sentences according to her relations table

[01:56:47] <DinkyBot> EEEWWwwww! Momma, tha's gross .. but funny!!
[01:57:08] <Snapai> And they all involve Eywind? :p
[01:57:26] <One-Trick> the biggest problem with Dinky is that she listens to everything and tries to make sense from it. most people usually just use one word or a name to talk to her directly, this is bad, veryverybad, for Markov as it lacks a lot of context and makes for poor responses
[01:57:39] <One-Trick> if people talked to her more like CleverBot, she would be as clever as cleverbot :)

[05:17:14] <Trildar> Just type their name.
[05:17:22] <SilentHoofsteps> and hit tab
[05:17:28] <Trildar> You can also press tab while typing partway to autocomplete nicks.
[05:17:38] <SilentHoofsteps> like type 'sil' and hit tab
[05:17:58] <TenderFlutter> and the magic happens
[05:18:06] <Trildar> Press tab again to cycle through multiple matches.
[05:18:21] <SilentHoofsteps> advanced magic right here
[05:18:26] <Smiley> ok i wondered if tab would do the same thing as it does with names in minecraft. aparently it does
