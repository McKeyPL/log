[04:04:24] <wobniaR> f
[04:04:28] <MikeM> You have to advertise to attract listeners?
[04:05:00] <wobniaR> Maybe if we do a free stuff promotion
[04:05:05] <wobniaR> That always brings people
[04:05:37] <Eywind> Yeah it's not something we haven't thought of
[04:05:47] <Snap_Shot> Lol those are worst promotions honestly. Brings lots of people but has like a 5% of people actually stayin
[04:05:57] <wobniaR> Pretty much
[04:05:58] <Eywind> But to actually benefit from free stuff things you have to have a product they're interested in staying around for
[04:06:03] <Nintendo4DS> just get an ad on derpibooru
[04:06:06] <wobniaR> It'll be fun for you Snap_Shot cause you get to ban stupid people

[05:37:34] <Ypsilanti> If you're not from the UK/commonwealth of nations, the proper spelling is color.

[05:38:34] <Ypsilanti> Yeah really.
[05:38:50] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Ypsilanti: Nothing wrong with using the British spelling.

[05:39:59] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> In any case.
[05:40:00] <Ypsilanti> This is a very simple concept and I have no idea why people have such a hard time coping with British and American orthographies having deviated slightly.

[05:48:23] <Snapai> MikeM, that's actually kinda' what made me want to do the picture. Like, how would a pony flash a peace sign without fingers? Then I realized she probably had peace sign horseshoes XD

[22:17:30] <Cloud_Zephyr|Live> i tried locking minecraft to fps the other day. it was horrible
[22:17:39] <Eywind> Not when you're going 10fps on witcher 3
[22:17:43] <Sombra> 144fps in minecraft.
[22:17:50] <RandomNinja> pleb
[22:17:52] <RandomNinja> 145
[22:17:52] <Eywind> Minecraft is garbage
[22:17:53] <Cloud_Zephyr|Live> 30 fps*
[22:18:02] <Sombra> Only because that's as high as my monitor refresh rate goes

[22:18:18] <Eywind> It's huge boxes, of course it can run high fps

[22:18:36] <RandomNinja> Eywind, it's terribly optimized tho
[22:18:50] <Sombra> Minecraft is not so easy as you think.
[22:19:03] <Sombra> There are physics and properties involved.
[22:19:04] <RandomNinja> also Java is pretty terrible for games afaik
[22:19:15] <Eywind> Okay?
[22:19:19] <Trildar> dat memory usage
[22:19:43] <Eywind> Just because it's hard it easy doesn't make it a better or worse game lol. It can be fun though I'm sure

[22:20:23] <Eywind> I have fun with bad games, but using a game with such rudimentary assets as Minecraft for a graphics gauge is laughable
[22:20:57] <RandomNinja> yeah but the thing is that minecraft runs like a game with way heavier assets
