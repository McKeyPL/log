[03:05:01] <RandomNinja> this is true
[03:05:03] <Eywind> btw why not low gravity homebrew?
[03:05:06] <Eywind> it'd rise directly to your mouth
[03:05:29] <RandomNinja> well, alcohol is lighter than water...
[03:05:36] <MikeM> Beer in space? 
[03:05:43] <RandomNinja> 10/10 would drink

[19:18:37] <Flurshy> I'm not sure
[19:18:37] <RandomNinja> if not, 750 Ti can still handle most games very well
[19:18:44] <Flurshy> 750 it is then, I think

[19:19:39] *** Joins: SomeFrenchBrony (Antoine@Im.Frenchy.And.I.Know.It.fr)
[19:19:51] <RandomNinja> yeah if you're going to game on 4K 960 is the minimum
[19:20:09] <RandomNinja> I'd say 290X or 970 for that

[19:28:25] <Flurshy> but water power is clean energy
[19:28:50] <Flurshy> why would they -discourage- it?
[19:29:03] <RandomNinja> their argument is that it hurts river ecology
[19:29:15] <RandomNinja> which is technically correct, but ya

[22:17:55] <Snap_Shot> NightmareMoon demonlucario- SPitefire
[22:18:28] <Eywind> Spitefire is the evil vindictive fanfic sister twin of Spitfire
[22:18:42] <Araxnus> I wish I knew the origin of that request. lol. the 7th wonder of the great Snap_Shot ;)
[22:19:32] <JockeTF> Grisou: No.
[22:19:51] <LocDogX86X> are we still still restricted too 3 tonight cause a thought of a song that needs too get played tonight for the last show
[22:20:50] <LocDogX86X> Twitch - Flutterborn
[22:21:14] <NightmareMoon> I'm loading both requests and a mix of my own choices.
[22:21:22] <Vengi57> I'd second Flutterborn
[22:21:27] <NightmareMoon> I think after three and a half years, I have quite the backlog of my own requests.
[22:21:33] <Grisou> NightmareMoon : is there a request spreadsheet ?
[22:21:37] <NightmareMoon> Nope
[22:22:02] <JockeTF> NightmareMoon: I wish one could request not just songs, but also alpacas.
[22:22:43] <wobniaR> Yes NightmareMoon insert ALL your requests
[22:22:51] <thereallynewmop12100> JockeTF: Are you sad LRT is disappearing from CLH? 
[22:22:54] <wobniaR> (Not ikea pony or gak)
[22:23:02] <JockeTF> thereallynewmop12100: Of course I am.
[22:23:14] <Araxnus> NightmareMoon: YourEnigma - My Roommate is a 'Bassist' | Likonan (Catharsis) - Celestia's Riddle (Nik Kershaw & Gigi D'Agostino Ponification) | Sand Josieph - Carnival Cat vs. Ponyville | That one song about wishes and masters please <3 It would make Raxy smile :) I need to smile. Just ask Eywind 
[22:23:20] <Eywind> Lol
[22:23:23] <wobniaR> I was wondering when you'd request that Araxnus
[22:23:38] <Araxnus> I was um pondering.
[22:23:41] <Araxnus> I guess
[22:23:43] <Eywind> Roommate is probably old enough by now
[22:23:53] <wobniaR> I had to do through my list to make sure all mine were from 2012
[22:23:56] <Araxnus> If not I would cry, Eywind 
[22:23:56] <JockeTF> thereallynewmop12100: I remember playing BeatHazard (or whatever it's called) to LRT long before I ever joined this IRC channel. :)
[22:24:00] <wobniaR> I only have like..3 or 4 songs from 2011
[22:24:12] <wobniaR> Like Luna wont you cry for meee
[22:24:14] <Eywind> Evil Enchantress though
[22:24:23] <Grisou> WobniaR : Oh, this one's from 2011 ?
[22:24:23] <Eywind> You know that one is always old school enough
[22:24:32] <wobniaR> Pretty sure Luna is 2011
[22:24:37] <Grisou> Thought it was more recent
[22:24:38] <wobniaR> Or early 2012
[22:24:44] <Grisou> The original, not the Alex S one ?
[22:25:01] <wobniaR> Uploaded on May 20, 2011
[22:25:05] <wobniaR> Original of course
[22:25:11] <Grisou> Nightmare or Dream ?

[23:27:20] <TheAndyMac[NLR]> This is really from 2011 0.0
[23:27:23] <NightmareMoon> And it was all done during the days when everybody was, pardon my language, Shit-Happy about the fandom. Everything was new, everything was awesome.

[23:29:58] <ponyshouldponypony> 2012 was most crazy year for me ;)
[23:30:00] <NightmareMoon> EFR and EFN are far from the same thing.
[23:30:10] <NightmareMoon> EFR was a small group of people who were doing this for fun.
[23:30:16] <NightmareMoon> EFN became business and seriousness.
