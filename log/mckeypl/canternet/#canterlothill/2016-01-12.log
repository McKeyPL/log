[07:05:14] <Cloudie> wow sounds *so* fun
[07:06:05] <MikeM> It sure is. I can't believe how fun it is. There's no way I'd let anyone else get in on it.
[07:06:38] <Cloudie> :')
[07:09:49] <Cloudie> Odd question, anyone know any songs in similar style to greensleves that can be played on guitar?
[07:10:33] * RandomNinja derives MikeM
[07:10:57] * MikeM is ded
[07:11:15] <MikeM> You mean folk songs, Cloudie?
[07:12:02] <Cloudie> No, more like classical Bardesque songs. Kinda reminiscent of Skyrim if you've ever played it.
[07:12:37] <Cloudie> In an attempt to try and define the kind of sound I'm thinking of, here's another example: http://www.jsayles.com/music/2013/Elway%20Bevin%20-%20Browning.mp3
[07:12:56] <Cloudie> They're almost always in Am I've noticed
[07:13:50] <MikeM> Does that key make the fingerpicking easier?
[07:15:09] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|Sleepies
[07:15:50] <Cloudie> possibly. I don't know the theory behind the consistency of Am, but I'm trying to find songs so I can expand the "fingerpicking/classical guitar" subsection of my library of "shit I can play"
