[00:46:48] <Hamtramck> Cloud I don't think dubstep really counts as a genre. It's just some blanket term that applies to a lot of things, sort of like post-rock I guess.
[00:47:08] <Hamtramck> Also it might have different implications in the UK and US????
[00:47:13] <Hamtramck> Sort of like with new-wave

[00:48:01] <Cloud_Zephyr> relly? i thought that blanket term was EDM :|
[00:48:12] <RandomNinja> that's an umbrella genre
[00:48:17] <RandomNinja> much like rock
[00:48:18] <Hamtramck> EDM is what people called techno to sound smarter.
[00:48:28] <Hamtramck> And techno is what people called "electronica" to sound less idk nerdy.
[00:48:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuu too many genres

[01:14:27] <Regulus> Yes, they're still going good with those
[01:14:35] <RandomNinja> They're doing consoles right
[01:14:48] <Regulus> Try telling the other 2 though >.<

[03:26:21] <MikeM> I'd go to the concert, you can probably leave if you don't like it.
[03:26:24] * Regulus snickers 
[03:26:38] <Night_Killer> And Hamtramck have you heard of the show called equestria unlimited?
[03:26:48] <MikeM> But if you don't go, will you later say, "I should have gone?"
[03:27:00] <Hamtramck> No
[03:27:12] <Sombra> I'll probably look at it
[03:27:25] <Sombra> Like I don't dance or move or anything
[03:28:06] <Eywind> You don't have to
[03:28:10] <Eywind> just enjoy the music
[03:28:32] <Night_Killer> That why then
[03:29:01] <Eywind> Night_Killer, living for 18 years doesn't get you respect from people, your actions do.
[03:29:41] <Eywind> You can legally be an adult but still be a kid; a good deal of people I've known fall into that group
[03:30:46] <Night_Killer> Don't give me that false adult talk that most people give to kids.
[03:30:49] <One-Trick> 18? yer old enough to be my kid
[03:30:57] <Eywind> Umm, it's true.
[03:31:01] <nekomi> where's my steam games, draco? i got a wishlist
[03:31:38] <Eywind> You'll get some experiences in the Army, and it's respectable that you're going into that, but just that doesn't make you more 'mature'
[03:32:47] <Hamtramck> Yeah 18 year olds are old enoughto be my kid too
[03:32:52] <Hamtramck> If I'd been more ambitious when I was 9.
[03:32:55] <Eywind> XD
[03:33:00] <Night_Killer> Being mature in person or in rl is one thing, but here it's another, in this irc it's ok to be a little immature it's what makes the fandom fun
[03:33:16] <Eywind> But whining that people call you a kid when you act like one isn't realistic
[03:33:19] <Regulus> Orly?
[03:33:30] <Eywind> And generally if you act like a kid in here you act like a kid outside of here
[03:34:57] <Night_Killer> I'm not whining, I'm stating that I don't want to be called a kid/child. And as for your "respect" if that even mattered to you, you would respect my request to be called an adult.
[03:35:01] <wobniaR> If you play Splatoon, you can be a kid AND a squid

[03:36:42] <Hamtramck> From the same store in Lansing, no less.

[03:45:40] <ButtonMasher_Draco> No Prob!
[03:46:00] <Hamtramck> the big thing about /being mature/ is not caring if others view you as mature?

[05:22:22] <Boxer>  Lyra and Sweetie Drops are cannon! MLP:FIM is happily progressive. I wonder if this will make the news. I think this is the first time there has been a lesbian relationship depicted on a children's cartoon. If I am wrong please correct me.
[05:22:22] <Moon_Solace> wrong topic XD
[05:22:28] <Eywind> they're just friends
[05:22:32] <Eywind> NOTHING MORE TOTALLY NOTHING
[05:23:07] <Moon_Solace> Honestly, I'm fine with calling her Sweetie Drops, Bon Bon since her undercover name is that.
[05:23:36] <Moon_Solace> omit "her" XD
[05:23:49] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: Thank you for that outburst...I too grow tiresome of overly-taking things too seriously.
[05:23:58] <Eywind> :P
[05:24:23] <Eywind> :P
[05:24:25] <Muffin_Spectacles> Personally, I felt that whole I'm not Bon-Bon thing was a little jab at the fanfic writers who take every little thing too seriously.
[05:24:43] <Eywind> It was also a way to bridge the fandom names
[05:24:47] <Eywind> well the merch names
[05:24:53] <Eywind> she's bon bon on the tcg cards
[05:25:06] <Muffin_Spectacles> "You don't know the whole truth...sure, Stephen Magnet is considered Cranky's friend...but you don't know what they had to do together..."
[05:25:12] <Eywind> Indeed
[05:25:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> So, who voiced Bubbles.
[05:25:24] <Hamtramck> Lesbians.

[05:25:31] <Muffin_Spectacles> or is it Ditzy now?
[05:25:34] <Boxer> She was always Bon Bon to me.
[05:25:34] <Eywind> it's Muffins
[05:25:34] <Hamtramck> Also no Courage the Cowardly Dog had some legits lesbanians
[05:25:48] <thereallynewmop12100> !t powerpuff girls
[05:25:49] <DinkyBot> yeah but so was the powerpuff girls
[05:26:07] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: The version I saw cut off before the credits, so who voiced whom I have no idea.
[05:26:30] <Muffin_Spectacles> Hasbro: Ok, the grey pony got to speak at least 100 words...now stop pestering us to do more!

[05:42:47] <Muffin_Spectacles> I will admit...I think I have a little fandom for Amethyst Star. I guess it's just her schooling RD in opening peanut butter that floats my boat.

[07:30:34] <Faith> logged onto IdleRPG for the first time in forever. Level 53. Dang.
[07:30:55] <Eywind> XD
[07:31:01] <Kelazi5> I've been doing pretty good with the steam sale, only spent about $20 so far
[07:31:01] <Eywind> Immeidately lost two levels
[07:31:07] <Faith> 57 rather
[07:31:50] <Hamtramck> the stupid metagames and social networking stuff around steam make me not want to keep buying stuff there :T
[07:32:07] <Hamtramck> Well that's like 20% of it, the 80% of it is the lack of games I want
[07:32:08] <Faith> sometimes I log in just to say "I like this game more than my brother" and leave.
[07:32:12] * LadyCameron looks at idlerpg, is amused.
[07:33:01] <Kelazi5> I never do any of the social media stuff, I just buy really cheap games
[07:33:56] <Faith> All of my Visual Novels are on sale for Steam Summer. I'm so happy.
[07:34:03] <Faith> Uhhh I mean... The Witcher 3!
[07:34:21] <Eywind> XD

[20:09:51] <miss> hi Eywind 
[20:10:16] <PinkieShy> wobniar I was wondering because a few months ago I installed opera and it wouldn't uninstall ended up installing it 3 times to get the uninstaller on the PC in the end I used revo uninstaller 
[20:10:25] <Eywind> Hello
[20:10:38] <PinkieShy> But the other installs that wouldn't remove keys stayed though it's not there 
[20:10:40] <Eywind> "Samus Aran NO ONE CAN STOP HIM" miiverse stage please
[20:11:05] *** Cloud_Zephyr|Away is now known as Cloud_Zephyr
[20:11:08] <Eywind> it's supporting zero suit...
[20:11:11] <PinkieShy> Will the win10 upgrade fix that or just find opera software in the reg edit and remove just them only?
[20:11:23] <wobniaR> Control panel > uninstall programs
[20:11:37] <Cloud_Zephyr> how many bitcoins do i recieve?
[20:11:39] <wobniaR> That's the best and easiest way to uninstall stuff on your system
[20:11:41] <Eywind> 0
[20:11:44] <Eywind> or 0.0000000002
[20:11:48] <PinkieShy> Wobniar I did that lol
[20:11:54] <miss> are there Star Wars fans here?
[20:12:14] <wobniaR> After uninstalling opera from there just restart your computer and it should be gone
[20:12:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuuu
[20:12:22] <PinkieShy> Should I just do a clean install of windows before the 10 upgrade or will the upgrade clean old keys?
[20:12:49] <wobniaR> Windows 10 is a completely new OS, it'll probably reformat and save your old files on your hard drive
[20:13:03] <miss> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYk1DgaeZC8
[20:13:08] <wobniaR> I don't know for sure
[20:13:25] <wobniaR> Just back up stuff you want to save before upgrading
[20:13:30] <PinkieShy> Wobniar I did lol but opera still shows up in the %temp% like unknown file extension about opera upgrade?
[20:13:55] <PinkieShy> I have a oem backup disk of 8.0
[20:13:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> i have yet to get back the money i spent
[20:14:25] <wobniaR> You're talking about the opera browser, right PinkieShy?

[20:15:00] <miss> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlaeJ6k75cY
