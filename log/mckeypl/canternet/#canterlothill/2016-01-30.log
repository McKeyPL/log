[07:32:17] <Eywind> and he got a foil wastes
[07:32:19] <Eywind> and he got a $10 card
[07:32:37] <Eywind> boo him lol
[07:33:07] <Ali> Could be worse, you see the power 9 someone ruined?
[07:33:14] <Ali> They ponified them
[07:33:17] <Eywind> the pony alters? lol
[07:33:23] <Ali> which in fact would KILL their value.
[07:33:36] <Eywind> they weren't good condition to begin with, and odds are if they're getting it altered with that they dont' care about the value
[07:33:41] <Eywind> or they won't get rid of them
[07:34:02] <Ali> Still they're ruined in any MTG players mind
[07:34:09] <Ali> even if a fan of MLP
[07:34:21] <Eywind> eh I'd buy them
[07:34:38] <Ali> Not for 12k
[07:34:45] <Eywind> For the set? IDK
[07:34:54] <Eywind> they were like MP/HP Revised anyways
[07:35:04] <Eywind> Unlimited*
[07:35:10] <Ali> Still
[07:35:14] <Eywind> I doubt they were worth 12k before the alters
[07:35:22] <Ali> Even after they're not worth 12k
[07:35:27] <Eywind> were they before?
[07:35:33] <Ali> I don't know
[07:35:45] <Ali> but altering the card usually lowers the value, not raise it.
[07:35:53] <Eywind> This is true
[07:35:59] <Eywind> but if they're already MP/HP, it's just a wash
[07:36:11] <Eywind> I think it's cool someone got them altered to what they wanted
[07:36:23] <Eywind> if they were alpha/beta I might be a bit more annoyed
[07:36:47] <Eywind> but still it's their property
