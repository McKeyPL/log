[00:03:06] <DanielWaterhorse> Is it weird to drink regular pepsi?
[00:03:08] <Eywind> yes
[00:03:11] <Eywind> it's such a boring soda
[00:03:39] <DanielWaterhorse> I don't even know how to respond to that. You must be right
[00:04:49] <RandomNinja> it's like Coke, except inferior
[00:04:54] <Eywind> ^
[00:05:00] <RandomNinja> too sweet
[00:05:24] <DanielWaterhorse> I think coke tastes sweeter than pepsi. But perhaps it is regional differences
[00:07:30] <One-Trick> i like coke lite over diet coke
[00:07:45] <RandomNinja> what's coke lite?
[00:08:05] <RandomNinja> also isn't american coke with corn syrup rather than cane sugar?
[00:08:20] <One-Trick> i dunno, i dont drink sugar
[00:08:24] <One-Trick> prolly
[00:08:30] <Hamtramck> Random, yeah but it doesn't taste appreciably different.

[00:09:12] <One-Trick> coke lite is diet coke, but its not called that outside of the US

[00:09:57] <Eywind> Agreed, but that's because we can drink regular soda if we want with relatively no drawbacks

[00:10:09] <RandomNinja> like sure they're sweet, but they don't taste like sugar

[00:11:02] <RandomNinja> plot twist: it's further education

[18:15:41] *** Joins: Cheese_Sandwich (WebChat@Pony-pbe.p7e.105.81.IP)
[18:16:06] <RandomNinja> basically I want another Divine Wings, but that's not happening :P
[18:16:18] * Cheese_Sandwich powers some metal and twists it into complex shapes for lels
[18:16:18] <BerryPunch> I want that or Odyssey
[18:16:28] <RandomNinja> Odyssey was pretty great as well
[18:16:39] <Cheese_Sandwich> BOMBASTICALLY. as if that wasnt obvious
[18:16:59] <RandomNinja> also, V: The New Mythology Suite needs more love
[18:17:15] <BerryPunch> They really haven't done anything power metallish in the past couple albums
[18:17:29] <BerryPunch> I guess that's what I mean by stale. I like the cheese too
[18:17:57] <RandomNinja> the Paradise Lost title song was a pretty by the book power metal ballad imo
[18:18:55] <BerryPunch> Yeah. That album had the last major power influences on it. Was a beautiful blend of styles really
[18:19:01] <RandomNinja> Iconoclast was really, really good but not very traditionally power metal
[18:19:07] <RandomNinja> more... trash?
[18:19:37] <BerryPunch> Then Iconoclast was like no power ... at least the kind I love and endear
[18:19:38] <RandomNinja> leaning towards Dream Theaters heavier stuff maybe
[18:20:13] <RandomNinja> you love traditional power metal?
[18:20:15] <BerryPunch> Yeah, more of a tech metal type thing
[18:20:19] <BerryPunch> Yes
[18:20:25] <RandomNinja> opinion on Gloryhammer? :P
[18:21:01] <BerryPunch> Let me go listen. The Unicorn Invasion of Dundee seems appropriate
[18:21:30] <RandomNinja> Basically, this is their upcoming album http://bravewords.com/medias-static/images/news/2015/gloryalbum.jpg
[18:21:40] <BerryPunch> Yes. This resonates with my soul
[18:21:41] <RandomNinja> that title is everything I love about power metal
[18:21:57] <RandomNinja> also, hilariously bad english in the lyrics
[18:22:13] <BerryPunch> Yes
[18:22:58] <BerryPunch> I dig this
[18:23:08] <RandomNinja> "The evil wizard falls to doom and drowns in liquid ice" is an actual lyric
[18:23:17] <BerryPunch> I thought Gamma Ray was the only band trying to keep the 80s alive
[18:23:31] <RandomNinja> Hammerfall
[18:23:35] <BerryPunch> Running Wild's reunion album was meh
[18:23:48] <RandomNinja> also, you know of Alestorm?
[18:24:03] <BerryPunch> Hammerfall had adopted a more modern sound. Though they still keep to roots with it
[18:24:07] <BerryPunch> Aye
[18:24:25] <RandomNinja> Gloryhammer is the Alestorm keyboardists "less serious" sideproject
[18:24:51] <RandomNinja> wait no, their singer is gloryhammers keyboardist
[18:24:54] <RandomNinja> that's the way around
[18:25:51] <RandomNinja> The Epic Rage Of Furious Thunder - 10 minutes of glorious cheese
[18:26:05] <BerryPunch> Nice
[18:26:33] <RandomNinja> I'm not sure if this is worse than oldschool Rhapsody
[18:27:53] <BerryPunch> Never use the term "worse" for describing glorious cheese
[18:28:10] <RandomNinja> worse as in more extreme
[18:28:11] <BerryPunch> I'm listening now and this is nothing short of magnificent

[18:40:16] <BerryPunch> Ya know. RandomNinja ... I've thought long and hard about this and may do it. I wanna write a power metal inspired fan fic about my OC and other OCs. I got the idea cause I'm very disappointed in the story of Brūtal Legend. 
[18:40:32] <Vulpor> yeah!
[18:40:36] <BerryPunch> And I'm like ... there's better ways to tell the great tales of metal
[18:40:37] <RandomNinja> I didn't like the gameplay :
