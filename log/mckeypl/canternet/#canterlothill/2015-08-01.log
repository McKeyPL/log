[17:04:54] <wobniaR> Preventive medicine
[17:05:03] <FruitNibbler> Because that's what "cure" is for the headache according to clickbait interweb sites
[17:05:05] <wobniaR> Or preventative
[17:05:43] <RandomNinja> wobniaR pls acid only makes you think you can time travel, it doesn't actually let you go back and prevent getting hurt
[17:07:21] <Hamtramck> actually headache cure: go take an excedrin or failing that, caffeine
[17:07:29] <Hamtramck> since excedrin's like caffeine and painkillers
[17:08:20] <Hamtramck> so caffeine and whatever painkiller you can mix with caffeine would work. The flavor profile of ibuprofen really complements the piquant nature of caffeine
[17:08:32] <RandomNinja> that sounds like overkill

[17:17:18] <FruitNibbler> All I know that opiate painkillers used in medical field have little to no effect on me, so I had my wounds stitched and teeth pulled with no anaesthesia before
[17:18:13] <FruitNibbler> I really thought painkillers were meant to lessen the pain a tiny bit, I didn't even knew they should have removed it completely
[17:18:13] <RandomNinja> fun fact: back in the day heroin was marketed as a cure for morphine addiction

[17:22:07] <FruitNibbler> But addiction doesn't seem like a good side effect to me

[21:53:45] <ynoP> 90% of the time, nobody is picking templates before they open a word document
[21:54:03] <ynoP> Because the default templates are default templates
[21:54:21] <ynoP> So why even show them on the startup screen?
