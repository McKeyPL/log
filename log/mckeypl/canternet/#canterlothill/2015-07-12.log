[02:17:34] <LocDogX86X> Sega should make another system
[02:17:48] <ynoP> Not really
[02:17:56] <LocDogX86X> i'd buy it
[02:18:00] <ynoP> It's all different people now
[02:18:04] <Hamtramck> Eh.
[02:18:15] <ynoP> Sega today is not the Sega of the past
[02:18:19] <Hamtramck> I'd rather they just focus on development. They've done some cool stuff on the 3DS
[02:18:25] <Hamtramck> I'd LOVE seeing Saturn games on Steam.
[02:18:50] <Hamtramck> ... Tempted to go get that Outrun remaster now that I think about it...
[02:19:49] <LocDogX86X> omg Outrun so much fun
[02:20:00] <Cloud_Zephyr> nomnom RandomNinja  i has cider
[02:20:04] *** Joins: Playstation (Playstation@Playstation.Pone.64)
[02:20:09] <RandomNinja> is it good cider?
[02:20:29] *** Playstation is now known as PointNClick
[02:20:34] <Cloud_Zephyr> i think so
[02:20:38] <Hamtramck> I played Outrun 2006 on the PS2 a lot.
[02:20:43] <RandomNinja> yay
[02:20:51] <Hamtramck> I should get normal Outrun 2 for the XBox sometime. It's got somewhat different mechanics.
[02:21:19] <Hamtramck> Once you get the hang of the ridiculous powerdrifting in 2006 though it's addicting
[02:21:19] <LocDogX86X> i have it on my 360, but it was way better at arcades
[02:21:32] <Hamtramck> I think the 360 version is missing content.
[02:22:02] <Hamtramck> Like I'm pretty sure it doesn't have the Coast to Coast tracks or the refined campaign mode from 2006
[02:22:03] <ynoP> I want to do a PC build to max Fallout 4 at 1440p... The gtx 980 ti got discounted to like, $650 retail recently and it's still a beast... Should I do it?
[02:22:22] * RandomNinja replaces Cloud_Zephyr's cider with mead
[02:22:44] <RandomNinja> honestly you'll probably max Fallout 4 with a 970
[02:22:53] <Cloud_Zephyr> nom
[02:22:58] <ynoP> But I want that future proof 980 ti
[02:23:09] <ynoP> So my mind is probably already made up
[02:23:12] <RandomNinja> yeah if you want it go ahead
[02:23:50] <RandomNinja> it's probablt overkill for Fallout specifically, but it never hurts to have more juice

[02:24:40] <Trildar> Such nerdery
[02:25:00] <RandomNinja> indeed
[02:25:02] <Eywind> Guys I need to dip for a little bit
[02:25:03] <ynoP> I mean, the AMD 300 stuff doesn't look that appealing with the start market costs and so far they're just matching what nVidia already has... Then the Pascal stuff won't be until like 2016 and that's too far
[02:25:07] <Eywind> see you before midnight

[02:25:58] <Hamtramck> Oh yeah I lookd it up, it just has the Outrun 2SP courses.
[02:26:32] <Hamtramck> The PS2/Xbox/PSP version had both the Outrun 2 and SP courses and a bunch of unlockables, as well as an upgraded mission mode, which I guess was not brought over t ohe 360 version

[05:15:19] <Sombra> An AR pistol precisely, this would be the second one I've ever built, and the FIRST one I'll ever build from the ground up.  The last one I had a complete upper, so I didn't get to do any of that assembly.
[05:16:24] <Eywind> Ah nice dude, sounds like you'd get a lot more out of it by building it piecewise
[05:19:16] <Crux> well that was a nice long awkward silence
[05:19:22] <Crux> :p
[05:19:31] <Sombra> Certainly will take longer.
[05:19:45] <Crux> okay I can wait lol
[05:21:29] <Sombra> I mean, I can't afford all the pieces at once, or a full thing, so that's why I piece it together.  This month it was a barrel, next month, upper/lower reciever and buffer kit, month after that, parts kit and handguard, month after that, sights and optics, then I should be good to go.

[17:29:05] <RandomNinja> well you're looking at about 10% alcohol or so
[17:29:10] <RandomNinja> so probably
[17:29:11] <Hamtramck> So yes?
[17:29:21] <RandomNinja> ye
[17:29:31] <Hamtramck> I've realized I don't like "MORE NPCS IN TOWNS" mods because a lot of the modders have no restraint and turn tiny backwater outposts into bustling metropolises. It's like, NV's in a post-apocalytic desert it's probably empty for a reason.
[17:29:50] <RandomNinja> well technically NV is post-post-acopalyptic :P
[17:29:54] <RandomNinja> the world is recovering
[17:29:57] <Hamtramck> Ok troo.
[17:30:42] <RandomNinja> the entire west coast is pretty stable under NCR
[17:31:30] <Hamtramck> Morrowind's kind of goofy about that NPC mods too. Yeah the towns are sort of empty but the entire island's basically Silent Hill so there's a reason that nobody's outside.
[17:31:44] <Hamtramck> You're not going to have dozens of people milling about outside being all"GOSH WHAT A LOVELY TOXIC ASH STORM"
[17:31:50] <RandomNinja> lul yeah
[17:31:56] <RandomNinja> also Cliffracers
[17:32:11] <Hamtramck> Cliffracers are way less annoying than I remember.
[17:32:11] <RandomNinja> http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/613921452399530486/6A57769A36FD44F89A5663F83F05A9C094B24961/
[17:32:32] <Hamtramck> I think I used to playwith an AI mod that made monsters more likely to flee though.
[17:32:43] <Hamtramck> If you don't do that they die in like two hits and are basically a cheap source of souls.
[17:33:34] <RandomNinja> yeah they're mostly really annoying
[17:33:45] <RandomNinja> not a real threat or anything
[17:33:57] <RandomNinja> well, except when theres hundreds of them
[17:37:16] *** Cloud_Zephyr|Away is now known as Cloud_Zephyr
[17:37:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> where has today gone?
[17:37:22] <Hamtramck> Anyway I really like the quests in MW. They're more open-ended in how you approach them -- that's what I liked about NV and why I found Oblivion so offputting.
[17:37:40] <Hamtramck> Also sort of why I prefer Fallout 1 over 2.
[17:39:20] <Hamtramck> Fallout 2 gave you options it was just weird about what was viable. Like the starting dungeon in that was really hard for non-combat builds.

[17:47:14] <RandomNinja> but yeah Oblivion was a bit stiff
[17:47:21] <RandomNinja> the exceptions were generally great tho
[17:48:17] <Hamtramck> I heard Shivering Islands was way better than base Oblivon
[17:48:24] <Hamtramck> Oblivion is so poorly optimized though.
[17:48:24] <RandomNinja> it is
[17:48:39] <RandomNinja> Shivering Isles is reason enough to buy the base game
[17:48:44] <Hamtramck> Like okay yeah I have a 2.2GHz laptop pentium thing, but Oblivion's from 2006, and I can run NV just fine.
[17:49:09] <Hamtramck> Then again I get a higher framerate in NV than I do in Morrowind.

[20:23:02] <RandomNinja> does USB work?
[20:23:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> nah i wanna print from other devices
[20:23:53] <Cloud_Zephyr> i could share it but then the host computer has to be on

[20:24:33] <RandomNinja> ah

[20:27:54] <RandomNinja> interestingly it's like a third of the price at german amazon
[20:28:01] <Trildar> Printers wouldn't really benefit from ethernet over wireless, so I guess most just give it that cause it pretty much covers all cases.
[20:28:12] <RandomNinja> less wifi pollution?
[20:28:20] <RandomNinja> but yeah doesn't matter a lot
[20:28:26] <Cloud_Zephyr> looks a bit funky
