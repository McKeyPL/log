[00:18:31] <RandomNinja> Hickory, kids?
[00:18:48] <Octavius_Scratch> It's cool to watch, but if it were a real man it'd be horrific
[00:18:59] <Hickory> Kids seem to not know a lot these days.
[00:19:31] <Octavius_Scratch> Well that's what you get when they spend all their days on fb
[00:19:47] <RandomNinja> Instagram*
[00:20:08] <Hickory> Don't kids go to school these days?
[00:20:15] <Octavius_Scratch> "school"
[00:20:20] <Hamtramck> it's sbubbertibe
[00:20:31] <Hickory> I'd think they wouldn't allow smartphones at school.
[00:20:45] <Octavius_Scratch> you'd think
[00:21:00] <Hickory> And that they'd block facebook page from the computer areas.
[00:21:15] <Octavius_Scratch> and they use proxy
[00:21:31] <Hickory> Proxy pages can be blocked.
[00:21:40] <Octavius_Scratch> proxy proxy
[00:21:44] <Octavius_Scratch> I
[00:21:48] <Octavius_Scratch> I've seen it happen
[00:22:00] <RandomNinja> pretty sure most elementary school kids don't know what a proxy even is
[00:22:05] <Octavius_Scratch> Running 2-3 proxy at the same time
[00:22:05] <Hickory> A proper administrator can view any computer school screen at any given time.
[00:22:12] <Hickory> And yeah, again, you'd assume that kids in school are smart.
[00:22:19] <Hickory> They don't even know that MRI's are magnets.
[00:22:29] <Octavius_Scratch> They don't even know how magnets work
[00:23:28] <RandomNinja> nobody does tho
[00:25:46] <wobniaR> They work with science
[00:25:52] <wobniaR> And magical science particles
[00:26:13] <RandomNinja> I'm sure they're involved in robo-scorpions somehow
[00:27:48] <Snap_Shot> Lol my public schools computer system were such a joke. Literally logged myself in gave my account admin access and never logged in again
[00:28:27] <wobniaR> That's because public schools almost never have any IT staff
[00:29:04] <wobniaR> They just toss an image on the computer boot it up and let the kids go wild until it breaks
[00:29:11] <RandomNinja> or it's a guy who's been doing it since the early 80's without ever updating his skills
[00:29:21] <Snap_Shot> Well the stupid webblocking thing they used for my distract was soo stupid I swear I was blocked from a website one time for reason:Educational
[00:29:44] <Inucroft[NLR]> At my school, they acidently game a friend of mine admin privalages to fix his account and forgot to remove the privialages
[00:29:48] <wobniaR> The proxy is located within the DOE network though none of that's done on-site
[00:30:03] <RandomNinja> Department Of Evil?
[00:30:10] <Hickory> Luckily we had compitent administrators at my old school.
[00:30:11] <Inucroft[NLR]> The admin were getting confused as sites they've blocked on the internet kept being unblocked XD
[00:30:13] <wobniaR> So individual schools have no control over what the DOE decides to block
[00:30:37] <Inucroft[NLR]> Huh... our school intenet was hosted in school.
[00:30:54] <Snap_Shot> Still wobniaR if one of the input reasons for why you block a site is Educational then the person that made it needs to be shot
[00:30:55] <wobniaR> Different per area then
[00:32:00] <wobniaR> There's a lot of dumb stuff going on in education systems
[00:32:07] <wobniaR> I'm glad I didn't continue working for them
[00:32:07] <RandomNinja> How dare the children spend their time in school learning?
[00:33:24] <Hickory> Sort of irrelevant anyway since most of their time shouldn't be spent on computers.
[00:33:42] <wobniaR> Depends on what they're learning
[00:33:45] <RandomNinja> it's still a really dumb category for bans
[00:33:47] <wobniaR> And how it's being taught
[00:34:22] <Hamtramck> Computers are dead, smart phones are the future, etc.
[00:34:26] <snitch567> RandomNinja: ?
[00:34:27] <Hickory> Probably because whatever administrator is in charge of it is completely incompitent.  He hs a nice cozy union job, and will get paid well no matter how terrible he does.
[00:34:41] <Snap_Shot> If i remember correctly I was doing something for my German Language class.
[00:34:55] <Snap_Shot> this was many years ago so i don't fully remember
[00:34:56] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hickory my secondary school, we only used PCs during ICT lessons. But my "form" group were based in a ICT room- so during rain breaks we arsed around on the internet
[00:34:57] <Hickory> Even a teacher who was charged with innappropriate conduct with a student was getting paid by the state via his union for two years until his case was finished.
[00:35:13] <wobniaR> Yep union wooo
[00:35:19] <Inucroft[NLR]> oh no, unions are evil- not.
[00:35:20] * snitch567 steals RandomNinja
[00:35:32] <wobniaR> Unions aren't a bad thing but people abuse it 
[00:35:34] <Hickory> They are not evil, they simply have their priorities mixed up.
[00:35:38] <Inucroft[NLR]> It's not like people are incoccent till proven guily by a jury of peers
[00:35:46] <Hickory> They put the good of the teachers above the good of the students.
[00:35:53] <Inucroft[NLR]> I feel the UK is not the best place for you to visit
[00:35:58] <Inucroft[NLR]> ;)
[00:36:03] <wobniaR> Come to america Inucroft[NLR] we have freedom
[00:36:11] <Hickory> No it isn't.  Because you can't just fire a teacher for doing a bad job, you have to send them to the union board of reviews and other such BS.
[00:36:13] <Inucroft[NLR]> yea, freedom for the goverment
[00:36:20] <Hickory> It's very difficult.
[00:36:26] <wobniaR> Or you can go to Sweden for free education
[00:36:30] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hickory yea, cause making people desitue is fair
[00:36:35] <Hickory> You can go here for free education.
[00:36:42] <Inucroft[NLR]> pffff XD
[00:36:46] <Hickory> It is fair if they're ruining my childrens education
[00:36:52] <Hickory> Do a bad job = get fired
[00:37:47] <Hickory> The US spends more per student on education, but it's worse.  For a multitude of reasons.  I believe the lack of quality teachers to be one of them, but certainly not the only reason.
[00:37:57] <Hickory> More per student on education* than the UK.
[00:38:10] <Hamtramck> Well exceeeept in the US it's more like
[00:38:14] <Hamtramck> Not do a bad job = get fired
[00:38:17] <Inucroft[NLR]> well, they are underpaid in the US, and the size of classes are insane...
[00:38:20] <Hamtramck> But be gay = get fired
[00:38:36] <Sera_Pony> except that is illegal in the US
[00:38:40] <Hamtramck> be regarded as not being relgious enough = get fired.
[00:38:45] <Inucroft[NLR]> pfffff
[00:38:46] <Sera_Pony> also illegal
[00:38:47] <Hickory> Also illegal.
[00:38:53] <Hamtramck> And it still happens.
[00:38:54] <Hamtramck> So
[00:39:03] <Inucroft[NLR]> Sera_Pony it's amazing what excuses people can fire people for such reasons
[00:39:04] <Hickory> If it does happen and you can prove it, you can sue someone into oblivion.
[00:39:07] <Sera_Pony> and that sort of thing happens in every nation where a business owner has baises
[00:39:10] <Sera_Pony> it's not an issue in the US.
[00:39:17] <Sera_Pony> no more than the rest of the world.
[00:39:28] <Sera_Pony> and if you can prove you were fired for being in a protected class, you can sue.
[00:39:36] <Sera_Pony> and you will win the court case, if you have enough evidence.
[00:39:36] <Inucroft[NLR]> It's an issue in all western world, but the US and UK it's more pronounced due to weak labour laws
[00:39:59] <Inucroft[NLR]> Issues is, most of the time, there is no evidence that a court would accept
[00:39:59] <Hickory> They can fire you for no reason in commercial businesses because of lay-offs and what-not.  
[00:40:09] <Sera_Pony> they should be able to
[00:40:22] <Sera_Pony> do we expect businesses to be job programs, or businesses?
[00:40:24] <Hickory> In the school system, they can't do that.  Which I sort of understand.
[00:40:31] <Hickory> But I think they should be able to fire you more easily for doing a poor job.
[00:40:37] <Inucroft[NLR]> Example: in UK all agency workers have to be hired by the firm after 6months onto a proper contact.
[00:40:41] <Hickory> How about this.  If you're  students are getting poor grades, you get fired.
[00:40:49] <Hamtramck> Nah.
[00:40:51] <Hamtramck> That doesn't work
[00:40:52] <Inucroft[NLR]> However, a warehouse doubles the expected quota of work
[00:40:58] <Hamtramck> It could be the students' fault, for one thing
[00:41:03] <Sera_Pony> then teachers get fired for taking on children with problems
[00:41:07] <Hickory> Wel
[00:41:17] <Sera_Pony> encourage those kids to get ignored, and given bad teachers who woulda been fired anyways.
[00:41:19] <Inucroft[NLR]> you get fired, and amazingly, the agency rehires you to do the same job back at the original quota
[00:41:21] <Hickory> If it were the students fault, then all of the teachers with those students would have students with poor grades.
[00:41:36] <Hickory> But if you notice a habit of students getting poor grandes in certain teachers classes, you know what to look for.
[00:41:49] <Sera_Pony> a system like that would work, but would require a level of technology and coherence that doesn't exist in school administartion
[00:42:01] <Hickory> So what you're saying Inucroft[NLR] is that companies have to hire people, even if they don't have any openings and are overstaffed.
[00:42:09] <Sera_Pony> also, a teacher that grades heavily will have students with lower grades across the board
[00:42:16] <Sera_Pony>  but be teaching better, rather than worse
[00:42:21] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hickory no, they're using 0hr contract workers instead of hiring the staff themselves
[00:42:27] <Inucroft[NLR]> through an agency
[00:42:29] <Sera_Pony> I've found the best teachers are the ones where the students do get low grades, and are allowed to fail.
[00:42:37] <Hickory> What do you mean 0hr
[00:42:45] <Hickory> So they're hiring someone and not giving them any hours?
[00:42:50] <Hamtramck> Yeah if you judge on grades, too, you'll just have teachers pass everyone and the kids won't learn anything.
[00:42:53] <RandomNinja> no guaranteed hours
[00:42:59] <Hamtramck> This is kind of a problem with universities I thiiiink?
[00:43:13] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hickory yes. It means the employer has no obligation to give you any work
[00:43:18] <Hickory> Hamtramck, if you don't judge on grades, then our students are doing great with the rest of the world!
[00:43:30] <Hamtramck> Hickory how many kids do you have anyway.
[00:43:36] <Hickory> So basically you just get a fancy name tag that says you work somewhere, without actually working there.
[00:43:59] <wobniaR> I want a name tag
[00:44:13] <Hickory> Or getting paid.
[00:44:17] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hickory pfff, like they're willing to spend a single penny on a 0hr contract
[00:44:18] <Hickory> Or do they have to pay you for not working.
[00:44:45] <Hickory> So basically it's just so that they can say "Look, we got someone a job!" without actually getting them a job.
[00:44:49] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hickory you get min wage, £6:55 ph (~$10) if you do work. But you only get paid for the hours you work. 
[00:44:53] <Hamtramck> Also Hickory where are your kids going to school, anyway..?
[00:44:58] <Inucroft[NLR]> yes- thus hiding unemployment figuers
[00:45:04] <Hickory> Inucroft[NLR]
[00:45:06] <Hickory> That's genius
[00:45:14] <Inucroft[NLR]> no, its awful
[00:45:25] <Inucroft[NLR]> I've been on a 0hr contact. It's usless and the goverment hates
[00:45:26] <Hickory> So what are the REAL unemployment figures like in the UK?
[00:45:26] <Inucroft[NLR]> it
[00:45:41] <Inucroft[NLR]> Blooming awful in most sectors...
[00:45:43] <Hickory> If you take away all of those "0hhr contracts"
[00:45:57] <Inucroft[NLR]> prob ~2% higher than it is
[00:46:04] <Hickory> Only 2%?
[00:46:15] <Inucroft[NLR]> the buggest issue is, the goverment has no idea how many 0hr contracts even exist
[00:46:22] <Sera_Pony> any unemployment is higher than it should be.
[00:46:25] <RandomNinja> percentage points or percentages?
[00:46:47] <Hickory> How do they have no idea how many even exist?
[00:46:53] <Hickory> Aren't they in charge of said agencies?
[00:46:56] <Hickory> Don't they keep records of it?
[00:46:57] <Inucroft[NLR]> 2% is 1.4 million people. 
[00:46:59] <Hamtramck> Anyway, speaking from personal experience, unions aren't the thing making it hard to get incompetent teachers fired.
[00:47:11] <Hamtramck> There's a tendency for school admins to form power verticals outside of what the union can do.
[00:47:12] <Inucroft[NLR]> Ha the goverment don't run them, all down to deregulation
[00:47:26] <Hickory> Inucroft[NLR], I mean of the total workforce not of the total UK population.
[00:47:37] <Inucroft[NLR]> That is that i'm basing it on
[00:47:38] <Hamtramck> And if you're on their good side, you're never getting fired. If you're on their bad side, they'll manufacture reason to fire you.
[00:47:45] <Inucroft[NLR]> ^
[00:48:20] <Hickory> So how do they get money?
[00:48:38] <Inucroft[NLR]> simple, you sign paper proving you've done said hours working
[00:48:48] <Inucroft[NLR]> it's then confirmed by the line manager
[00:48:59] <Hickory> Okay, you have to actually go to an agency, and there's people there who get you "hired" right/
[00:49:04] <Hickory> How do those people who work there get money?
[00:49:13] <Inucroft[NLR]> Through the agency. 
[00:49:14] <Hickory> What's their source of income?
[00:49:22] <Inucroft[NLR]> The work place pays the agceny
[00:49:23] <Hickory> Yes the agency, how does the agency get money.
[00:49:41] <Hickory> Okay, so a workplace pays an agency to get people to come work at their company, and then they don't give them any hours.
[00:49:52] <Inucroft[NLR]> then they don;t get a wage
[00:50:19] <Hickory> What incentive does a workplace have to pay an agency to have them send them workers?
[00:50:24] <Hickory> What does that do for the workplace?
[00:50:57] <wobniaR> Not all places are like that Inucroft[NLR], I've been working hourly and getting paid for whenever I come in
[00:51:00] <Inucroft[NLR]> Hickory on call workers, and they don't need to give them any hours. Moreover, cheaper than full time workers who they have to pay NI/pensions and such
[00:51:23] <wobniaR> They don't limit my hours but I'm expected to be there 3 days 8 hours a day
[00:51:45] <Inucroft[NLR]> lucky, I was at a warehouse which was filled with internet web stores

[03:39:00] <wobniaR> Yeah legacy of the duelist sounds like an old yugioh game but apparently its a new one
[03:39:08] <Eywind> that is actually kinda cool wobniaR
[03:39:17] <wobniaR> Has story duels from the main series, reverse duels where you play as the antagonist
[03:39:21] <Eywind> yeah that's pretty sweet
[03:39:26] <wobniaR> Has cards from the beginning to feb 2015 as well
[03:39:36] <wobniaR> Most archetypes exist in the game
[03:39:41] <Eywind> yera
[03:39:43] <Eywind> draft and sealed though

[03:40:05] <wobniaR> Probably
[03:40:08] <wobniaR> It has like 6.6k cards
[03:40:23] <wobniaR> Anything up to february this year it most likely has
[03:40:36] <StrykerVylon> Red-Eyes support comes out like this month.
[03:40:40] <wobniaR> Then no
[03:40:42] <StrykerVylon> So probably not.

[03:41:42] <wobniaR> pls
[03:41:56] <SilentHoofsteps> have you rememebered the name of the thing yet, One-Trick ? I'm too curious not to know at this point
[03:42:03] <wobniaR> I mean sure if you wanna do a pure red-eyes themed deck
[03:42:11] <wobniaR> But dragons are better off being mixed or focused
[03:42:30] <wobniaR> They have a lot more universal support than all the other archetypes in the game
[03:42:37] <wobniaR> And mix well with other types
[03:43:26] <StrykerVylon> With the Dragon Ruler's banned theyre pretty meh.
[03:43:44] <wobniaR> The elemental dragons were a deck on their own
[03:43:55] <wobniaR> They didn't use any other dragons cards they didn't need it

[03:52:58] <Eywind> wobniaR you saw the CCV errata right?
[03:53:16] <wobniaR> Wow really
[03:53:52] <Eywind> Yeah it makes no sense
[03:54:32] *** Joins: MikeM (wanderer@watcher.in.the.water)
[03:55:26] <Eywind> apparently Temple of the Kings, Exchange of the Spirit, Ring of Destruction, CED, and DMoC also got errataed
[03:55:33] <StrykerVylon> Yup.
[03:55:37] <wobniaR> That would explain why they also got unlimited
[03:56:01] <wobniaR> Well ring of destruction is at 1
[03:56:37] *** AFK|Vigilant_Watch is now known as Vigilant_Watch
[03:56:45] <StrykerVylon> #Stratosto1pls
[03:56:58] <wobniaR> Stratos was at 1 for a long time
[03:56:59] <Eywind> I mean CED isn't -significantly- worst 
[03:57:03] <Eywind> worse*
[03:57:28] <wobniaR> They actually banned both morphing jars too which makes win by 0 cards to draw almost impossible
[03:57:38] <StrykerVylon> wobniaR: They made a new jar card.
[03:57:47] <wobniaR> Is it as good as morphing jar?
[03:57:53] <Eywind> morphing jar #42
[03:58:01] <wobniaR> Toss your deck, you lose the game
[03:58:08] <wobniaR> Literally toss your deck
[03:58:11] <Eywind> yup

[03:58:57] <wobniaR> Nope
[03:59:04] <Eywind> but it's 3000 DEF
[03:59:08] <Eywind> that's enough to stop a Blue-Eyes White Dragon attack!
[03:59:15] <wobniaR> But not Exodia
[03:59:17] <wobniaR> 0/10
[03:59:23] <StrykerVylon> It's a nice tech to the Sibyll deck.
[03:59:26] <Eywind> isn't that what the last abil does? :P
[03:59:31] <StrykerVylon> Like really nice.
[04:00:19] <StrykerVylon> Cause one of their cards summons cards facedown as long as it's a Flip monster and another card and return cards to facedown.
[04:01:23] <wobniaR> Yeah but that card doesn't toss your opponents hand and make them draw 5 cards like the old morphing jar does
[04:01:41] <wobniaR> Then spam books to flip and deck them out
