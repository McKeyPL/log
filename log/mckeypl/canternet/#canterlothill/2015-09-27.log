[00:00:05] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> State school?
[00:00:12] <LetsEatHay> haha that promo with Photo Finish in it XD...
[00:00:19] <RandomNinja> I dunno, this is what wikipedia tells me
[00:00:21] <wobniaR> It's mandatory schooling for everyone under a certain age
[00:00:45] <wobniaR> I think the max age for high school is like 20 something and goes up to 25 if you're special ed
[00:01:09] <RandomNinja> also the word school gets weirder the more you read it
[00:01:22] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> School
[00:01:23] <wobniaR> It's funded by the government and free
[00:01:25] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Sucks
[00:01:32] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Its free here
[00:01:32] <wobniaR> Private and boarding school are stuff you pay for
[00:01:36] <RandomNinja> "The term public school refers to a group of older, more expensive and exclusive fee-paying private independent secondary schools in England and Wales, which cater primarily for children aged between 13 and 18. Traditionally," - Wiki
[00:01:47] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> And theyre insanely expensive
[00:01:58] <wobniaR> Yeah so public schooling in the UK is private schooling in the US
[00:02:06] <RandomNinja> from what I can tell
[00:02:38] <SkippeZ_ShadoW> Public school from the uk opinion is not payed for

[16:03:25] <Hamtramck> EQG1 was a magical girl about a horse that turned into a human so she could teach her friends how to turn into furries and defeat satan.
