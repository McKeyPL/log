[00:33:09] <Eywind> me too
[00:33:31] <Eywind> I even stayed up late to do a write-up for the Roan Kickstarter
[00:33:38] <Eywind> http://canterlothill.com/blog/hill/2015/08/24/roan-tabletop-rpg-kickstarter/ you know, this thing I wrote
[00:33:40] <DinkyBot>  [  Roan Tabletop RPG Kickstarter! | Canterlot Hill ]
[00:33:42] <Eywind> with pictures and stuff
[00:33:45] <wobniaR> Oh hey a thing
[00:34:18] <MikeM> Some nice art with that game.
[00:34:18] <Eywind> that the dev group tweeted about and CLH retweeted before I tagged it as front page cuz I wanted approval from them lol
[00:34:23] <Eywind> oh definitely MikeM
[00:34:43] <Eywind> It's the game I'd like to campaign with people for a more casual campaign
[00:35:10] <Eywind> the engine is more about RPing instead of hardcore munchkining
[00:36:02] <Eywind> although the latter is definitely more fun to prepare for, it's a different environment
[00:36:10] <wobniaR> If I was to play a tabletop that's what I'd be more interesting in, if I want to grind for gear I'll play a MMO with RNG engines instead of dice rolling
[00:36:18] *** Quits: Fantasma (Iceman@Darkhorse21) (Quit: quit)
[00:36:28] <wobniaR> Or a single player RPG
[00:36:33] <Eywind> yea
[00:36:49] <MikeM> So could you say it's more on the social aspect than the technical?
[00:36:50] <Eywind> again unless Snap_Shot wanted to DM and make impossible campaigns everyone dies in every week
[00:36:57] <Eywind> yeah MikeM
[00:37:06] <MikeM> That sounds kinda fun.
[00:37:13] <Snap_Shot> hmm?
[00:37:17] <Eywind> they use a system where instead of counting rolls, you just have 'success' dice
[00:37:25] <Eywind> like you roll a d6 and either it's a 1 or 0
[00:37:36] <MikeM> We were talking about a game called Roan, Snap_Shot 
[00:37:46] <Eywind> maybe it's like "you need 4/6 to succeed" so I'd roll 6 dice and if four came up even or something I'd succeed
[00:37:59] <Eywind> and if you roleplay well the DM gives you chips you can use later for additional dice
[00:38:39] <Eywind> and they have like an 'average' roll feature, where it's kinda like autobattle in fighting games
[00:38:39] <scootaloo> Eywind: <3
[00:38:49] <Eywind> won't be a critical success every time, but you'll at least pass most rolls
[00:39:00] <Eywind> or well be able to pass a lot of easier rolls

[03:04:52] <Glowing_Whooves> never had a problem since I started using it almost a decade ago
[03:05:24] <EM-C> Then just out of nowhere suddenly yesterday every time I told it to run a virus scan it would go up to about 20% and reboot the computer.

[03:35:47] <EM-C> Of course this one is closer to Kipling than Disney's was, but any time Kaa isn't one of Mowgli's three mentors you're not being true to Kipling.

[21:55:10] <EM-C> I just want it to let me assess that page.
[21:55:22] <Flurshy> it might not let you do that
[21:55:37] <Flurshy> a lot of antivirus programs also function as "you can't pirate this" programs
[21:55:45] <EM-C> It has an "exclusion" option and I've entered the web address, but it still won't let me access it.
[21:56:01] <EM-C> I don't know what to do.  I have to have an antivirus program.
[21:56:11] <Flurshy> you could disable it for 10 minutes according to this page
[21:56:14] <EM-C> And I want to be able to read the comics at yayponies.
[21:56:21] <EM-C> Hold on.
[21:56:22] <Flurshy> by the sound of it you can't do both
[21:56:41] <EM-C> AVG protected me from viruses AND let me read the comics on yayponies.
[21:56:46] <Flurshy> read the second thing on the page I linnked
[21:56:50] <EM-C> Why did it have to go haywire???
[21:56:58] <Flurshy> you'll want to disable the web shield
[21:57:33] <Flurshy> see what I linked. it provides instructions on how to do this
[21:57:54] <EM-C> Hold on.  I'm checking it out.
[21:58:05] <EM-C> Why did this have to happen?  Everything was going so smoothly.
[21:58:36] <Flurshy> did you actually try uninstalling and re-installing AVG before you gave up on it?
[21:59:40] <Cloud_Zephyr> :O youtube has a twitch replacement now
[21:59:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> is a*

[22:00:47] <EM-C> Thank you so much, Flurshy!
[22:01:00] <Flurshy> mhm
[22:01:05] <EM-C> I just wish I could still use my beloved AVG.  I have no idea why it suddenly went crazy.
[22:01:15] <Flurshy> did you try reinstalling it?

[22:01:35] <Flurshy> and also, maybe it was some other program you had recently installed interfering with it
[22:01:36] <EM-C> I uninstalled and reinstalled it a zillion different times.  The same stupid thing kept happening.
[22:01:57] <EM-C> I think it finally picked up an update that won't let it work on WindowsXP any more.
[22:02:16] <Flurshy> that... DOES explain things.
[22:02:22] <pony153> hi
[22:02:50] <EM-C> Maybe when the 2016 version comes out it will work again.  But since Monday it just refuses to perform a scan without rebooting the computer.
