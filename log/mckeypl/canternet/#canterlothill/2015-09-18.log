[18:02:25] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> Thats when I found out I was ancient
[18:03:00] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> But I want to get back in the loop ^^
[18:03:09] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> thanks I will check out this list of musicians I have now
[18:03:19] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> Did anyone hear about SoGreatAndPowerful?
[18:03:19] <wobniaR> There's a lot of artists, new and old still making horse themed music
[18:03:31] <wobniaR> Sgap is done as far as i know
[18:04:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> this is some nice stolen music
[18:05:18] <wobniaR> Aviators still makes music, and like Cloud_Zephyr said jayb releases a horse track once in a while
[18:05:37] <wobniaR> I don't have an updated list on me so yeah
[18:05:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> outside of pony music: anjunabeats has stopped going downhill
[18:06:08] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> SoGreatAndPowerful was gone already even when I was in the loop
[18:06:20] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> and they archived his stuff

[18:07:56] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> Yea thats right
[18:08:08] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> I'm in love with SoGreatAndPowerful - PinkiePieSwear
[18:08:14] <wobniaR> if you wanna get technical, the whole fandom is a cult, it's just not something there's a blood rites ritual for
[18:08:23] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> And when he deleted all of his videos I was shocked
[18:08:27] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> I had no chance to check out the others
[18:08:29] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> sooo
[18:08:36] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> thats something I will be all over
[18:08:42] <wobniaR> Pps still has his youtube channel up
[18:08:50] <EQI_BattlefieldBro> But it feels weird to listen to music if the musician is not standing behind his work anymore
