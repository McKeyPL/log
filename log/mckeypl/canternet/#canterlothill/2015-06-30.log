[14:26:56] <Flurshy> gunna go get an LG G4
[14:26:56] <Cloud_Zephyr> i get an upgrade tomorrow :D
[14:27:02] <RandomNinja> Yeah slow transfer is teh worst
[14:27:16] <RandomNinja> Having lots of tiny files doesn't help either
[14:27:46] <Flurshy> I might should get a bigger SD card at some point
[14:27:51] <Flurshy> this is an 8GB card
[14:28:00] <RandomNinja> 32GB master race
[14:28:00] * Cloud_Zephyr shares his vinyls with teh neighbours :3
[14:28:15] <RandomNinja> Cloud Zephyr: unlegal
[14:28:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> lul
[14:28:40] <Flurshy> cards cost money though
[14:28:40] <Cloud_Zephyr> true i dont have a license for them to hear it
[14:28:45] <Flurshy> and I want to spend money on other stuff
[14:29:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> im getting 32gb. I'll be able to fit 2/3 of my library on my phone now :D
[14:29:40] <Flurshy> my library's only 3gb so far
[14:30:03] <RandomNinja> Isn't a 32GB μSD like $10?
[14:30:22] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[14:30:37] <Flurshy> is it?
[14:30:44] <Flurshy> god I'm behind on storage prices
[14:31:07] <RandomNinja> Around 13 on Amazon, yeah
[14:32:35] <Flurshy> okay, added that to my list of purchases
[14:33:36] <Flurshy> I've got a pretty good paycheck to look forward to, so am buying some things
[14:33:50] <RandomNinja> Sweet
[14:34:02] <Flurshy> like I'm gunna go ahead and order a rain resistant case for le new phone, and I guess I'll order that SD card
[14:34:09] * RandomNinja applies greek to Cloud_Zephyr

[14:35:14] <DinkyBot> Mmm! Thank you, momma!
[14:35:46] <Flurshy> :P
[14:36:09] <Flurshy> Cloud_Zephyr: whenever I finally get my first PA speaker all our neighbors are gunna dislike me
[14:36:17] <Flurshy> even with a ton of trees between houses
[14:36:40] <RandomNinja> Flurshy acquire open back headpones
[14:36:46] <Flurshy> heeellll no
[14:36:47] <RandomNinja> Also Cloud_Zephyr
[14:37:00] <Flurshy> actually I could probably do that. I only use over-ear headphones at home
[14:37:00] <Cloud_Zephyr> lul
[14:37:13] <Flurshy> maybe get the audiotechnica m50 some time this year and sell my bose
[14:37:42] <Flurshy> oh, I thought m50 was $200
[14:38:17] <RandomNinja> m50 are closed
[14:38:25] <Flurshy> still
[14:38:28] <Flurshy> high quality
[14:38:35] <RandomNinja> ad500/700 are the open ones
[14:39:04] <Flurshy> but how do they compare?
[14:39:15] <Flurshy> I imagine open-back has clearer mids and highs but less bass
[14:39:20] <RandomNinja> Also you probably want the m50X because removable cable
[14:39:31] <Flurshy> that'll about do it.
[14:41:06] <Flurshy> see I thought the m50 were still $200 and such :P
[14:41:22] <Flurshy> what's the go-to for sennheiser?
[14:41:54] <RandomNinja> HD558 or 598
[14:42:51] <Cloud_Zephyr> :O another spider
[14:43:03] <Flurshy> ehhhh I don't like the look. hmmm...
[14:43:19] <Flurshy> this isn't the best pic though
[14:43:45] <RandomNinja> To generalise a lot, closed back headphones are like being in a smaller room: you're more in the centre and the sound is close to you
[14:43:53] <Flurshy> does the 598 only come in that ugly beige?
[14:44:04] <Flurshy> ahhhh this bass ahhhhhhh
[14:44:16] <Flurshy> my eeaaaars
[14:44:37] <Flurshy> you know those times where the bass just feels like someone is pushing down on your eardrums?
[14:44:38] <RandomNinja> Open back is like being in a large concert hall or outdoors, things can actually sound far away, not just muted
[14:45:05] <Flurshy> hmmm... I may want to go open-back then. sounds like it'd be better for movie watching
[14:45:22] <RandomNinja> Which is ideal for things like classical music, jazz, and more melodic metal
[14:45:30] <RandomNinja> Also gaming for positioning
[14:45:39] <Flurshy> well, but then I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now, which is blast music while others are asleep
[14:45:43] <Flurshy> closed back it shall be
[14:45:55] <RandomNinja> True
[14:46:11] <Flurshy> does the HD598 pair only come in ugly beige?
[14:46:11] <RandomNinja> Also yes I think HD598 only come in brown
[14:46:21] <RandomNinja> Hd558 come in black though
[14:46:32] * Flurshy gags
[14:46:52] <Flurshy> it looks like the interior of a car... from the 90s
[14:46:57] <RandomNinja> Meh, I like it
[14:47:09] <Flurshy> think I'll go for the m50x
[14:47:09] <RandomNinja> Looks classic
[14:47:47] <Flurshy> solid pair and not too expensive
[14:47:59] <Flurshy> hell, they're really not even more expensive than my current pair
[14:48:14] <RandomNinja> If you're mostly going for EDM it's a good choice
[14:48:20] <Flurshy> indeed
[14:48:27] <Flurshy> also, may keep these Bose as a backup pair
[14:48:48] <Flurshy> and for sound booth monitors
[14:49:32] <Flurshy> I won't get them for a while though
[14:49:38] <Flurshy> not till I'm done with my PA system
[14:49:49] <RandomNinja> A well mixed album that uses lot of soundspace (say, Dark Side Of The Moon) on open back headphones is absolute magic though
[14:50:20] <RandomNinja> Also, Into The Electric Castle
[14:51:23] <Flurshy> possibly in the future
[14:52:03] <RandomNinja> Yeah start with m50
[14:52:48] <Flurshy> or I could get the HD 800 :P

[14:53:51] <Flurshy> dad's fixing breakfast :D
[14:54:47] <RandomNinja> If you go HD800 you'll ruin pretty much everything below $500 :P
[14:54:52] <Flurshy> :P
[14:55:05] <Flurshy> do people actually buy that pair?
[14:57:17] <RandomNinja> Yeah
[14:57:46] <RandomNinja> HD800 is basically The high-end benchmark
[14:59:12] <RandomNinja> The other would be Audeze LCD series
[14:59:24] <Flurshy> true enough. also, Audeze? I haven't heard that brand

[18:37:49] <Flurshy> verizon removed theme customization
[18:37:52] <Flurshy> so I'm probably gunna root
[18:37:55] <Flurshy> on the G4
