[08:39:24] <Nintendo4DS> it was active about a year ago
[08:39:38] <Eywind> the everfree radio chat hasn't been active since I started in mid 2013
[08:39:49] <Eywind> it might have redirectred to everfreenetwork
[08:40:16] <Nintendo4DS> probably
[08:40:43] <Eywind> Realistically though, if you want something from the Everfree days, it's probably either a. not around or b. on Canterlot Hill
[08:41:39] <Nintendo4DS> I guess I was just looking for an mlp radio stream
[08:41:45] <Nintendo4DS> probably one here
[08:41:48] <Eywind> Well yeah canterlot hill has a radio
[08:41:59] <Eywind> http://canterlothill.com/includes/popup.php direct link is there
[08:42:58] <Nintendo4DS> so the radio's still called everfree radio
[08:43:01] <Eywind> for now
[08:43:16] <Eywind> We got all the assets, the music database, etc. from Everfree
[08:43:20] <Nintendo4DS> can't let the bumpers go to waste 
[08:43:37] <Eywind> Well they'll be gone at some point in the near future.  Sad, but it's a new step
[08:43:39] <Eywind> and we'll be getting new ones
[08:44:11] <Eywind> Even Dusty still facehooves when he hears about the "new show Stay Brony My Friends on Everfree Network" bumper lol
[08:44:42] <Nintendo4DS> only thing I know dusty for is the bronycon incident

[08:45:34] <Eywind> gets VA and top-shelf fandom guests every week heh
[08:46:08] <MikeM> New one coming up soon, I think.
[08:46:19] <Eywind> Also gets a bunch of money towards deserving charities
[08:47:23] <Eywind> But I guess depending on how you look at the fandom you can remember an individual as however you want

[09:00:29] <Eywind> Not that you have to believe the same, but I'd say 'popular' consensus places it as one of the most/the most disliked episode, at least early
[09:00:30] <Nintendo4DS> the only episode I really find disagreeable is pinkie keen
[09:00:45] <Eywind> Spike at your Service was an awful characterization of multiple characters

[09:03:56] <MikeM> Yup. Our ponies aren't perfect. But the show is great. Anybody who wants to get total spriritual/psychologic fulfillment from the show should think about the relationship between McDonalds and total nutrition.

[17:11:04] <wobniaR> What's your recommendation for a good apple laptop?
[17:11:14] <KooK> An Asus, of course
[17:11:27] <Cloud_Zephyr> wut for?
[17:11:28] <KooK> Half the price, double the performance.
[17:11:42] <wobniaR> Mostly basic usage
[17:11:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> probably a macbook air then
[17:11:54] <wobniaR> And ironically, using microsoft applications in OSX
[17:12:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> It's a matter of personal opinion but i prefer apple devices for laptops
[17:12:09] <KooK> Yeah, have fun with that
[17:12:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> mainly because of the build quality and the trackpads
[17:12:26] <wobniaR> The microsoft office suite is available for osx so yeah

[17:13:33] <KooK> Windows programs on OSX?  I've had nothing but headaches with them
[17:13:52] <KooK> well, programs designed for Microsoft in the first place.
[17:14:07] <wobniaR> They work, and like I said I'm not the one who prefers appul here but they do
[17:14:58] <Cloud_Zephyr> they could always get parallels desktop

[17:16:12] <RandomNinja> not carryable, but easily moved
[17:16:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> parallels desktops is a program that lets you run windows side by side with mac
