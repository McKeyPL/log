[22:33:46] <thereallynewmop12100_> Pony_2163: Because your name is miss. 
[22:34:17] <Pony_2163> is that really so?
[22:34:24] <thereallynewmop12100_> Pony_2163: Yes...
[22:34:53] <Pony_2163> hum suspicious!
[22:35:03] <thereallynewmop12100_> Pony_2163: Later.
[22:35:54] <Pony_2163> how do you know my name actually?
[22:36:10] <Eywind> You don't have a hostmask and you're probably the only person that uses telnet

[22:36:44] <Eywind> Plus if you're the only person active at a time and talk the same, it's gonna be pretty obvious whatever your name is.
[22:36:52] <Pony_2163> nuuuu
[22:37:01] <thereallynewmop12100_> Eywind: I agree with you. 
[22:37:09] <thereallynewmop12100_> (Almost)
[22:37:20] <Eywind> It's factual, nothing to agree or disagree.
[22:37:29] <Eywind> Not that I really know the actual basis behind it is true or not, but eh.
[22:39:40] <wobniaR> Unless there's another person here with a belgian ip address probably not
[22:40:01] <Pony_2163> talk the same? eywind  do i really write so diffrent  than the others?
