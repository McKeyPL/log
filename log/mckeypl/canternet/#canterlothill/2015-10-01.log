[02:10:43] <LunaticHell> hohoho, he's a fun one, I can say that without any reservation.
[02:11:28] <LunaticHell> He doesn't seem, however, like the perfect canidate for the office or the president of the US of the A, though.
[02:12:00] <LunaticHell> Not like there ARE any serious good canidates to begin with, to be honest.
[02:12:14] <Fantasma> I dunno about him.
[02:12:54] <LunaticHell> I'm afraid it could come done to either him or Hilary Clinton and the majority would go "lesser evil", if you know what I mean.
[02:13:12] <Fantasma> I'm pretty sure Hilarity Clinton won't win the nomination
[02:13:40] <MikeM> It's 13 months to the election. Lots of time for wheat and chaff.
[02:14:11] <LunaticHell> Yes, some things tend to come out of way left field, especially in the times of election.
[02:14:25] <LunaticHell> F.e. Obama.
[02:14:39] <Fantasma> But, I think Sanders has a real chance at winning, something that people really like.  And that scares me.
[02:14:50] <LunaticHell> That was not a political pun, by the way.

[02:18:34] <LunaticHell> Agreed, he's rich enough on his own.
[02:18:58] <MikeM> I'd rather talk booze. Or pretty ponies.
[02:19:03] <LunaticHell> But I want to add, and partially warn, in one regard.
[02:19:17] <Regulus> Yes please 
[02:19:22] <LunaticHell> Honesty is a good policy, but honesty is the LEAST you can do.
[02:19:31] <Fantasma> But certainly not the most.
[02:19:37] <Regulus> Politics are awfully divisive 
[02:19:56] <LunaticHell> Yeah, I kinda have to agree, even when drunk.
[02:19:58] <Fantasma> I don't think so.

[15:57:03] <RandomNinja> Nuuh
[15:57:18] <Spectra_Borealis> haha. Well, either way, I will avoid it anyways. I will certainly have a drink of wine or two, maybe go have some beer with friends, but never get intoxicated.
[15:57:23] <Flurshy> if I get drunk it's going to be with someone to safely escort me home
[15:58:21] <Spectra_Borealis> haha. well, I have seen drunk people. if they want something, they WANT IT. They say, give me my keys, you say no, you are drunk, they say GIVE ME MY KEYS! you say no you are drunk, they murder you and steal their keys and drive home and die.
[15:58:34] <RandomNinja> Unless you're competing at fairly high level you can get reasonably drunk on a weekly basis without much effect
[15:58:48] <Flurshy> beer belly though
