[02:17:12] <BLame> Hey guys!
[02:17:24] <Screwball> 3 pages of what?!
[02:17:32] <Flarecobra> Ugh. Ads. And I have adblock. 
[02:17:36] <DirtyKitten> @ Flarecobra, I was thinking the same thing. Like if Rarity and Steven had a spinoff on PBS with it being a kids based show, being that Tabby and Lee both are on PBS, as well as Claire Corlett
[02:17:48] <Moon_Solace> Flarecobra: You might have a virus then
[02:18:02] <Flarecobra> No, it was Ustream
[02:18:10] <StandingLeaf> Gummy is best philosogator
[02:18:42] <Sonny_Starbrite> No ads here.  I have Adblock Plus, Adblock Plus Pop-up Addon, and Element Hiding Helper for Adblock Plus.  NO Ads!  8-)

[19:05:10] <ynoP> It has nothing to it except scale right now
[19:05:17] <ynoP> Scale and visuals
[19:05:20] <wobniaR> And that's why you don't pre-order kids
[19:06:23] <ynoP> They should rent out the framewwork of No Man's Sky to game developers so someone can make a real game with it, where you actually do things and explore things that are worth something
[19:07:38] <wobniaR> They won't
[19:09:21] <ynoP> The generated planets are great, but there's no game... There won't be enemies or adversaries, or characters, and maybe not even a story at all, so the only thing left to do with the game is make it a fun multiplayer competitive game, but they said it won't be like that either, so basically, they've confirmed that the game will not have anything in it
[19:09:50] <wobniaR> Pretty much
[19:11:23] <RandomNinja> so basically like all the other survival games?
