[03:10:41] <One-Trick> so that new win10 update wont update
[03:11:09] <One-Trick> because i refuse to keep \program files on the c: and have it set up as a junction point instead
[03:11:35] <wobniaR> Windows does not like change
[03:12:09] <Flurshy> hey One-Trick I need an opinion
[03:12:17] <Flurshy> this mixer has no fans but it does have vent openings
[03:12:31] <Flurshy> do you think this foam is gunna make it overheat if I run it in the case?
[03:12:48] <One-Trick> it likely has MOSFETs, they get hot but dont require fans
[03:12:54] <One-Trick> you need to make sure it can breath
[03:13:11] <One-Trick> MOSFETs are transistor op amplifiers
[03:13:14] <Flurshy> think about a centimeter of space around the vents should do it?
[03:13:22] <One-Trick> the hotter they get, the more hum you will get from the power supply
[03:13:29] <One-Trick> it should, yeah
[03:13:36] <One-Trick> it just needs to be able to move with convection
[03:13:44] <Flurshy> ah
[03:14:17] <One-Trick> you CAN get some 5v micro fans and force air flow and run it off an xlr output
[03:14:23] <One-Trick> i would do that, but its not required
[03:16:34] <Flurshy> I just want to be able to safely operate it inside the case
[03:16:53] <Flurshy> because coolness factor, and because that keeps the case from wasting space during a gig
[03:17:02] <Flurshy> from being wasted space*
[03:17:14] <Flurshy> mostly because I like the idea of it really
[03:19:48] <One-Trick> the case is a lot larger than the mixer- how does it save space?
[03:19:55] <One-Trick> just put the case under the deck
[03:20:32] <Flurshy> this is true
[03:20:50] <Flurshy> I couldn't actually find one that closely matched the size of the mixer >.<
[03:22:24] <Flurshy> at least it means I have a place to put microphone or other sensitive equipment too maybe
[03:22:32] <One-Trick> if you need forced air cooling, use this: http://www.amazon.com/Evercool-25mm-10mm-5Volt-Fan/dp/B00295C20U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1452046931&sr=8-3&keywords=5v+micro+fan

[03:23:04] <One-Trick> you can run that off an xlr socket with 40v turned on (mic setting)
[03:23:14] <One-Trick> make sure you ground it, though

[03:24:24] <Flurshy> not fancy enough
[03:24:39] <Flurshy> I do hope I didn't go overboard with this case >.>
[03:24:42] <One-Trick> well, its just 5v, you can just use a usb
[03:25:43] <Flurshy> well, with that in the bag (case?) I think I'm gunna go play vidya

[23:27:23] <Unixkitty> That makes sense :P
[23:27:41] <Unixkitty> It's 1:27am, braining is slow!
[23:28:01] * Unixkitty applies late night tea and sandwich to RandomNinja 
[23:28:29] <RandomNinja> nom
[23:28:41] * RandomNinja applies bolognese to Unixkitty 
[23:29:01] <Unixkitty> Way too late for that, but I take it you're having it?
[23:29:38] <RandomNinja> too late? 1:30 am? naah
[23:30:10] <Unixkitty> Unless you're not planning on going to bed in the next two hours, I suppose
[23:30:42] <RandomNinja> I mean I slept from like 3:30 to 10 today
[23:30:55] <thereallynewmop12100> RandomNinja: Go to bed
[23:31:09] <RandomNinja> it's 23:30. pls.
[23:31:51] <Unixkitty> 3:30 am to 10am?
[23:31:55] <RandomNinja> yes
[23:32:03] <Unixkitty> And that was enough for you?
[23:32:22] <RandomNinja> I woke up naturally, so I assume yes
[23:32:43] <Unixkitty> Goodness, I honestly wish that much sleep was enough for me
[23:32:53] <Unixkitty> I sleep at least 10 hours if I undisturbed
[23:32:55] <RandomNinja> I slept longer the night before though, so I guess it averages out to like 7-7.5 hours
[23:33:33] <Unixkitty> I blame big city atmosphere, in all it's meanings
[23:33:52] <RandomNinja> I shall eat, finish cleaning, shower, then bed
[23:36:20] * RandomNinja boops Unixkitty 
[23:36:25] <RandomNinja> tomorrow is deadlift day, halp
[23:36:39] <thereallynewmop12100> !t deadlift
[23:36:40] <DinkyBot> But like deadlift, squats, benchpress
[23:36:53] <RandomNinja> y'all should do those ^
[23:37:14] <Unixkitty> I thought you enjoyed all those things, RandomNinja :P
[23:37:24] * Unixkitty boops RandomNinja's nose back
[23:37:41] <RandomNinja> yeah but that doesn't mean it's very heavy and tiring :P
[23:37:53] <Unixkitty> isn't*
[23:38:26] <Unixkitty> Be careful at least :P
[23:38:37] <RandomNinja> also I switched program, instead of <10 every 5 days it's 15+ heavy plus 50 light lifts
[23:38:45] <RandomNinja> per week*

[23:48:13] * Unixkitty keeps one and sells the rest
[23:48:18] <RandomNinja> Thaum is a SI-unit of magic power in some book, can't remember which
[23:48:39] <Unixkitty> Thaumaturgy is science about magic
[23:48:46] <Unixkitty> Thaumaturgist is the scientist
[23:48:51] <RandomNinja> true
[23:49:00] <RandomNinja> ah right Discworld

[23:49:44] <Unixkitty> Also I keep hearing about this Discworld or Discoworld, but I've never bothered to actually look up what that is
[23:49:49] <MikeM> Howdy, mop.
[23:49:52] * RandomNinja applies a 4-stack of foxes to MikeM 
[23:50:03] <MikeM> That picture hurt my brain.
[23:50:11] <Unixkitty> Your brain sounds weak

[23:50:27] * MikeM looks at more foxes to attain gainz
[23:51:40] * RandomNinja boops MikeM on the nose
[23:51:45] <RandomNinja> !t gainz
[23:51:46] <DinkyBot> I blame Infinite, for he brings gainz eternal
[23:51:49] * MikeM scrunchies
[23:52:01] <RandomNinja> does he bring Infinite gainz?
[23:52:03] * Unixkitty applies Infinite to RandomNinja 
[23:52:07] <RandomNinja> hooray
[23:52:17] <Unixkitty> Make sure not to overgainz haha
[23:52:33] <RandomNinja> yes my wallet can't handle that
[23:52:46] <Unixkitty> What does your wallet have to do with that? :P
[23:52:58] <RandomNinja> buying larger clothes
[23:53:14] <Unixkitty> As if that would be the only problem
[23:53:16] <RandomNinja> also protein and general food

[23:56:51] <RandomNinja> madness!
[23:57:37] <MikeM> Imposter
[23:57:47] <Regulus> Don't stack foxes!
[23:57:51] * Regulus flails 
[23:58:00] <MikeM> They stack automatically.
[23:58:05] <MikeM> They're self-stackers
