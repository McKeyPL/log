[01:21:46] <ynoP> You need to download more Ghz for your CPU
[01:22:01] <pinkpearlapple> never use ad blocker on a laptop....especially one you DONT OWN
[01:22:04] <wobniaR> Adblocker actually speeds up your computer
[01:22:15] <ynoP> Except when it doesn't
[01:22:20] <pinkpearlapple> not on this one. it slows the dang internet window down
[01:22:22] <Hamtramck> Which ad blocker?
[01:22:26] <Hamtramck> I used Adblock Plus and it works fine
[01:22:33] <Hamtramck> although rarely causes intermittent input lag on certain sites
[01:22:38] <wobniaR> That is most likely a problem with your computer that you already have
[01:22:38] <pinkpearlapple> i used ad block plus
[01:22:48] <Hamtramck> Did you do something weird with the filters
[01:22:49] <pinkpearlapple> its my mothers computer
[01:23:02] <Hamtramck> My laptop isn't turrbly fast either
[01:23:25] <pinkpearlapple> i cant do  anything with it. i had to beg 3 weeks just to be allowed to download ad blocker and before it was working fine
[01:24:14] <pinkpearlapple> it went from "working fine" to "Slower than  water in mid winter"
[01:24:32] <ynoP> Maybe there was problems installing things in general beforehand, hence the aprehension
[01:25:02] <pinkpearlapple>  the installing thing worked,as far as i can tell. no problems. 
[01:25:27] <ynoP> Is it just the Chrome add on?

[01:26:48] <pinkpearlapple> internet in general
[01:27:09] <ynoP> It's on Chrome? or a different browser?
[01:27:13] <pinkpearlapple> chrome
[01:27:18] <ynoP> Okay
[01:27:44] <ynoP> I think it might be fixed if you reset Chrome settings completely then reinstall the add on
[01:28:03] <pinkpearlapple> oh ok
[01:28:15] <ynoP> You'll have to set your homepage again and reinstall all your add ons but it should be good

[01:38:05] <ynoP> If you never fully closed Chrome the reset may not have taken full effect yet

[02:53:07] <StatManDan> It needs to stop. Now.
[02:53:09] <pinkpearlapple> its a serious issue
[02:53:12] <Caper---CoolBreeze> was bullied in high school for my disability-appearance
[02:53:18] <SpikeFiremane> I hate bullying! I have done the Bullying Panel with Dustyfor this reason
[02:53:18] <ricardofr-200> No offence, this bullies are just a reflection of the education some people give to their kids
[02:53:22] <Marbi-Z> It's much easier to ignore Bullying online as all you have to do is Report/Block them.
[02:53:41] <pinkpearlapple> i was bullied because i liked drawing and staying by myself then hanging out with others
[02:53:45] <ricardofr-200> Marbi-Z sometimes it not that easy
[02:53:48] <Caper---CoolBreeze> that's a panel i'd join in
[02:53:52] <Marbi-Z> Once I learnd to tell the teachers I was never bullied in School.
[02:54:05] <RedCard> It's important to me too
[02:54:16] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> Fez hat!
[02:54:21] <StandingLeaf> I'm presently working on a web site for informing everyone about bullying, the possible solutions and some supports from the fandom.

[02:55:28] <Marbi-Z> ricardofr-200 If the bully can get your actual Identity then it can be a problem but most internet trolls are not tech savy.
[02:55:30] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> it did kind of buy me breathing room but I ended up moving
[02:55:34] <Screwball> I was shocked when I found an Artist proof Sombra comic arch in the shop. They said it was the only one they had and I GOT IT! 
[02:55:58] <Caper---CoolBreeze> dont have physical ability to fight back
[02:55:58] <Flarecobra> Yeah... I was bullied in middle school myself... I didn't really fight back too much, but when I did, I did it in a manner that did not get me into trouble at school
[02:56:00] <ricardofr-200> Marbi-Z thankfully they're not
[02:56:00] <Muffin_Spectacles> I'm looking forward to the end of Season 5...for...Reasons!
[02:56:02] <pinkpearlapple> i want that issue!!! i wasnt able to find one!!!!
[02:56:04] <StandingLeaf> Crazy_Rainbow_Dash TRue. 
[02:56:28] <Flarecobra> Namely because I actually punched out the bully, then casually walked onto the bus. 
[02:56:44] <pinkpearlapple> cool!
[02:56:54] <Flarecobra> On the final day of school before summer break
[02:56:58] <Screwball> No spoilers, but the ending to #2 of 4 Sombra comic arch was sooooooo twisted
[02:57:10] <pinkpearlapple> ^
[02:57:17] <thereallynewmop12100> I got bullied a lot at glendale high school
[02:57:23] <ricardofr-200> good to know you guys are not like me, Im the kind of guy who explodes almost for nothing
[02:57:25] <pinkpearlapple> i know. it was kinda weird.....i need to reed more
[02:57:27] <StatManDan> Rule of thumb for main comic series:  Wait until I get all the parts of the arc.
[02:57:40] <RedCard> Screwy!
[02:57:44] <Marbi-Z> I used to get bullied too until I got there names and told the teachers.

[03:39:33] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> awesome I just need to collect so placids real fast
[03:39:43] <Screwball> ahh, I know that struggle
[03:40:35] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> gotta sit here waiting for  updates I had to repair the entire thing today
[03:40:53] <Screwball> I can't wait for update 18, so much amazing is coming out!!
[03:41:14] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> what are they bringing? I kind of barely got back into it still technically a noob
[03:42:12] <Screwball> new maps, an orokin base built right on Earth's moon, it's going to have a HUGE story mode with cinematic trailers, new skills, new warframe, they are getting rid of void keys, so the void is free to get in to (rumor), and so much more
[03:42:30] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> dang nice
[03:42:47] <Screwball> and hopefully, the Focus system.
[03:43:08] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> Some kind of seperate energy source?
[03:43:46] <Screwball> kinda. Rumor is it's like a Super Saiyan mode, where your warframe boosts in crazy power. The higher your mastery rank, the more powerful you become
[03:44:07] <Crazy_Rainbow_Dash> Oh dang that does sound nice
[03:44:38] <Screwball> they been planning it for years, but never did anything till now
