[15:47:20] <Unixkitty> Also not entirely related, my package manager is called "Homebrew"
[15:47:43] <RandomNinja> the goal is to have slightly above average chocolate and just a hint of  heat

[16:15:58] <RandomNinja> stupid alcohol laws
[16:16:06] <Regulus> We have beer. Lots of beer.
[16:16:29] <Regulus> Excessive amounts of beer.
[16:16:30] <RandomNinja> you also have the open container law
[16:16:48] <Regulus> This is true. We're not perfect. 
[16:17:08] <LostThoughts> What stupid alcohol laws?
[16:17:21] <RandomNinja> open container law = you're not allowed to drink in public
[16:17:47] <Regulus> Can't sell alcohol after 9pm or on Sunday in my state
[16:17:50] <LostThoughts> Uh it's cant drink in a car. Last I looked
[16:18:05] <RandomNinja> both
[16:18:11] <LostThoughts> We can't sell on Sunday in certain stores
[16:18:29] <Regulus> Generally speaking, you can't drink in public spaces unless they're established as suck.
[16:18:35] <Regulus> *such
[16:18:47] <LostThoughts> Well why would you drink in public? I have like 12 bars and lots of private areas I can do that in
[16:19:00] <Regulus> Bars, beer gardens, or exempt spaces
[16:19:12] <RandomNinja> maybe you're at a picnic
[16:19:19] <Regulus> Parks, concerts
[16:19:29] <RandomNinja> or you just want a cold beer on a hot day
[16:19:37] <Regulus> Exactly 
[16:19:38] <RandomNinja> note that drinking =/= getting wasted
[16:20:03] <LostThoughts> And why would I wanna get wasted? It dost help anything
[16:20:10] <Regulus> Europeans treat beer more like a standard beverage, so that's how it's treated.
[16:20:30] <Regulus> We treat it like a drug, so people abuse it.
[16:20:33] <RandomNinja> except scandinavia, which has a culture of getting wrecked on weekends
[16:20:41] <RandomNinja> this is slowly changing though, which is great
[16:21:41] <LostThoughts> Lol when I go to evefest is when I drink beer but that's it really
[16:21:56] <Regulus> Wish they'd update the laws over here
[16:22:12] <RandomNinja> Regulus, go to belgium :P
[16:22:16] <Regulus> Mostly just so we're not quite so ridiculous 
[16:22:21] <RandomNinja> more amazing beer than you could wish for
[16:22:52] <Regulus> I don't drink, but I'm for responsible and sensible regulations regarding alcohol
[16:22:54] <LostThoughts> Well I like not walking down the street and seeing beer everywhere
[16:23:02] <LostThoughts> Not seeing*
[16:23:30] <LostThoughts> Think how easy it would be for minors to get it!
[16:24:16] <Regulus> Oh my... how ever will we stop kids from drinking more than they already do :V
[16:25:33] <RandomNinja> oh joy
[16:25:46] <RandomNinja> one of the laundry room doors has stopped working
[16:25:58] <RandomNinja> incidentally one containing my laundry
[16:26:02] <LostThoughts> Well we ID like crazy so they don't get it from me!
[16:26:03] <Regulus> Best answer is to not sit there forbidding it, but rather education and encouraging health habits early, rather than keeping them from it for so long that when they turn 21 they go nuts and potentially cause themselves problems
[16:26:48] <RandomNinja> I'm convinced the best way to limit excessive underage drinking is to raise them to good drinking culture
[16:26:57] <Regulus> Exactly 
[16:27:11] <FruitNibbler> Bans never wurk!
[16:27:11] <Regulus> Education is always a good answer
[16:27:23] <FruitNibbler> Regulation and oversight does!
[16:27:35] * RandomNinja regulates FruitNibbler's cookie consumption
[16:28:06] <RandomNinja> also lying is a terrible idea
[16:28:10] <RandomNinja> see: D.A.R.E
[16:28:21] * FruitNibbler chants "transparency, education, regulation, oversight!"
[16:28:28] <LostThoughts> I don't know the people I live with brink a beer and turn into rage Monsters.
[16:28:54] <FruitNibbler> I should make my party
[16:29:06] <RandomNinja> the fruit party?
[16:29:23] <FruitNibbler> I'll call it "TEROR"
[16:29:32] <LostThoughts> Also I think the laws are more for the things like vodka then things like beer.
[16:29:49] <LostThoughts> Things with a large content.
[16:29:55] <RandomNinja> it's not hard to get smashed on beer
[16:29:58] <FruitNibbler> Transparency, Education, Registration, Oversight, Regulation
[16:30:11] <Regulus> Again, learning to be responsible with alcohol is better than regulation with no education. 
[16:30:22] <RandomNinja> especially now with the surge of delicious 10% bottles
[16:30:24] <FruitNibbler> I agree with you Regulus 
[16:30:34] <LostThoughts> Yeah but harder then when the thing your drinking has like 20% content
[16:30:46] <FruitNibbler> Things aren't that scary when people are aware of what they actually are
[16:30:53] <RandomNinja> that's what knowing your limits is for
[16:30:56] *** Quits: Flurshy (Flttrshy@TightRope.is.best.pony) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[16:30:58] <Regulus> ^
[16:31:01] <Regulus> yes
[16:31:05] <Regulus> Exactly 
[16:31:10] <FruitNibbler> Some danger that is a mystery sparks more fearmongering
[16:31:18] <RandomNinja> If I get smashed of 5 regular beers, drinking a bottle of Port probably is a bad idea
[16:31:24] <LostThoughts> Yeah I drink a Black Russian now and again but other then that I don't really drink
[16:31:48] <FruitNibbler> I can drink a bottle of vodka, and not get drunk
[16:32:01] <RandomNinja> 70?
[16:32:17] <FruitNibbler> Because I usually drink it with alcohol-neutralising tablets :3
[16:32:45] <FruitNibbler> That would be "theoretically" because I don't drink vodka
[16:33:21] <Regulus> Let's face it, when your policy is "No alcohol until you're 21", there's gonna be problems if that's all there is. If you educate about alcohol, teach about responsible drinking, and encourage healthy behaviors you're better off. 
[16:33:27] <FruitNibbler> I drink only martinini, baileys, ouzo, cocktails and beers
[16:34:01] <LostThoughts> Yeah my sister husband drank a entire bottle of vodka and was completely fine... 'Twas scary
[16:34:04] <FruitNibbler> Not selling alcohol to underaged is a good policy even with education
[16:34:20] <Regulus> This is true
[16:34:47] <LostThoughts> Yeah I think I heard about a lower from 21 to 19 bill a while back but it was cut down fast
[16:35:51] <Regulus> That's because it would need to be partnered with education, but that costs money.
[16:37:24] <LostThoughts> America? Money?
[16:37:43] <LostThoughts> Pff! What a silly notion!
[16:38:04] <LostThoughts> https://i.imgur.com/obiSzOd.jpg
[16:39:40] <RandomNinja> I have a friend who drank a case of beer within a few hours and still managed to have coherent discussion with a party guard
[16:39:50] <RandomNinja> it was described as "both impressive and terrifying"
[16:40:13] <FruitNibbler> That thing is incoherent
[16:40:26] * RandomNinja bops FruitNibbler 
[16:40:33] <FruitNibbler> It states that debt could pay itself somehow
[16:41:12] * Regulus applies cat costume to RandomNinja 
[16:41:18] * RandomNinja pones
[16:41:59] <LostThoughts> FruitNibbler it talking about the entire us "NATIONAL DEBT" that can pay that
[16:42:50] <FruitNibbler> How one debt can pay another???
[16:43:03] <FruitNibbler> It is a minus sum of money
[16:43:56] <FruitNibbler> Unless you do the (-10) - (-1) kind of thing with debts somehow
[16:44:21] <RandomNinja> that's not how math works
[16:44:26] <LostThoughts> The US  national debt and the consumer debt are different
[16:44:53] <Trildar> I think it means if they had all the money they have in debts, though that hypothetical doesn't really make much sense.
[16:45:00] <LostThoughts> So unless your calling the cunsumer debt the nation one then it does make since
