[19:45:49] <JockeTF> Hamtramck: Depends a bit on what's going on 56 FPS is a pretty odd number, so it may result in choppiness when crammed into something running at 60 FPS.
[19:46:10] <JockeTF> For example, playing a 56 FPS video on a monitor running at 60 FPS.
[19:46:25] <JockeTF> Now, if the monitor was running at 56 FPS that's a whole different thing.
[19:46:40] <JockeTF> Maybe some can, but it's unlikely.
[19:47:28] <FritzyBeat> c:
[19:47:59] <JockeTF> Note that even if the monitor appears to run at 56 FPS according to your computer, the monitor may be the thing that does the "cramming". :P
[19:48:52] <JockeTF> Using the same video and monitor frame rates can make a big difference. :)

[21:45:16] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> What's the difference between the ps 3 controller and the ps 4 controller? I mean, is the ps 4 controller any better than the ps 3 one?
[21:45:40] <Lrond> better battery maybe?
[21:46:09] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I consider buying a controller for my pc. Because aparently that's pretty useful in some games ^^
[21:46:35] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> And the ps 4 controller is not too much more expensive than the ps 3 one.
[21:46:36] <ChordCatcher> Oh look, an Eywind
[21:46:42] <Eywind> It is me
[21:46:52] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> But if there's no real difference, I don't really want to pay extra :p

[21:47:21] <Lrond> cant you use a ps3 controller for your ps4? Dumb question alarm
[21:47:23] <Ferexes> Helo?
[21:47:26] <ChordCatcher> PS4 controllers are apparently a lot more responsive but the main difference is the track pad thing at the back
[21:47:41] <ChordCatcher> although I don't think that works on pc
[21:47:50] <ChordCatcher> Hey Ferexes

[21:48:43] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> That's why I'm asking here.
[21:48:49] <Melody_Sky> FritzyBeat: I gotta say, that OhPonyBoy song was wicked
[21:48:49] <Eywind> Hisha_The_Unicorn I like XBO controllers better
[21:48:54] <Eywind> :P
[21:49:00] <FritzyBeat> it really is X3
[21:49:00] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I just had a feeling that playstation was better than xbox, but I might be wrong?
[21:49:04] <ChordCatcher> Depends if you prefer holding your hands weird or normally x3
[21:49:08] <Eywind> It really depends on how you ^
[21:49:23] <ChordCatcher> I can't get on with the PS controllers but love the XBox ones
[21:49:40] <Eywind> yeah my best purchase was a 8 foot microusb cable
[21:49:42] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> The xbox one controller is not too expensive either.
[21:50:07] <ChordCatcher> The only real difference between the 2 is stick positioning
[21:50:12] * Flurshy makes off with Eywind's microusb cable
[21:50:33] <Eywind> PS4 doesn't have the same type of plug and play interaction that Xbox controllers do, right?
[21:50:36] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So you guys would recoment an xbox one controller?
[21:50:39] <Eywind> Or can you just plug one into your PC and use it on Steam?
[21:50:42] <ChordCatcher> correct Eywind 
[21:50:42] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Eywind
[21:50:43] <DinkyBot> Eywind you getting that problem?
[21:50:44] <Lycan> Ergonomically, the Xbox controller is better, but mostly because of the extra weight from the battery

[21:55:19] <ChordCatcher> it won't
[21:55:35] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I found a cabled controller that comes with the converter. $60, is that a fair price?
[21:55:47] <Eywind> I mean that's the same as the wireless + USB cable
[21:55:52] <Eywind> $50 for the controller and $10 for the cable I thijnk
[21:56:21] <ChordCatcher> you can get controllers for $50? they're like $60-$70 over heh..
[21:56:27] <Eywind> idk I guess
