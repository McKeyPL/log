[04:19:07] <Eywind> not sure how many years at the end of my life I'd sell, and how much money I'd need for them though
[04:19:57] <One-Trick> maybe ill just make my plane ticket first class for next year
[04:19:58] <keekle> i basically had the last 8 days off (Though i did check in on work remotely).. will be hard to adjust on monday
[04:20:02] <One-Trick> seems i have wiggle room now
[04:20:03] <keekle> but hey at least there is one day lef
[04:20:07] <keekle> left
[04:21:11] <One-Trick> why are plane tickets almost 300$ higher this year? anyone got an insight?
[04:21:17] <One-Trick> gas is, like, 1.50$ here
[04:21:30] <Eywind> Tix don't seem more expensive ot me
[04:21:40] <keekle> it depends on the day and time of year
[04:21:55] <keekle> midweek is always cheaper
[04:22:06] <keekle> also clearly summer and xmas are more expensive
[04:22:10] <One-Trick> seems i cant get below 1500$ in the middle of may
[04:22:22] <keekle> what source are you using?
[04:22:29] <keekle> 1500 seems high
[04:22:29] <One-Trick> pretty much everyone
[04:22:36] <One-Trick> well, my airport is expensive anyway
[04:22:44] <One-Trick> but it was 1100$ last year
[04:22:45] <keekle> maybe some sport event?
[04:22:58] <keekle> european cup or something?
[04:23:01] <One-Trick> hm

[23:53:49] <Hamtramck> Well
[23:54:05] <Boxer> That one was resolved quickly.
[23:54:28] <Hamtramck> You'd kind of hope that "Wait crap sold friend into slavery, MULLIGAN" would be a quickly arroven at conclusion
[23:54:28] <Eywind> and the Daring Do one didn't?
[23:55:13] <Eywind> I mean, Daring lived days away from them and generally still does stuff by herself
[23:56:03] <Hamtramck> It's fun cause the implications of that Daring Do episode were like, oh hey there's all this horrible stuff on the outskirts of equestria, let's hope ahuizotl doesn't accidentally set anything off.
