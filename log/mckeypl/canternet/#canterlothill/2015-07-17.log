[04:31:37] <Eywind> umm
[04:31:39] <Obsidian-Rose> Everfree Network going off the air had a big part.
[04:31:43] <Eywind> Yep, and the hiatus
[04:31:47] <Eywind> and radio issues
[04:31:53] <Eywind> and someone put me in charge of stuff, which is a horrible decision

[04:33:08] <Eywind> so I apologized
[04:33:15] <Eywind> I wish we had 200 lol
[04:33:34] <wobniaR> We need more airhorns for that
[04:33:38] <Obsidian-Rose> Oh
[04:33:52] <GeneralLiberator> 200 people at once? Seriously? 
[04:33:59] <Obsidian-Rose> We need to go speak with some EQD admins and get some advertising.
[04:34:04] <Eywind> meh
[04:34:08] <Eywind> Not worth it right now
[04:34:14] <Obsidian-Rose> Used to be much more, Liberator.
[04:34:17] <MikeM> Something to support us during the hiatus.
[04:34:39] <wobniaR> It would make a slight difference, fandom interests have split up way too much

[05:26:57] <DinkyBot> Vinyl? Sounds like a tv plot.
[05:26:59] <ynoP> it was the worst HDTV I've ever used
[05:27:01] <One-Trick> i use my raspberry pi on my tv

[05:27:41] <One-Trick> but its not a smart tv, i dont need that crap. i have a raspberry pi, i have a full linux computer
[05:27:44] <Flurshy> because with a PA I can also earn money back

[05:27:51] <Flurshy> I got the smart tv thing for a discount
[05:28:01] <Flurshy> a 720p TV was advertised as 1080p
[05:28:15] <Flurshy> so I got the nearest match 1080p TV of that size for no change in price
[05:28:25] <Flurshy> it just happened to be a smart TV but I don't use the features
[05:28:44] <ynoP> You could probably screw that rasperry pi into the casing of a non-smart tv
[05:28:51] <One-Trick> i dont want a tv, especially samsung or sony, that has a camera either. thats just asking for trouble

[05:29:32] <One-Trick> but it has depth and object mapping
[05:29:40] <ynoP> But they're not going to use it
[05:29:53] <One-Trick> we use one at uni to map objects for the 3d printer
[05:29:56] <Flurshy> well they aren't exactly going after VR

[05:30:04] <One-Trick> yep
[05:30:09] <ynoP> That's pretty cool actualy
