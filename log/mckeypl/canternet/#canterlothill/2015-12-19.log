[04:02:30] <One-Trick> huh huh huh
[04:02:41] <Regulus> Also, if you're only gonna build settlements, spec Strength and Intelligence up to 6 points and Charisma up to 10
[04:02:50] <MikeM> Nice boat, RandomNinja 
[04:03:01] <RandomNinja> why strength?
[04:03:10] <Sketchy_Sounds> That's a big red rocket you got there

[04:06:09] <Regulus> Otherwise calibrated shocks, motion assist servos, and a military paint job on power armor is great for maximum looting potential

[04:36:42] <MikeM> wobniaR, that's the best version of the gif
[04:36:50] <Regulus> It's a sadistic plot to get you to like them
[04:36:52] <Octavia> theyre marking them for death
[04:36:59] <MikeM> Nitroglycerin world is a scarycool place to live.
[04:37:19] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay now I know you are joking.
