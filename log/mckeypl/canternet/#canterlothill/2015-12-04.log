[02:37:56] <One-Trick> so many stores that lack credit applications for the day will pressure employees to apply for a credit card, even if they know theyll be rejected, and dont realize that each time they do that that it chips off 2~4 points from your credit score and leaves a credit check entry in the ledger that doesnt go away for several years
[02:38:01] <One-Trick> its incredibly destructive
[02:38:13] <Flurshy> ah
[02:38:26] <Flurshy> thus far, mine doesn't seem to do that, at least that I've seen
[02:39:57] <SaultSteMarie> Man I think I have a Kohl's card
[02:40:01] <SaultSteMarie> Or I applied for one.
[02:40:11] <SaultSteMarie> I don't think I ever activated it.
[02:40:16] <Flurshy> as it stands though, this place may be an easy inlet to a job in Austin, so I can deal with that at least long enough to move and look for another job
[02:40:35] <Eywind> Kohls has a decent selection of polos and stuff, only reason I shop there
[02:40:37] <Flurshy> yeah they tell us in training that if you don't activate it immediately they normally will never use it
[02:41:00] <Flurshy> though I'm not sure what activating it means, when you have to use the card to get the approval discount anyway
[02:41:07] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (Bluepon@Pony-mfh7oq.md.comcast.net) (Quit: Ping timeout: -1 second)
[02:41:14] <SaultSteMarie> Somehow having a kohl's card that I've never activated/used/I think I threw it away haaaas helped my credit score? idk how that works
[02:41:17] <One-Trick> i wish the Sonoma long sleeve shirts didnt make lint balls all over it the first time i wash it
[02:41:25] <Flurshy> I got a sonoma coat
[02:41:27] <Flurshy> well
[02:41:27] <One-Trick> i really like how they look
[02:41:27] <Flurshy> jacket
[02:41:32] <Flurshy> for when it gets colder
[02:41:39] <Eywind> well in the long run it'd increase your credit score nominally, but not really worth it
[02:41:44] <Flurshy> kohl's is normally too expensive for me
[02:41:53] <Eywind> $15 polos are fine for me
[02:42:14] <Flurshy> I'm thinking I'll go get a credit card but not from a store. it'd be from a bank probably, so I can buy gum and build up a score
[02:42:29] <Flurshy> Eywind I found some polos for $2 at walmart in clearance
[02:42:31] <Eywind> well yeah you should get one from a bank that you have an account for
[02:42:45] <Eywind> eh I don't trust walmart clothes that people can see when I'm wearing them
[02:42:46] <SaultSteMarie> I have a card from mastercard Fifth Third.
[02:42:50] <Flurshy> I need to find a different bank first, one that has a presence where I'm going to more
[02:43:00] <Flurshy> ...
[02:43:01] <One-Trick> im a state employee, i just use my credit union for credit :)
[02:43:01] <SaultSteMarie> I activated this spring and just binge purchased stuff online for the sake of getting my credit score up
[02:43:03] <Flurshy> going to move*
[02:43:03] <SaultSteMarie> Just as a lark.
[02:43:16] <SaultSteMarie> Also as an excuse to buy stuff.
[02:43:26] <Flurshy> stuff is ni e
[02:43:28] <Flurshy> nice*
[02:43:32] <Flurshy> I bought a lot of stuff today
[02:43:35] <SaultSteMarie> I might use it for awhile cause I don't trust the dentist I was at with my credit card information.
[02:43:39] <Eywind> I work at Chase, so...
[02:43:47] <Flurshy> so with a credit card is it possible to pay a due the day you use the card?
[02:43:53] <SaultSteMarie> @ Eywind, Capitol Square Dental downtown is a !@#% nightmare btw.
[02:44:00] <One-Trick> yes
[02:44:01] <Eywind> Well you don't pay the day you charge, you pay when it's due
[02:44:06] <Flurshy> I mean
[02:44:07] <Eywind> I've never paid interest on my credit card
[02:44:10] <Flurshy> pay the day of the purchase
[02:44:21] <SaultSteMarie> Flurshy no you have to wait till the charge goes through
[02:44:23] <One-Trick> i pay about net28 from the day i purchase something
[02:44:23] <Eywind> You don't get charged interest starting with day 1 anyways
[02:44:23] <Flurshy> if not then I'll probably make a third account to put credit funds into
[02:44:24] <SaultSteMarie> which is usually a few days after
[02:44:42] <SaultSteMarie> you have to let it sit there for like a month before you pay interest though?

[02:44:59] <Eywind> to pay interest
[02:45:14] <Flurshy> well, actually, I mean... gum isn't that much, I might not need a third account to keep track of that

[02:46:28] <Eywind> One good thing about credit cards is if you get one with cash back you can get 1-5% back
[02:46:29] <Hamtramck> EYwind Fifth Third is dumb and doesn't let you autop
[02:46:34] <Hamtramck> actually they might as of like a week ago
[02:46:34] <Flurshy> the in-fashion sort of print
[02:46:38] <Eywind> well 5/3 is stupid
[02:46:42] <Flurshy> hmm
[02:46:45] <Eywind> they don't even really have a lot around here anyways
[02:46:47] <Flurshy> I need to look into that actually
[02:46:53] <Flurshy> maybe something with miles?
[02:46:55] <Eywind> I charge literally everything I can
[02:47:02] <Flurshy> I don't know if you can get a starter card with miles though
[02:47:07] <Eywind> probably not
[02:47:10] <Eywind> but maybe
[02:47:11] <Flurshy> >.<
[02:47:15] <MikeM> All that cash back makes for high credit card usage.
[02:47:29] <Hamtramck> I think my credit score's like 784ish now idk I don't even know what that means
[02:47:32] <Flurshy> probably best I avoid cash back, good point Mike
[02:47:36] <Eywind> 784 is pretty good
[02:47:40] <Flurshy> isn't 784 a really good score
[02:47:49] <Flurshy> I don't know my score, or if I have one
[02:47:51] <Hamtramck> Does this benefit me in some way
[02:47:52] <One-Trick> my capital one card is points-based, which i usually turn around and pay part of the balance with
[02:47:54] <Flurshy> what are the three free report places again?
[02:48:15] <Eywind> I think it's what, annual credit report?
[02:48:16] <One-Trick> equifax, experian, and trans.. uhh, something
[02:48:18] <Eywind> that's the actually free credit score?
[02:48:19] <One-Trick> transunion
[02:48:35] <Eywind> creditkarma gives you free scores too
[02:48:40] <One-Trick> us citizens are allowed 1 free credit report a year
[02:48:41] <MikeM> Flurshy, if you can pay off your debt every month, the cash back is a great bonus for money you would have spent anyway.
[02:48:45] <Flurshy> four, Eywind?
[02:48:52] *** Braixen is now known as Hoofy
[02:48:54] <Eywind> four what?
[02:49:04] <Hamtramck> Okay also serious question that I've already asked, if you have dental insurance, the dentist is supposed to bill insurance, and then insurance bills you for what they dont pick up, right?
[02:49:10] <Eywind> equifax, experian, and transunion are the companies that generally make up credit scores
[02:49:13] <Eywind> but they're not free if you go to their web sites
[02:49:24] <Eywind> Hamtramck yes
[02:49:27] <Flurshy> how do I get the free report from them then?
[02:49:30] <Eywind> well kinda
[02:49:47] <Eywind> sometimes the dentist will bill you the whole amount cuz they are stupid and then they get money from the insurance and then you pay the dentist
[02:49:52] <One-Trick> all of them should offer a basic credit score report for free
[02:50:00] <One-Trick> but its kinda useless
[02:50:01] <Eywind> well you get a report, not a score.
[02:50:19] <Hamtramck> So if a dentist gave me a quote of 1600, said insurance was paying 1000, and asked me to pay 600 the day I was scheduling the appointment, would that be weird?
[02:50:24] <Flurshy> equifax says $1
[02:50:25] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Eywind
[02:50:26] <DinkyBot> Eywind, okey dokey!
[02:50:28] <Eywind> annualcreditreport.com gives you a free one every year
[02:50:32] <Eywind> and creditkarma runs you one I think
[02:50:44] <Flurshy> creditkarma trustworthy?
[02:50:46] <Eywind> mint also runs your credit score
[02:50:47] <One-Trick> equifax and experian still cant validate me as a real person, still
[02:50:50] <One-Trick> Flurshy: yes
[02:51:07] <Eywind> Hamtramck not really
[02:51:12] <Hamtramck> O ok.
[02:51:21] <Eywind> I mean you could always ask how they're handling billing if you're not sure
[02:51:24] <Eywind> Better to ask them than us lol
[02:51:29] <Hamtramck> Well I mean
[02:51:33] <Eywind> I've gotten bills from insurance and bills from hospitals and stuff
[02:51:43] <Eywind> I generally just ignore any health bills I get now cuz my insurance pays it all lol
[02:51:51] <One-Trick> same
[02:51:54] <Eywind> one of the best things about capping out your health costs in January every year
[02:52:01] <One-Trick> yep
[02:52:12] <Eywind> I mean, sure, I pay like $140 a paycheck for health care
[02:52:16] <Eywind> but that's it
[02:52:22] <Hamtramck> Actually I'll probably just call the insurance guys and see if the dentist was BSing me on the price.
[02:52:25] <One-Trick> i get all my diabetic tests done when my plan rolls
[02:52:26] <Eywind> yeah that works too
[02:52:34] <Eywind> Yeah that's a good idea
[02:52:37] <Hamtramck> Beyond like scheduling me for 19 more dental procedures than was actually necessary.
[02:53:08] <One-Trick> my insurance doesnt cover nitrous :(
[02:53:15] <Hamtramck> I mean idk why but I'm getting vibes there's something weird going on here and I don't want to say fraud, because never attribute to malice what could be just as easily attributed to ineptitude
[02:53:15] <Hamtramck> but
[02:53:47] <Flurshy> okay so I need to make an account on creditkarma to get the free report yes?
[02:53:53] * Flurshy is totally doing this right now
[02:53:59] <One-Trick> yep
[02:54:41] <Hamtramck> CreditKarma says I have a good credit score which is the only reason I'm like HMMMMMMM around them
[02:55:17] <Hamtramck> then again maybe binge purchasing Saturn games is in fact a worthwhile investment for strong credit futures

[02:56:34] <Eywind> I haven't checked mine since I bought my house lol
[02:56:37] <Flurshy> does that mean I don't -have- a score?
[02:57:41] <Flurshy> I think that's what it means
[02:57:43] <One-Trick> you do, they just cant verify who you are. i have that problem, too. mostly cuz i changed my name many years ago
[02:58:04] <Flurshy> so I don't get a report D:
[02:58:34] <One-Trick> i dunno, youll have to see what they require to verify you are, indeed, you

[02:58:55] <One-Trick> i have to send equifax a copy of my drivers license
[02:59:13] <Flurshy> do I really need to check my score before I get my first card?
[02:59:17] <Eywind> no
[02:59:34] <Eywind> really if it's your first line of credit you're gonna get a little amount anyways, which is good
[02:59:43] <One-Trick> whether or not you get a credit card doesnt rely solely on the score
[03:00:18] <Flurshy> also depends on your income right
[03:00:52] <One-Trick> a lot of things, like late payments for bills, evictions, etc..
[03:01:27] <Flurshy> of which I have had none
[03:01:41] <One-Trick> having no history is sometimes worse than bad history
[03:01:48] <One-Trick> like, buying a car or such
[03:02:04] <Flurshy> my car is a hand-me-down
[03:02:19] <Flurshy> I have a debit card
[03:02:27] <One-Trick> all of mine up until i was 29 years old were also, which made it hard to buy a car when i needed one
[03:02:34] <One-Trick> i had to get a cosigner
[03:02:37] <Eywind> Yeah no history is bad
[03:02:48] <Flurshy> which is why I wanna build a score
[03:02:54] <Eywind> then j ust go to the bank
[03:02:57] <Eywind> see what they offer ya
[03:03:02] <One-Trick> ^
[03:03:14] <Flurshy> does closing a card affect your score?
[03:03:21] <Eywind> Kinda
[03:03:28] <One-Trick> most everything does
[03:03:38] <Eywind> account length is an aspect of your credit score
[03:03:41] <Flurshy> like if I get a card at my current bank, then switch banks and get a new card to keep with the same bank
[03:03:51] <Eywind> Just keep the old one too? lol
[03:03:54] <Flurshy> hm
[03:03:57] <Flurshy> fair enough
[03:04:07] <Flurshy> or would I even want to get a new card?
[03:04:32] <Flurshy> actually, maybe a credit card could do without having to be able to reach a physical locale that often
[03:04:43] <One-Trick> ive had a bank of america account for about 20 years, switched to my credit union due to the benefits i get, but that kind of history is good
[03:04:43] <Flurshy> right?
[03:04:46] <Eywind> yeah only debit cards really matter when you are trying to withdraw cash
[03:04:51] * Flurshy nods
[03:05:00] <Eywind> My score dropped a bunch cuz I got my home loan
[03:05:02] <Eywind> but it'll go back up
[03:05:02] <Flurshy> well like when something goes wrong
[03:05:23] <Eywind> IF something goes wrong
[03:05:26] <Eywind> you just call a service number
[03:05:31] <One-Trick> i have $28,000 in student loan debt but capital one keeps wanting to raise my credit limit xD
[03:05:33] <Flurshy> alright then
[03:05:50] <Flurshy> so something I probably need to know about is uhh... stop payments?
[03:05:58] <Eywind> why do you need to know that?
[03:06:00] <Flurshy> apparently that is something you can do with a credit card?
[03:06:07] <One-Trick> chargeback
[03:06:25] <Flurshy> well, if you needed a company to haul tail because they're being fraudulent
[03:06:32] <Eywind> well yeah then you call the number
[03:06:34] <Flurshy> I like to learn these things as a precaution
[03:06:39] <Eywind> and they'll do stuff ofc
[03:06:50] <One-Trick> thats why you ask the bank, and make sure theyre fdic insured
[03:07:01] <Flurshy> how do such things affect your score?
[03:07:17] <Flurshy> if you do that to a company because they haven't provided your product and refuse to refund
[03:07:34] <Eywind> significantly less than not opening a card

[04:08:48] <Flurshy> APR is when you are late on your payment
[04:08:50] <Flurshy> correct?
[04:10:23] <MikeM> APR is when you carry a balance from one period to the next.
[04:10:34] <MikeM> Being late on a payment may incur additional fees.
[04:11:15] <MikeM> APR what you pay for borrowing money from your credit card.
[04:11:31] <MikeM> *is
[04:15:00] <Eywind> Yeah for instance, if I bought a $200 item today on my credit card
[04:15:14] <Eywind> come next payment period (mine's the middle of the month), the bank's gonna be like
[04:15:20] <Eywind> yo, you have to pay us $25
[04:15:31] <Eywind> I can choose to pay any amount from 0 to 200
[04:15:52] <Eywind> If I pay less than $25, I'm gonna pay some ridiculous late charge ($40?) and it'll ding my credit score
[04:16:14] <Flurshy> so
[04:16:15] <Eywind> I can pay $25, but I"d get charged interest on the $175, which I'd probably be paying 28%/12*175, or like $5 for the month
[04:16:20] <Flurshy> I'm not just paying for what I bought
[04:16:21] <Eywind> I can pay $200 and pay no interest
[04:16:35] <Flurshy> now I'm confused
[04:16:40] *** Jokerboxer is now known as GM
[04:16:43] <Eywind> The bank'll give you a 'minimum payment'
[04:16:51] <Eywind> You can pay anywhere between that and your 'statement balance', which is everything outstanding
[04:16:55] <Flurshy> oh! so it divides it up over time
[04:17:02] <Eywind> well yeah, your APR is your Annual Percentage Rate
[04:17:10] <MikeM> Try to not pay just the minimum.
[04:17:17] <Eywind> so if it's 28%, you'd be paying 1/12th of the 28%
[04:17:28] <Eywind> (and it'll recalculate every month and charge you interest then)
[04:17:42] <Flurshy> wait, so
[04:17:48] <Flurshy> so let me see if I understand
[04:17:49] <Eywind> canterlot hill, where finances happen.
[04:18:02] <MikeM> Friendship is creditworthiness!
[04:18:04] <Flurshy> you don't have to pay in full, but if you don't, you'll get charged the APR on what you didn't pay
[04:18:14] <Eywind> Yep
[04:18:35] <Flurshy> so if I buy a toaster for $50, they tell me the minimum is $5, I pay $10, I'll have to pay the APR on the $40 left?
[04:19:08] <Flurshy> why would anyone in their right mind do that? do people not know how to save up money to buy something?
[04:19:54] <MikeM> You should print this and save it for later.

[04:23:17] <thereallynewmop12100> Eywind: Besides. It's December 
[04:23:19] <Eywind> you value your time at <$7/hour
[04:23:27] <Flurshy> I went this black friday around midnight on the way to work, so I could grab san andreas on bluray
[04:23:31] <Eywind> Holy crap you actually read what I say and are replying to it
[04:23:52] <Eywind> I think that's literally the first time you actually have said something semi-lucid to me
[04:24:05] <thereallynewmop12100> Eywind: Well. Congrats
[04:24:27] <Eywind> It being 'christmas shopping season' and 'december' doesn't mean that your time is worth less or that saving $30 for a night is really worth it
[04:24:32] <Eywind> You could just get a second job and make more money that way
[04:24:59] <Flurshy> I saw someone go from the front of the left turn lane at a light, drive down the pedestrian walk and get in front of a car in the right turn lane to turn right
[04:25:03] <Flurshy> this happened earlier today
[04:25:25] <Flurshy> holiday traffic is definitely here
[04:25:51] <Eywind> holiday stupidity*

[04:26:17] <thereallynewmop12100> Flurshy: And the christmas music. it's playing on the radio (like Fresh Radio 103.1, KOST 103.5 and others)

[14:40:11] <Flurshy> another one, is it rude to "return the favor" when someone holds the first door open for you?
[14:40:33] <Flurshy> cause I did that and felt like I was being rude. this lady told her son to hold the door for me and I was already grabbing the handle >.<
[14:40:42] <RandomNinja> you open the door for people who are weaker/less able to open if it's practical to do so, imo
[14:40:50] <Unixkitty> I'm not sure what you mean by "return the favor", Flurshy 
[14:41:05] <Flurshy> in places where there are two sets of doors
[14:41:15] <Flurshy> so they hold the first, then you go in and hold the second for them
[14:41:31] <Unixkitty> Only if you feel like they could actually use some help
[14:41:38] <RandomNinja> I push it hard enough to stay open for them to enter
[14:41:45] <Unixkitty> Because again, you aren't obliged to do anything based on anyone else's actions
[14:41:48] <Flurshy> maybe that etiquette has become local
[14:42:03] <Flurshy> men are generally obligated to hold the door open for women
[14:42:16] <Flurshy> if a man holds the door for another man, they're obligated to return the favor
[14:42:19] <Unixkitty> They are not, and I never expect any to do that for me
[14:42:27] <Flurshy> this is texas though
[14:42:44] <RandomNinja> I've never heard that...
[14:43:04] <Unixkitty> Must be some specific social standards there, because honestly, I haven't either
[14:43:32] <Unixkitty> And frankly, I think it comes with the male "bro" thing, Flurshy 
[14:43:37] <Unixkitty> But that's just my opinion
[14:44:38] <Flurshy> bro?
[14:45:06] <Flurshy> I was taught it's simply polite, and rude not to, for a guy. but I don't know for a girl
[14:45:35] <Unixkitty> Let's just say that it's usually the guys that feel "obliged" to do things for others to "return the favour"
[14:45:50] <Flurshy> transitioning gives a bit of culture shock for sure
[14:46:09] <Unixkitty> I suppose it might, something of a two-side perspective?
[14:46:15] <Unixkitty> two/both
[14:46:23] <Flurshy> well
[14:46:28] <Flurshy> you're raised to one set of standards
[14:46:47] <Flurshy> when you transition, the standards all change. what's expected of you changes, and you struggle to keep up with all the changes
[14:47:36] <Unixkitty> How is it coming for you so far anyway, if you don't mind me asking?
[14:47:49] <Flurshy> great! especially now that I pass most of the time
[14:48:08] <Flurshy> at least, if my attire is right. wrong clothes and everyone will think I'm a guy
[14:48:29] <Unixkitty> Haha, well I assume the former must feel exciting for certain
[14:48:51] <Sketchy_Sounds> Really what people should aim for is to just be thoughtful towartds each other irrespective of gender.
[14:48:58] <Flurshy> it's important to compensate -- an androgynous person wearing a dress will generally be seen as a girl, but an androgynous person in jeans and a T-shirt might confuse everyone
[14:49:28] <Unixkitty> Most of my casual attire consists of hoodies and jeans :P
[14:49:31] <Flurshy> Sketchy, I try to learn the etiquette to "pass" better, to avoid having someone call me out and say "That must be a guy! ew"
[14:49:56] <Flurshy> but I have a face that leans toward the masculine, so I have to wear snug clothing

[14:50:41] <RandomNinja> :O
[14:50:44] <RandomNinja> you need more squats
[14:50:47] <Flurshy> I went on a pre-birthday shopping spree :D
[14:50:55] <Flurshy> those are just loose pants
[14:51:00] <Sketchy_Sounds> You look good, Flurshy :)
[14:51:05] <Flurshy> I'm trying to get new pants, because I shrank sizes
[14:51:20] <Unixkitty> You could definitely use tighter jeans
[14:51:29] <RandomNinja> tight pants are evil though
[14:51:41] <Flurshy> I mean, I also bought tighter jeans. I just didn't take a pic of the jeans and that shirt together
[14:51:58] <Flurshy> I could show you, but it's a pic of booty in jeans, so I probably won't
[14:52:03] <Unixkitty> For someone with glutes as mighty as yours, RandomNinja? :P
[14:52:23] <RandomNinja> I mean I always hated tight pants
[14:52:34] <Flurshy> I used to
[14:52:34] <RandomNinja> they're restrictive and lack useful pockets
[14:52:36] <Sketchy_Sounds> I cannot ever wear tight-fitting trousers because I have fairly mighty thighs from a childhood spent cycling.
[14:52:45] <Flurshy> until they started to look really really good on me
[14:52:59] <Flurshy> then I started to like them
[14:52:59] <Sketchy_Sounds> So unless what I wear has some elastic properties, I end up ripping them apart across the thigh seams.
[14:53:06] <RandomNinja> Sketchy_Sounds, team quad 4 lyfe?

[14:53:35] <RandomNinja> those who don't are literally the worst thing though
[14:53:45] <Flurshy> agreed.
[14:53:46] <Sketchy_Sounds> I've worn skinny jeans before, they do not like me very much XD
[14:53:47] <RandomNinja> actually worse than Hitler
[14:54:21] <Sketchy_Sounds> Although with that said I do have one pair that fit relatively well. Unfortunately I ended up ripping open a big hole in the knee of those when I tripped over outside with them on.
[14:54:43] <Sketchy_Sounds> Ripped a pretty painful hole in the skin of said knee as well, which was ow.

[15:07:30] <Sketchy_Sounds> I already have done.

[15:08:11] <RandomNinja> surplus as in dirt cheap?
[15:08:20] <Sketchy_Sounds> About ten quid for a pair, yes.
[15:08:23] <RandomNinja> sweet

[15:08:50] <RandomNinja> yay
[15:09:05] <RandomNinja> I need to start checking the surplus store
[15:09:30] <Sketchy_Sounds> But they're fantastic. Massive map-size pockets, they're made to last, and they fit nicely as well. And cos they're for the army they're adjustable around the waist, cos of course not all recruits are the same size.
