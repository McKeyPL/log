[05:08:48] <RandomNinja> pls
[05:08:49] <Flurshy> this headline makes me want to throw up
[05:08:55] <RandomNinja> don't bring your logical solutions into this
[05:09:13] <Flurshy> "The 5 best credit cards with no interest to help you get out of debt..."
[05:09:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flurshy: You mean how Donald Trump is pulling ahad because he's telling everyone to 'sit down and shut up?'
[05:09:26] <RandomNinja> >credit card
[05:09:31] <RandomNinja> >get out of debt
[05:09:33] <wobniaR> Yes credit cards are a foolproof way of getting out of debt
[05:09:49] <RandomNinja> loan money to pay your current loans
[05:09:56] <RandomNinja> there is no way this could snowball
[05:10:16] <Flurshy> I suppose you could use it as a trick to freeze interest, if the cards are really zero-interest
[05:11:05] <Flurshy> but if you were that smart financially you probably wouldn't be in debt to begin with
[05:12:38] <Muffin_Spectacles> I only have 1 credit card, and I keep telling myself, 'you don't need another.'
[05:12:44] * RandomNinja boops Muffin_Spectacles with Flurshy's stick
[05:12:45] <One-Trick> its not about being financially smart- you get into situations you can not control
[05:13:01] <Flurshy> hence the word "probably"
[05:13:20] <Flurshy> I understand that sometimes you have to go into debt to survive
[05:13:29] <Flurshy> but I can't help thinking that's the exception
[05:13:35] <Muffin_Spectacles> I have considered those super-special cards where you pay annual fees to accumulate points for air travel, but I don't buy-buy-buy like most, so it is probably pretty ridiculous to get one.
[05:13:59] <One-Trick> ive not ever been able to use my airline points for anything useful
[05:14:17] <One-Trick> its always off-season or you have stupid layovers in towns no ones heard of
[05:14:23] <Muffin_Spectacles> One-Trick: I FINALLY had enough to use for a ticket a few months ago...and I'd been accumulating them for over 8 1/2 years!
[05:14:39] <Flurshy> at that rate you're better off just buying your own airfare
[05:15:00] <One-Trick> i flew to germany and back and didnt make a dent in arkansas to florida to see my parents
[05:15:41] <Flurshy> you were flown to germany on a trip to florida?
[05:15:45] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flurshy: Well, it definitely took a bit out of the dent in my 'We're Going Back' BTTF event I'm going to in October.
[05:16:01] <Flurshy> ah
[05:16:12] <Flurshy> oh yeah, that's this year
[05:16:13] <Flurshy> what's the date?
[05:16:16] <One-Trick> no, i went to germany for vacation and the miles i earned didnt make much difference in the cost to fly to florida to see my parents
[05:16:20] <Muffin_Spectacles> It'll be interesting to see if I'll survive the mean streets of Hollywood. I'm staying at a Hostel off of Hollywood Blvd in late October.
[05:16:21] <One-Trick> airlines points are a joke
[05:16:43] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flurshy: October 21-October 27.
[05:17:11] <Flurshy> I've got a hopefully fun october ahead of me
[05:17:19] <Muffin_Spectacles> Flurshy: The cool thing? We're going to be at Univesal Studios on October 21st...though if we'll be on the Courthouse Square at 4:29pm, we're all hoping for...for that was when MArty, Doc, and Jennifer arrived!
[05:17:46] <Flurshy> ooooooh
[05:18:04] <Flurshy> also, courthouse square in universal studios, or the actual setpiece?

[05:20:16] <RandomNinja> yay
[05:20:40] <One-Trick> yeah, i should convert those
[05:21:40] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, sent my sister a Amazon gift card. Hope she doesn't think it's too blase.
[05:24:14] * One-Trick loves gift cards
[05:24:47] <Muffin_Spectacles> Her Birthday is tomorrow. I feel like a heel that I didn't get her something as cool as she got me, but I'm alway for practical.
[05:25:31] <One-Trick> my sister, mom, dad, etc... have no idea what i like or can use. they all pretty much send me redbox codes or amazon/walmart cards
[05:25:40] <One-Trick> which is fine with me, i can get what i want and need
[05:26:51] <Muffin_Spectacles> One-Trick: We usually are practical folk in our family. Though my sister got me a stake in Disney, with one share of stock...and it's been climbing.

[05:29:17] <One-Trick> its been going up since 1978
[05:29:49] <Muffin_Spectacles> One-Trick: Not really, it hung around $25-30 per share during the mid 2000's with how bad it was doing...recently, it's climbed up around $120. I should have bought when it was low.

[06:42:37] <Muffin_Spectacles> Had a crazy idea: what if Bronycon offered specially-produced ponies for the convention?
[06:43:41] <Muffin_Spectacles> Gi Joe-con and Botcon have an interesting deal with Hasbro, where they make special boxsets/packs of figures, using certain molds, but theming them to certain characters or things...what if that happened with Bronycon? Like, you'd get a boxset LE of 3,000, dealing with a certain episode.
[06:44:54] <RandomNinja> crazy
[06:46:07] <Muffin_Spectacles> Think of it: a 5-pack set dealing with TWilight and her friends in Magic Kindergarten...with a special figure-head-mold of Minuette with head-in-beaker.
[06:47:03] *** Joins: thereallynewmop12100 (Mibbit@Pony-pl3.h7o.49.66.IP)

[06:48:23] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: I'm just speculating for now, but it's definitely something that I'd love to see what people would think. Maybe I should submit it to EqD for a topic...but then, they'd probably say, 'whuh?'
[06:48:43] <RandomNinja> yeah I don't know
[06:49:02] <RandomNinja> you'd probably want to get in touch with convention people
[06:49:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: Though the boxsets for the Joe and Botcons run upwards of $300+, and the special 
[06:49:16] <RandomNinja> :O
[06:49:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> LE packs run around $80-100.
[06:49:36] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: Yeah, but then, they are getting access to Hasbro's molds, and crafting new heads, accessories, and in some rare cases, brand-new moldings.
[06:50:20] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: Besides, imagine them making a boxset of Granny Smith, pre-ponyville days, with a young-looking Granny, and her family, along with a specially-molded Timberwolf.
[06:50:22] *** Quits: luckyspirit (luckyspirit@pony.poni.pony) (Quit: pony should pony pony)
[06:50:29] <RandomNinja> yus
[06:51:01] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: I see con-exclusives being the one place where such a thing could work...and Bronycon? Well, who there wouldn't want a pre-ponyville Granny?
[06:51:28] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: Or, what if they could make a proper-scaled STeven Magnet?
[06:52:26] <RandomNinja> seeing as people are already willing to pay massive overprice at conventions
[06:53:06] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: The biggest issue would be of course, trying to find a set that could make everyone go bonkers for and shell out cash. That's definitely a problem at Botcon. The last few years, they have not sold out of their $300 big boxset.
[06:53:41] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: I bought the 2011 set, because it got me in its retro-styling for some older Transfomrers, and from what I heard, that set was the last time they had a full-on sellout of almost all product.
[06:55:55] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: It'd definitely be the place to get proper characters...or, what if Bronycon boxsets would bring about characters from the comics...say...Nightmare Rarity?

[07:11:50] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, submitted my topic idea to EqD. We'll see if they can understand what I'm thinking.
[07:12:10] <Muffin_Spectacles> But think of it, would you attend Bronycon if they had specially-made figures made in conjunction with Hasbro, if they had lesser-known characters?
[07:12:33] <Snapai> Hasbro already does that for SDCC I think
[07:12:43] <Snapai> with Funky
[07:12:45] <Snapai> *Funko
[07:12:51] <Muffin_Spectacles> For example, what if the first 2000 who signed up for Bronycon got dibs on a special Braeburn figure?
[07:13:21] <Muffin_Spectacles> Snapai: But, Bronycon would deal more with lesser-seen secondary and more obscure stuff. JoeCon and BotCon do something similar with GI Joe and Transformers figures.
[07:14:21] <Muffin_Spectacles> Snapai: These conventions I mentioned, often have characters made into their boxsets and specialties, that stuff like Comic-Con would never get. Besides, I could see Bronycon being the place to release a limited release Nightmare Rarity figure.

[17:17:27] <UniteThePinkies> that*

[17:17:54] <RandomNinja> yes
[17:18:23] <UniteThePinkies> went to an amusement park yesterday... was amusing :)
[17:18:29] <UniteThePinkies> er, Saturday
[17:18:32] <UniteThePinkies> not yesterday
[17:18:34] <Flurshy> so there can be mold in food even if you can't see the mold?
[17:18:49] <bikey> yeah
[17:18:55] <Hamtramck> Mold in yogurt's weird though, usually yogurt's already too crowded with bacteria and acidic for mold to wanna hang out
[17:19:23] <wobniaR> Mold is airborne
[17:19:23] <wobniaR> You could breathe in mold spores and not know it
[17:19:34] <bikey> that's why you shouldn't eat bread that's been in a package with moldy bread, because even if you don't see it, it's probably already moldy on the inside
[17:19:57] <Flurshy> what about cheese?
[17:20:06] <bikey> same
[17:20:10] <Flurshy> since conventional wisdom around here says to just cut the mold away
[17:20:17] <Hamtramck> iirc cheese can be safe since the mold doesn't tend to penetrate deepl into it.
[17:20:23] <RandomNinja> ^
[17:20:24] <Hamtramck> Like if we're talking harder block cheeses
[17:20:27] <wobniaR> Some cheeses ferment with mold
[17:20:32] <bikey> that's just cosmetics, the mold is inside it
[17:20:36] <RandomNinja> different kinds of mold tho
[17:20:55] <wobniaR> Yes friendly mold that doesn't want to kill you
[17:20:57] <bikey> mold becomes visible when it has eaten enough to spread more
[17:21:32] <RandomNinja> yeah but mold isn't inherently bad, it's the toxins that are
[17:21:46] <Flurshy> let's eliminate the kinds of mold that make food inedible
[17:21:53] <Flurshy> and then the world will be a better place
[17:22:16] <Hamtramck> iirc food mold's not generally TOO bad.
[17:22:24] <Hamtramck> It's more like the mold that gets up in your walls after water damage
[17:22:38] <bikey> the mold makes the toxins. But as I was saying, there can be toxins in food even if you don't see the mold that caused them
[17:22:43] <RandomNinja> I would't want to eat a cheese chunk that's entirely colored though
[17:22:55] <RandomNinja> yeah I guess that's true
[17:22:58] <Hamtramck> random that's racist
[17:23:03] <Flurshy> I recall something about a type of mold that basically makes your house unsurvivable like that Hamtramck?

[18:09:52] <wobniaR> Heresy of the highest degree
[18:10:25] <ynoP> You can do that geometrically correct with a circle compass and an overlay for the pizza
[18:10:44] <RandomNinja> 8 slices are skrub tier tho
[18:10:51] <RandomNinja> try 7
[18:11:09] <ynoP> That's ridiculous
[18:11:17] <ynoP> 6 is one thing
[18:11:24] <ynoP> But 5 or 7!
[18:12:01] <ynoP> You need some intense shape work to construct those
[18:13:38] <ynoP> I can do 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 slices
[18:14:53] <ynoP> 2 4 and 8 are all just halves, 3 6 and 12 require a compass.

[21:49:47] <wobniaR> Except it'll be a bottomless trap hole instead of explosions
[21:50:09] <quindo> it would basically be a caster that has a limited spell pool each turn, and can not tell anyone what spell he is throwing out
[21:50:27] <quindo> the benifit is that after each battle all the cards are shuffled back into the deck

[21:53:38] <wobniaR> Oh that
[21:53:56] <quindo> Yeah, but if you have to lock the card in first, and it does not trigger until round end you can not metagame
[21:54:09] <quindo> you can only use the info you have at that moment

[22:10:34] <RandomNinja> it's just a naked fat man
[22:10:36] <Pony_4275> RandomNinja: drunk
[22:11:01] <RandomNinja> I'm still not sure what you're saying
[22:11:27] <Pony_4275> RandomNinja: never mind, it that you on the imgur?
[22:11:33] <RandomNinja> no
[22:12:00] <RandomNinja> I'm a naked skinny guy
[22:12:07] <Pony_4275> RandomNinja: maybe in a few years when you a very old :p
[22:12:13] <wobniaR> He wishes he could down beer like that
[22:12:21] <Pony_4275> :)
[22:12:24] <wobniaR> And have a keg to do so with
[22:12:30] <RandomNinja> pls I just lack the keg
[22:12:34] <RandomNinja> I totally could
[22:12:38] <quindo> illustrator CC 2015 stopped working!
[22:12:39] <quindo> :D
[22:12:49] <wobniaR> Do it for the vine
[22:13:14] <Pony_4275> you must really like beer then RandomNinja 
[22:13:28] <RandomNinja> I can't tho, I lack the keg
[22:13:38] <quindo> So I mixed this drink last night...
[22:14:23] <Pony_4275> what was it,
[22:14:27] <quindo> It was mexicain vinella extract, Soy Milk, Crown Royal, Lemon juice, and Garlic Powder
[22:14:39] <Pony_4275> How is it called?
[22:14:53] <SilentHoofsteps> garlic powder?
[22:15:04] <SilentHoofsteps> how did it taste?
[22:15:14] <Pony_4275> i don't think good.
[22:15:29] <quindo> evidently at first it was not bad, but then the aftertaste kicked in and he almost puked
[22:15:41] <quindo> then he finished it... x.x
[22:15:42] <SilentHoofsteps> eww
[22:15:44] <RandomNinja> if you can't remember how it tasted it probably did the job
[22:15:58] <Pony_4275> he puked? did you fixed it for someone? quindo 
[22:16:08] <quindo> he did not
[22:16:17] <wobniaR> You guys and forcing yourself to drink terrible drinks
[22:16:24] <quindo> I do not drink
[22:16:28] <Pony_4275> are you talking in 3rd person? quindo 
[22:16:30] * wobniaR slaps RandomNinja & quindo with vanilla coke
[22:16:36] <RandomNinja> nuu the worst coke
[22:16:48] <wobniaR> Lies
[22:16:52] <wobniaR> Coke zero is the worst
[22:17:00] <quindo> the next thing I make is going to be something with soy sauce and hot sauce.
[22:17:01] <RandomNinja> !t worst
[22:17:02] <DinkyBot> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: the best worst pun
[22:17:02] <Pony_4275> i like coke &whisky and coke &wodka
[22:17:20] <RandomNinja> I like coke and whiskey separately
[22:17:22] <wobniaR> Yeah coca cola is really good at masking alcohol
[22:17:29] <wobniaR> But still pointless
[22:17:50] <Pony_4275> more whisky and less coke, the same with the wodka
[22:18:09] <RandomNinja> if you need to hide the flavor you should drink better stuff :P

[22:19:55] <Pony_4275> dragon's milk?
[22:20:11] <quindo> yeah
[22:20:17] <quindo> You capture a dragon and then milk it
[22:20:22] <quindo> then age the milk in a barrel

[22:41:59] <SilentHoofsteps> what server?

[22:42:47] <SilentHoofsteps> I see now, yes
[22:43:38] <RandomNinja> Jaraxxus > Kil'Jaeden
[22:43:55] <quindo> my dps for assult sucked cause I had to taunt kite berz around so we could kill it
[22:45:14] <SilentHoofsteps> I probably can't play on an American server from Europe, huh?
[22:45:42] <quindo> uuh... I do not think cross rhealm works for that no.
[22:45:45] <RandomNinja> you'll get lag
[22:45:51] <quindo> idk... it might
[22:46:01] <RandomNinja> pretty sure you can play on US servers
[22:46:05] <SilentHoofsteps> actually I was doing the opposite
[22:46:20] <SilentHoofsteps> while I was in US I played in the server I usually play on
[22:46:24] <SilentHoofsteps> and no lag at all
[22:47:02] <quindo> I think their lag prevention has gotten better, but some fights it was really bad

[22:47:39] <RandomNinja> Jon-The_Bronynerd, do you even biology? :P
[22:47:53] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> I don't biology, RandomNinja :P
[22:50:59] <SilentHoofsteps> googled it and you have to buy the US version of the game to play on US servers also nothing's synced and you gotta pay subscription for both
[22:51:43] <quindo> I do not think you can transfer across them either
[22:52:14] <SilentHoofsteps> you can't
[22:52:27] <quindo> maybe you could if you have a wow account that has been inactive sense before the other 'things' exsisted
[22:52:37] <quindo> but it would need to be a manual ticket

[23:00:07] <SilentHoofsteps> yeah, I might do that
