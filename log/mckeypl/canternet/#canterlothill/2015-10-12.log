[03:03:49] <EM-C> Any opinions on the Crusaders' marks?
[03:04:01] <RandomNinja> #hype
[03:04:07] <MikeM> I like them.
[03:04:17] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Like it? I love it!
[03:04:42] <EM-C> I had absolutely no idea what was coming.  I had been completely spoiler free.
[03:04:55] <EM-C> It was so fast and song-filled it reminded me of Twilight's ascension episode.
[03:05:21] <EM-C> At first I was sort of disappointed.  But then...I did somethinking.
[03:05:37] <MikeM> Oh?
[03:05:48] <EM-C> Their cutie marks are essentially for being Cutie Mark Crusaders, which has been their true essence all this time.
[03:06:11] <EM-C> At first cutie marks for being Cutie Mark Crusaders sounds sort of tautological.
[03:06:45] <EM-C> But they indicate not only the help they will give other ponies, but also hint at a life of adventure ahead of them.
[03:07:00] <MikeM> I think it's more like Cutie Mark Crusaders Guidance Counselors
[03:07:02] <EM-C> And also assure that their friendship will remain as it is and they won't grow apart.
[03:07:09] <Hamtramck> I was reading someone else's thoughts on that. I think the big thing is that most pony's get cutie marks for finding their special talents or whatever, but the CMC got theirs as the result of this like, personal revelation?
[03:07:33] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: I have to say something 
[03:07:38] <Hamtramck> Like right before they get them, Scoots is talking about how she doesn't care if she gets a cutie mark, as long as they can help other ponies?
[03:07:58] <EM-C> Yeah.  I noticed that too.  A little out of character for her.
[03:08:13] <wobniaR> Nah, finding a talent IS a personal revelation
[03:08:31] <RandomNinja> "oh man, I found something I don't suck at!"
[03:08:48] <Hamtramck> Yeah but this was like a personal relevation separate from their talents.
[03:08:51] <EM-C> The thing is, crusading and searching for meaning really has been their thing for all this time.
[03:09:03] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: This episode is currently my favorite one :D
[03:09:18] <EM-C> I like Mythril Moth's take on it.
[03:09:22] <Hamtramck> whosat?
[03:09:26] <wobniaR> The revelation was the discovery of their ability to help others both find and use their talents 
[03:09:29] <EM-C> A fic writer, a good one.
[03:09:33] <Hamtramck> o ok
[03:09:44] <EM-C> He's started a new fic called "Trinity" about their post-mark adventures.
[03:10:15] <Hamtramck> wobniaR: idk I still think it's important that she was talking about how the cutie mark /itself/ wasn't the important thing, it's what it like, stood for that mattered????
[03:10:33] <EM-C> But the pony they helped most was Diamond Tiara, who already had her cutie mark but who still hadn't found herself.
[03:10:35] <wobniaR> Isn't that true?
[03:10:38] <EM-C> Just like Troubleshoes.
[03:10:43] <wobniaR> Exactly
[03:10:57] <wobniaR> They helped them find what their talents really meant
[03:11:16] <EM-C> So they're not just going to be helping young foals find their marks, they're going to help ponies understand the marks they already have.
[03:11:22] <wobniaR> Exactly
[03:11:44] <Hamtramck> wobniaR: You'd think so but then Magical Mystery Cure and S5 openers had ponies getting their cutie marks swapped/removed and it messed with their minds, so like in those cases its like they were being controlled in some part by their marks.
[03:12:01] <EM-C> One thing this assures us is that this isn't the end of the Crusaders.  I know we were all a little worried about what would become of their club once they found them.
[03:12:24] <wobniaR> Because their marks are magic that represent who they are
[03:12:59] <EM-C> What a fifth anniversary episode.  And I wasn't even remotely expecting it!
[03:13:28] <EM-C> It was also interesting to see where Diamond Tiara got her meanness.
[03:13:40] <EM-C> The few times we've seen her dad, he seemed like an all right pony.
[03:14:02] <EM-C> Oh, and it was a redemption ep as well!
[03:14:25] <EM-C> You know what I thought was dawwww and hnnnnng-inducingly cute?
[03:14:27] <Hamtramck> Diamond Tiara's cutie mark did the "just got a cutie mark" flash when she had her /moment of clarity/ too. Wondering if that was just a visual mnemonic or if she literally re-got it.
[03:15:02] <EM-C> Remember the musical number where the Crusaders were chasing Diamond while she was racing to the school board meeting?
[03:15:31] *** Joins: Toothpaste (uid63062@Pony-jogq8d.ealing.irccloud.com)
[03:15:43] <EM-C> Well, for just a couple seconds we see it from Diamond's perspective, and we see the road ahead of her and at the bottom, her two little front hooves running in time with the song.
[03:15:59] <EM-C> I don't know why, but I thought that was so CUUUUUUUTE!!!!  I hope that's not weird.
[03:16:31] <wobniaR> A re-got is one way of describing it, more like a rediscovery
[03:16:39] <MikeM> It was a pretty well-designed scene.
[03:16:50] <MikeM> scene/shot
[03:17:25] <EM-C> Just those two front hooves, from her perspective, as she ran in time with the music.
[03:17:37] <Hamtramck> I should rewatch that, I don't think I quite caught that.
[03:18:44] <Hamtramck> Anyway I was definitely expecting them to get cutie marks in a much more mundane and predictable way (Sweetie Belle sings stuff good, gets mark, etc.) so I thought that it was really cool that the show went in a completely different direction.
[03:18:49] <EM-C> Right now I'm contemplating whether or not to get into Star vs. the Forces of Evil.
[03:19:29] *** Velvet is now known as Braixen
[03:20:03] <EM-C> It's a bit vulgar and surreal--the very opposite of the ponies--but the thing that has me fascinated is that the very final episode of the season supposedly turned serious and really emotional out of nowhere.
[03:20:36] <EM-C> wobniaR, you're a mod, right?
[03:20:39] <Hamtramck> I really liked Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go for similar reasons.
[03:20:53] <wobniaR> Half mod
[03:20:58] <wobniaR> Why what's up?
[03:21:02] <RandomNinja> EM-C, weird and vulgar with surprising amounts of depth and emotion?
[03:21:11] <EM-C> I'd like to show you a video and ask you if it's okay to post here.
[03:21:21] <RandomNinja> have you watched Rick & Morty?
[03:21:23] <EM-C> RandomNinja: maybe?  At the end, anyway.
[03:21:30] <EM-C> Hold on, wobniaR.
[03:21:36] <wobniaR> You should be able to watch it and tell if it's appropriate to post or not
[03:21:38] <RandomNinja> because that show has a ton of that
[03:21:52] <wobniaR> If you're in real doubt it's probably better not to post it
[03:22:08] <Hamtramck> It started off as a really goofy, but pretty well done, homage to 70s anime/giant robot shows, but then it went into some... rather dark and weird territory. And then I think it got cancelled because Disney is stupid.
[03:22:09] <RandomNinja> if you're not sure if it's heresy, it probably is
[03:22:11] <EM-C> There it is.
[03:22:25] <Hamtramck> If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it.
[03:22:28] <EM-C> No, it's been renewed.  Second season is next summer.
[03:22:38] <Hamtramck> EM-C I was talking Super Robot Monkey whatever.
[03:22:48] <RandomNinja> networks are stupid
[03:22:51] <EM-C> Oh.  Sorry.
[03:23:13] <RandomNinja> I mean they cancelled Futurama, Metalocalypse, AND Firefly
[03:23:32] <EM-C> Star vs. is like so many other cartoons: it's that trope of goofy boy and beautiful girl who are friends as adolescents.
[03:23:51] <MikeM> What a dream
[03:23:57] <EM-C> That concept simply stupefies, amazes, and fascinates me, since at that age I was terrified of females.
[03:24:26] <EM-C> For five or six years I avoided having to talk to any girl my own age if I could avoid it at all.
[03:24:42] <Hamtramck> Also CN cancelled Young Justice because girls don't buy merch or something.
[03:25:06] <Hamtramck> And Young Justice was really popular with the ladies.
[03:25:35] <Hamtramck> I've encountered some people that are /nervous/ about Steven Universe getting merch, out of fears that if the merch doesn't sell, SU will get cancelled.
[03:25:35] <EM-C> I completely and totally missed out on the romance part of growing up.  It's ... looking back I kind of feel cheated.
[03:25:44] <RandomNinja> not enough Starfire 
[03:26:08] <Regulus> Needs moar foxes. 
[03:26:09] <Hamtramck> Starfire probably could've been in Young Justice if they hadn't cancelled it! We'll never know, now!!!
[03:26:39] <Hamtramck> EM-C: I never dated anyone when I was younger, never had any interest in doing so, and still don't, if that makes you feel any better :S
[03:26:45] <RandomNinja> I need to watch more Teen Titans, Raven is great
[03:27:05] <Hamtramck> The original Teen Titans is another lovely example of starting out goofy and getting "woah what" as it goes on.
[03:27:16] <RandomNinja> also a firm believer in never skipping leg day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sulguAnwsoM
[03:27:16] <DinkyBot>  [ Teen Titans Go! - Leg Day Transformation (with Sailor Moon music) - YouTube ]
[03:28:29] <EM-C> Hamtramck: I've never had a sweetheart, even at my age.  Women are like strange, magical beings to me.  I still find them super intimidating.  So cartoons where two adolescents kids, a boy and a girl, can just be friends?  That's like Tolkienesque fantasy to me.
[03:28:59] <EM-C> Hamtarmck: I loved the original Teen Titans show and was active in the online fandom.  I have some fics up at fanfiction.net.
