[00:29:16] <Rawrity> Today my sister (15yo) went to buy shoes, but ended up with a badass skateboard
[00:29:32] <Rawrity> So badass 16 people asked her about it
[00:29:38] <Hamtramck> "Sad Scootaloo playing left-handed fender jazz bass". <- guys stop feedin DinkyBot NSFW phrases omgomgomg
[00:29:43] <Eywind> hah
[00:29:48] <Rawrity> And 2 offered to buy it out
[00:29:55] <Eywind> wow Rawrity
[00:29:59] <Eywind> she shoulda sold it and went and bought a new one
[00:30:15] <Rawrity> The deck is rather rare one
[00:30:20] <Eywind> ook
[00:30:27] <Eywind> souther biscuits and gravy chips... let's see

[00:31:31] <DinkyBot> Rawrity: even with that much money then.
[00:31:41] <Rawrity> She could sell it for 70 (market value) or even 90Eur, becuse she bought it for 50
[00:31:59] <Rawrity> That would be the deck only
[00:32:23] <Eywind> niceee]
[00:33:53] <Rawrity> Bur because of rarity of the deck and no forseeable re-prints (unless you order it for about 80-90, as a custom print)
[00:34:06] <Rawrity> But*
[00:34:32] <One-Trick> i never really cared what the print was- chances are itd get all scraped off pretty quick anyway

[23:47:57] <Hamtramck> I listened to pink floyd a lot in highschool :T
[23:47:59] <Hamtramck> nostalgia :T
[23:48:13] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> well then starting right from the middle of the song
[23:48:18] <RandomNinja> madness I say
[23:48:30] <RandomNinja> Hamtramck, Pink Floyd is gud
[23:48:55] <Hamtramck> I'm a terrible floyd fan though.
[23:48:55] <RandomNinja> sounds not suspicious https://i.imgur.com/BO0TNfK.jpg
[23:48:55] *** FN_away is now known as FN
[23:49:16] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> too many illuminuts
[23:49:31] <Hamtramck> Like my top three floyd albums, in no order, were Piper, Final Cut, and Atom Heart Mother
[23:49:34] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> illuminaughty
[23:49:36] <RandomNinja> https://i.imgur.com/kdIUETy.jpg
[23:49:47] <Hamtramck> and then I liked meddle, animals, and the wall more than DSOTM and WYWH
[23:49:49] <FN> Where can I apply?
[23:49:55] <RandomNinja> so psychadelic era Floyd
[23:49:58] <Hamtramck> I wasn't realy big on that one soundtrack they did
[23:50:07] <Hamtramck> bu I don't think peple were in general
[23:50:07] <RandomNinja> The Wall?
[23:50:08] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> gooooooooooooood dammit
[23:50:09] <Hamtramck> Obscuredby Clouds
[23:50:11] <RandomNinja> or whih one?
[23:50:13] <RandomNinja> oh right
[23:50:24] <Hamtramck> Dude I loved The Wall, I just though TFC was a more concise version of it is all.
[23:50:39] <RandomNinja> stream pls
[23:50:48] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> well screa taht song then
[23:50:53] <Hamtramck> Actually okay Alan's Psychedlic Breakfast never did a lot for me but the rest of AHM is really <3 to me
[23:50:56] <RandomNinja> Wall > WYWH > DSOTM imo
[23:51:13] <RandomNinja> Final Cut probably makes 4th, followed by Animals
[23:51:24] <LocDogX86X> the Orchestral is so persistant its wants too be heard
[23:51:25] <Hamtramck> I didn't really like WYWH that much in retrospect.
[23:51:47] <RandomNinja> there's nothing really mindblowing on it
[23:51:50] <RandomNinja> just really solid
[23:52:11] <Hamtramck> First floyd was Animals
[23:52:23] *** Vigilant_Watch is now known as Away|Vigilant_Watch
[23:52:26] <Hamtramck> though I think the first floyd song I heard was TWo Suns in the Sunset

[23:53:20] <DinkyBot>  [ Welcome to the Machine - Quest - World of Warcraft ]
[23:53:29] <RandomNinja> also the description
[23:53:39] <Hamtramck> I listened to AHM and TFC a lot during the same summer though (2004) and really latched onto them because there was stuff going on in my family and I needed something to latch onto
[23:54:50] <Hamtramck> ... I sometimes can't tell if my headphone are buzzy because I got something on the drivers or because they're just exposing noise in the original recordings that my other earbuds aren't :S
[23:55:03] <RandomNinja> which headphones?
[23:55:13] <Hamtramck> The open-back kosses
[23:55:29] <RandomNinja> yeah I can imagine those being pretty transparent
[23:55:48] <Hamtramck> Getting stuff on the drivers is apparently just a thing that happens with openback headphones :SSSSS
[23:56:04] <RandomNinja> delicious midrange and treble details tho
[23:56:07] <Hamtramck> yes.
[23:56:18] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> but what bout that bass?
[23:56:26] <RandomNinja> meh :P
[23:56:32] <Hamtramck> These are pretty bassy.
[23:56:48] <RandomNinja> have you listened to Time with them?
[23:56:59] <Hamtramck> No, and my copy of DSOTM cracked like
[23:57:02] <Hamtramck> over ten years ago
[23:57:04] <RandomNinja> darn
[23:57:09] <RandomNinja> acquire vinyl rips
[23:57:11] <Hamtramck> I could probably torrent some flacs
[23:57:41] <RandomNinja> the soundstage on that song is incredible
[23:59:30] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> well i'm afraid thats all folks
[23:59:39] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> hope you had fun
[23:59:53] <The_Iron_Pony[RzR]> sorry for all the derps :/
