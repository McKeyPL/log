[03:31:19] <PinkieShy> I found OutBrowse PUP virus on the computer..
[03:31:39] <PinkieShy> its not installed but just the installer.. Hitman pro detected it and avast is removing it 
[03:31:41] <wobniaR> Sounds like adware
[03:31:45] <RandomNinja> murderize it
[03:31:48] <wobniaR> PUP is potentially unwanted program
[03:32:03] <PinkieShy> Do you guys think if its not running and its not installed any in browsers, that it didn't install and i am safe
[03:32:15] <thereallynewmop12100> PinkieShy: I discovered RSA yeterday..
[03:32:25] <PinkieShy> I don't want to have to reinstall windows again xD
[03:32:36] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> DinkyBot wat
[03:33:21] <PinkieShy> wobniaR do you think i am safe if its not installed but yet the installer is on the computer? Its digitally signed by "BeSt InsTaller"
[03:33:50] <wobniaR> Obviously fake, run malwarebytes and/or your anti-virus and remove it
[03:34:03] <PinkieShy> wobniaR i did.
[03:34:28] <PinkieShy> it removed the installer.. But do you think that if it didn't install in the browsers, or running in the background or in program and features or program files.. do you think i am safe
[03:34:35] <PinkieShy> like virus free now :3
[03:35:03] <RandomNinja> if your antivirus found it you should be good
[03:35:08] <PinkieShy> ok
[03:35:09] <wobniaR> If your AV software got it then you're good, whether it made other changes it's difficult to tell

[05:11:16] <ynoP> I seriously cannot fix this stupid Windows 10 bug. Every time I wake it up from sleep, the same thing happens: All metro based apps, including settings, the start menu. the action center, and Cortana all stop working and won't open.
[05:11:44] <Moon_Solace> ynoP!
[05:11:49] <ynoP> And every time I try to apply the Powershell command fix it does nothing
[05:11:50] * Moon_Solace glomps ynoP 
[05:12:01] * ynoP flips
[05:12:58] <ynoP> Its been some time
[05:12:59] <Moon_Solace> Anyway, I'm not sure what's wrong with your computer. Only problem my OS system has is that Cortana has trouble reconizing my voice.
[05:13:21] <ynoP> It's specifically a metro problem
[05:13:51] <Moon_Solace> ah ok
[05:13:59] <One-Trick> have you tried hibernate?

[05:14:44] <One-Trick> like, ever
[05:15:08] <ynoP> Restarting or shutting down fixes the error, but only temporarily, because it just happens again randomly if I idle long enough
[05:15:14] <ynoP> Or sleep
[05:16:28] <One-Trick> could be your video card
[05:16:34] <One-Trick> does this happen because the screen shuts down?
[05:16:42] <ynoP> I'm really not sure
[05:16:56] <One-Trick> force your screens to turn off
[05:17:07] <One-Trick> hang on, might be a command for that
[05:17:33] <One-Trick> %systemroot%\system32\scrnsave.scr /s

[05:19:02] <One-Trick> if it fails to come back after being removed from video memory then it could be a driver

[05:20:48] <One-Trick> well, i had to guess how much sugar was in the cake
[05:20:58] <Moon_Solace> A banana should spike your sugar for a short amount of time while you make something.
[05:21:01] <One-Trick> i guess i over estimated

[05:25:33] <ynoP> Which driver would this be?

[05:25:48] <One-Trick> win+r -> dxdiag
[05:25:49] <ynoP> That's what I'm thinking
[05:26:13] <Moon_Solace> I thought intel made the core proccessores?
[05:26:19] <ynoP> Yeah
[05:26:23] <One-Trick> intel makes onboard laptop video

[05:36:44] <ynoP> I dunno, they don't seem much different
[05:36:57] <ynoP> I think most of the code is recycled anyway

[05:37:06] <One-Trick> well
[05:37:07] <One-Trick> most
[05:37:36] <One-Trick> in fact, windows 10 has moments where it will report its windows 8.1 for compliance with certain api's

[07:32:17] <Eywind> Sorry I'm here
[07:32:43] <Eywind> Yeah sometimes when people say "well x cooked it" that could mean "well it's a coin flip if I'm in the bathroom all day tomorrow"
[07:32:46] <Eywind> like me, for instance
[07:33:45] <One-Trick> there was a time quake was going to be a professional chef but the cordon bleu couldnt get their tuition process in order
[07:33:57] <One-Trick> so he just cooks at home now
[07:34:08] <Eywind> oh wow
[07:34:11] <Eywind> dats pretty sweet
[07:35:22] <Hamtramck> spending an entire day in a bathroom seems nice. Bathrooms are relaxing. Especially the ones that don't have ghosts.
[07:36:14] <Eywind> you say that until you do that
[07:36:18] <Eywind> trust me, not worth it
[07:36:32] <One-Trick> i like to read in mine. its quiet and the a/c is cold in there

[08:20:19] <Eywind> AJ and Pinkie Pie reasonably close
