[01:17:36] <FN> Here's the cryptographic puzzle, guess the country:  _;*
[01:17:38] <RandomNinja> could you excuse alcoholism by being a germaphobe?
[01:17:57] <RandomNinja> you're killing the bugs inside you
[01:18:03] <Inucroft[NLR]> RandomNinja ahahaha YES

[01:19:26] <RandomNinja> again, phobias aren't reasonable
[01:19:46] <RandomNinja> also I'm pretty sure anything that survives in there can handle the alcohol as well
[01:20:12] <Inucroft[NLR]> moreover, it does minimal dmg to our enyzimes within our gut
[01:20:36] <Inucroft[NLR]> the bigger issue is the sugar created from the alchahol, kidney & liver dmg
[01:20:39] <FN> Alcoholics often develop a swollen big red nose because of the excess of bacteria that splits the alcohol
[01:20:48] <RandomNinja> interesting
[01:21:24] <FN> It starts to dominate their intestine, producing certain chemicals, which result in this weird nose thing

[05:24:09] <wobniaR> You were their age not too long ago
[05:24:45] <Hamtramck> Yes that's why this is confusing because I really *don't* remember people acting like this when I went to uni.
[05:25:07] <wobniaR> People are different, no matter the age
[05:25:23] <wobniaR> Some take a little more time to grow up than others
[05:25:46] <Hamtramck> I think Ohio State's kind of drawing a... less... studently student population.
[05:26:05] <wobniaR> Less nerds you mean?
[05:26:27] <Hamtramck> Ffffff how do I explain thiiiiiiiis. It's kind of a twofold issue.
[05:26:52] <Hamtramck> Part of it is that OSU draws the WOO COLLEGE, PARTY set. Part of it's the the university kiiiiind of exists in a bubble.
[05:26:56] <wobniaR> I don't see why this matters to you, you graduated lol
[05:27:17] <Hamtramck> I live next to the university and the student population is something I'm having to deal with a lot right now.

[05:28:51] <Faith> woo spring break
[05:29:00] <Hamtramck> Anyway the latter problem -- OSU being in a bubble -- has a pretty bad impact on the professors too and plays a large part in why I didn't continue with grad school.
[05:29:06] <wobniaR> But it's fall
[05:29:22] <Hamtramck> Anyway they've got a lot of policies in place that keep the students on campus and stuck in /college bubble/ which means they don't, uh, grow up.
[05:29:27] <Faith> it's always spring break when you're at OSU

[05:40:44] <Hamtramck> Lucky :(
[05:41:15] <Snap_Shot> Midli I own a 1911 Colt Defender so I wasn't worried. 
[05:41:34] <Snap_Shot> Only time it was a problem is if it was on my street. beyond that i wouldn't care
[05:42:01] <wobniaR> I live high up so gunshots on ground level is whatever
[05:42:05] <Hamtramck> I used to work in Dublin, out neat the mall. I'm working downtown, now.
[05:42:13] <Hamtramck> Downtown's even more boring than Dublin.
[05:42:30] <Snap_Shot> but downtown has COSI
[05:42:31] <wobniaR> Also I live right next to a highway so the noise from that drowns out most of the noise
[05:42:59] <Hamtramck> COSI got too many chilluns.

[05:48:31] <Hamtramck> What I don't get is how empty a lot of the city seems. Metro area's population is like 1.78, but I just don't see people outside that often, except for the campus area.
[05:49:07] <Hamtramck> Then again I don't drive anyway, so I acknowledge that I'm defective :S
[05:49:37] <wobniaR> Because it is empty
[05:50:38] <Kelazi5> Yeah my town is kinda boring too but then again it isn't like I go outside for much besides work
[05:51:08] <wobniaR> First thing I notice in an overnight trip to other cities is that they're dead in the middle of the night
[05:53:12] <Hamtramck> That's like what I was saying earlier about why I'd have a hard time figuring out where to move to -- I don't think the problems I have with columbus are at all unique to columbus.
[05:53:50] <wobniaR> If you want to see people and traffic come to NYC, got that and really high taxes and cost of living, hope you're rich
[05:54:19] <Hamtramck> I didn't really like NYC when I visited it.
[05:54:27] <Hamtramck> Manhattan at least was really fake feeling.
[05:55:04] <wobniaR> It's exactly what it looks like, a nice welcoming place if you got money, cold and dirty if you don't
[05:55:19] <Hamtramck> It felt like a giant tourist trap.
[05:55:38] <wobniaR> Tourism is a big income source for the city
[05:55:58] <wobniaR> Tourists throw their money away on worthless merchandise and overpriced $4 water bottles
[05:56:25] <wobniaR> They also walk really slow and take lots of pictures
[05:57:02] <Hamtramck> Time Square was like the stupidest thing I've ever
[05:57:16] <wobniaR> I never go there
[05:57:32] <wobniaR> Way too many tourists and other stuff like those people walking around in mascot costumes
[05:57:54] <Hamtramck> wobniar those are called furries, and fursuiting is a deep and important part of their culture
[05:57:59] <wobniaR> pls
[05:58:01] <Kelazi5> Ah, I figured it was pretty much overhyped
[05:58:19] <wobniaR> I mean there's a really big toys r us over at times square, and a bunch of signs and flashing lights
[05:58:48] <Hamtramck> NYC felt like what would happen if someone likes Washington DC a lot and tried to recreate it in SimCity but they were really drunk at the time and didn't entirely understand what they were doing.
[05:59:07] <wobniaR> I strongly disliked DC both times I went

[16:36:10] <RandomNinja> google nexus 5 is ~€300-350

[19:03:22] <Snap_Shot> I could get a DeLorean. Know a guy a few blocks away selling one. only wants $25,000 for it too
[19:03:40] <MojoJojo> Only...
[19:04:05] <MojoJojo> for a hunk of crap with a junk French engine and 80s GM electronics whose only appealing factor is the doors
[19:05:00] <Snap_Shot> True. if i ever pay $25,000 for a car it would be for a '69 GTO Judge with a 429 in it
[19:05:14] <MojoJojo> Good luck finding that for $25k
[19:05:43] <Snap_Shot> Seen it a few years ago at a car show but since i was just getting out of highschool i didn't have that kinda cash
[19:06:21] <MojoJojo> To find one for $25k would purely be a restoration project, probably wouldn't even have an engine or transmission
[19:06:28] <MojoJojo> that's closer to a $125k car
[19:07:13] <MojoJojo> Let me look it up here real quick
[19:07:47] <MojoJojo> Current value for a restored GTO Judge is $80k
[19:08:02] <MojoJojo> That's with the 400ci
[19:10:37] <Snap_Shot> well there is this one that the guy is selling for 55 http://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/cars-for-sale/pontiac/gto-judge/1766487.html
