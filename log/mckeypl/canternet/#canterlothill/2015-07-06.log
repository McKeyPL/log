[02:32:27] <wobniaR> I don't know if you can win anything more than caps from caravan

[02:32:44] <RandomNinja> yeah but like
[02:33:07] <wobniaR> If caravan was in fallout 3 maybe, it's a pain to get caps and stuff there in comparison
[02:33:10] <RandomNinja> I've got 50K caps at level 12 and I haven't broken any of the casinos

[02:35:21] <wobniaR> Sounds like a good example for the kids
[02:36:51] <RandomNinja> apparently stacking all the druggie perks/traits makes the GRX Turbo last for 16 seconds
[02:37:13] <RandomNinja> and you have 10 of them
[02:37:52] <wobniaR> Endless turbo spam sounds op
[02:37:59] <RandomNinja> pretty much
[02:38:22] <RandomNinja> especially since it removes the main advantage of Deathclaws, being ridiculously fast
[02:38:38] <RandomNinja> you can basically dodge their leaps
[02:38:48] <wobniaR> Add a nice paralyzing palm or super slam to that to rekt deathclaws
[02:39:53] <wobniaR> Super slam probably better cause you won't need vats
[02:40:08] <RandomNinja> I did the math a few days ago, with only the crit perks Embrace of the Mantis King does like 250 dps
[02:40:23] <RandomNinja> that's without damage bonuses and attack speed
[02:40:43] <RandomNinja> you could probably kill a deathclaw in between 2 of their hits without turbo

[05:04:56] <RandomNinja> I watched the cartoon when I was very young
[05:05:21] <EM-C> You've never read the book?  It's one of the most delightful children's books ever.
[05:05:40] <EM-C> Very clever and funny.  It doesn't patronize the reader.
[05:06:06] <EM-C> Anyway, it was great how the reconnected to the very first episode again.

[05:07:44] <EM-C> I read A.A. Milne's "Pooh" books once.  I wish I had a copy of them.  They were pretty good too.
[05:08:00] <Sombra> That's because she's a top background pony, they copy pasta here in pretty much everywhere.
[05:08:12] <Sombra> I remember watching the wedding scene and seeing like 12 colgates.
[05:08:20] <EM-C> Which is why it was a bad idea for them to canonically make her a resident of Canterlot.

[05:08:42] <wobniaR> ^
[05:08:50] <thereallynewmop12100> Music ffrom ITV Nightscreen <3 
[05:08:51] <RandomNinja> the non-disguised one was just a distraction
[05:08:52] <thereallynewmop12100> *from
[05:09:14] <RandomNinja> gaming as explained by Pinkie https://i.imgur.com/ieFFil8.jpg
[05:09:18] <EM-C> Poor Moondancer though!  But seriously, this was a really good episode.
[05:09:27] <wobniaR> >not 120fps
[05:09:28] <EM-C> And Pinkie to the rescue!
[05:09:36] <RandomNinja> also, mild seizure warning
[05:09:41] <EM-C> Pinkie's really been on a roll this season.
[05:09:58] <MikeM> Like buttah
[05:10:07] <RandomNinja> like butts?
[05:10:13] <wobniaR> https://derpiboo.ru/930914 Look at Minuette's face of evil here
[05:10:14] <EM-C> She saved Rainbow's life, she traversed all of Equestria to try to throw a party, and now she brings friendship and fun to Moondancer.
[05:10:29] <RandomNinja> wobniaR, good enough for me
[05:10:33] <RandomNinja> deploy the inquisition
[05:10:34] <MikeM> Maybe Pinkie's inner alicornness will come out at the end.
[05:10:58] <RandomNinja> yeah Pink Horse is quickly climbing Best Horse ladder this season
[05:11:01] <Ypsilanti> man what if moondancer is the neville long bottoms to twilight sparkle's harry potter?????
[05:11:22] <EM-C> She'd have *another* evil counterpart/rival!
[05:11:28] <RandomNinja> the actual intereresting background character?
[05:12:09] <EM-C> MikeM: Pinkie is great this season.  I really like it when she dove down to keep Rainbow from falling.
[05:12:49] <EM-C> True, she untied the rope to do so, but she was able to catch her and then Gilda was able to grab a ledge.
[05:12:55] <MikeM> I like that she always does that. Diving now to save friends, consequences later.
[05:13:16] <RandomNinja> disregard logic, apply friendship
[05:13:21] <EM-C> People who make Pinkie an Omnipotent Entity of Evil in their stories should be ashamed!
[05:13:28] <RandomNinja> also, Pinkie Pie Is Watching You confirmed

[05:14:07] <wobniaR> So stealthy
[05:14:14] <RandomNinja> 10/10 would wear in public
[05:14:18] <MikeM> Twilight's a master of spycraft.
[05:14:35] <Sombra> I'm pretty sure Pinkie Pie is a master of spycract
[05:14:37] <Sombra> *craft
[05:14:43] <Sombra> She has a fully Fluttershy suit.
[05:15:16] <wobniaR> Doesn't everyone?
[05:15:42] * wobniaR hides his 1000 different disguises, and mustaches
[05:15:58] <MikeM> Reminds me of a fanfic about Lyra buying a Lyra suit.
[05:16:13] <Sombra> Why wasn't lyra in there...
[05:16:22] <MikeM> She was in Ponyville
[05:17:26] <MikeM> So, since it was a Larson ep, I wonder what got cut.
[05:17:29] <EM-C> Yeah...Lyra moved to Ponyville, but she and Colgate are always visiting each other.  Good save there, writers.
[05:17:54] <EM-C> Not!
[05:18:01] <Ypsilanti> Anyway yeah, last episode + canterlot wedding == weird feeling of /alienation/ in how twilight just left her old life behind suddenly and completely == this is what graduating from college feels like.
[05:18:21] <EM-C> Like I said, it's like Mole returning to Mole End.
[05:19:14] <EM-C> None of the fics I like are being updated.
[05:19:15] <wobniaR> Another changeling invasion MikeM probably
[05:19:20] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: This song played on ITV Nightscreen sounds like Skrillex + Owl City + Fritzybeat

[05:19:52] <DerpyBot> Look into my eyes, maybe you can see her! Deeper...Deeeper...

[06:09:26] <Ypsilanti> it was sort of racist
[06:09:46] <Ypsilanti> My uncle is half-yak and he has been trying to live down stereotypes like YAK SMASH for years.
[06:10:10] <Ypsilanti> ... Unrelated, but we don't talk about my grandpa much.
[06:10:23] <MikeM> Maybe the episode will help. It showed that there's more to Yaks than smashing.

[22:20:03] <EM-C> I push the power button and when I let it go it's still not on.

[22:20:14] <EM-C> I repeat numerous times and it's still not coming on.
[22:20:17] <RandomNinja> sounds like a loose cable to me, yeah

[22:21:28] <EM-C> I hold the button, the light stays on.
[22:21:33] <EM-C> But the computer still doesn't turn on.
[22:21:48] <EM-C> Sometimes the computer motor comes on for just a little while but then it goes back off.
[22:22:01] <EM-C> And I have to keep pushing the button.
[22:22:21] <EM-C> Next time I turn the computer off I might not be able to turn it back on again.

[22:26:53] <EM-C> I haven't disconnected and reconnected them anytime recently.
[22:26:59] <RandomNinja> just because they're all connected doesn't mean the cables themselves aren't damaged
[22:27:11] <EM-C> There's no difference between them today and them yesterday when they worked just fine.
[22:27:17] <Inucroft[NLR]> :/
[22:27:28] <RandomNinja> but if you haven't touched them recently, it's probably the power supply unit
[22:27:40] <EM-C> The only thing I've disconnected lately is the modem when it was thundering.
[22:27:49] <EM-C> That's what the guy at the shop said.
[22:28:01] <EM-C> I just hope it's something easy to fix.
[22:28:32] <RandomNinja> from the perspective of anyone with experience, yes it is
[22:28:58] <EM-C> It's just another bout of having to disconnect everything, take it to the shop, and then reconnect everything.

[22:30:58] <RandomNinja> replacing the PSU won't affect your files though
[22:31:11] <EM-C> I know.  That's the good part.  I hope that's the only problem.
[22:31:27] <EM-C> The guy hasn't looked at it yet; I just described the problem over the phone.
[22:31:35] <Trildar> So... I have no idea when it became 4:30 in the morning.
[22:31:40] <RandomNinja> of the only problem is not starting or shutting down randomly, it most likely is
[22:31:57] <EM-C> It doesn't shut down randomly.  It just doesn't want to come on.
[22:32:15] <EM-C> I don't know why a computer needs a power supply if it's plugged in.
[22:32:35] <EM-C> You'd think the electric connection would supply all the power it needs.
