[02:18:38] <DatTaxPony> I think I'm the only one who actually like the yaks.
[02:18:45] <Flarecobra> I liked the Yaks...
[02:18:57] <Flarecobra> You knew where you stood with them
[02:19:15] <Kemy> I think it was more that the Yaks thought the ponies were being rude about their culture, in hindsight it was a bad choice from Twilight.
[02:19:29] <Marbi-Z> Now I wanna see an episode where Twi has to stop Illegal immigrants from Hex-ico XD
[02:19:59] <Flameheart_Kindle> or Mexicolt.

[02:20:23] <Marbi-Z> Wouldn't that be ironic for poor Twi? (The princess of friendship Starts a war)
[02:20:39] <ricardofr-200> Yep Indeed.
[02:20:46] <Flarecobra> Yaks smash things not perfect. Things not perfect makes others try to fix things. Fix not perfect, so Yaks smash, which drives friends away. It vicous cycle.

[02:48:40] <Marjan_Lion> Yaaaay! :D
[02:48:40] <LittlesToyCompany> mid season hiatus is meant to get the series back to where it is suppose to be. Next season will probably start in the fall like it is suppose to. Thats my opinion 
[02:48:41] <Marbi-Z> I wanna collect this stuff but I don't have any space... Am I the only one here that has to share a room?
