[00:18:29] <IBAIPshow> This is definitely an episode that puts our season line-up of creatives in context
[00:19:44] <IBAIPshow> Which is 12x 11 episode seasons that cover people from DeviantArt, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and more
[00:19:49] <IBAIPshow> How is everypony?
[00:19:57] <LunaticHell> 8/10 too much water
[00:20:07] <IBAIPshow> haha
[00:20:09] <IBAIPshow> okay
[00:20:30] <IBAIPshow> Why's too much water?
[00:20:44] <LunaticHell> I've been around for a while, you will see me refferencing stuff way older than that.
[00:20:56] <LunaticHell> It's a refference joke.
[00:20:58] <IBAIPshow> Haha, cool :)
[00:21:31] <IBAIPshow> Must say, definitely enjoyed the latest ep of mlp
[00:21:36] <LunaticHell> IGN made a review about one of dem pokemon games and gave it a 8/10, because "too much water"
[00:21:44] <IBAIPshow> lol
[00:21:47] <IBAIPshow> i see
[00:22:06] <LunaticHell> I loved the episode.
[00:22:16] <LunaticHell> Especially the little gummy kiss at the start.
[00:22:22] <IBAIPshow> Gilda: The Redemption ;)
[00:22:26] <IBAIPshow> Oh yes
[00:22:31] <IBAIPshow> That was priceless
[00:22:42] <IBAIPshow> Glad the place didn't burn down
[00:23:12] <LunaticHell> Well how? The oven was off, the cake was cooling off.
[00:23:17] <IBAIPshow> Ah
[00:23:21] <IBAIPshow> Cool
[00:23:34] <LunaticHell> Yup, I did remember that detail. :P
[00:23:45] <IBAIPshow> Good job
[00:23:50] <IBAIPshow> #LuckyKnightFail
[00:23:51] <LunaticHell> Before she left she told gummy to let the first layer cool off about 1 hour.
[00:24:03] <IBAIPshow> Aha!
[00:24:28] <LunaticHell> That's why it takes 15 hours for the cake, by the way. ;)
[00:24:39] <IBAIPshow> For some reason I had it in my head that Gummy was to bake the next layer
[00:24:56] <LunaticHell> He was supposed to.
[00:25:13] <LunaticHell> He's an aligator, he doesn't bake.
[00:25:23] <IBAIPshow> Hence, the joke
[00:25:26] <IBAIPshow> :P

[04:49:22] <Hamtramck> Keanu Reeves already is an owl

[04:49:43] <StrykerVylon> The muggles who can use magic introduce the internet to the wizards and they adapt to it?
[04:50:16] <Hamtramck> No the wizards wouldn't do that that's too straightforward

[04:50:49] <StrykerVylon> Maybe if their head of state is like Mr. Weasley. 
[04:51:19] <Hamtramck> Also like canonically they don't like muggle technology because it's sort of implicit that wizard magic couldn't really hold up to like human guns

[05:52:09] <ynoP> Good

[05:52:32] <MikeM> And it has JT

[05:53:36] <ynoP> Maybe it needed more time, I dunno

[05:55:08] <ynoP> It was probably a problem with Amazon or my BluRay player

[05:57:40] <ynoP> We didn't really get much of anywhere and probably spent more time arguing about writing than actually writing

[06:01:35] <ynoP> Yup
[06:01:40] <ynoP> And revenge
[06:01:54] <Hamtramck> Stories always got conflict. I want stories without conflict.
[06:01:59] <ynoP> But we basically had 3 main elements
[06:02:04] <ynoP> The protagonist
[06:02:07] <ynoP> The girl
[06:02:25] <ynoP> And "The group"
[06:02:31] <ynoP> AKA the bad guys
[06:03:14] <ynoP> We called them the group because we couldn't come up with anything good and defaulted to secret terrorists
[06:03:26] <ynoP> It made sense when I was 13
[06:05:14] <ynoP> Then I wrote another Matrix-like story on the side and we merged them together

[06:07:13] <ynoP> MikeM: Is that first hand information?
[06:08:04] <Hamtramck> I should totally write a story about being burnt out in northwestern Ohio and too caught up in paranoid to be able to appreciate the beauty of how flat and nowhere that place is :333

[06:14:17] <wobniaR> A story without conflict is boring slice of life
[06:14:33] <wobniaR> Even slice of life has conflict like who stole the cupcakes?
[06:14:42] <Eywind> It was Spike
[06:14:44] <Eywind> Spike stole the cupcakes
[06:14:46] <ynoP> Suddenly I'm reminded of Double Rainboom. Remember that part near the end where Pinkie says "Wait, you mean you AREN'T supposed to take things without permission?"
[06:15:12] <ynoP> I don't know if there's a trope for that, but if there is, I would call it moral cramming
[06:16:00] <wobniaR> Moral cramming, so almost every episode of MLP?
[06:16:58] <ynoP> It reminds me of a Garfield comic where Garfield says something along the lines of "Well, apparently I have to add educational value to this stuff because it's required now."

[11:07:44] <RandomNinja> JockeTF yes I know! :D
[11:07:48] * Unixkitty softly beeps RandomNinja's nose
[11:07:52] <RandomNinja> #GetHype
[11:08:03] * RandomNinja scrunchies
[11:08:20] <RandomNinja> Electric Castle?
[11:08:41] <Unixkitty> That one and The Human Equation as well, I love both of those albumbs equally
[11:08:51] <Unixkitty> The latter is like more deep though I think
[11:10:39] <RandomNinja> Definitely, human equation has a lot of substance
[11:10:56] <RandomNinja> Electric Castle is just a really awesome opera
[11:11:12] <Unixkitty> It's glorious
[11:12:04] <RandomNinja> :3
[11:12:16] <Unixkitty> The funny thing now is that I find listening to lower quality that FLAC basically makes me hear the compression, if you know what I mean
[11:12:21] <Unixkitty> than*
[11:12:29] <RandomNinja> Did you listen to The Final Experiment yet
[11:12:48] <Unixkitty> Downloaded, will probably sometime this week
[11:13:24] <RandomNinja> What else is left? :P
[11:13:41] <Unixkitty> We started playing Minecraft again, so as a slightly related matter I find myself listening to more music because of that
[11:13:56] * Ali sssssss's behind Unixkitty 
[11:14:11] * Unixkitty eeeeps and dives under RandomNinja 
[11:14:25] * Ali explodes into more Ali's!
[11:14:33] * Ali all glomp Unixkitty and nom her.
[11:14:39] * RandomNinja tactically boops all the Alis
[11:14:39] <DinkyBot> !moo
[11:14:39] * DerpyBot chews on some hay and moos at DinkyBot
[11:14:40] * DerpyBot pours her muffin a glass of milk
[11:14:40] <DinkyBot> Mmm! Thank you, momma!
[11:15:00] * Unixkitty starts uncontrollably giggling and flailing

[11:15:34] * Unixkitty pulls Ali and RandomNinja into snuggles
[11:15:40] <Ali> COuld be worse
[11:15:46] <Ali> Could just make ghast noises
[11:15:49] <Ali> HATE GHASTS
[11:15:58] <Unixkitty> Darn caps limits
[11:16:05] <Unixkitty> tell me about it
[11:16:10] <Unixkitty> Imagine that is all in caps ^
[11:16:32] <RandomNinja> ALL CAPS YOU SAY?
[11:16:42] <RandomNinja> :P
[11:16:45] *** Cloud_Zephyr|Away is now known as Cloud_Zephyr
[11:16:48] <Unixkitty> At one point I used to live in the nether, and we had that Soul Shards mod which basically allowed you to collect mob souls and use them for spawners later
[11:17:02] <Unixkitty> So I would build towers around my nether castle and shoot ghasts for fun
[11:17:09] * RandomNinja applies Kung Fury hype to Unixkitty and Ali
[11:17:31] <Unixkitty> After a few weeks I remember having an almost full chest of 500 soul filled each gems...
[11:17:33] <Ali> Ghasts suck cause in vanilla, the only real way to kill them was with bow and arrow, and 95% of the time they're floating over lava.
[11:17:47] <Unixkitty> Which renders picking up their tears a pain
[11:17:56] <Ali> Eeyup
[11:18:04] <RandomNinja> Are those the floaty things who shoot fireballs?
[11:18:05] <Unixkitty> And we need tears of our enemies.
[11:18:11] <Ali> RandomNinja, yes
[11:18:23] <Unixkitty> Giant white jellyfish
[11:18:23] <Ali> The big white blobs that go BRREEEEEEE when they see you.
[11:18:26] <RandomNinja> Yeah wurst thing
[11:18:33] <Unixkitty> Even when they NOT see you too
[11:18:45] <Unixkitty> Honestly, their whining sounds are like the most annoying thing ever
[11:18:59] <Ali> And that you can hear them from like 100 blocks or something?
[11:19:06] *** Joins: SkyHighAway (Tom@Pony-hhhij4.threembb.co.uk)
[11:19:07] <Unixkitty> Haha pretty much
[11:19:20] <Unixkitty> This time around we have a Turret mod though.
[11:19:33] <Unixkitty> I am sooooooo building a defense system around our Nether spawn.

[11:19:52] <Ali> And then the portal gets disabled before you can set things up properly.
[11:20:17] <RandomNinja> Yay being trapped in the nether
[11:20:24] <Unixkitty> You think I wouldn't take that possibility into consideration? :P
[11:20:42] <Unixkitty> Also the guys already made our main portal rather safe I think
[11:20:46] <Unixkitty> It's in a cave too
[11:21:26] <Unixkitty> By the way, beautiful Streams mod for rivers and ATG for hills http://i.unixkitty.net/2015-05-24_14.24.45.png
[11:21:57] * Ali gets the TNT ready!
[11:21:59] <RandomNinja> Needs moar ENB 
[11:22:05] * RandomNinja steals Ali!
[11:22:17] <Unixkitty> I didn't really feel like having shaders on this time
[11:22:18] * Ali eeps and flails, which lights the TNT block
[11:22:25] * Unixkitty puffycheeks
[11:23:12] * RandomNinja flails and implodes
[11:23:49] <Ali> Unixkitty, did you ever have the power armor mod on or anything like it?  I don't remember what the mod was really called though
[11:24:14] <Unixkitty> http://machinemuse.net/
[11:24:19] *** Quits: SkyHighAway (Tom@Pony-hhhij4.threembb.co.uk) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[11:24:35] <Unixkitty> We used to have that mod at one point, but I wouldn't say I ever actually played with it myself
[11:24:38] * Ali flails, she didn't want a link, she doesn't remember it
[11:24:48] <Ali> Well anyway it had a arm item
[11:24:54] <Unixkitty> That's the one
[11:24:56] <Ali> That could equip a railgun to it.
[11:25:10] <Unixkitty> I watched Direwolf20's spotlights on it though
[11:25:23] <Ali> I would always turn the power up to max, and laugh at the recoil
[11:25:36] <Unixkitty> Oh was that the blue energy ball thing or something else they added later?
[11:25:39] <Ali> You literally could fly with that thing if you had enough power
[11:25:45] <Unixkitty> Haha really
[11:25:54] <Ali> No its a railgun type shot
[11:26:00] <Ali> Would OHKO any basic mob
[11:26:12] <Unixkitty> Must have been some other module for the arm then
[11:26:12] <Ali> but the recoil shot you up about 20 blocks
[11:26:24] <Unixkitty> That does sound rather funny
[11:26:36] *** Joins: SkyHighAway (Tom@Pony-hhhij4.threembb.co.uk)
[11:26:50] <Ali> Well I used it to snipe Skellies and Zombehs
[11:27:09] <Unixkitty> Noscope mlg?
[11:27:11] * Unixkitty shot
[11:27:31] * Ali blows off railgun
[11:27:47] <Unixkitty> We seem to have a ton of different mob mods this time around, could probably be fun to have different weapons to counter that
[11:27:54] <Ali> But it was too much of a pain to make the weapon though
[11:28:06] <Ali> you HAD to use IC2 to make the items
[11:28:13] <Unixkitty> Oh yes, I think I remember how complex it's recipes were
[11:28:21] <Unixkitty> Nevermind if you had... gregtech
[11:28:47] * Ali hisses at Unixkitty for mentioning that mod.
[11:29:02] * Unixkitty shivered herself upon typing that out
[11:29:07] *** Joins: Sombra (Iceman@Darkhorse21)
[11:29:33] <Unixkitty> I don't think we've even played with IC2 by itself in years
[11:29:40] <Ali> I haven't either
[11:29:56] <Unixkitty> It's Thermal Expansion and EnderIO nowadays
[11:30:01] <Ali> But you needed this one machine that was only IC2 that would make all the parts for the item
[11:30:19] <Ali> Either that or waste a lot of time with 3 items constantly needing to be crafted
[11:30:39] <Ali> TE is the go to power supply nowadays cause its not painful to start
[11:30:55] <Ali> IC2, you need to waste so much mats to get 1EU of power.
[11:31:01] <RandomNinja> Power Armor?
[11:31:05] <Sombra> Ohhh man.

[11:31:21] <RandomNinja> Dinky no

[11:31:41] <DinkyBot> Derp...closed the wrong tab.
[11:31:44] <Unixkitty> I am such a mod noob now though
[11:32:09] <Sombra> Ohhh man.
[11:32:17] <RandomNinja> Have you tried being not a noob?
[11:32:43] <Unixkitty> I practically only build pretties and have fun caving as well as mob murdering, the guy I live with slowly teaches me newer modded stuff

[11:33:06] * Ali would play, but feels like she woudln't fit in and timezones
[11:33:10] <Unixkitty> I do know Tinker's Construct and a little bit of TE though, as well as Buildcraft
[11:33:14] <Unixkitty> But that's about it
[11:33:47] <Unixkitty> Considering I'm in Europe and most of them in USA, Ali? I'd say we stopped caring about timezones long ago
[11:34:26] <Unixkitty> For the most part we like to start out together, and then do random things cooperatively as time goes on without truly planning anything
[11:34:57] <Unixkitty> It's a long term world this time as well, so I highly doubt there'd be need to worry about being in a hurry anywhere
[11:35:20] <Unixkitty> Oh woops, did I just monologue a bit... sorry
[11:36:34] * Ali snuggles Unixkitty and boops for monologuing
[11:36:48] <Cloud_Zephyr> !link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48A_Yqj965c so professional :3
[11:36:49] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[11:36:49] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about 36 Cores, 72 Threads, and Two Titan Xs - Our New INSANE Rendering Machine Part 1
[11:36:55] * Unixkitty squeaks

[11:41:49] <RandomNinja> Halp
[11:41:52] <Unixkitty> Considering you at least typed the phrase "Oh man" three times in the past 15 minutes about it, I'd assume you'd probably been in quite a... relationship with the mod
[11:43:42] <RandomNinja> Pls
[11:44:15] <Sombra> It just one of those things that changed my outlook on minecraft forever.
[11:44:45] <Unixkitty> It was the first mod I ever saw for that game, but you don't see me swooning about it
[11:45:52] <Unixkitty> Sorry, I was just trying to see what you thought was so special about it I guess
[11:47:00] <FruitNibbler> Unixkitty, don't be so bauss'y
[11:49:31] <Unixkitty> What's that supposed to mean?

[11:50:13] <FruitNibbler> https://derpiboo.ru/584292
[11:50:48] <Unixkitty> Would commenting "What a nerd" be appropriate in this case?
[11:51:00] <RandomNinja> That's always appropriate
[11:51:07] <Unixkitty> Haha

[12:03:40] <RandomNinja> started watching The Flash
[12:03:48] <Sombra> I really got hooked on it, now the rest of minecraft can never be the same for me
[12:04:18] <Unixkitty> "The rest of Minecraft", as if without mods it's actually worth anything at this point to those who tasted glory
[12:04:28] <RandomNinja> I'm slightly sad Justice League Unlimited was canceled after S5 though, it was so good
[12:04:48] <Unixkitty> I'm sure they must have had their reasons
[12:05:01] <Sombra> industrial craft just made sense to me, even though there was a bug or two with it.
[12:05:06] <Sombra> Also there's metallurgy and big dig.
[12:05:09] <RandomNinja> go watch it :P
[12:05:31] <Sombra> I watched most of that.
[12:06:11] <Sombra> Why did teen titans become so stupid.
[12:06:26] <Sombra> Did they just get sick of paying for the normal classy animation style?

[12:08:16] <Sombra> Yeah but that doesn't answer my question about teen titans go

[12:11:11] <Sombra> I think kids should quit watching TV for a while.
[12:11:22] <RandomNinja> maybe
[12:11:48] <Sombra> I don't think I'd let my kids watch TV.

[14:52:13] <LunaticHell> Because I object to that idea.
[14:52:52] <FruitNibbler> I would love them to be replaced
[14:53:13] <LunaticHell> No question about that, the less men die, the better.

[14:53:42] <LunaticHell> But living, breathing, soldiers will always remain, sadly, one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest war recource.

[14:54:38] <LunaticHell> As soon as a viable energy source is discovered, yes.
[14:55:26] <LunaticHell> Those things require huge amount of energy, as we see with Ironman, who has his own reactor.
[14:56:09] <Hamtramck> What if we fought wars with the already dead
[14:56:25] <LunaticHell> How?
[14:56:33] <FruitNibbler> What about not fighting any wars?
[14:56:44] <LunaticHell> That would be a dream came true.
[14:56:51] <FruitNibbler> I propose they play online a war game or something
[14:56:58] <Hamtramck> idk just dig up a bunch of civil war soldiers and play volleyball using them.
[14:57:14] <FruitNibbler> Or try to outd each other drones in a war
[14:57:30] <FruitNibbler> Outdo*
[14:57:40] <LunaticHell> There is a problem with that.
[14:58:05] <LunaticHell> Poor countries will always fall back to the use of human soldiers.
[14:58:25] <FruitNibbler> That would promote drone competition which inevitably would end up in use for civilian needs
[14:58:35] <LunaticHell> Hell in some countries a men with a gun is already counted as soldier.

[14:58:52] <Hamtramck> small countries have less dead people so they just lose by default.
[14:59:01] <FruitNibbler> I don't want to ho there in this chat
[14:59:01] <LunaticHell> Drones are already in civil use.
[14:59:02] <Hamtramck> Basically China would just win by default with my setup but I don't realy care.

[14:59:45] <FruitNibbler> Wrong drones though
[14:59:47] <Hamtramck> Are you guys familiar with "dogs?"
[14:59:58] <FruitNibbler> Quads are like super inefficient
[15:00:20] <FruitNibbler> They need some kind of tilt-rotor drone instead
[15:00:46] <FruitNibbler> A tricopter tilt-rotor would be perfect
[15:00:56] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t drone
[15:00:57] <DinkyBot> guys i need a drone simulator
[15:01:08] <Hamtramck> !t It's called "World of Warcraft"
[15:01:09] <DinkyBot> raises the flag of…
[15:01:13] <LunaticHell> What intrests me most are those robots they are working in japan on, ones who can take over dangerious jobs, like the one they one to use in the nuclear plant.
[15:01:36] <FruitNibbler> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BleD5TdWzWQ/VCFR-EGb7-I/AAAAAAAACXg/253kyFUF1rc/s1600/FlameTron_PEARCE.jpg
[15:01:41] <FruitNibbler> Something like that?
[15:02:59] <LunaticHell> For example, in japan you can imagine it like this: in the broken nuclear power plant there are tens of thosands of valves to be operated, the entire thing is flooded with radiation and stuff.
[15:03:40] <FruitNibbler> There are robots operating in Chernobyl
[15:04:10] <LunaticHell> Nuclear material is clogging up the pipes, operating the valves can release this and thus lower the radiation, a well build robot, who can walk stairs and walk over stuff and all of that could make the change.
[15:04:35] <FruitNibbler> But radiation is a bad enemy of any electronics, so these robots get out of order very fast
[15:04:53] <FruitNibbler> And worst of all they get stuck in the most irradiated paces
[15:05:17] <LunaticHell> Yes.
[15:05:46] <LunaticHell> This is why they are working miracles to upgrade their robots.
[15:06:03] <FruitNibbler> Those robots are just normal construction equipment: bulldozers, bobcat with modified arm for a hydraulic gripper and such
[15:06:11] <FruitNibbler> In chernobyl that is
[15:06:13] <LunaticHell> Stuff that is simple for a human can be very tricky for a robot, like running.
[15:06:50] *** Hoofy_sleeping is now known as Hoofy
[15:06:59] <FruitNibbler> Well for whatever stupid reason they try to invent a robot that walks on two legs like a human
[15:07:19] <FruitNibbler> http://duster132.deviantart.com/art/Babel-08-UGV-01-414647126
[15:07:38] <LunaticHell> There are good reasons for that, actually.
[15:07:40] <FruitNibbler> What is wrong with making them multi-legged?
[15:08:07] <LunaticHell> Well let me explain it to you like that: most stuff is designed to be operated by humans, no?
[15:08:15] <FruitNibbler> It is a choice between "working now" and "maybe functioning in the distant future" though
[15:08:36] <LunaticHell> Trust me, it's not that distant, anymore.
[15:08:57] <LunaticHell> I've seen the latest models, it's like a dream.
[15:09:20] <DinkyBot> !shoo
[15:09:20] * DerpyBot sways from side to side, quietly humming "shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo"
[15:09:21] <DinkyBot> What a silly song, momma!
[15:09:23] <RandomNinja> Also, spider-mechs are cool

[15:09:33] <LunaticHell> Wel yes, they are.
[15:09:40] <FruitNibbler> This /WORKS/
[15:09:43] <FruitNibbler> Nao
[15:09:49] <FruitNibbler> Not in 2040
[15:09:52] <LunaticHell> Can it walk up steps?
[15:10:05] <FruitNibbler> Yes it is a bomb difusing robot
[15:10:19] <FruitNibbler> http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2010/09/060501-N-7586B-015.jpg
[15:10:30] <LunaticHell> Well you don't need a human-like for diffusing bombs.
[15:10:54] <FruitNibbler> Then why would you need human like for turning valves???
[15:11:30] <LunaticHell> Because the nuclear plant was build with human use in mind, too big would not fit.
[15:11:34] <FruitNibbler> This obsession with anthromorphic robots is just stupid
[15:11:49] <Flurshy> so... I didn't realize this sort of mixer was a thing http://www.musiciansfriend.com/keyboards-midi/roland-aira-mx1-mix-performer-control-surface?cntry=us&source=3WWRWXGP&gclid=Cj0KEQjwkIurBRDwoZfi1bGCxocBEiQAmcs-esnaxbx5rkdX2YwfXJPvzTPBGZTYXVoTOUQau9ObIYUaApXJ8P8HAQ&kwid=productads-plaid^80557822347-sku^J19801000000000@ADL4MF-adType^PLA-device^c-adid^51870555867#productDetail
[15:12:10] <FruitNibbler> Human body isn't perfectly made for every task, you can do one better in form of a robot
[15:13:07] <Hamtramck> back in my day we didn't have mixers, we were literally cutting CDs apart and gluing them back together
[15:13:10] <LunaticHell> thing is, they don't need a robot that is build for one single task in mind in which it excelles, they need a robot that can do many things avaragely.
[15:13:52] <FruitNibbler> Again, it doesn't need to resemble human 
[15:14:23] <FruitNibbler> Robots don't have muscles, so the form factor is irrelevant and inefficient for motors
[15:14:35] <LunaticHell> Then again, the power plant was build to be used by humans
[15:14:47] <FruitNibbler> There is no reason why a robotic arm should have the same number of joints as human hand
[15:14:54] <FruitNibbler> Absolutely no reason
[15:15:51] <Hamtramck> some day we'll all be robots, then how will we know
[15:16:05] <FruitNibbler> https://www.pinterest.com/pin/183943966007110540/
[15:16:39] <FruitNibbler> Also there is no objective reason why a robot has to have only two arms and camera on the "head" only
[15:17:47] <FruitNibbler> They are limiting their design by imitating human body and postponing working products for an indefinite time, while chernobyl and fukushima are still kinda there
