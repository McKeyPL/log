[04:08:51] <MikeM> That sucks
[04:09:10] <Hamtramck> But like, back in spring, when those episodes aired, there were... signs they weren't well and that that'd probably be my last year with them.
[04:09:29] <wobniaR> Did you make the most of your time with them?
[04:09:42] <Hamtramck> And at that point it was something I could kind of ignore, but I mean the dogs were like siblings to me so yeah

[04:21:59] <Sombra> It is here, I've just never seen it.  I did see it once at a gun store but that seemed pretty normal to me.  because it was a gun store.
[04:22:01] <Sombra> A handgun.

[21:22:17] <Sketchy_Sounds> So I got a new mouse today, cos my old one was slowly dying
[21:23:35] <Sketchy_Sounds> I now own a Roccat Kone XTD Optical.
[21:23:42] <Sketchy_Sounds> Was pricy, but definitely worth it :)
[21:23:46] <RandomNinja> yay
[21:24:07] <RandomNinja> I have a $5 chinese rip-off mouse I bought on eBay :3
[21:24:52] <One-Trick> i still have my wired microsoft widewinder

[21:25:26] <Sketchy_Sounds> I have a Sidewinder keyboard. It's not bad, but I plan to replace it with one of Roccat's mechanical offerings.
[21:26:26] <Sketchy_Sounds> Which reminds me, I should get a Cherry key sampler so I can decide what switch colour to get. I'm thinking I should have black as I tend to be a fairly heavy typer, but I'm not 100% certain.
[21:27:34] <One-Trick> i kinda dislike my g510s
[21:29:12] <Sketchy_Sounds> About the only thing I'm relatively sure of is that I don't want reds or blues, because I'm pretty sure those are the noisy ones. And while the clickety clackety sound is one of the more pleasant features for some people, I doubt my flatmate would appreciate me going clickety clackety all the time.

[21:42:37] <Flurshy> I mean I've got a top 40s folder for modern hits, and I'll make a classic 40s folder as well
[21:42:46] <Flurshy> but all my other music is allll over the place
[21:43:00] <Flurshy> I'd rather categorize it by sound than by genre
[21:45:35] <RandomNinja> isn't the entire point of genres to sound somewhat similar?
[21:47:01] <wobniaR> it's a word used to describe music that's similar in a way that people can understand
[21:47:33] <wobniaR> So if WUB WUB WUB gets your point across, it's close enough
[21:48:18] <Flurshy> well considering I'm organizing this for myself to use
