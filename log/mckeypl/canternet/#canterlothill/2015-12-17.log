[01:03:55] <Sombra> So something really bothers me, and we need to talk about it.
[01:04:03] <Sombra> Eywind, RandomNinja, Regulus, other guyst.
[01:04:05] <RandomNinja> someone report Eywind to the internet police
[01:04:14] <Sombra> Season 1, episode 3, ticket master.
[01:04:21] <MikeM> It's ok to have thoughts. Actions are different.
[01:04:23] <Eywind> okay lemme go back to 2010
[01:04:36] <Sombra> Princess Celestia gives Twilight two tickets... even though she knows that she has five other special friends, with a magical connection that saved the world.
[01:04:39] <RandomNinja> this is why I keep a time machine handy
[01:04:49] <Sombra> Most people have heavily theorized "well that was obviously a test"
[01:04:53] <Eywind> The second ticket was for Spike
[01:04:55] <Sombra> But... she's never disclosed that it was a test.
[01:04:57] <RandomNinja> or she just forgot
[01:05:04] <Eywind> she didn't think about her friends
[01:05:05] <Sombra> What do you mean she forgot...
[01:05:12] <Eywind> Celestia didn't think about Twilight's friends when issuing the tickets*
[01:05:15] <MikeM> They were new friends.
[01:05:17] <Sombra> Her friends? Those people that unlocked the elements of harmony and saved the world?
[01:05:29] <Sombra> How could she miss that?
[01:05:30] <MikeM> Celestia wasn't sure how interested they'd be.
[01:05:30] <Eywind> bruh that doesn't mean a princess is gonna think to invite them to a dance
[01:05:36] <RandomNinja> you assume celestia is flawless
[01:05:48] <RandomNinja> she's been proven over and over again to not be
[01:05:49] <Sombra> yeah but she'd have to be retarded to miss that.
[01:05:54] <RandomNinja> pls

[01:06:52] <DinkyBot> 330 feet long enough for my purposes right now. But it's what she wanted to commandeer the soundwaves in the house I was in Washington D.C
[01:07:02] <thereallynewmop12100> Sombra: Later on in the season 1 finale of MLP: FIM. They are invited to the gala
[01:07:19] <RandomNinja> isn't that the same tickets?
[01:07:21] <Sombra> God I know that, I'm not stupid.
[01:07:22] <MikeM> They were invited at the end of the episode.
[01:07:35] <Eywind> Dude
[01:07:40] <Eywind> Give it a rest Sombra
[01:07:42] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: Yes and in the season 1 finale. 
[01:07:43] <Eywind> we've provided opinions
[01:07:53] <Eywind> Take our thoughts or stick with your headcanon
[01:07:55] <RandomNinja> also the most obvious explanation
[01:07:57] <Sombra> But why didn't she either A. give twilight all the tickets at once, or B. give tickets to all of them at once.
[01:07:59] <RandomNinja> convenient plot device
[01:08:03] <Eywind> Dude
[01:08:03] <Sombra> But it's FUN to pick this apart!
[01:08:08] <MikeM> Not really
[01:08:10] <Eywind> It was the second episode of the show
[01:08:11] <Sombra> Like seriously, nothing has made me laugh more.
[01:08:58] <Eywind> That Celestia didn't think to invite any of the other ponies from Ponyville she maybe had 20 min of interaction with to a big dance she was inviting hundreds of ponies to?
[01:09:28] <Eywind> compared to her pupil/somewhat child and almost her literal child in Spike
[01:09:36] <Sombra> No, that she didn't think to invite the ponies that saved the world.
[01:10:00] <Sombra> It's just like... what are ya doin celestia... what's your play?
[01:10:54] <Eywind> invite list was probs put together 3 months before that
[01:11:23] <Eywind> whatever
[01:11:25] <Sombra> "Sorry girls, these golden tickets are really hard to put together man... glhf"
[01:11:27] <Eywind> it's not like you care what I think anyways
[01:11:32] <Eywind> or any of us
[01:11:35] <Eywind> you care about what you think
[01:11:36] <Sombra> No I care.
[01:11:44] <Sombra> I just find the whole thing funny, and fun to talk about.
[01:13:00] <Sombra> I mean, the characters and background are usually so good that I don't really notice these sorts of things to pick apart.
[01:13:15] <Sombra> But now that I've watched it a hundred times it makes it easier.  Which is a sign of good writing that I haven't noticed it before.

[01:42:57] <Regulus> RandomNinja, mages are brokenly OP now
[01:43:02] <RandomNinja> again?
[01:43:53] <Regulus> Sir Finley + Justicar for new, better hero power, then Coldara Drake + Lady of the Lake for 10 hero power uses a turn
[01:44:49] <Regulus> Need 40 armor? Who doesn't! Want 10 extra draws? Sure! Need 30 damage to the face in a hurry? No problem! 
[01:45:36] <Eywind> I want to pay 20 life to draw 10 cards
[01:46:00] <Regulus> No, upgraded warlock hero power has no draw cost
[01:46:12] <Regulus> It's just a pay 2, draw 1
[01:46:18] <RandomNinja> except you don't have any mana left to use hero power
[01:46:29] <RandomNinja> Lady gets removed the next turn
[01:46:32] <Regulus> Until next turn, yes
[01:46:44] <RandomNinja> if your opponent can't do that you were already winning
[01:46:46] <Regulus> I've sprung the combo a few times.
[01:46:48] <Eywind> idk what upgraded is
[01:47:01] <Regulus> It's Justicar's effect
[01:47:10] <Regulus> It improves hero powers
[01:47:26] <RandomNinja> mages get 2 damage, paladins get 2 1/1, warrior gets 4 armor etc
[01:47:43] <Regulus> Warlocks get cheap draws
[01:48:25] * thereallynewmop12100 removes Nerd.exe from RandomNinja 
[01:48:29] <Eywind> cool
[01:48:46] <RandomNinja> also if you need stupid amounts of armor: armorsmith x2, whirlwind x2, death's bite deathrattle
[01:48:51] <Regulus> It's useful, but I usually have better combos 
[01:49:33] <Regulus> Like Nexus Champion Sarad and Summoning Stone
[01:49:53] <RandomNinja> >everyone, get in here
[01:49:57] <Regulus> Spamming spells and minions for glory!

[01:58:02] <Regulus> I played a friendly match with an old friend. He brought the Cho, I brought the tree of life.
[01:58:28] <Regulus> We were taking like 20 exhaustion damage lol
[01:59:27] <RandomNinja> need that card that makes you take 1 damage
[01:59:38] <Regulus> It's nice
[01:59:54] <Regulus> It's a 4/4/4

[02:12:49] <RandomNinja> did you play him heroic tho?
[02:12:57] <Regulus> Noooooooo
[02:13:12] <Regulus> I'm not lucky enough to try heroic
[02:13:31] <Regulus> I always get terrible draws
[02:14:04] <Regulus> Like, I can build dozens of combos... and not draw the one key card for any of them
[02:14:49] <Regulus> That's why I don't run a rogue deck. I can never get any of my key cards when I need them...
[02:15:32] <RandomNinja> the naga boss is ridiculous
[02:15:56] <RandomNinja> instead of getting progressively 1/1, 2/1, 3/1 etc, he gets 1/1, 2/2, 3/3 
[02:16:02] <Regulus> I have had decks with 2/3 of the cards under 4 mana... and still manage to draw my high cost cards at the start, even when I mulligan 
[02:16:16] <RandomNinja> meaning by the time you pick up the pace he's dropping 0 mana 8/8
[02:16:49] <Regulus> Yea... I think I ran my druid against him
[02:17:50] <RandomNinja> also giantfin
[02:17:53] <RandomNinja> so many murlocs

[02:18:28] <Regulus> That's where a priest with 2 mass silences comes in handy
