[03:46:31] <MikeM> Interesting. I've seen a couple of physics evaluations of the show, but no magical evals.
[03:47:49] <Jokerboxer> Remember how he found an unknown varible? That could have been magic. 
[03:49:05] <MikeM> Yes...
[03:49:24] <Jokerboxer> I wonder what it tastes like. The air in Equestria has got to be thick with magic.
[03:50:59] <MikeM> Could non-magical creatures perceive it? Would the natives notice it? What about someone who is magical, but is from a lower state?

[04:19:10] <RimeTM> So, the chart year is just about wrapping up
[04:19:31] <RimeTM> This week technically isn't finalized, but it's looking safe to say Prototype is #1 for a ninth nonconsecutive week
[04:20:03] <RimeTM> but now we can finally talk about the year-end, which should only have minor variance from what I say if change does come Sunday
[04:20:36] <RimeTM> After 10 weeks on chart, Getting Stronger finally manages to get a year-end spot, currently pinned at No. 92
[04:21:29] <RimeTM> Metajoker and Respin get on the year-end with Become at No. 88
[04:23:07] <RimeTM> Back Again is Archie's only year-end charter, and it's boosted in proxy thanks to the Scoots Nightmare Terror video (it does not get direct points from it, however), logging the last 2 weeks of the chart year at No. 19 and landing on the year-end at No. 73

[18:50:12] <RandomNinja> it's not objectively worse, some of the lines are pretty great, especially the sarcastic ones, but Plot Induced Stupidity is a lot more noticable and annoying

[19:02:46] <RandomNinja> in vanilla, max sneak attack is x30, combine that with the perk that makes enemies lose you for half a second when crouching....
[19:03:16] <RandomNinja> really, there are two ways to play Fallout 4, either melee, because hitting things in the face with large weapons is fun...
