[20:27:34] <johnsey> how do you "properly delete"?
[20:27:55] <RandomNinja> delete the actual data rather than just clearing the space for writing
[20:28:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> yeh, apparently people have had data stolen for selling their androids
[20:28:18] <johnsey> how do you delete the actual data?
[20:28:26] <Cloud_Zephyr> just write over it a few times
[20:28:34] <Zuthal> johnsey: put phone in microwave, nuke for five minutes at max power

[20:28:51] * RandomNinja inverts Cloud_Zephyr's 1's and 0's
[20:28:51] <johnsey> Cloud_Zephyr: does that guarantee that the data is not in a different place you're writing?
[20:28:58] <johnsey> *than
[20:29:19] <RandomNinja> it makes the data much harder if not impossible to recover
[20:29:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> idk
[20:29:25] <RandomNinja> for security reasons
[20:29:39] <Zuthal> You know what I never understood? Why fully overwrite with zeros multiple times?
[20:29:44] <johnsey> RandomNinja: that's not how flash memory works
[20:30:00] <Zuthal> If you just fill up all available storage space with zeros once it should be gone already, right?
[20:30:01] <RandomNinja> that's true, I was thinking like HDDs
[20:30:17] <RandomNinja> disregard
[20:30:38] <johnsey> and even on HDDs, you can't be absolutely sure your OS isn't placing the written blocks elsehwere on the disk
[20:31:40] <johnsey> so if you really wanna be sure nobody can recover your data, encrypt it :)
[20:32:02] <Cloud_Zephyr> maybe that’s what the news was talking about then
[20:32:11] <Cloud_Zephyr> because as far as i’m aware, apple encrypts
[20:32:20] <johnsey> they do
[20:32:29] <johnsey> android does it by default on newer devices/versions
[20:32:41] <Cloud_Zephyr> that makes sense
[20:33:03] <RandomNinja> johnsey: set up your hard drives inside a massive degausser, then when the cops arrive you start it
[20:33:25] <johnsey> RandomNinja: nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure
