[15:07:50] <RandomNinja> yay
[15:08:11] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> The government is trying to take away our say in the matters that is EU.
[15:08:42] <RandomNinja> did you vote for unrealistic immigration or racism? :P
[15:08:49] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> If this vote ends in a yes. We, the citizens of Denmark, will no longer have any influence in our choices in the EU.
[15:08:57] <RandomNinja> fun times
[15:09:09] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So ofcause I voted no.
[15:09:15] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Hopefully people agrees.
[15:09:36] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I'm not a critic of EU, but I would like to state my opinions too :p
[15:09:52] <RandomNinja> I was about to say why would anyone vote in favor, then I remembered people are dumb
[15:10:31] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Yea. The fun part about this, however. Is that, if this vote ends with a no. It'll show how little we trust our politicians >.>
[15:10:45] <RandomNinja> you shouldn't trust your politicians
[15:10:50] <RandomNinja> that's the problem with politics
[15:10:55] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> And that's why I voted no :p
[15:11:12] <RandomNinja> assume they are idiots and scrutinize every choice they make
[15:11:37] <RandomNinja> media is supposed to do this, but lolno
[15:12:04] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> That's why, if this ends with a no, they'll take it up again in 2018. However, if it ends in a yes, it'll never be taken up again.

[16:52:11] <RandomNinja> something confirmed
[16:52:12] <wobniaR> Too bad none of the endings of new vegas are canon
[16:52:24] <wobniaR> Which is weird
[16:52:38] <RandomNinja> I still argue the House ending is the best one
[16:52:57] <wobniaR> I usually went with the NCR one
[16:53:31] <RandomNinja> what made america into what it is? science and capitalism

[16:54:05] <wobniaR> Science and capitalism also turned the fallout world into what it is
[16:54:09] <RandomNinja> true
[16:54:20] <wobniaR> So eventually the cycle will repeat
[16:54:33] <RandomNinja> solution: world domination
[16:54:38] <RandomNinja> thus no war
[16:54:42] <RandomNinja> it's foolproof

[17:00:53] <RandomNinja> obviously
[17:01:01] <RimeTM> BTW, I haven't written an article for it yet, but last week, thanks to the episode

[17:01:43] <RandomNinja> also, Lone Wanderer arrives in the Commonwealth to shoot MacCready in the face since he doesn't have child immunity anymore
[17:02:20] <wobniaR> DLC that combine previous fallout games with 4 would be interesting
[17:02:55] <wobniaR> 1 2 3 new vegas, with you getting involved with each of them somehow
[17:03:07] <RandomNinja> 1 and 2 will be hard since both characters are long dead
[17:03:14] <wobniaR> Right
[17:03:27] <wobniaR> Simulators is the obvious solution to this

[17:06:12] <RandomNinja> it kinda was though, did you play Fallout 2?
[17:06:23] <RandomNinja> most small arms literally did 0 damage
[17:06:33] <wobniaR> Nah, but in the recent ones
[17:07:06] <wobniaR> Power armor could eat 9 and 10mm in 3 but new vegas especially with mods
