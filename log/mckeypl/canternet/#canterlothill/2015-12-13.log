[01:20:27] <keekle> this one yay
[01:20:29] <Regulus> Figure that the average movie script is SIGNIFICANTLY shorter than the average novel, and you can see why it's not been done
[01:20:51] <Regulus> It's kind of a monumental task.
[01:22:12] <Regulus> You'd have to modify the narrative for that format, cast VAs, get them to record their HOURS worth of lines, likely individually, edit them together, get re-recordings for sections that don't work, etc
[01:22:18] <Sombra> But each episode is only like 20 minutes long.

[01:37:19] <RandomNinja> whatnow?
[01:37:27] <Sombra> .I'm on very hard difficulty, things don't seem very hard yet.
[01:37:33] <Regulus> Go to Shamrock Taphouse
[01:37:35] <RandomNinja> try Survival
[01:37:45] <RandomNinja> you occasionally die
[01:38:06] <Regulus> In the basement, there's a Protectron that brews Gwenet drinks.
[01:38:15] <Regulus> Ice Cold ones.
[01:38:34] <SaultSteMarie> Hrm. Okay GPU isn't getting too hot with this overclock but I am getting some artifacting.
[01:38:36] <Regulus> You can send him to one of your settlements.
[01:38:53] <SaultSteMarie> Anyway I'm pretty sure if I can get Witcher 3 running smoothly on Ultra at 720p I could probably run Fallout 4.
[01:39:15] <RandomNinja> Fallout runs way better than Witcher for me
[01:39:31] <SaultSteMarie> Should have lower specs.
[01:39:32] <Regulus> If you give him additional brewing holotapes, he can brew Gwinet Pale, Lager, Brew, etc and chill all versions of Nuka Cola
[01:40:03] <SaultSteMarie> I'm wondering if there's any downside to overclocking my GPU like this. It's... helping pretty substantially.
[01:40:20] <Lost> Downside to overclocking is generally lifetime
[01:40:21] <Regulus> A must for brewing enthusiasts, RandomNinja 
[01:40:52] <Lost> I overclocked my 8800s back in the day, they set fire, it was glorious
[01:45:30] <SaultSteMarie> Lost, even if the temperature increase isn't that much?
[01:45:38] <SaultSteMarie> I mean my GPU isn't fast enough to catch fire
[01:45:59] <SaultSteMarie> But the overclock's only adding like 10 C's of heat units it
[01:46:36] <Lost> SaultSteMarie, Well yeah, lifetime is tested at the factory clock settings, so pushing it even a little is gonna lower its lifetime
[01:47:36] <Lost> I seriously OC my 680 though, had it since it first came out and its still going strong, so i wouldnt worry too much.

[01:48:23] <SaultSteMarie> oh it sounds like as long as you don't touch the voltage you can't do too much damage
[01:48:31] <Lost> The only reason my 8800s caught fire is because i messed up its cooling and didnt notice until smoke came outa my machine.

[03:57:46] <wobniaR> Especially a restriction that goes against everything the game is about
[03:57:53] <RandomNinja> this is what happens when you're stuck on console and can't fix the game being stupidly easy

[03:59:38] <wobniaR> Fallout 4's been okay with that so far, but some unarmored raiders can tank a point blank shotgun to the face

[06:53:30] <Eywind> You should do piano covers of stuff

[06:53:36] <Faith_> it was on HotNewMixtapes.org

[06:57:29] <Eywind> yeah he was down today
[06:57:32] <Eywind> glad he was on though
[06:57:34] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: Midnight Mad Libs disappeared until next weekend. 
[06:57:42] <MikeM> So it goes.
[06:57:57] <Eywind> Should I use the Papyrus spaghetti background or the better looking Sans sleeping one on Steam? Lol
[06:58:01] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: Back to regular late-night talking..
[06:58:04] <wobniaR> Spaghetti
[06:58:06] <wobniaR> Always spaghetti
[06:58:08] <nyditch> Even the best things must come to an end, as is with the worst things. XD
[06:58:16] <Eywind> It's worth way too much
[06:58:28] <Eywind> like for a steam wallpaper lol
[06:58:33] <wobniaR> Can you sell steam wallpapers?
[06:58:35] <Eywind> although I think I've spent $2 real money
[06:58:35] <Eywind> yeah
[06:58:37] <Eywind> after a week
[06:58:45] <wobniaR> Neat that'll get you like $7
[06:58:55] <Eywind> on 4 badges + $7 in wallpapers + $4 in emotes
[06:58:55] <wobniaR> You can almost buy half a pizza pie with that
[06:58:56] <Eywind> it's dumb
[06:58:57] <Eywind> Lol
[06:59:09] <Eywind> I can buy one bad nonbasic land or an older common/uncommon
[06:59:09] <Eywind> in magic
[06:59:15] <nyditch> I feel pizza would be the wiser investment.
[06:59:22] <wobniaR> Agreed
[06:59:38] <SaultSteMarie> I liked collecting magic cards but I was never good at the game so i just have a ton of commons that I got for like fifteen cents a piece when I was
[06:59:41] <Eywind> hah
[06:59:43] <SaultSteMarie> younger and a very different person
[06:59:52] <Eywind> I played/ran a tourney today
[06:59:57] <Eywind> I went 1-1-1 and ropped lol
[07:00:18] <Kelazi5> Yeah, I usually convert any cool art I find into desktop wallpapers. It's kind of a hobby now
[07:00:29] <nyditch> Hey, even the best of us collected pogs back in the day. What a waste that was. Wish I still had mine.
[07:00:54] <SaultSteMarie> Beanie babies.
[07:01:00] <Eywind> I had a tube of pogs  lol
[07:01:08] <Eywind> I found them a few years ago and they were super water damaged
[07:01:11] <SaultSteMarie> Remember Hardee's Apollo 13 pog promotion
[07:01:18] <nyditch> I ended up with beanie babies worth all of $0.5 each. A bunch.
[07:01:33] <Kelazi5> I only had a couple, not enough spending money, that wasn't spent on legos or video games at least
[07:01:35] <Eywind> hah I feel like there's a lot of people out there banking on them going up in value
[07:01:49] <SaultSteMarie> god the nineties were weird and best forgotten
[07:02:02] <nyditch> I just finished watching all of Daria.
[07:02:10] <Kelazi5> each decade has its dumb fads
[07:02:15] <Ali> !t Eywind 
[07:02:16] <DinkyBot> Eywind: next person who joins is prob him
[07:02:27] <Eywind> yep
[07:02:31] <SaultSteMarie> yeah but the 90s was just concentrated dumb fads
[07:02:45] <Eywind> and pokemon
[07:02:48] <nyditch> 90's cartoons are still masterpieces.
[07:02:49] <wobniaR> Lots of dumb fads right now too
[07:02:54] <wobniaR> What's different?
[07:03:00] <MikeM> That sounds like every decade ever.
[07:03:07] <SaultSteMarie> yeah but I don't talk to the younger generation these days so I'm free to ignore their dumb things.
[07:03:10] <Eywind> 90s cartoons are nostalgia
[07:03:13] <Eywind> somea re good sure
[07:03:15] <Kelazi5> The 90s X-men cartoon is still really good
[07:03:21] <SaultSteMarie> The difference is that I am a totally alienated solipsist and I'm okay with this!!!
[07:03:58] <nyditch> Hey, re-watching Daria really got me in tough with my cynical intellectual side on a very personal level.
[07:04:05] <nyditch> touch*
[07:04:31] <MikeM> Daria...she's a pretty cool cartoon chick.
[07:04:39] <thereallynewmop12100> I gotta go 
[07:04:48] <nyditch> Seeya mop
[07:04:48] <thereallynewmop12100> MikeM: Now libs are over. I must run off
[07:04:51] <MikeM> There's that one Luna animation which was pretty good.
[07:04:54] <Kelazi5> night moppy, for realsie this time
[07:04:55] <MikeM> Later, mop.
[07:04:56] <thereallynewmop12100> Brohoof, stay gold and see ya later. goodnight!

[07:05:35] <nyditch> MikeM, right? I'd totally go sabotage someone else's life with her given the chance.
[07:05:37] <SaultSteMarie> anyway beanie babies were particularly bad for the /toy speculation/ side of it, because that's a depressing and soulless thing in any form.
[07:05:45] * Eywind is frumpy
[07:05:47] <SaultSteMarie> Like people buying up and speculating on vidyagams these days
[07:05:48] <Eywind> oh flump
[07:06:01] <Eywind> hows you Ali?
[07:06:03] <SaultSteMarie> or people that dig up all the skeletons in your closet.
[07:06:25] <wobniaR> You don't want to do that, they tell puns
[07:06:28] <MikeM> SaultSteMarie, that's why you never let anyone see your skeltons.
[07:06:33] <wobniaR> !t skeleton
[07:06:34] <Eywind> ^^
[07:06:34] <DinkyBot> robot skeleton, covered in pony drool
[07:06:37] <Eywind> one more up sure

[07:07:00] <MikeM> Lots
[07:07:02] <SaultSteMarie> i literally have red skelton decaying in my closet
[07:07:11] <nyditch> I'll say one thing, I've not wasted nearly as much money on fads as I have on fighting robots.
[07:07:24] <Kelazi5> Dinky is getting pretty meta tonight
[07:07:36] <wobniaR> !t meta
[07:07:37] <DinkyBot> meta snowblitz haz your picture haha
[07:07:51] <MikeM> !t and yours, too.

[07:08:29] <Eywind> sorry you are meh
[07:08:35] <Eywind> I went 1-1-1 in modern today, it was cool
[07:08:49] <nyditch> That's a palindrome
[07:08:52] <Eywind> I played splinter twin on a restoration angel today
[07:08:52] <Kelazi5> neat
[07:09:00] <Eywind> and I'm playing a twin combo deck
[07:09:01] <Eywind> so that was fun
[07:09:41] <Kelazi5> Been doing the latest Pokemon Battle Competition online today
[07:10:04] <Kelazi5> though mainly to get that special mon you get for participating
[07:10:25] <nyditch> Well folks, it's been fun but now I need to go derp about in the shower before derping about elsewhere tonight.
[07:10:34] <Kelazi5> night
[07:10:55] <MikeM> Happy derping!
[07:11:01] <Eywind> ew pokemon what a nerd
[07:11:11] <nyditch> Sleep well, all, and may you wake up in the morning.
[07:11:19] <Eywind> I plan on waking up in the afternoon, thanks
[07:11:25] <Kelazi5> we're all nerds here
[07:11:29] <wobniaR> 5:20 am naptime hype
[07:11:38] <Eywind> wobniaR why do you nap for 10 hours every night?
[07:11:39] <MikeM> haha
[07:11:47] <wobniaR> I wish it was 10 hours
[07:11:49] <nyditch> To each their own. To wake up at some point at least ensures being definitely not dead.
[07:11:57] <Eywind> unless you wake up dead
[07:12:02] <nyditch> I have my 2pm days as well.
[07:12:03] <wobniaR> And a skeleton
[07:12:14] <Eywind> btw PSA for everyone
[07:12:29] <nyditch> Well if you wake up dead, then you would have a lot of questions that suddenly need to be answered.
[07:12:30] <Eywind> http://i.imgur.com/EMh0UKT.jpg
[07:12:46] <wobniaR> Teal needs that
[07:12:52] <Eywind> agreed
[07:13:05] <Kelazi5> -_-
[07:13:14] <Eywind> what Kelazi5?
[07:13:38] <Kelazi5> just laughing at that PSA
[07:13:43] <Eywind> ook
[07:13:44] <nyditch> Good to look for social cues, because it would be impolite and politically incorrect to ask someone if they are indeed a skeleton.
[07:13:51] * DerpyBot sits down with DinkyBot to go through her homework with her
[07:13:51] <DinkyBot> Momma, Im learnin' about speech today!

[22:35:42] <ExplodingPonyToast> Replacer was heavily influenced by some game called Undertale for this song

[22:35:48] <Eywind> it is horrible

[22:36:02] <Araxnus> Eywind: Undertale? :p
[22:36:04] <ExplodingPonyToast> My song was heavily influenced by the mlp gameloft app
[22:36:13] <ExplodingPonyToast> (not really)
[22:36:16] <Eywind> yeah I mean it's only barely better than a bunch of old nes games and a gamecube one
[22:36:18] <InklingBear> Haha
[22:36:20] <Selv3dge> Ahh i get it, "Determination"
[22:36:21] <Eywind> well not old nes, but you know what I mean
[22:36:34] <Lycan> My song was heavily influenced by my microphone, and you get to hear it every three songs... :P
[22:36:47] <Eywind> you should request addition to the radio for your song lycan
[22:37:12] <Araxnus> Pls don't :3
[22:37:26] <SpectraMusic> My song was influenced by a game that isn't even complete yet
[22:37:30] <Lycan> See, my song is actually a remix of a book... That book is called the dictionary. Everything I've ever done has been a remix of that.
[22:37:38] <ExplodingPonyToast> Wow hipster Spectra
[22:37:38] <LiquidSunshine> This has some industrial tones, I like it
[22:37:41] <InklingBear> Such ambient
[22:37:44] <InklingBear> Spectra
[22:37:47] <SpectraMusic> ^
[22:37:51] <Shad0wMeister> Mine was influenced by Madeon
[22:37:53] <Eywind> Lycan you should release like a 15 album set of you just reading the dictionary
[22:37:58] <Araxnus> ^
[22:38:01] <SpectraMusic> Shad0wMeister: good to hear
[22:38:05] <ExplodingPonyToast> Mine was actually just me attempting tropical house
[22:38:12] <ExplodingPonyToast> Because christmas in australia is not cold

[22:38:20] <Intersekt> God my rapping was bad
[22:38:25] <Eywind> well it was 70 here yesterday
[22:38:26] <Intersekt> I'm relistening to it
[22:38:28] <ExplodingPonyToast> It was fine Intersekt
[22:38:32] <Eywind> so it might not be cold in the US either lol
[22:38:34] <ExplodingPonyToast> I made him remove the bad part
[22:38:38] <Lycan> Your rapping was great Intersekt
[22:38:38] <ExplodingPonyToast> haha
[22:38:42] <InklingBear> I liked it tbh
[22:38:43] <Selv3dge> Lol
[22:38:44] <thereallynewmop12100> Lycan: You should release like 150-track album songs based on the words on the dictionary. 
[22:39:00] <Araxnus> This style is fun
[22:39:08] <SpectraMusic> Track 1: Aardvark
[22:39:12] <Bushesonfire> dunno how i feel about this one
[22:39:14] <Shad0wMeister> and have the intro track featuring morgan freeman saying one word as thats all we can afford him to do
[22:39:14] <Bushesonfire> but it grooves
[22:39:34] <SpectraMusic> Wasn't expecting this style from Replacer but it sounds cool
[22:39:37] <ExplodingPonyToast> This is the longest song on the album
[22:39:39] <Eywind> Shad0wMeister actually it's recording him saying that he woudln't say anything for money
[22:39:41] <Araxnus> Going to enjoy uploading and posting some of these :)
[22:39:42] <Budzy> i was playing around with my song in FL just now and I made some melody changes that I wish I figured out before
[22:39:47] <Lycan> This is one of the longest songs on the album
