[07:52:01] <nyditch> Is unusual behaviour too abrasive for general consumption?
[07:52:55] <Jokerboxer> What type of tea are you drinking?
[07:53:32] <nyditch> Twinnings Earl Grey with three sugars and a dash of milk.
[07:53:53] * Jokerboxer cringes.
[07:53:59] <Uityyy> Excellent!
[07:54:12] <nyditch> Sorry if I'm a bit nutty for putting 3 sugars in as opposed to the usual 2.
[07:54:56] <Jokerboxer> It is not that. I am not a fan of Burgamont. Also, I enjoy tea plain.
[07:55:14] <Jokerboxer> That's a whole lot of nope for me.
[07:55:39] <nyditch> Ah hah, that would mae it rather undesirable for you then. It's like deset for me.
[07:55:44] <nyditch> desert*
[07:56:22] <Jokerboxer> Have you had tea the way they do in Tiawan.
[07:56:43] <nyditch> I'm not familiar with Taiwanese tea.
[07:57:10] <nyditch> Thai iced tea, however, is delectible.
[07:58:15] <Jokerboxer> It is very sweet. Lots of milk and sugar. It tastes like a sweet milk drink after it is done. I suppose it is to cover the taste of cheap breakfast teas.
[07:58:22] * Uityyy sips PG Tips decaf in honor of the conversion
[07:59:06] <nyditch> Sounds like that iced tea, except hot I guess
[07:59:27] <Jokerboxer> Yes.
[07:59:39] <nyditch> I never got into PG Tips, though I've heard good about it. Once I discovered Twinnings, I never bought anything else.
[08:00:26] <Jokerboxer> PG tips? What about silver needle?
[08:00:41] <nyditch> Never heard of it
[08:01:17] <Uityyy> I had Twinings once at DisneyWorld. I didn't get my cup brewed quite enough so it was a little disappointing.
[08:01:29] <Jokerboxer> It teasts like sunshine and corn on a fresh moring.
[08:01:49] <nyditch> Ah, that'd do it. Recommended 2-4 minutes, I like to go 4+
[08:01:53] * Jokerboxer runs a tea business in real life.
[08:02:06] <nyditch> Oh neato
[08:02:10] <Jokerboxer> :D
[08:02:16] <nyditch> I'm no expert on tea. Just like it.
[08:02:43] <Jokerboxer> I'm getting there.
[08:02:44] <nyditch> Mainly because I can't stand coffee, and I don't always feel like hot chocolate.
[08:04:04] <nyditch> I hear that 3rd picking jasmine is more expensive than coccaine.
[08:04:27] * Jokerboxer chuckles.
[08:05:44] <nyditch> I've known a few tea-freaks (no offense intended), and one was telling me about his 3rd picking jasmine that he saves for very special occasions.
[08:07:49] <Jokerboxer> I had a stash of Houjicha Gold that I treated like that.
[08:08:57] *** Quits: KooK (Magnus__@Pony-1vdac7.client.mchsi.com) (Connection closed)
[08:08:58] <nyditch> and about how 1st picking is reserves for royalty, and 2nd picking is for aristocrats essentially.
[08:09:29] <nyditch> Googling that....
[08:09:30] <Jokerboxer> I don't know anything about that.
[08:12:45] <nyditch> Of course, I have no other reference and thus this guy could have been spouting some BS, but it's interesting nonetheless.
[08:13:44] <Jokerboxer> Maybe he is talking about steeping or aging.
[08:14:40] <nyditch> He said it was to do with the age of the plant, where the first set of leaves picked would be 1st picking, and so on.
[08:15:54] <nyditch> Anywho, I don't know nearly as much about tea, only what I like. XD
[08:16:13] <Jokerboxer> It is actually a common practice.
[08:16:17] <nyditch> which my list is restricted to that I've tried obviously.
[08:17:04] <nyditch> maybe something to do with a specific type of plant grown in certain areas..... beats me.
[08:17:56] <Jokerboxer> That's right.
[08:18:31] <nyditch> All's I know, is that if you like sweet, black tea mixed with vanilla chai, agave syrup/honey to sweeten, and a dash of milk makes an absolutely delicious treat.
[08:19:14] <Jokerboxer> That it does.
[08:19:39] <nyditch> I usually use earl grey, but  others work as well.

[08:21:52] <nyditch> Hmm, according to Wikipedia, traditionally buffalo milk is used in chai tea.
[08:22:09] <nyditch> Ooh, does sound jolly good.
[08:22:13] <Jokerboxer> I don't trust Wiki with that one.
[08:22:33] <nyditch> Thus my foreword.
[08:23:02] <Jokerboxer> Buffalos in South America? Must be a different milk. Maybe Llama or goat.
[08:23:28] <nyditch> Ah, I forgot to say in India
[08:24:00] <Jokerboxer> Perhaps.

[22:36:31] <Snapai> So people at sea level can get slightly more done in a day, but are aging slightly faster (from a solar time perspective)
[22:37:38] <RandomNinja> I guess
[22:37:38] <Snapai> That adds up to a little over an hour and a half a year o.o
[22:38:00] <RandomNinja> I need to read up on general relativity

[22:38:44] <Trildar> Relativity is confuzzling
[22:38:53] <RandomNinja> 1200m?
[22:38:59] <RandomNinja> sure they do

[22:45:49] <RandomNinja> that would get weird quickly
[22:46:10] <FN> One flight at high altitude would be a weird thing
[22:46:36] <RandomNinja> to be fair we already deal with jet lag
[22:46:36] <FN> Although I always confuse if you'd be older or younger after such flight
[22:47:31] <RandomNinja> depends on who you ask
[22:47:32] <FN> I think older since the close you are to the black hole the slower time ticks
[22:47:53] <FN> I mean older than your identical twin at the sea level

[22:50:12] <RandomNinja> physics is weird
[22:50:41] <FN> And one dive in marianna trench in such increased time dilation would cost you some serious years

[23:23:19] <Unixkitty> Environmental lighting looks that realistic mostly because of photogrammetry.
[23:23:22] <FN> There was a good BF3 and then BF4 mods that made them look ultra-realistic
[23:23:25] <RandomNinja> makes sense
[23:23:37] <FN> But alas EA issued fatwa against it
[23:23:40] <RandomNinja> it's partly because of how soon it is

[23:23:52] <RandomNinja> I'd expect this kind of improvement to take a few years
