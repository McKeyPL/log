[14:33:54] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Funniest Dog Bark Ever!!! (Crazy Springer Spaniel)
[14:34:24] <RandomNinja> integrating in polar coordinates gives you 1/r, which obviously breaks down at r=0
[14:34:33] <RandomNinja> I'm not sure what to do here
[14:34:36] <Misty> Cosine, Sine, Tangent etc
[14:34:54] <FN> Oh dear, I only know how programming around this works, but not the actual formula
[14:35:10] <RandomNinja> Misty: how do you mean?
[14:35:15] <FN> Forgot because I don't need this kind of math
[14:36:13] <FN> I make tools for CAD and this kind of math comes up every now and then, but programs have formulas integrated and downloadable, so I don't need to have them memorised
[14:36:51] <RandomNinja> polar coordinates are ∫∫(1/r)² drdφ
[14:36:52] <Misty> Go to mathisfun. Com
[14:37:20] <FN> also why not ^(-1.5) or is this not a division?
[14:37:58] <RandomNinja> x²+y² = r²
[14:37:59] <FN> Sorry RandomNinja it was too long ago for me to remember this
[14:39:19] <RandomNinja> so (x²+y²)^(-3/2) is r^-3, change to polar coordinates add an r to the numerator => r/r³
