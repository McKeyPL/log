[01:37:06] <Dreamland200> G.M. was amazing
[01:37:11] <thereallynewmop12100> The Only prescription is more cowbell
[01:37:53] <Snapai> Apparently early on they were considering leaving what the secret was til the end, but decided that would make the episode more spoilerable, so put it in the cold open
[01:38:06] <Eywind> interesting
[01:38:34] <Snapai> Since it really wasn't an episode about the secret, but rather, Pinkie trying to keep a secret. XD
[01:38:50] <Lycan> Yeah, the writing was amazing
[01:38:56] <Snapai> Also, something kinda' glossed over-
[01:38:59] <Eywind> IDK I still felt like it was one of those episodes where you know exactly what's gonna happen

[03:16:10] <Eywind> XD
[03:16:15] <Midli> its a knub

[03:24:57] <keekle> hi
[03:24:59] <Eywind> hey keekle
[03:25:05] <MikeM> Howdy, keekle 
[03:25:51] <keekle> i need to rewatch this weeks episode
[03:26:16] <Eywind> I bet you do
[03:26:21] <keekle> heheh
[03:26:30] <Eywind> I'm sure it's slightly better in the context that you know what you know at the end of the episode
[03:26:57] <keekle> not a fan of it?
[03:27:02] <Eywind> Not particularly
[03:27:10] <keekle> it was a bit slapsticky
[03:27:20] * Flurshy boops someone
[03:27:51] <Eywind> The conflict was pretty expected and the whole "shoe being on the other hoof" situation or whatever idk I just didn't really like it
[03:27:52] <MikeM> The flashbacks were unusual, too.
[03:27:54] <Eywind> It wasn't a bad episode or anything
[03:28:05] <keekle> it was amusing
[03:28:08] <keekle> not deep
[03:28:17] <Eywind> flashbacks?
[03:28:18] <keekle> though the ramifications are huge :)
[03:28:34] <Eywind> did I miss some part? hmm
[03:28:44] <MikeM> Family Guy style flashbacks of things that happened in the past, but were never shown in previous episodes.
[03:28:55] <MikeM> There were a couple in this one, but the show overall doesn't use them.

[03:39:11] <Eywind> yeah they got to hang out without the world in the balance or fighting voracious worms
[03:39:43] <Muffin_Spectacles> Though one has to wonder if she was all full of pent-up energy after that last encounter, and decided to 'work it out' when she got back.

[04:18:47] <Eywind> Were you at the game or just watching on TV?
[04:18:53] <thunderace> tv
[04:18:57] <Eywind> ok that's good
[04:19:03] <Hamtramck> One of my coworkers is an East Lansing grad.
[04:19:14] <Eywind> A couple of my friends are Michigan alums and went to the game
[04:19:22] <thunderace> kool
[04:19:23] <Eywind> so I have to make sure not to talk too much trash to them
[04:19:32] <thunderace> it was a good game tho'
[04:19:38] <RandomNinja> Eywind, do it anyway
[04:19:41] <Eywind> Yeah but if you went to the game
[04:19:54] <Eywind> traveled and went, and felt like you were winning up until the last 8 seconds
[04:20:17] <Hamtramck> Coworkers talk about the Michigan/OSU sports rivalry a lot, since the client's... OSU fans, this being Columbus, and a lot of our team are from Michigan.
[04:20:28] <Eywind> Yep
[04:20:30] <thunderace> yeah but still it was a great game
[04:20:34] <Eywind> I mean it's a big rivalry
[04:20:38] <Eywind> You're not wrong, it was a really close game
[04:20:43] <thunderace> ehh
[04:20:44] <Eywind> just took one miscue to chang eit
[04:20:47] <Hamtramck> We had a team lunch on Wednesday.
[04:20:54] <Hamtramck> Coworkers spent the entire time talking about it and I just
[04:21:07] <Hamtramck> am so sick of hearing about it.
[04:21:24] <thunderace> dont worry dude it is kinda dumb
[04:21:27] <Hamtramck> Well, the guy that was screwing around with his cellphone (and probably cheating on his wife via sais cellphone) wasn't talking much at all.
[04:21:30] <thunderace> sorry to all osu fans here
[04:21:42] <wobniaR> SPORTSBALL!
[04:21:44] <Eywind> ...
[04:21:57] <Eywind> It's dumb until you interact daily with people that are fans of the other team.
[04:22:03] <Hamtramck> I'm kind of tired of dealing with living next to the OSU campus, or dealing with OSU students in general.
[04:22:18] <Eywind> and wow nice phone actions
[04:22:18] * Regulus flops on top of Eywind 
[04:22:26] <thunderace> i mean its big but i like the sec moor tho
[04:22:46] <Hamtramck> It comes up in every !@#% conversation at work and I swear to god it's really trying my patience because of how ridiculous and forced it is.
[04:23:01] <Eywind> Bruh you know what else is ridiculous?  Michigan Football LOLOLOLOL
[04:23:14] <Eywind> and you know what else is forced?  That laugh :/
[04:23:21] <thunderace> yup that why i watch sec lsu alabama old miss auburn
[04:23:26] * RandomNinja sportsballs wobniaR 
[04:23:28] <thunderace> its alot of fun to watch those teams
[04:23:52] <Eywind> I guess; I hated watching them when I watched more football, and the ego of the SEC is unbearable, even more magnified by the media the last 6 years
[04:23:54] <thunderace> right now im watching the lsu florida game
[04:23:59] <Hamtramck> Manager really wants to the team -- as in, my team of coworkers -- to be close.

[04:24:28] <Hamtramck> It's like bro I don't like being in social situations and I don't really like you guys in general. You can't pay me to be more extroverted and the more you try to force this the more I'm just going to shut down :D
[04:24:28] <Eywind> that better be a chaos dunk

[04:55:55] <Regulus> Of course not
[04:56:05] <RandomNinja> no, creme brulee
[04:56:11] <Eywind> that constitutes a fancy party?

[04:56:26] <Eywind> oh so I should probably watch the football game my team is playing lol
[04:56:35] <wobniaR> Come to think of it, was Spike at this week's party?
[04:56:42] <Eywind> I think so
[04:56:46] <RandomNinja> well, champagne, suits, 3 course dinner, stage performances
[04:56:53] <RandomNinja> I'd say that qualifies as fancy
[04:57:11] <Regulus> Oh my
[04:57:12] <Eywind> nope he wasn't
[04:57:16] <Eywind> oh yeah that's facy

[04:59:38] <Regulus> Well, he's not a background character, he's not main cast on a regular basis. 
[04:59:48] <Eywind> He's getting a bit more involved
[04:59:58] <Eywind> He was at least present earlier in the episode
[05:00:00] <MikeM> He has his own chair
[05:00:01] <Eywind> Just not later
[05:00:12] <Eywind> He's more present in the show than like 75% of the fanfics
[05:00:30] <Eywind> that just ignore him or dedicate maybe five lines to Twilight leaving him at home or him sleeping
[05:00:33] <Regulus> He's like Newman on Seinfeld.
