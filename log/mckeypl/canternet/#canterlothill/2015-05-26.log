[01:42:45] <Cloud_Zephyr> thats my friends class lul
[01:42:50] <Regulus> Well, it is college XP
[01:43:05] <RandomNinja> which is like most of STEM except for pure biology and chemistry
[01:43:09] <Eywind> I mean I could have gotten some GFs
[01:43:12] <Eywind> I just wasn't in the right mindset
[01:44:06] <RandomNinja> too busy acquiring sick gradez
[01:44:10] <Eywind> Umm
[01:44:11] <Eywind> No
[01:44:14] <Regulus> Dating in college isn't for everyone 
[01:44:15] <Eywind> Quite the opposite lol
[01:44:37] <RandomNinja> too busy drinking to forget about your grades :P
[01:44:40] <Eywind> Usually 'dating' for my friends meant 'having a lot of sex and occasionally doing things other than that'
[01:44:42] <Regulus> Some people are just too focused
[01:44:51] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> !t Eywind
[01:44:52] <DinkyBot> Eywind, can BagelPie JackShy be canon?
[01:44:58] <Eywind> since it's a lot quicker to spend an hour in someone's dorm room than a couple hours out on a date
[01:45:01] <Eywind> wat
[01:45:04] <Eywind> no
[01:45:06] <Regulus> Some don't want a casual fling
[01:45:12] <RandomNinja> Eywind pls
[01:45:25] <Eywind> RandomNinja more like "burdened by crippling depression and therefore was not good in the head for girls, even though he had a couple that were interested" but that's beside the point :P
[01:45:40] <Regulus> nuuuu 
[01:45:41] <RandomNinja> I meant the canon thing :P
[01:45:44] <Eywind> Uhhuh
[01:45:50] <Cloud_Zephyr> oh
[01:45:51] * Regulus hugs Eywind 
[01:45:53] <Eywind> Hey I'm fine now
[01:45:56] <Eywind> but thanks :)
[01:45:59] <Eywind> Well okay, I'm slightly better now
[01:46:03] <Cloud_Zephyr> my dumb phone is so dumb it hasn't got any space
[01:46:06] * RandomNinja boops the Eywind with a cookie

[01:46:12] * Eywind clicksa
[01:46:14] <RandomNinja> mwahaha
[01:46:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> i guess that can work depending on how much space it comes with
[01:47:13] <Eywind> But yes if you're in the right mindset to date
[01:47:13] <Regulus> Needs expandable storage
[01:47:17] <Eywind> and you find the right girls you're gold
[01:47:40] <RandomNinja> also don't get too drunk
[01:47:44] <Eywind> ^
[01:47:52] <Eywind> Well too drunk too often
[01:47:54] <Cloud_Zephyr> git moderatly drunk
[01:47:58] <RandomNinja> that helps both long term and, uh, short term :P
[01:48:00] <Eywind> just make sure to travel in packs
[01:48:08] <Eywind> that's the biggest thing I tell people
[01:48:17] <Regulus> Aye

[01:48:46] <RandomNinja> also don't use drunkness as an excuse to be a douche

[01:49:13] <Eywind> I have a 64gb one in mind

[01:49:22] <Regulus> There is NO EXCUSE to be a douche

[01:50:04] <RandomNinja> well yeah I mean the stereotype associated with the term
[01:50:15] <Eywind> I know, but I'm just saying they have their benefits
[01:50:17] <Regulus> Yeah....
[01:50:22] <RandomNinja> not just dudes at a frathouse
[01:50:32] <Eywind> I don't want to see any of those fratbros between the hours of 4AM and 10PM

[01:51:43] <RandomNinja> you can also buy several gallons of cheap apple juice and add yeast
