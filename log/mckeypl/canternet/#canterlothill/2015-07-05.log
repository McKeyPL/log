[04:26:45] <DerpyBot> I need to ask Twilight about that one.
[04:26:45] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about Pinkie Pie's Big Bounce House
[04:26:58] <wobniaR> Oh yeah I remember this one

[04:33:19] <wobniaR> Much less whining in general about this episode
[04:33:44] <wobniaR> Guess it matches peoples headcanons better
[04:33:51] <MikeM> More backstory, and Twilight working on being a better friend. It was nice.
[04:34:07] <wobniaR> Minuette was voiced by a newcomer too
[04:34:21] <wobniaR> I looked up her imdb, don't recognize anything on there

[04:37:24] <MikeM> Was it? I saw a screencap, but haven't rewatched the ep yet.
[04:37:45] <wobniaR> Yeah when Twilight blackmails Moondancer to go to the restaurant, she's in the background covered by a menu
[04:37:51] <MikeM> (speculation obscured)
[04:38:07] <MikeM> Interesting.
[04:38:15] <wobniaR> It's like the villian of the season can't go to a fancy restaurant for a bite to eat without being overanalyzed
[04:38:28] <MikeM> Can't a mare just go out for a sandwich?
[04:38:32] <wobniaR> ^
[04:38:49] <wobniaR> Judging by the restaurant it'd be like a $15 small sandwich
[04:39:24] <MikeM> Potato chips extra.
[04:40:16] <wobniaR> I've been to places that charge like $4 for a fountain drink and $3 for a small bag of chips
