[23:30:15] <Cloud_Zephyr> 9 days ro decide whether i need http://www.cyberghostvpn.com or not

[23:31:12] <Cloud_Zephyr> hola is only useful for getting past region blocks, does nothing for privacy stuff
[23:31:24] <Unixkitty> Why would you want a VPN?
[23:32:51] <Cloud_Zephyr> mainly to use against the proposed surveillance bill in the uk, but also to get onto muh torrent sites and the mobile data compression
[23:33:22] <Unixkitty> Doesn't seem very cheap
[23:33:37] <Unixkitty> Don't forget your network speed may suffer somewhat as well

[23:34:06] <Unixkitty> It also seems that there's a similar bill or of sort at least is trying to get squeezed in USA
[23:34:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> £30 a year isn’t that bad, also the speed seems fine on the free version
[23:35:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> just want to make sure a vpn will actually help
[23:38:25] <Unixkitty> There is also this apparently https://www.betternet.co/
[23:40:20] <Cloud_Zephyr> ooo i’ll look into that. usually free means too good to be true but https://www.betternet.co/transparency.html
