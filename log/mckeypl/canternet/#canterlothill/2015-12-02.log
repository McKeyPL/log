[03:00:12] <thereallynewmop12100> Later, RandomNinja
[03:00:14] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: Tell me..
[03:00:20] <EM-C> A lack of Sparity.
[03:00:28] <EM-C> This was a practically 
[03:00:31] <EM-C> Arg!
[03:00:41] <EM-C> This was a practically Sparityless season.
[03:00:52] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: I know
[03:01:20] <EM-C> And even though we saw Spike's crush on Rarity twice in the finale, other than the alternate reality where she was mean to him, they didn't interact at all.
[03:01:45] <EM-C> Couldn't they have let her nuzzle him at the end or **something**???
[03:01:56] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: I watched Rudolph in the past hour
[03:02:07] <EM-C> I didn't know Rudolph was on tonight.
[03:02:15] <EM-C> I also forgot to watch Charlie Brown last night.
[03:02:23] <EM-C> TCM is showing Ma and Pa Kettle tonight.
[03:02:58] <EM-C> In Spike's birthday episode, we saw that Rarity obviously knew he had a crush on her.
[03:03:12] <thereallynewmop12100> EM-C: I know. 
[03:03:23] <EM-C> And even in "Castle Sweet Castle" she batted her eyelashes at him.
[03:03:47] <EM-C> I just wish they'd show she really cares about him.  They make her look cruel towards him.  I know they don't mean to, but...
[03:04:00] <wobniaR> Perspective
[03:04:15] <EM-C> Anyway, it looks like Sparity is gone so far as the show itself is concerned.
[03:04:20] <wobniaR> It never existed
[03:04:25] <wobniaR> Spike's a baby dragon
[03:04:28] <EM-C> It's either going to be the comics now, or else limited forever to fan fics.
[03:04:55] <EM-C> They could still show that she is his friend.
[03:04:59] <wobniaR> They do
[03:05:01] <wobniaR> Many times
[03:05:24] <EM-C> Spike and Rarity were barely together at all this entire season.
[03:05:42] <EM-C> And they really should have given them a scene together, however brief, in the finale.
[03:05:58] <wobniaR> They had to shove a ton into the finale already
[03:06:09] <wobniaR> No room
[03:06:17] <EM-C> I guess so...but after AU Rarity was so mean to him...
[03:06:28] <wobniaR> Yeah because she was a servant of an evil tyrant
[03:06:40] <wobniaR> With no relationship to him
[03:06:57] <wobniaR> That's not represenative of the Rarity we all know and love
[03:07:04] <EM-C> I know I'm just projecting ('cause I once had my heart broken by a beautiful girl), but...I just wish they'd show that she really cares about him, in whatever context.
[03:07:43] <EM-C> You know, I was really hoping that when the map summoned Rarity to a problem that Spike would go with her, maybe to solve a problem involving dragons.
[03:08:56] <EM-C> I can see why they did what they did with that ep, and it was certainly a good one, but it was disappointing that it was just to clean up a park in Manehattan (and friendships too, I know).

[15:17:38] <RandomNinja> sure
[15:18:04] <Jokerboxer> The reason they didn't use weapons was because Celestia regonized that the Sombra Soldiers were victims. She wanted to free them them without killing them.
[15:18:36] <RandomNinja> probably more because it's for kids
[15:19:00] <Jokerboxer> ...
[15:20:26] <RandomNinja> srsly though, if that's the reasoning you would put your own soldiers at unnecessary risk

[18:39:42] <Midnight_Lilly> My AI is very aggressive. I have attacks hitting planets all over. At least 6 attacks a galactic day. I can't keep up. But it uses a little more strategy then pile numbers on till it wins now
[18:40:07] <Inucroft[NLR]> Midnight_Lilly eh I still own it (got it for ~£4 in a discount PC Game shop) years ago. But just don;t like it that much, fun, but little varity in games

[18:41:41] <Midnight_Lilly> Though most mod's have not put much thought into the map designs when they change them. All extremely huge. Maps are better small on empire at war
[18:41:58] <RandomNinja> also improves DOF
[18:42:48] <Midnight_Lilly> DOF?
[18:43:05] <RandomNinja> depth of field
[18:43:09] <RandomNinja> also known as heresy
[18:43:37] <Midnight_Lilly> The issue with empire at war space battles is that the AI. Likes to use hit and run tactics even when attacking
[18:43:56] <Midnight_Lilly> For the rebellion it's works fairly well
[18:44:11] <Midnight_Lilly> For the empire it ends up making there attacks basicly a joke
[18:44:55] <RandomNinja> empire should use a big wall of death?
[18:45:28] <Midnight_Lilly> Well let me put it this way
[18:45:56] <Midnight_Lilly> They send in a wave you take out a ship and all three ships slowly turn around and run away them come back in another wave again
[18:46:27] <RandomNinja> guerilla tactics with large, slow star destroyers?
[18:46:27] <Midnight_Lilly> They turn so slowly however the you can take half the attack out and cripple the rest.
[18:46:33] <Midnight_Lilly> Yeah
[18:46:38] <Midnight_Lilly> Basically
[18:46:40] <RandomNinja> that's dumb
[18:46:59] <Midnight_Lilly> They use it with the smaller star destroyers also
[18:48:04] <Midnight_Lilly> The only saving grace is that every star destroyer carries a lot of fighters and bombers. Like a rebel fleet attacking can have 25 units in play. A empire one can have 38 in play
[18:48:53] <Midnight_Lilly> Plus they have advantage in tech. They have the ability to adapt to any type of attack basically
