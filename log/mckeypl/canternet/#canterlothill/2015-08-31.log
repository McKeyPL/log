[00:24:43] <Eywind> ohai
[00:24:50] <Eywind> how's you today?
[00:25:17] <Ali> So I went to my game store to check out the fetchlands, P Delta is up X2 its price I remembered it being.
[00:25:31] <Ali> Also
[00:25:49] * Ali shows Eywind her newest foils, Foil Liliana and Foil Maze of Ith
[00:25:51] <Eywind> yea delta is like $25
[00:25:52] <Eywind> Hah nice
[00:25:54] <Eywind> which maze of ith?
[00:25:58] <Ali> FTV
[00:26:06] <Eywind> Ah cool
[00:26:22] <Ali> Cause I always wanted one and they're never in the case
[00:26:22] <Eywind> I like the Judge one slightly more, but for the price I'll def take the FTV
[00:26:39] <Ali> Yeah I also bought the Eldrazi vs Zendikar
[00:26:43] <Eywind> Sweet
[00:27:13] <Ali> But I'm glad I got me a playset of all the fetchlands before the price went up.
[00:27:17] <Eywind> indeed
[00:27:23] <Eywind> but still
[00:27:29] <Eywind> foil full art fetchlands :P
[00:27:34] <Ali> Yeah
[00:27:42] <Eywind> which Liliana did you get?
[00:27:55] <Ali> Heritical Healer or however its spelled
[00:28:08] <Eywind> Ah coo
[00:28:18] <Eywind> Yeah that one's not too bad in the coco decks
[00:28:36] <Ali> Yeah I'm not passing up on a foil plainswalker
[00:28:46] <Eywind> I'm sure I can find you some foil Tibalts :P
[00:29:04] <Ali> Well at least I can say I have an Avenger of Zendikar now
[00:29:09] <Ali> And it looks cool too.
[00:29:12] <Eywind> Yeah and that one looks a lot better than the other
[00:29:18] <Ali> I needed one for my token EDH
[00:29:31] <Eywind> indeed
[00:29:36] <Eywind> boundless realms > avenger of zendikar
[00:29:43] <Eywind> or avenger of zendikar > boundless realms
[00:29:52] <Eywind> either way you win lol
[00:30:10] <Ali> Do you know that 2 drop cobra from zendikar block?
[00:30:18] <Eywind> Lotus Cobra, yeah
[00:30:30] <Ali> He loves fetchlands
[00:30:35] <Eywind> Indeed he does
[00:30:50] <Eywind> GU ramp with Jace was a deck back then
[00:30:53] <Eywind> I played it, it was fun
[00:31:03] <Ali> Big Jace?
[00:31:07] <Eywind> jtms
[00:31:21] <Eywind> cuz turn 3 you can cast Jace and still have Spell Pierce up
[00:32:04] *** Andromeda is now known as SkyHigh
[00:34:00] <Eywind> and then play Primeval Titan or Frost Titan the following turn
[00:34:07] <Eywind> was a pretty sweet deck
[00:34:29] <Ali> I still think Frost Titan was underrated
[00:35:03] <Eywind> It just wasn't good in that metagame
[00:35:14] <Eywind> it's quite powerful
[00:37:04] <Cloud_Zephyr> lel why was i away
[00:37:17] <Eywind> cuz udum
[00:37:21] <Eywind> nerd
[00:37:23] <Cloud_Zephyr> :P
[00:38:01] <Eywind> hmm, rakdos's return or falkenrath aristocrat
[00:38:36] <Ali> Wow there's some good to decent EDH cards in this dual decks, but on their own, they both stink
[00:38:41] <Eywind> hah yeah
[00:39:28] <Eywind> rakdos's return because I own it it is :P
[00:39:39] <Ali> What's that?
[00:40:12] <Eywind> ah I'm working on my cube and had some RB slots
[00:40:34] <Eywind> Rakdos's Return is XBR, deal x damage to target opponent & they discard x cards
[00:41:00] <Ali> Ah
[00:41:19] * Ali would play with Eywind but probably lives on the other side of the world or something like that.
