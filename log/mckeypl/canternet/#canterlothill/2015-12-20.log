[05:12:44] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> She would think I am weird.
[05:12:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> i’ve been thinking about 4k, but i want to wait until it’s the same price as 1080p. which could be a while
[05:13:07] <Sombra> 4k for gaming just isn't quite worth it.
[05:13:16] <Sombra> Not when you have to spend $2000 on graphics card just to get it to work semi-normal.

[05:14:35] <SaultSteMarie> So yeah I can't play TW3 till that gets here next week.
[05:14:49] <Cloud_Zephyr> i want a 1440p. should have the same space as my 5k work imac (minus the pixel density)
[05:14:52] <SaultSteMarie> Since the overclocks on the r7 240 I have now can't keep up with Velen.
[05:15:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> 1080p is annoying me because thinks get squished up when i have windows side by side

[22:53:42] <SaultSteMarie> I got an R9 380x coming in the mail but people tell me I coulda just went the extra 100 and got a 970 although people tell me that at that point I coulda just gone another 100 and got a 980TI although people tell me that at that point I coulda just waited and seen what AMD's new stuff this summer will be
[22:53:43] * DerpyBot puts some carrot muffins in DinkyBot's bag and wakes her up for school
[22:53:44] * DinkyBot hides her head under the blankets and grumbles. "5 more minutes, momma!"
[22:53:57] <SaultSteMarie> so i wonder if pc gamers actually play games or just delay buying GPUs to see what the next new GPU will be
[22:54:17] <Eywind> the latter
[22:55:02] <Eywind> "oh man this 8970x came out and I've been watching it for 6 months!  BUTTT the AMD conference is in 2 months and you know they always announce something else... I'll just wait until then"
[22:55:16] <RandomNinja> can confirm

[22:56:08] <Eywind> When I asked a couple people about building a new computer.  "My computer can't handle Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 very well, probably time to get a new computer built" (right when FO4 came out) "You should wait until Spring when the parts start to get on sale"
[22:56:09] <Eywind> wut
[22:56:25] <RandomNinja> that's just silly
[22:56:41] <thereallynewmop12100> Is AMD handles Gmod & TF2?
[22:56:45] <RandomNinja> yes
[22:56:56] <Sketchy_Sounds> They don't make those things
[22:57:03] <Sketchy_Sounds> But they handle them just fine
[22:57:15] <wobniaR> You don't need a gtx 980ti for gmod & tf2
[22:57:22] <RandomNinja> lies
