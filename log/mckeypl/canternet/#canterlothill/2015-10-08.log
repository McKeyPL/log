[03:18:58] <Regulus> nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 
[03:19:47] <Hamtramck> tbh it doesn't sound like Skylines did anything to address the issues I had with SC4's city model
[03:19:59] <RandomNinja> which is?
[03:22:08] <Hamtramck> Mixed-use zoning (for buildings housing both residential and commercial tennants), modeling homelesness and gentrification, uh... making areas that are in use for something during both the day and night to reduce crime in what would otherwise be unpopulated spaces...
[03:22:23] <Hamtramck> Also I think it still has highly accelerated construction times
[03:22:47] <Hamtramck> Whereas lengthy construction projects have a big impact on how cities flow...
[03:23:02] <RandomNinja> this is true
[03:23:16] <Hamtramck> Also stuff like racial tension although that's... a sensitive issue.
[03:23:17] <RandomNinja> some of those things might be fixed by mods tho
[03:24:03] <RandomNinja> that's not necessarily a thing everywhere though
[03:24:19] <Hamtramck> True.
[03:24:45] <RandomNinja> america has their black-white problems, that doesn't really exist in europe
[03:24:45] <Hamtramck> But then let's take the positive -- ethnically diverse communities create demand for more diverse retail/dining/commercial stuff.
[03:25:29] <Hamtramck> So if you take that into account you could also look at it in terms of local business v big business, since the niche commercial stuff tends to be locally owned.

[15:48:20] <JockeTF> Hamtramck: Yeah, it's not fast enough for videos. But an internal hard drive most certainly is. ;)
[15:48:37] <JockeTF> Works for game-play though.
[15:48:39] * RandomNinja sits on Regulus' tail
[15:48:46] <JockeTF> But that's why I'm installing it to the hard drive.
[15:48:59] <Hamtramck> That reminds me. G Darius has major performance issues on an actual PSX or PS2, but runs at a proper framerate on emulation.
[15:49:20] <Hamtramck> I wasn't aware of games running faster in emulation thna on hardware though. Wondering which other ones do it, now.
[15:49:34] <JockeTF> They even create virtual memory cards for PSX, just like for PS2.
[15:49:39] <JockeTF> Very nice.
[15:49:43] <RandomNinja> emulation performance usually only depends on your hardware
[15:50:08] <RandomNinja> assuming it's written well, obviously
[15:50:15] <JockeTF> Well, the PS2 has hardward support for PSX.
[15:50:18] <JockeTF> As far as I know.
[15:50:26] <Hamtramck> Random, yeah. I thought it was usually capped to the original system, so that if you had slowdown on hardware, you'd still have it in emulation.
[15:50:27] <JockeTF> Also, they use the emulation code from SONY.
[15:51:03] <JockeTF> I think that tries to stay as accurate as possible, apart from game load times.
[15:51:54] <Hamtramck> Wasn't the load time stuff a menu option?
[15:52:00] <Hamtramck> Like you had fast load and sprite smoothing.
