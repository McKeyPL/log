[00:21:20] <FruitNibbler> Whuch reminds me again that i need to tension the neck of my bass guitar
[00:21:56] <Flurshy> so
[00:22:08] <Flurshy> our living room TV actually has a headphone output
[00:22:36] <Flurshy> here's the odd thing though... turning up both channels cancels out the vocals on a movie
[00:22:55] <Flurshy> it doesn't cancel out the sound effects, just what I assume is the center channel
[00:24:21] <FruitNibbler> Yup that is a function in modern dolby surround setups
[00:24:33] <Flurshy> why
[00:24:35] <FruitNibbler> The dialogue comes from a middle speaker
[00:24:42] <Flurshy> no like
[00:24:48] <Flurshy> headphone jack in the side of the TV
[00:24:56] <FruitNibbler> Unless the voice is somehow in the background sounds
[00:25:10] <Flurshy> hook it up to my speaker... if you only use one side it's fine, but turn both up and it cancels out
[00:25:28] <Flurshy> I might get a DAC anyway and hook it directly to the bluray player
[00:25:45] <Flurshy> turns out our bluray player uses coaxial instead of toslink, so I already have the cable, just need the box
[00:26:26] <FruitNibbler> Some TVs have this feature that lets the dialogue come from TV speakers, and the external audio provides all other sounds
[00:26:44] <FruitNibbler> Maybe that's the setup you have, only not working as intended
[00:27:03] <Flurshy> I tried the TV's audio options and it came up with "Audio option cannot be set while in wired headset mode"
[00:27:19] <FruitNibbler> It is a good idea IMO: I prefer to hear the dialogue more clear than the sound effects
[00:27:29] <RandomNinja> !t Flurshy 
[00:27:30] <DinkyBot> Flurshy: this makes more sense for Russia
[00:27:35] <FruitNibbler> And with recent movie stuff it is the other way around
[00:27:45] <Flurshy> see what I'm trying to do is use my PA speaker like a soundbar, so we'll have some bass

[17:21:16] <FruitNibbler> LEL Florida court slaps a man with a fee of 210$ for not being able to pay previous court fee for wrongful accusation (found not guilty)
[17:21:33] <RandomNinja> the system works
[17:21:44] <FruitNibbler> A person that has no money has to pay for not having money XD
[17:22:14] <RandomNinja> Don't they have overdraft fees for ATMs as well?
[17:22:31] <FruitNibbler> That at least is a contract deal
[17:22:41] <RandomNinja> still disgusting
[17:23:04] <RandomNinja> you don't have enough money to withdraw that? Here's some additional huge fees!
[17:23:19] <FruitNibbler> When you are accused by the system of wrongdoing and acquitted, I think it is a bit wrong to demand moneys for the court proceeds...
[17:23:56] <FruitNibbler> That just sounds like a racket ring
