[01:17:49] <Sombra> Specifically for food, and cost of living.
[01:18:12] <Sombra> I get by paying rent on 750/mo
[01:18:24] <Sombra> and food of course, and other things.
[01:18:51] <RandomNinja> what does 750 get you?
[01:18:58] *** Quits: Playstation (Playstation@Playstation.Pone.64) (Connection closed)
[01:19:05] <Sombra> A two bedroom house.
[01:19:12] <RandomNinja> neat
[01:19:32] <Sombra> rent is 300/mo, gas/electric is 30 in the summer 80 in the winter (split with roomate)
[01:20:24] <Sombra> I've seen those tiny little closet flats in britian, outragous how much they cost.
[01:20:45] <One-Trick> my book rental for 1 month was $72 for a Kindle version

[01:21:37] <RandomNinja> in smaller towns, yes
[01:21:39] <Shrike> I live in the middle of nowhere though
[01:21:45] <Shrike> So that's full of room
[01:21:49] <One-Trick> it cost me $700/month for a 2 bedroom apartment in tampa xD
[01:21:56] <One-Trick> that doesnt include any utilities
[01:22:13] <thereallynewmop12100> snitch567:  <3 
[01:22:20] <One-Trick> and it was a crap apartment
[01:22:30] <RandomNinja> suddenly my $500 1 bedroom apartment with everything included doesn't seem so bad
[01:22:42] <Sombra> 700$ a month would get you a nice box in sanfrancisco
[01:22:50] <One-Trick> hah yea
[01:22:56] <Sombra> 800 will get you a 1 bedroom studio, in the ghetto

[01:24:03] <Sombra> Most things are more expensive in the UK, judging from what my friend has told me.
[01:24:24] <Sombra> particularly the healthcare it seems.
[01:24:39] <Shrike> ....
[01:25:04] <Sombra> Well, someone's got to pay for it.
[01:25:14] <Sombra> It certainly doesn't fall out of the sky.
[01:25:21] <Shrike> Yes, taxes
[01:25:29] <Shrike> Those things everyone pays?
[01:25:35] <Sombra> And that's why it's more expensive.
[01:26:22] <Sombra> But our schooling is more expensive, we spend more per student on public education than the UK.
[01:26:30] <Shrike> I think it's better to pay a small about over a long time than have to drop loads of money every time something bad happens
[01:26:49] <Shrike> *amount
[01:26:50] <Sombra> I agree, thats' why we had insurance.  Which... USED To be affordable for people.
[01:27:09] <Sombra> Which most people had.
[01:29:14] <Sombra> Well, hopefully the AHCA will eventually get repealed and people will be able to afford insurance again.

[08:41:29] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Then again, I'm not an expert like the likes of DustyKatt or IHeartKimPossible, or any of those guys, so I wonder if anyone would care.
