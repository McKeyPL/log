[04:05:26] <FinalDraft> Summer of love remixes are brilliant in of themselves
[04:05:38] <FinalDraft> then Myon and Shane54 went and made a song.... based on those vibes
[04:05:38] <CrimsonFirefall> I'm a bit late to the show cuz of computer issues
[04:05:42] <HardCover-KPNY> Hi darft
[04:05:44] <FinalDraft> then Kevin Wild made this mix
[04:05:57] <FinalDraft> Trance is all about people building on eachother's work
[04:05:58] <Araxnus> Myon & Shane 54 is love. This remix is well done!
[04:06:02] <Araxnus> Yup :)
[04:06:07] <PointNClick> I just now realized that Racebest comes on this channel

[04:07:00] * Araxnus giggles and hides
[04:07:15] <Eywind> It really depends on which we're talking about

[04:13:10] <Ypsilanti> they're synced to music sort of but the music is like
[04:13:13] <FinalDraft> talk about a perfect evening, I have trance, and I have RC cola
[04:13:16] <Ypsilanti> just ten seconds of some song then it switches over
[04:13:18] <FinalDraft> little else can be done to improve things
[04:13:24] <CrimsonFirefall> Cookies?
[04:13:33] <Ypsilanti> Also the smoke cloud is obscuring the fireworks
[04:13:35] <Toby_SC> maybe some deep fried stuff?

[04:17:57] <PointNClick> I remember last year, we were getting some sonic shakes to watch the fireworks with, and this guy in a truck threw a firecracker onto the parking lot and it was loud as heck
[04:18:00] <PointNClick> We were right next to him
[04:18:10] <Toby_SC> Double Pegasus awesomeness
[04:18:22] <Araxnus> Bahahaha
[04:18:28] <Eywind> I know some drunk hicks threw some firecrackers like under my grandparents car in Arkansas
[04:18:35] <Araxnus> Wub you guys. Ha!
[04:18:36] * FrozenSound goes to the fridge to get that Monster
[04:18:40] <Eywind> not sure how far under but they did go off and shot across the road, it was cool
[04:18:43] <Araxnus> Do witt
[04:18:50] <Araxnus> JUST DO IT
[04:19:16] <FinalDraft> this track is what Protoculture uses to intro "Gravity South," his podcast
[04:19:30] <FinalDraft> Gravity South is a HUGE source of new songs for me, and it's just a great free listen
[04:19:30] <ynoP> Yesterday a bunch of teenagers drove down my street firing fireworks in any direction but up. One went off right by my window as I sat there.
[04:19:38] <MikeM> We all know there's only one true Pegasus song, anyway.
[04:19:42] <PointNClick> Eywind I once had one of those roman candle thingies
[04:19:45] <PointNClick> Those are awesome
[04:19:47] <Araxnus> Ah yes. I remember, FinalDraft 
[04:19:57] <Eywind> Yeah I've heard those are popular
[04:20:00] <wobniaR> Pegasususususus

[04:21:10] <PointNClick> so yeah
[04:21:14] <PointNClick> I didn't know at first
[04:21:29] <FinalDraft> Usually Protoculture is super high on any list of mine, but this time around it was just a tad too repetitive for me to do that.... for this track....
[04:21:45] <ynoP> I only know one illegal fireworks store, but it's pretty shady
[04:21:45] <PointNClick> Listening to Trance in the dark is like, the best way
[04:22:00] <Araxnus> Least they made it on. But yeah I agree. Well on this track
[04:22:05] <PointNClick> ynoP I know a firework store in Kansas....which is RIGHT next to a gas station
[04:22:09] <ynoP> PointNClick: Smoke and lasers

[05:02:35] <FinalDraft> yes.
[05:02:38] <FinalDraft> yes. yes. yes.
[05:02:43] <FinalDraft> The vocals weren't up to snuff
[05:02:58] <PointNClick> FinalDraft the tempo that the light is flashing seems to be the same for all songs, like, it fits perfectly every time
[05:03:00] <FinalDraft> I was surprised actually, My Heaven was a mazing
[05:03:11] <FinalDraft> PointNClick: that'd be 138 if I had to guess
[05:03:12] <Toby_SC> indeed
[05:03:15] <FinalDraft> and we shouldn't be afraid of it
[05:03:20] <PointNClick> yeah
[05:03:26] <Eywind> Frozen's had it synced at 132 the whole time
[05:03:36] <Toby_SC> Who's afraid of 138?
[05:03:36] <PointNClick> Ah
[05:03:36] <FinalDraft> not me!

[05:04:51] <FinalDraft> FrozenSound, Dave, Araxnus and I all got shoutouts on Universal Nation, Alex Morph's show. it was fun

[05:05:08] <Eywind> Yeah I heard about that, Araxnus was super hyped then
[05:05:08] <PointNClick> noice
[05:05:15] <FrozenSound> though mine derped in the live broadcast
[05:05:37] <FinalDraft> it sounded fine
[05:05:59] <FrozenSound> nah the voice was way too deep and slow
[05:06:07] <FinalDraft> if Alex had fixed the vocals for this track it would have been god-tier trance, but it's brilliant as a dub anyway
[05:06:08] <PointNClick> This makes me wonder what program they made it with, because I want to use it
[05:06:54] <FinalDraft> this next track is awesome dark
[05:07:19] <Araxnus> "<+FinalDraft> FrozenSound, Dave, Araxnus and I all got shoutouts on Universal Nation, Alex Morph's show. it was fun" Yeah that was cool. Still gotta do mine.
