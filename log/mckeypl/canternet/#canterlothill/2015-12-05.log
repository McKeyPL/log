[00:15:43] <nyditch> The solution: build our own space craft.
[00:15:49] <LetsEatHay> they should just have celestia launch it
[00:15:49] <thereallynewmop12100> ponyshouldhibernate: This is my reaction: http://media.thedailytouch.com/2014/05/nooooooooo.gif

[00:16:10] <LetsEatHay> hahaha
[00:16:30] <ponyshouldhibernate> thereallynewmop12100: hehe, yeah, just saw it
[00:16:59] <nyditch> Well, space will still be there tomorrow. Probably.
[00:17:00] <ponyshouldhibernate> thereallynewmop12100: are there any weeping angels on the ISS?
[00:17:22] <LetsEatHay> is there a 'tomorrow' in space?
[00:17:30] <nyditch> Not sure, but there are no weeping angels in the ocean. Too many fish that don't blink.
[00:18:07] <LetsEatHay> haha, maybe all the ones that ever went in the ocean are stuck there now
[00:18:08] <thereallynewmop12100> Maybe T.O.M & Sara will launch the ship
[00:18:48] <ponyshouldhibernate> rockets are sooo stone age - let's build a space elevator!
[00:19:01] <nyditch> In space there is no tomorrow without a frame of reference with which to judge the start of a new day. So astronauts are the most capable of living like there's no tomorrow.
[00:19:23] <LetsEatHay> haha true
[00:19:59] <nyditch> I'd like to see a hybrid ramjet/mixed rocket fuel engine.
[00:20:15] <ponyshouldhibernate> Well, those astronauts in the ISS have a very strange year with lots of extra days.
[00:20:29] <nyditch> We have a strange year as well.
[00:20:46] <ponyshouldhibernate> Oh, is it 2012 again?
[00:20:56] <LetsEatHay> anyone know how many sunrise/sunsets they actually see in a year?

[00:23:53] <ponyshouldhibernate> nyditch: depends on where you look from
[00:24:09] <nyditch> Good answers. Without a view point, it's both.
[00:24:24] <nyditch> or none
[00:24:44] <ponyshouldhibernate> nyditch: but its rotation has the same orientation as the rotation around the sun
[00:25:22] <nyditch> as is wit hthe moon's rotation, as is with the moon's orbit around the earth. One heck of a spyrograph. ^_^
[00:25:41] <ponyshouldhibernate> It's that way with most objects in the solar sstem
[00:26:16] <LetsEatHay> except uranus
[00:26:32] <LetsEatHay> bummer of a name for that one
[00:27:01] <LetsEatHay> doesn't it rotate sideways or something?

[20:41:33] <SpectraMusic> Sombra: Lots of different writers for the show as well, I don't think they had the co-ordination at the time for that kind of thing
[20:41:39] <Lycan> Basically, in 1945, Nazis fled to the moon, developed technology and came back to earth to invade in present time
[20:41:56] <Lycan> It's so bad, that it's good
[20:42:02] <Lycan> kinda like sharknado
[20:42:12] <Sombra> But the writers who did the finale also did many of the previous episodes.
[20:42:17] <Sombra> So it's not like they weren't aware of it.
