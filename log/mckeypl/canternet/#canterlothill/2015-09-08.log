[14:22:36] * Trildar is totally tame
[14:23:17] <Trildar> Dumb dweller, unequiping the +3 luck outfit for the +4 agility and +1 luck one
[14:28:54] <RandomNinja> That's bad even in real Fallout where agility isn't entirely useless outside
[14:29:19] <RandomNinja> Mostly because delicious luck based critical hit chance
[14:31:41] * RandomNinja slaps Trildar with hilariously broken stacked crit bonuses
[14:32:12] <Trildar> Also, I can only guess that it's because this guy has like no endurance, but he's taking far more rad damage then anyone else I've sent out.
[14:32:23] * Trildar gains 99.99% crit chance
[14:32:44] * Trildar somehow fails to get crits for 10 hits in a row
[14:32:48] <RandomNinja> Yeah pretty sure endurance is basically resistance
[14:33:09] <RandomNinja> You can actually get 100% crit chance tho
[14:33:36] <Trildar> lel
[14:33:56] <RandomNinja> I think you can get 37% base+armor or so with a dedicated melee/unarmed build
[14:34:19] <RandomNinja> Then there's a fist weapon with x3 crit chance and bonus critical damage
[14:34:32] <RandomNinja> Also, good reach
[14:34:43] <RandomNinja> You can probably guess the result
[14:36:08] <Trildar> Falcon Punching the wasteland into submission. That sounds utterly ridiculous.
[14:36:24] <RandomNinja> It is
[14:37:29] <RandomNinja> You can also go melee with less crit chance(~50%) but utterly ridiculous critical damage (>400%)
[14:39:26] <RandomNinja> Also with Project Nevada you can charge and tackle enemies down cliffsides and whatnot, which is clearly the best way of combat
[14:40:09] <RandomNinja> Synergizes well with close range combat as well
