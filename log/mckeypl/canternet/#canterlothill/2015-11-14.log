[04:17:33] <Zuthal> how so, RandomNinja?
[04:18:03] <RandomNinja> Zuthal: so as you probably imagine, non-irradiated water is valuable in Fallout
[04:18:17] <Zuthal> eeyup
[04:19:14] <RandomNinja> you can build water purifiers in your settlements that produce a certain amount daily. Any amount not used up by settlers is automatically put into storage in bottles, which you can sell
[04:19:24] <RandomNinja> you can probably see where this is going
[04:19:53] <Zuthal> Sell bottled purified water for huge profit, invest profit into more water purifiers, make more profit, repeat ad infinitum?
[04:20:00] <RandomNinja> basically
[04:20:28] <Zuthal> Adam Smith would be proud
[04:20:35] <RandomNinja> you need materials to build purifiers though, which can be hard to reliably get
[04:20:41] <Cloud_Zephyr> omg gais i found the new doge
[04:20:48] <Zuthal> ahhh
[04:20:50] <RandomNinja> that and water weight are the main issues

[04:30:13] <RandomNinja> why does it look like that?
[04:30:29] <Zuthal> All the pipes are for stuff like coolant and such
[04:30:35] <Zuthal> and you also need a lot of power for the magnets
[04:30:42] <RandomNinja> the assymmetry though
[04:31:29] <Zuthal> It does have symmetry, 5x rotational symmetry :P
[04:31:38] <RandomNinja> <.<
[04:31:49] <Zuthal> And it is to make the field twisty so that every fieldline has the same length
[04:31:57] <Zuthal> which you don't get in a standard torus

[05:40:09] <RandomNinja> they cost 3500 to build though, so it's basically a rich-get richer scenario
[05:40:18] <Regulus> Oh, but I did get a good lead pipe. Damage increases with each successive attack on a target
[05:40:41] <RandomNinja> that would be great if my other weapon didn't do 3x the damage to start with :P
[05:40:47] <Regulus> lol
[05:41:06] <RandomNinja> I can imagine it working on some niche scenario like say Mirelurk Queen
[05:41:17] <RandomNinja> Hamtramck it's pretty great, you should get it :P
[05:41:23] <Regulus> High AP melee build
[05:41:34] <Regulus> Just swing away
[05:41:35] <RandomNinja> melee is wonderful
[05:41:54] <RandomNinja> you know that perk Blitz, that lets you "close in on an enemy"
[05:42:04] <Regulus> I prefer my snipers and combat rifles
[05:42:06] <RandomNinja> you actually basically teleport next to them and slash
[05:42:39] <RandomNinja> you can do this through windows and gaps and other obstacles
[05:43:13] <Regulus> I only have a few things left to upgrade 
[05:43:19] <RandomNinja> my favourite one was when I went back and forth between 2 super mutants on 2 different building levels
[05:43:27] <Regulus> lol
[05:43:57] <RandomNinja> also melee/unarmed has executions like skyrm
[05:45:12] <RandomNinja> my favorite is probably the one where you judo throw a dude and then snap his neck
[05:46:12] <Nintendo4DS> melee was the best smash game
[05:46:18] <Nintendo4DS> best official one anyway

[05:52:31] <Regulus> Just that one Deathclaw while I was on a roof without power armor
[05:53:49] <RandomNinja> I killed 2 deathclaws in melee combat at level 13
[05:53:55] <RandomNinja> up your game
[05:54:06] <Regulus> lol
[05:54:48] <Regulus> I spent some time sniping it with a rifle... took it a bit to go down
[05:55:47] <RandomNinja> Sentry Bots are way scarier than Deathclaws imo
[05:56:03] <Regulus> While not in power armor, I'm not gonna confront one in anything other than high damage laser rifle mode
[05:56:11] <Regulus> I need more fiber optics

[05:57:20] <RandomNinja> do the Armory quest for the Minutemen at the fort
[05:57:40] <Snapai> what is a deathclaw?
[05:57:48] <Regulus> What I really need is some better power armor
[05:57:53] <Snapai> Is it like a bearclaw?
[05:57:55] <Snapai> Can I eat it?
[05:58:05] <Regulus> The T-45 stuff isn't cutting it
[05:58:33] <RandomNinja> Snapai when killed they drop Deathclaw Meat which can be cooked and eaten, so yes
[05:58:43] <Snap_Shot> hmm

[05:59:27] <RandomNinja> this is the new one
[05:59:28] <Snapai> I never really got into it
[05:59:29] <Snapai> oh
[05:59:36] <Regulus> Fallout 4 
[05:59:39] <RandomNinja> though the original games are also great
[05:59:43] <Snapai> They sell that at work
[05:59:49] <Snapai> xbones with it bundled
[06:00:08] <RandomNinja> Regulus you should find some T-60 fairly early into the Brotherhood quests
[06:00:08] <Regulus> RandomNinja, I saw someone kill the first Deathclaw with a pool cue
[06:00:14] <Regulus> I laughed
[06:00:33] <Regulus> I'm sort of working on those quests
[06:00:42] <RandomNinja> I tried doing that, unfortunately it out-DPS'd me and killed my armor too quickly
[06:00:59] <RandomNinja> Snapai you should get the PC version
[06:01:04] <RandomNinja> because mods
[06:01:11] <Snapai> Mauds?
[06:01:13] <Snapai> Mauds rock.
[06:01:16] <Snapai> Like a rock.
[06:01:31] <Regulus> On the plus side, I've only got 1 pipe weapon now RandomNinja 
[06:01:34] <Snapai> They won't put up with your schist.

[06:02:46] <Regulus> A fully upgraded automatic pipe pistol does as much damage as a fully upgraded smg, but with a faster fire rate

[06:05:58] <RandomNinja> supposedly it happens when your food+water is higher than your defense
[06:06:17] <RandomNinja> which is weird since my Sanctuary has like 250 water and 15 defense
