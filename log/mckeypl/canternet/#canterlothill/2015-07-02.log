[04:47:00] <One-Trick> she didnt used to
[04:47:04] <Eywind> Twitter is a scary, scary place for a niche-famous girl

[04:47:45] <Sombra> Eywind
[04:47:49] <Sombra> This is how I become horse famous.
[04:48:10] <Eywind> tweet at famous people and they favorite you?
[04:48:19] <Eywind> pretty sure that doesn't make you horse famous
[04:48:26] <wobniaR> So fame much favorite very popular wow
[04:49:04] <Eywind> You become horse famous by doing high-visibility, well-received things in the fandom
[04:49:18] <One-Trick> like drawing questionable content
[04:49:43] <Eywind> Well as long as you make a secondary name to distance yourself from your questionable art even though everyone still knows it's you
[04:49:45] <Sombra> My words are my paintbrush.
[04:49:52] <Eywind> So you're going to write a Past Sins-tier fanfic?
[04:50:01] <Eywind> You might be a couple years late for that
[04:50:15] <One-Trick> i just tell people im djing topless and i get 300 followers
[04:50:24] <Eywind> link pls
[04:50:27] <Sombra> No
[04:50:28] <MikeM> lol
[04:50:40] <Sombra> I mean words, not letters, sounds coming out of my mouth.
[04:50:43] <Eywind> you should periscope yourself DJing like Cloud_Zephyr
[04:50:50] <Eywind> So you're going to start into music
[04:50:52] <One-Trick> what does that mean
[04:51:09] <Eywind> it's like a bad livestream but random people can watch it
[04:51:13] <Sombra> I mean, talking.
[04:51:14] <One-Trick> oh huh
[04:51:25] <Eywind> Sombra so.. you're going to do podcasts?
[04:51:35] <MikeM> fanfic readings?
[04:51:46] <Eywind> Fanfic readings do not get you horse famous
[04:51:55] <Nintendo4DS> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dnmjf0d4c4
[04:52:01] <Sombra> It depends on how you do them I guess.
[04:52:08] <Eywind> No
[04:52:08] <Sombra> A radio show, perhaps.
[04:52:29] <Eywind> It really doesn't depend on how you do them.  Fanfics already seem to be on a downswing
[04:52:44] <Sombra> Then someone needs to do them differently.
[04:52:52] <Eywind> There's just not a big market for fanfic reading
[04:53:05] <Sombra> Probably because they're all the same and boring
[04:53:21] <Eywind> If you do a podcast or review videos or interview show you could at least get a show on a brony network
[04:53:37] <Sombra> .Maybe I should figure out how to do ytp's
[04:53:42] <Eywind> I'm not going to say that I think Lucky or Norman or anyone are 'horse famous' but Lucky's certainly talked to a lot of people
[04:54:13] <Eywind> and the MBS group had Larson on a couple weeks before 100 to talk about the episode and everything else
[04:55:18] <Eywind> Honestly it'd be incredibly difficult to become 'horse famous' right now, because of how spread out the fandom is
[04:56:02] <MikeM> It's interesting how many different circles there are.
[04:56:07] <Eywind> It's significantly harder if your goal is to solely become "horse famous" lol
[04:56:11] <Eywind> Well there's just so much stuff out there
[04:56:26] <MikeM> Yup.
[04:56:35] <Eywind> The show isn't new, so there's not the rabid vigor of the fans to try and find anything pony-related
[04:56:53] <Eywind> and there's just soooo much music or stories or videos or whatever that if you really like something, you don't necessarily have to delve into other stuff to still get your fix
[04:57:17] <Eywind> I used to read like 4 hours of fanfics a day before I joined Everfree.  Now I can go a week or two and not even touch one and still be okay with pony
[04:59:24] <Eywind> I'm disappointed the total read word count got removed from fimfiction though
[04:59:46] <wobniaR> I used to spend hours on youtube, derpibooru, deviantart and social media for pone, I still do
[05:00:09] <Eywind> I just wonder how many millions of words I've read

[05:44:59] <PinkieShy> One-trick is it kinda hard? I wantting to do it in like a year from now

[05:51:25] <Hamtramck> Minecraft'll run fine on any laptop made in the last four years.
[05:51:31] <Hamtramck> I mean like normal laptops.
[05:51:31] <PinkieShy> Minecraft does play but lags like crazy
[05:51:43] <Hamtramck> Not laptops from Bosnian Mikes Warehouse.
[05:52:09] <Hamtramck> Like Minecraft works fine on a Pentium 4 with an ATI Radeon x600 iirc.
[05:52:12] <PinkieShy> this laptop is a gateway ne56r41u it has Intel pentium b960, Intel hd graphics which intel told me is 2nd gen intel graphics, and 4b ddr3 mem.
[05:52:19] <Hamtramck> Wait what
[05:52:31] <Hamtramck> Pinkie my laptop has a B960. It runs Minecraft fine.
[05:52:43] <Hamtramck> Unless minecraft's changed substantially recently.
[05:52:48] <PinkieShy> Hamtramck why does it lag for me then
[05:53:02] <PinkieShy> Could it have been my internet connection?
[05:53:08] *** Quits: wobniaR (wobniaR@Monoshy.Hydra.Fighter.64) (Quit: HOOOOOOOOOOONK)
[05:53:11] <Hamtramck> Lag can mean a lot of thing
[05:53:16] <Hamtramck> I mean
[05:53:21] <Sombra> Minecraft runs like a dream for me, so do most other games, I can even play farcry4 on high settings at 30fps.  But try to play ark on medium-low settings? Forget it... 12fps
[05:53:28] <Hamtramck> Lag actually means latency between some input and some output.
[05:53:34] <Hamtramck> A low framerate is not lag.
[05:54:03] <Sombra> I know that.
[05:54:20] <Hamtramck> That was @Pinkie
[05:54:28] *** Away|Vigilant_Watch is now known as Vigilant_Watch
[05:54:41] <PinkieShy> I know that too.
[05:54:56] <Hamtramck> So are you getting lag or a low framerate :S
[05:55:00] <One-Trick> ok, time to fix dinky before this ambien knocks me out
[05:55:05] <Vigilant_Watch> Hamtramck: Depends. TECHNICALLY, there could be lag within the system. CPU/North Bridge bottlenecks.
[05:55:16] <Vigilant_Watch> Usually refered to as 'Latency' though.
[05:55:29] <PinkieShy> I don't know.. last time i tried Minecraft was back in december.. so its been a while since i last tried
[05:55:38] <One-Trick> i play minecraft on a model b raspberry pi on my tv
[05:55:42] <Vigilant_Watch> Or, more accurately, just latency.
[05:55:45] <Vigilant_Watch> One-Trick: You too, huh?
[05:55:51] <Hamtramck> Vigilant: I have no idea what that is!
[05:55:54] <One-Trick> love that
[05:56:04] <Hamtramck> pinkie I'm installing minecraft
[05:56:05] <Sombra> One-Trick yeah but only peasant minecraft version
[05:56:06] <PinkieShy> My internet connection back then was 1mbps DSL
[05:56:09] <Vigilant_Watch> I sometimes use an xbox or ps3 controller for it.
[05:56:14] <Hamtramck> If yr. FPS was low your settings could've just been inappropriate for your system
[05:56:15] <PinkieShy> Its now 10mbps Cable
[05:56:21] <Vigilant_Watch> Sombra: I play FTB Classic on my RPi.
[05:56:23] <Beetdabrat> Hi all :D
[05:56:44] <Vigilant_Watch> Heck, at one point I hosted Minecraft servers on an RPi.
[05:56:49] <One-Trick> eh? i played the same minecraft my laptop has
[05:57:05] <Sombra> Well, I guess you can graphics whatever you want on those
[05:57:28] <Sombra> What os?
[05:57:39] <Vigilant_Watch> A few, mostly Raspbian
[05:57:56] <Vigilant_Watch> Heck, I'm connected via a Raspbian-Hosted ZNC Bouncer right now.
[05:57:59] <Sombra> CPU?
[05:58:37] <Hamtramck> pinkie: fwiw, if you stick another 4 gigs of ram in that, you'll get some improvement in performance with the integrated graphics. This wouldn't really matter for minecraft though
[05:59:19] <Beetdabrat> I need to upgrade mine again
