[12:01:25] <Umer> Anyone around?
[12:02:23] * Umer looks around
[12:04:15] <Unixkitty> Unless you have a question, the answer would be no
[12:04:23] <Umer> I have a question
[12:04:30] <Umer> My friend wants to register a nick
[12:04:41] <Umer> And hotmail does not accept your mails
[12:04:54] <Umer> Can I register that nick for my friend on my email
[12:05:04] <Umer> The same email on which my nick is registered?
[12:05:16] <Unixkitty> I'm fairly certain you can only use one email per registration
[12:05:22] <Unixkitty> And vice versa
[12:05:49] <Umer> So I have to ask her to make a new email account?
[12:06:48] <Unixkitty> Well you could have simply tried registering and seeing what would happen, and then if that didn't work, yes
[12:07:09] <Umer> Would it freeze my nick?
[12:07:17] <Umer> If I register her nick on the same email?
[12:08:05] <Fluttershi> don't think so, if anything the attempt should just be denied if ya can't
[12:08:09] <Unixkitty> ^
[12:08:17] <Umer> Thanks :)
[12:08:21] <Unixkitty> If it would, that would be horrible logic
[12:08:41] <Umer> :|
