[01:05:58] <Colgate> look in your other windows
[01:06:22] <joblessidoit> no other windows
[01:06:31] <Colgate> should have a server status window
[01:06:54] <joblessidoit> there is #ChatRoom and #help
[01:07:08] <Colgate> then your client is awful and I recommend using a different one
[01:08:00] <joblessidoit> using chattingcorner
[01:08:15] <Colgate> I don't know what that is

[03:51:21] <dumbjobless> Hello
[03:51:44] <dumbjobless> Where can I find a list of channels? /list is not working
[03:52:16] <Dusk> check the server tab
[03:52:22] <Dusk> if you've typed /list
[03:52:33] <dumbjobless> No server tab
[03:55:39] <dumbjobless> only tabs are chatroom and help
[03:55:59] <Fluttershi> where does the wall of extra stuff that isn't chat go to?
[03:56:12] <Dusk> ^
[03:56:17] <Dusk> You're using mibbit
[03:56:23] <Dusk> so you should have a tab that says Canternet
[03:56:25] <Dusk> :/
[03:56:34] <dumbjobless> there is not
[03:56:45] <Fluttershi> check the chatroom tab
[03:57:07] <dumbjobless> there is no list there
[03:57:17] <Fluttershi> i see that you don't seem to be in a channel called "chatroom" so...
[03:57:36] <dumbjobless> ChatRoom
[03:58:27] <Fluttershi> it isn't case sensitive, chatroom is ChatRoom is CHATROOM is...
[03:58:51] <dumbjobless> that is the room it says ChatRoom

[08:27:17] <Lunar_w0lf> Hello, I was wondering if anyone could tell me more about Canternet.
[08:27:45] <Colgate> what about it?
[08:28:36] <Lunar_w0lf> I dont realy know what this thing is, nor what it is used for. I't appears to be some sort of chat service for bronies, Am I correct?
[08:28:47] <Colgate> it is an irc network for mlp, yes
[08:29:13] <Googie> Canternet is an IRC network, a lot of different channels for fans of MLP. You can type /list to get a list of them.
[08:30:02] <Lunar_w0lf> Thanks for the info, Colgate, and thanks to you aswell, googie.
[08:31:38] <Googie> As examples, we host the channels/chatrooms for BronyTV, EquestriaDaily, Canterlot hill... really too many channels to mention all of them, as well as just smaller channels that aren't related to any big community sites.
[08:33:08] <Lunar_w0lf> Do you recomend any chatrooms that I could join? I'm sorta just looking for a way to pass the time.
