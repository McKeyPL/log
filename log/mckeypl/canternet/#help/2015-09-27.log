[08:49:36] <thegoodhen> hello guys! :3
[08:49:42] <thegoodhen> anypony here?
[08:49:42] <Twili> Somepony said it was Yes, I am! But I'm just a bot. It might have been Pinkie though.
[08:50:35] <Dusk> thegoodhen:
[08:50:38] <Dusk> yes
[08:50:49] <thegoodhen> ooh, Hi, Dusk :3 I was just wondering
[08:50:55] <thegoodhen> got banned from 2 channels yesterday
[08:50:58] <thegoodhen> with no reason given
[08:51:14] <Colgate> channels can ban for any or no reason at all, you will have to talk to the person who banned you
[08:51:16] <Dusk> Oh that's up to the channel moderation
[08:51:40] <thegoodhen> Okay, thanks
[08:51:54] <thegoodhen> I tried to talk to him, he banned me from another channel, I sent him a pm, he put me on ignore
[08:52:03] <thegoodhen> I'll just get a proxy then :3 thanks!
[08:52:36] <Googie> If you do that you'll get banned from the network entirely.
[08:52:50] <thegoodhen> ok
[08:53:09] <thegoodhen> Googie:what other steps do you suggest then?
[08:53:26] <Colgate> admit that you are banned from that channel and move on?
[08:53:49] <thegoodhen> I usually spend about 30 mins there active per week
[08:54:06] <thegoodhen> I don't really need the channel. But the guy tried to push me, to get in my face
[08:54:11] <thegoodhen> to touch my freedom, you know
[08:54:15] <thegoodhen> I can't let people do that
[08:54:37] <Colgate> too bad? deal with it
[08:55:01] <Colgate> attempting to ban evade will just earn you bans network wide
[08:55:37] <thegoodhen> Colgate:thanks for the tip.
[08:55:51] <thegoodhen> But I am sure you wouldn't like it if people disrespected you either?
[08:56:14] <Colgate> I repeat: they banned you, too bad, move on
[08:56:45] *** Quits: Match (Match@Match.Stick) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:56:46] <thegoodhen> Colgate: I understand you cannot help me then.
[08:56:57] <Colgate> network staff will not remove a channel ban
[08:57:18] <thegoodhen> I had no idea, I was sent here by a friend who said you might be able to help me.
[08:57:33] <Colgate> they were wrong, we do not do that
[08:57:44] <thegoodhen> yes, I see that now
[08:58:01] <thegoodhen> well... unfortunately moving on is not an option :/
[08:58:03] <thegoodhen> but thanks! :3
[08:58:06] <thegoodhen> bye
