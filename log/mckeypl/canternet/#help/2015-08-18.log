[16:21:55] <tdk> Hi 
[16:22:22] <tdk> Is there any way .. If some sop add aop in my room i get notify?
[16:23:20] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[16:23:50] <Googie> Yes, the channel's VERBOSE setting can be used to automatically message all ops in a channel when someone is added to any of the lists.
[16:24:23] <tdk> i know about verbose .. but i want like memo me cause not all time i am here 
[16:24:29] <Googie> That being said, if you don't trust someone not to add users behind your back, it's probably best to not give them SOP (or to remove their ability to modify the access list)
[16:24:32] <Googie> No.
[16:24:56] <tdk> whats the flags sop not add anyone?
[16:25:04] <tdk> what flag i minus them
[16:25:46] <Googie> /cs help flags
