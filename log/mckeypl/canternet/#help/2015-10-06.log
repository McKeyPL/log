[05:18:53] <SniperDash> I can't get my nickname registered
[05:19:03] <SniperDash> I ran the verification thingy
[05:19:33] <SniperDash> but it wants me to sign in and when I try to change my nickname it won't work
[05:19:55] <Fluttershi> what happens when you try?
[05:20:04] <SniperDash> it tells me to log in
[05:20:11] <SniperDash> -NickServ- Please log in before attempting to verify your registration.
[05:20:30] <Fluttershi> hm...
[05:20:31] <Colgate> /nickserv ID username password
[05:20:35] <SniperDash> I'm trying to verify the nickname "HyperDash"
[05:20:58] <SniperDash> oooo
[05:21:04] <Colgate> then run it
[05:21:10] <Colgate> /nickserv ID is how you log in
[05:21:12] *** Fluttershi is now known as afkshi
[05:21:28] <SniperDash> ok
[05:21:48] <SniperDash> it's not letting me change my nickname still
[05:21:57] <SniperDash> to "HyperDash"
[05:22:10] <afkshi> saying it's reserved or something?
[05:22:13] <Colgate> /nickserv release hyperdash
[05:22:20] <SniperDash> no it isn't saying anything
[05:22:24] <Colgate> it locks it if you fail to log in in time
[05:22:28] *** SniperDash is now known as TestTest
[05:22:47] *** TestTest is now known as SniperDash
[05:22:50] <SniperDash> ok

[05:23:26] <Colgate> undo what?
[05:23:29] <afkshi> release whosit that was just meantioned
[05:25:22] <SniperDash> how can I sign in again?
[05:25:34] <SniperDash> . /msg something, right
[05:25:36] <SniperDash> ?
[05:25:54] <Colgate> /nickserv ID username pass
[05:26:00] <Colgate> release doesn't log you out
[05:26:08] <Colgate> it just removes the lock so you can /nick to it
[05:26:38] <SniperDash> I'm signed in as HyperDash, but I can't nick to it
