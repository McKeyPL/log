[01:49:29] <Devin> I need help
[01:50:00] <Devin> I was banned from a channel just because I'm American and use comcast as an ISP
[01:50:10] <Devin> the Channel is #parasprite
[01:50:29] <Sour_Sweet> Channel bans are subject to channel OPs. Nobody here can help you with that
[01:50:33] <Gigabit> Private channel bans, need to be talked about with the channel owner
[01:52:14] <Devin> They are rasict
[01:52:44] <Sour_Sweet> Than don't join their channel
[01:52:50] <Devin> racist*
[01:52:59] <Sour_Sweet> Then* :P

[01:55:43] <Devin> Dusk
[01:55:48] <Devin> Can u unban me?
[01:56:03] <Dusk> I could but then they'd ban you again and remove my channel access.
[01:56:10] <Devin> nvm then

[01:56:58] <Fluttershi> that sounds silly, was there a more legit reason?
[01:58:05] <Sour_Sweet> I've never been in #parasprite, but the channel name doesn't sound like they'd need much more of a reason
[01:58:27] <Dusk> He's lying about the reason 
[01:58:33] <Dusk> but that's not a topic for this channel.
