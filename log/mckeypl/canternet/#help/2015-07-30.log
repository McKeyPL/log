[02:23:11] <RainbowHacks> If I wanted to donate infrastructure to your network, who would I talk to? :3
[02:23:28] * RainbowHacks figures you guys could use a box in the asia-pacific region
[02:24:32] <Acacia> They have a lot of servers as is >.>
[02:24:36] <Princess_Starlight> Probably everyone in #Techponies.
[02:24:49] <Acacia> Why would they ask techponies?
[02:24:56] <Acacia> techponies doesn't own the network >.>
[02:24:59] <RainbowHacks> I only saw 4 or 5. I'm basically trying to help out projects how I can to make up for how much of a cunt I used to be to bronies >.>
[02:25:17] <Acacia> They definitely have more than 4 :p
[02:25:31] <Acacia> There are 6 in fact
[02:25:39] <Acacia> not counting services
[02:25:46] <Princess_Starlight> Acacia why would they ask? And I figured they would go into tech ponies to talk, not ask.
[02:25:50] * Princess_Starlight shrugs.
[02:25:58] <RainbowHacks> then my work here is done. x3 (or rather, unneeded)
[02:26:08] * Acacia patpats RainbowHacks
[02:26:18] <Acacia> I was just making a valid point is all, you're still free to ask
[02:26:30] <RainbowHacks> I'm assuming #Techponies is a channel for those with a tech bent? (and is that T or t? .w. )
[02:26:45] * RainbowHacks just stumbled across this network, hasn't really done any exploring yet
[02:26:45] <Acacia> techponies is a channel for tech talk
[02:26:56] <Acacia> questions/discussions and stuff
[02:27:13] <Acacia> Plenty of people there to field questions on pretty much anything with
[02:27:32] <RainbowHacks> Sounds like my kinda place. Thanks for the heads up. Is it T or t though? I noticed #Help is capitalized, not sure if the daemon being run on this net differentiates between the two
[02:28:30] <Princess_Starlight> It's not case sensative RainbowHacks 
[02:28:45] <Acacia> ^
[02:28:52] <Acacia> it will correct for it automatically
[02:28:55] <Princess_Starlight> #Techponies #techponies and #tECHPONIES are all the same.
[02:29:05] <Acacia> yep
[02:29:11] <RainbowHacks> Thanks, Princess_Starlight :3
[02:29:16] <Princess_Starlight> :3
[02:29:31] <RainbowHacks> I'm so used to having to mind case >.>
[02:29:57] <Acacia> Inspired doesn't care :p
[02:30:00] <Princess_Starlight> Oh sheesh, if canternet WAS case sensative I would have 5 times as many files in my logs right now.
[02:30:41] <Princess_Starlight> Not to mention command errors and what have you.

[02:31:35] <Colgate> ha, my #help is all lowercase!
[02:31:49] <Acacia> hehe
[02:31:54] <AppleDash> So is mine!
[02:31:55] <Colgate> guess it is capitalized in the chanserv registration
[02:33:20] <Princess_Starlight> I think this channel is just in Lower case but at one point I think #Help was the channel name.
[02:33:33] * Princess_Starlight can check their logs.

[03:18:48] <CompuDesktop> hey my bot is getting messages from channel mode H even tho she has user mode B set
[03:19:14] <Colgate> botname?
[03:19:29] <Colgate> also, is it setting the mode before joining the channel?
[03:21:15] <CompuDesktop> Colgate: CompuBot
[03:21:17] <CompuDesktop> and yes
[03:21:21] <CompuDesktop> she always has
[03:21:34] <CompuDesktop> only just today did she start getting messages from H
[03:21:43] <Colgate> nothing has changed server side
[03:22:00] <CompuDesktop> well i never changed how she joins channels and stuff
[03:22:07] <CompuDesktop> always been the same
[03:22:13] <Colgate> are you sure it is setting the mode before joining?
[03:22:19] <Colgate> check raw logs
[03:23:27] <CompuDesktop> 1 sec
[03:23:51] <Colgate> just tested it on a connection on cadance, it is working correctly for me
[03:30:00] <Princess_Starlight> Sometimes when I connect it does the modes correctly but when I add more connection commands or lag the commands are not sent in the correct order. I'm guessing that's a hexchat issue but maaaaybe it's canternet slowing down the commands.
[03:30:54] <Colgate> the server would process them in the order received
