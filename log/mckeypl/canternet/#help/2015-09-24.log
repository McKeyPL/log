[03:34:54] <iamalion> stupid question. what was the damn command to invite myself to my own invite only channel again? I keep forgetting it
[03:35:03] <Colgate> /chanserv invite #channel
[03:35:30] <Colgate> you can also set a +I on yourself if you are an op there, which makes it so you don't have to be invited to join
[03:35:32] <iamalion> .... oh my god
[03:35:39] <iamalion> yeah def setting +I, i forgot last time 
[03:35:55] <iamalion> im so used to other services where i need to specify the nick with the invite command
[03:35:56] <iamalion> -__-
[03:36:07] <Colgate> with our services, you can only invite yourself
[03:45:43] <iamalion> yeah
[03:46:05] <iamalion> im just used to other services where I can invite myself but still need to specify the nick. set +I finally. thanks <3

[18:12:06] <Shan> some one is spamming in everyone pm
[18:12:15] <Shan> they are flooding in private msgs
[18:12:22] <Shan> what to do ?
[18:13:19] <Unixkitty> Who would that be? Also for your own PM you could always use /ignore
[18:14:16] <Shan> its a massive spam

[18:18:30] <Unixkitty> Shan, could you at least give their current nickname or hostmask?
[18:18:32] <Shan> all the users in #gupshupcorner
[18:18:40] <Shan> you can see there are only few users left
[18:18:44] <Colgate> I need a name and what they are spamming
[18:18:45] <Shan> and they just disconnected
[18:18:52] <Shan> if you send allot of msgs at the same time in mibbit
[18:18:55] <Shan> in private msgs
[18:18:58] <Shan> it gets disconnected
[18:19:39] <Colgate> /mode yournick +c
[18:19:41] <Colgate> would stop that
