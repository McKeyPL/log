[19:02:23] <JiyaKhan> any admin here ?
[19:02:44] <Sour_Sweet> Channels bans are subject to channel ops
[19:02:55] <Colgate> channels can ban for any or no reason at all
[19:04:19] <Sour_Sweet> No IRCop can help you with that ;-) Try to contact a channel op. /msg ChanServ info #channelname can give you the name of the channel founder if you don't know any op
[19:04:45] <Sakura> Though I kind of see why. *cough*unsolicited PMs*cough*
[19:04:58] <Sour_Sweet> Got one as well :D
[19:05:25] <Colgate> JiyaKhan: right, I have 4 reports of you PMing people randomly about this, stop that
[19:05:44] <Shutter> 5. I got one, too.
[19:05:52] <RubyPinch> add another
[19:06:02] <Colgate> Shutter: I wasn't including ircops in the list :P
[19:06:09] * Sour_Sweet is not going to answer, because this is not my business. He does only provide help through this channel
[19:06:30] <Shutter> Colgate: But that's discrimination =p

[19:07:00] <Colgate> there :3
[19:07:06] <Shutter> Seriously though, don't go around PM-ing random users, JiyaKhan. Unless you want a proper vacation at least.
[19:07:07] * JiyaKhan slaps Colgate around a bit with a large trout
