[20:54:58] <Starflare> How do I set channel flags?
[20:55:12] <Colgate> what do you mean by flages?
[20:55:15] <Colgate> flags*
[20:55:37] <Starflare> Sorry, modes
[20:56:09] <Colgate> /mode #channel +-whatever
[20:56:21] <Starflare> ok thanks
[20:56:49] <Colgate> most clients let you omit the #channel if you are looking at it
[21:19:09] <Starflare> How do I have my ops do logging?
[21:19:23] <Colgate> what?
[21:19:24] <Twili> I read in a book once that said what can Full-ops and Net-ops do?
[21:20:07] <Eventide> Silly Twili
[21:20:21] <Dusk> Starflare: What?
[21:20:51] <Starflare> I don't entirely know....... I was reading about IRC and it said that was a good idea.
[21:21:07] <Colgate> I don't understand your question
[21:21:32] <Dusk> Link us to where you're seeing thast
[21:21:34] <Dusk> that*
[21:21:44] <Dusk> and maybe we'll be able to provide better assistance
[21:22:06] <Eventide> I think it's recomending his ops log the channel
[21:22:12] <Dusk> Oh
[21:22:16] <Colgate> that's a client thing
[21:22:25] <Dusk> Well then whoever is an op of your channel needs to have logging turned on in their client settings
[21:22:39] <Eventide> log /everything/
[21:22:45] <Dusk> Eventide: :|
[21:22:51] <Starflare> Somewhere in 4A-4B I think: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/changuide.html
[21:23:53] <Dusk> Yea that's just you telling the people you op (For moderation purposes) To log the channel
[21:24:31] <Starflare> Can lightIRC do that?
[21:24:41] <Dusk> No you'll need an actual client
[21:25:20] <Eventide> pretty much anything else will do
[21:25:46] <Dusk> No web client (Unless you're using a complex setup, such as my NodeJS client) will log for you
[21:26:11] <Dusk> Or if they do I've never seen it, nor would I recommend it
[21:26:18] <Starflare> Ok then
[21:26:30] <Eventide> irccloud does logs, but nobody in here would recommend that client except me >.>
[21:26:40] <Dusk> I'd suggest you go get hexchat
[21:26:45] <Eventide> and I only use it because I don't have any other options :p
[21:26:55] <Dusk> You don't?
[21:26:57] <Eventide> Hexchat is a good option
[21:27:06] <Eventide> yeah, Dusk, I'm lazy at the moment
[21:27:18] <Dusk> Could be lazy and run weechat on a server :p
[21:27:31] <Eventide> yeah, but to set that up I'd need to unlaze
[21:27:56] <Dusk> Well as you know I've already offered my help in setting up whatever for you ^.^
[21:31:00] <Starflare> Any complaints on Hexchat? Does it slow down anything
[21:32:31] <Eventide> nah I use it for logging and it runs fine in the background
[21:33:10] <Eventide> it's also very easy to use
[21:35:23] <Starflare> I think I need my admin password to get it....
[21:35:36] <Starflare> Which my dad won't give me.
[21:38:09] <Starflare> ok then! Thank you all!

[22:03:15] <Starflare> How do I register a channel again? DX
[22:04:22] <Black> /msg chanserv register #Channel
[22:04:49] <Black> You have to be an operator in the channel and it cannot be registered by anyone else.

[22:24:26] <Starflare> And.... I locked myself out of my private channel.
[22:24:39] <Colgate> /chanserv invite #channel
[22:26:03] <Starflare> oh... Thank you!
[22:26:46] <Colgate> invites allow someone to join invite only channels, passworded channels, and even channels they are banned in
[22:27:45] <Fluttershi> really? huh, neat, didn't know that last bit
[22:28:16] <Colgate> if you get invited to a channel, you can join it with only 1 excepton, and that's if the channel is set as ircop only
[22:28:30] <Colgate> actually, +l might stop it too...
[22:28:40] <Colgate> but almost without exception :P
[22:28:57] <Starflare> Passwords never work for me....
