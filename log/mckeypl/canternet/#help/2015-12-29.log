[21:47:34] <Umer> Anyone around?
[21:49:09] <Unixkitty> There should always be at least someone around, please state your question
[21:50:17] <Umer> I was using "dude" nick
[21:50:23] <Umer> Was not able to register it
[21:50:31] <Umer> Because of that hotmail error
[21:50:44] <Umer> Someone registered it last week
[21:50:52] <Umer> And he does not use it
[21:50:59] <Umer> The nick stays online all the time
[21:51:07] <Umer> Could you please give that nick back?
[21:51:09] <Colgate> no
[21:51:29] <Colgate> unregistered nicks are free for all
[21:51:33] <Unixkitty> Unfortunately, whoever registered the nick holds it until it either expires or they give it away willingly
[21:51:41] <Unixkitty> So you would simply have to negotiate with them
[21:52:12] <Umer> People know me with that nick :(
[21:52:18] <Umer> And the don't come online daily
[21:52:51] <Unixkitty> Sorry, but there is nothing we can do
[21:53:16] <Umer> Ok, thanks for your concern :)
[21:53:43] <Umer> One more thing
[21:54:08] <Umer> Can I use mIRC for this server?
[21:54:20] <Unixkitty> Certainly, I don't see why not?
[21:54:32] <Unixkitty> mIRC is just a client like any other
[21:54:56] <Umer> Would like to ask for server IP and port
[21:55:06] <Unixkitty> https://canternet.org/support
[21:55:26] <Unixkitty> Server IP I would start with irc.canternet.org
[21:55:31] <Finwe> 54.225.226.8
[21:55:43] <Umer> And port?
[21:55:52] <Finwe> Port depends on whether you want to use SSL or not.
[21:56:00] <Unixkitty> 6666-6669, 6697 for SSL
[21:56:15] <Umer> Thanks :)
