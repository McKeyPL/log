[08:08:57] <Maria> helo !!
[08:09:02] <Maria> channel is in flood
[08:09:09] <Maria> #asiafm1o1
[08:09:13] <Maria> ban bots please.
[08:12:22] <Maria> why u guys alwways sleeping :@
[08:12:28] <Maria> he is ruining our channel !!
[08:12:32] <Maria> wake up !!!!!!!!
[08:12:36] <Maria> #asiafm1o1 <<
[08:12:39] <Maria> join and see !!
[08:12:42] <Maria> they are spamming
[08:16:08] <Princess_Pwny> Just banning them would be a good idea
[08:17:22] <Maria> how can i ban them !!!
[08:17:27] <Maria> they are soooo many !!
[08:17:32] <Maria> they are bots !!
[08:17:37] <Maria> just g line them
[08:17:40] <Maria> or z line them
[08:17:51] <Maria> else they will slow your server
[08:17:52] <Princess_Pwny> Most of them were the same two people
[08:18:19] <Princess_Pwny> I'm not related to the people who run the server btw
[08:18:20] <Fluttershi> what's the flag to make join/part/quit messages not show untill they say something?
[08:18:39] <Princess_Pwny> D
[08:18:42] <Princess_Pwny> Well channel mode D
[08:18:51] <Fluttershi> try that
[08:19:00] <Maria> :(
[08:19:06] <Maria> i have put +m
[08:19:13] <Maria> now giving voice
[08:19:16] <Maria> to everyone
[08:19:33] <Maria> but i am worried about your server
[08:19:43] <Maria> they will slow your server by sending lots of bots
[08:19:54] <Princess_Pwny> I doubt the actual server will have an issue from that little traffic
[08:19:56] <Maria> i dont have any issue i will put mode of +m and voice my users
[08:20:10] <Maria> they are my enemies
[08:20:17] <Princess_Pwny> One of the server admins might chime in or something at some point
[08:20:23] <Maria> when i was in previous server they did the same stuff
[08:20:29] <Maria> now i am here still they are doing this
[08:20:33] <Princess_Pwny> But it'd take way more spam than that to hurt the server 
[08:20:42] <Maria> the only solution is just Z line them as colate did last night
[08:20:53] <Maria> then they were in trouble to join
[08:21:07] <Maria> look
[08:21:12] <Maria> again bots joining
[08:21:12] <Maria> :/
[08:21:17] <Maria> plz come #asiafm1o1
[08:21:22] <Maria> huring your server
[08:21:27] <Maria> join and quit join and quit
[08:21:34] <Maria> hurting*
[08:24:24] <Maria> :( ruining my users my channel
[08:25:21] <Maria> now he have started notice !!!
