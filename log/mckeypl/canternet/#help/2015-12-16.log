[19:12:14] <User_6144> So, do I just type that out as is?
[19:12:47] <Colgate> nickname is the nickname you want
[19:12:48] <Unixkitty> Since the line starts with a forward slash, it will be interpreted and sent as a command by your client

[19:13:52] <afkshi> oops
[19:13:52] <nickname> Would you know by chance why I keep getting an 'erroneous nickname' message?
[19:13:58] *** afkshi is now known as Fluttershi
[19:14:11] <Colgate> that nickname may be in use already, or someone may have registered it
[19:14:48] <nickname> Thanks, &Colgate. You're already much more helpful than whoever I was chatting to last night
[19:14:52] <Colgate> or it might have letters that aren'y allowed
[19:14:52] <Fluttershi> you might be trying to put characters in the nick that it no likey

[19:16:44] <NextTuesdayMorning> even better.
[19:17:12] <Unixkitty> That sounds like something a lazy developer would say.
[19:17:26] <NextTuesdayMorning> What does? My nickname?
[19:17:31] <Unixkitty> Yes :P
[19:17:32] *** Joins: Fall (Fall@silently)

[19:18:06] <Fluttershi> 5 hours of summer, once a week one saturday morning!
[19:18:27] <Fluttershi> why'd that pop in my head?
[19:18:38] <NextTuesdayMorning> I couldn't tell you
[19:19:16] <NextTuesdayMorning> So to register this, I type the forward slash, then my nickname, then my email password followed by my email address? I don't want all that floating around on here if I mess it up
[19:19:24] <NextTuesdayMorning> Do I leave spaces between everything?
[19:19:44] <Unixkitty> /msg NickServ register YourPassword Email
[19:19:55] <Unixkitty> Type that exactly, replacing password and email respectively.
[19:20:24] <Unixkitty> Make sure there is no space before the forward slash in line, and preferrably do it in the server tab.
[19:20:44] <NextTuesdayMorning> Thanks everypony! I will be back
[19:21:07] <Colgate> the next important thing to know is how to login XD
[19:21:18] <NextTuesdayMorning> That would be very helpful!
[19:21:35] <NextTuesdayMorning> I feel like I'm six years old, thanks for putting up with me guys!
[19:21:39] <Colgate> if you are on the registered nickname, /msg nickserv ID password, if you are on a different nickname, /msg nickserv ID nickname password
[19:21:56] <Unixkitty> This channel is called #help, is it not?
[19:22:08] <Unixkitty> This is what it's for, NextTuesdayMorning 
[19:22:13] *** Parts: Fall (Fall@silently) ()
[19:23:29] <NextTuesdayMorning> To log in with this nickname, I have to type the forward slash msg Nickserv and then what do you mean by ID? My nickname?
[19:23:43] <Unixkitty> Exactly that, 'ID'
[19:23:47] <Unixkitty> Or 'identify'
[19:24:06] <Colgate> ID is the command name to login, LOGIN and IDENTIFY also work
[19:24:15] <Colgate> I just use ID because it is the shortest :P
[19:25:04] <Unixkitty> Haven't heard of the aliases, I've personally always used 'identify' when I had still the need to do it manually
[19:25:44] <NextTuesdayMorning> okay, thanks. I'm going to pop over to the server tab and register the nickname. I know this is the 'helpchannel' but you've all been very helpful.
[19:25:54] <NextTuesdayMorning> Very surprising for people online

[19:59:53] <NextTuesdayMorning> Thanks colgate, I think I figured it out. I have another question though
[20:01:00] <NextTuesdayMorning> I changed my email password. Is my nickname on here linked ot my email account or would it be specific to the password i used when I was setting this up?
[20:01:22] <NextTuesdayMorning> Will my new password be recognized?
[20:01:25] <Colgate> the password here has nothing to do with your email password
[20:01:34] <Colgate> in fact, don't use the same password here as your email account
[20:02:31] <NextTuesdayMorning> oh, so the password i first used to register will be the password i use to log in everytime?
[20:02:51] <Colgate> unless you change it here, yes
[20:03:02] <NextTuesdayMorning> how do you change it here?
[20:03:38] <NextTuesdayMorning> I think I may have left it floating around on one of the other channels after a failed login attempt
[20:05:30] <Colgate> /nickserv set password newpasswordhere
[20:06:38] <NextTuesdayMorning> So I would type the forward slash, set password and then the new password?
[20:07:01] <Colgate> yes
[20:07:27] <NextTuesdayMorning> do those messages I see show up for everybody?
[20:07:36] <NextTuesdayMorning> can you see what my new password is?
[20:08:32] <Colgate> no
[20:08:44] <NextTuesdayMorning> Okay, thanks a lot
[20:09:20] <NextTuesdayMorning> I'm heading out now, thanks for the help
