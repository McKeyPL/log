[03:58:06] <Apple_Bloom> Is my vhost gonna be accepted? 
[03:59:18] <Fluttershi> when did you request it?
[04:02:00] <Apple_Bloom> Tonight.
[04:02:12] <Apple_Bloom> I've seen network admins around
[04:02:47] <Dusk> Pestering opers isn't the way to get a vhost approved
[04:02:59] <Dusk> unless its been like forever since you requested it >.>
[04:03:20] <Apple_Bloom> Don't they get notified of pending requests? 
[04:04:18] <Colgate> yes, you can wait
[04:06:08] <Apple_Bloom> Still getting hit? 
[04:07:58] <Apple_Bloom> I was told Canternet was being affected too, there isn't much to do as far as mitigation, is there? 
[04:09:00] <Fluttershi> hm? affected by what? somethin goin on?
[04:09:28] <Apple_Bloom> PonyChat servers are being attacked by keksec
[04:09:35] <Dusk> This has nothing to do with Canternet
[04:10:05] <Apple_Bloom> It does if they were targeted as well.
[04:11:13] <Dusk> -_(\
[04:11:23] <Dusk> You missed my point and it flew over your head apparently
[04:17:59] <Fluttershi> ...so you assume there are struggles with some attack going on, and are in a hurry to bug people working with such a thing with your vhost request?
[04:18:48] <Apple_Bloom> Those two things were unrelated.
[04:19:03] <Apple_Bloom> There wouldn't be much they could do anyway
[04:23:01] <Colgate> hasn't been anything out of the ordinary lately, there was some bandwidth increase earlier today, but nothing huge
[04:23:11] <Colgate> earlier today being... 10 hours ago?
[04:23:47] <Apple_Bloom> Ah ok
