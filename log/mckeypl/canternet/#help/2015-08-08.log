[17:21:15] <Starflare> Is there a command to tell if somepony's account is online if they aren't using the registered nick?
[17:26:02] *** Starflare is now known as Starry
[17:26:36] <Googie> You can setup a watch or monitor for a specific nickname, or manually check using whois
[17:26:55] *** Starry is now known as Starflare
[17:26:57] <Googie> If they aren't using that specific nick though, and they aren't in any shared channels, then no.
[17:28:30] *** LightningCrash is now known as Cloud_Kicker
[17:29:10] <Starflare> Okay..... And how do set the vacation command and what exactly does it do? (Precisely.... The name gives away part of it lol)
[17:30:02] <Googie> By default, nickserv accounts expire after 30 days. Vacation mode allows you to extend that to 90, however it is automatically turned off whenever you login, so you cannot leave it on all the time.
[17:30:42] <Starflare> Thanks!
