[02:02:40] <Starflare> How can I register my name??? I can't quite get it right again.
[02:02:52] <Colgate> Twili: register
[02:02:52] <Twili> Somepony said it was "/msg nickserv register password email". It might have been Pinkie though.
[02:04:06] <Starflare> I tried and it said I couldn't use my user as a pass
[02:04:40] <Colgate> so uh, don't use your username as a password?
[02:05:11] <Starflare> But I entered my user AND pass
[02:05:28] <Colgate> your username is the nick you are right now
[02:05:44] <Colgate> you don't include a username in the register command
[02:06:03] <Starflare> ohhhhhh
[02:10:49] <Starflare> Invalid command???
[02:11:04] <Colgate> did you spell register correctly?
[02:14:24] <Starflare> I guess not.
[02:14:27] <Colgate> went through that time
[02:14:41] <Starflare> Yay!!! Thanks guys!

[16:30:21] <Starflare> *Yes

[16:31:17] <Starflare> Oh, you can only have one? I thought that would give me another XD
[16:31:58] <Googie> Just the one, yeah.
[16:34:33] <Starflare> Bot not registered???
[16:34:54] <Googie> You can only choose a bot in the botlist.
[16:35:42] <Starflare> She was in the Botlist....

[16:42:23] <Starflare> How do you give mod powers to someone and what do the symbols mean exactly?
[16:43:08] <Dusk> So you can give people part of the xop list by /cs flags #channel user vop/hop/aop/sop
[16:43:24] <Dusk> there the last bit is the associated xop predefined set of flags
[16:43:43] <Dusk> vop voices someone, where they can talk when the channel is +m (Moderatoed)
[16:44:11] <Starflare> What is xop???
[16:44:12] <Dusk> hop gives a user the ability to kick and allows them to set mode +m (and a few other modes as well as ban users)
[16:44:27] <Dusk> it's the predefined list of flags
[16:44:31] <Shutter> I'll just leave this here: http://www.stack.nl/~jilles/irc/atheme-help/ChanServ.html
[16:44:33] <Starflare> ok
[16:44:33] <Dusk> Sure
[16:44:33] <Twili> Ponies say Sure is bookworm
[16:44:39] <Dusk> Thanks shutter
[16:44:47] <Dusk> it's faster than me and my tired self typing it
[16:45:13] <Starflare> lol
[16:51:24] <Starflare> Can you give me the symbols (&,%,@) and their flag equivalent as well as names (Mod, etc.)

[17:05:15] <Starflare> How do I set a tagline/description?

[17:42:26] <Awaykitty> You do not.
[17:42:44] <Starflare> Oh.....
[17:42:49] <Awaykitty> That is DerpyBot's exclusive coding, because it's not a BotServ services bot like the other ones.
[17:42:55] <Shutter> Services bots don't do that. You'd need your own bot for that, and that falls outside the scope of this channel :)
[17:43:15] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[17:43:24] <Starflare> So @Luna is a service bot.....
[17:43:56] <Shutter> Yes, it is.
[17:44:01] <Awaykitty> Yes. If you do a /whois on it, you will see the like "[Luna] services.canternet.org [Canternet.org Services]".
[17:44:06] <Awaykitty> line*
[17:44:17] <Starflare> Can I tell her to do anything???
[17:45:00] <Awaykitty> Things like !kick, !ban, !quiet, and other fantasy commands should be available to you with a services bot in the channel and if you have such commands enabled
[17:45:54] <Starflare> So where can I go to learn how to get a non-service Bot....or can I not?
[17:46:16] <Awaykitty> You either code one yourself using conventional means, or get someone to code one for you
[17:46:46] <Awaykitty> Or maybe use an existing bot if you find one available to download
[17:47:16] <Starflare> And where do I code it???
[17:48:09] <Awaykitty> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming
[17:51:34] <Starflare> And if I write the script, how do I implement it here.
[17:51:36] <Starflare> ???
[17:51:56] <Awaykitty> I'm afraid you're going to have to find that out on your own
[17:52:19] <Awaykitty> Anything standard for the IRC protocol
[17:52:34] <Starflare> Ok.....One last No-one-probably-knows question.
[17:53:03] <Starflare> Can I have a service Bot AND a non-service Bot???
[17:53:55] <Awaykitty> I'm fairly certain that in your own channel, you could have as many bots as you like, but only as long as they don't put much pressure on the network
[17:54:09] <Googie> You will need to provide your own hosting.
[17:54:20] <Starflare> Hosting.....?
[17:54:31] <Googie> A place to run your bot.
[17:54:34] <Awaykitty> As in run the bots on your own hardware, yes.
[17:54:57] <Starflare> Downloading the Bot to me......
[18:00:42] <Starflare> Gulp
[18:02:16] <Starflare> Is there any way to get around the hosting???
[18:02:24] <Starflare> Probably not.

[18:06:09] <Starflare> How do I bold a topic???
[18:07:39] <Shutter> That's client dependent. Generally I'd recommend not using colours, but no one ever listens to me so yeah, client dependent :P
[18:08:11] <Starflare> I don't want colors, but what is "Client dependent???
[18:08:13] <Starflare> "
[18:08:21] <Shutter> Bold, colours, same same :P
[18:08:27] <Shutter> Depends on your client.
[18:08:49] <Shutter> Ah, you're using lightirc. Not even sure you can with that client.
[18:08:55] <Starflare> Client???
[18:08:55] <Twili> Somepony said it was mIRC.. It might have been Pinkie though.
[18:09:59] <Shutter> IRC is an open protocol with a lot of clients. You happen to be using lightirc through some webpage, but most people prefer clients native to their operating system.
[18:10:23] <Starflare> I have Windows 8......
[18:10:40] <Starflare> How can I change my client?
[18:11:55] <Seoson> Well you have to use a different one :P
[18:12:01] <Starflare> How???
[18:12:01] <Twili> Ponies say How is it going
[18:12:09] <Shutter> One alternative is https://hexchat.github.io/
[18:12:09] <Seoson> I'd suggest reading how IRC works
[18:15:00] <Seoson>  This text for example should be bold for ChatZilla Users.  I used a combination of the character % and B to achieve this. However other clients use hotkeys or other escape characters.
[18:16:10] <Seoson> Some clients don't display colors at all and channels can deactivate the ability to user colors or formatting.
[18:16:56] * Seoson notices the channel flags. ^^
[18:18:02] <Starflare> My text is purple for me.....
