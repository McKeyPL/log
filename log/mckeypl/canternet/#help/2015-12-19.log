[03:57:07] <Santa-Claws> is chanserv down right meow?
[03:57:50] <Santa-Claws> ...nevermind mirc decided chanserv text should just output to one of the many channels im in instead of the console window
[03:57:52] <Santa-Claws> -________________-
[04:02:14] <Fluttershi> if a channel has chanserv instead of one of the hostserv bots in there, i noticed that happens
[04:02:52] <Fluttershi> if you're in multiple chans like that, it'll get dumbed into all of those channels on you
[04:02:53] <Colgate> some clients do that :(

[08:54:33] <Googie> Santa-Claws: You can do "/ns set privmsg on" to make services use standard messages rather than notices.
[08:55:00] <Santa-Claws> nah, Some of my scripts rely on being noticed by services :)
[08:56:18] <Googie> The nickserv login stuff is still done via notices.
[08:57:04] <Fluttershi> lol, just got a pm from nickserv, is that what that command is supposed to do?
[08:57:42] <Fluttershi> seems like, hm... not sure if want
