[17:11:03] <Shaitaan> hi Seoson
[17:11:29] <Shaitaan> why is everyone playing dead :(
[17:14:33] <Unixkitty> It's #help, people don't chat around here unless they actually need help, if that's what you're wondering
[17:15:10] <Shaitaan> Unixkitty do you need any help?
[17:15:19] <Unixkitty> No, do you?
[17:15:22] <Shaitaan> yeah
[17:15:35] <Shaitaan> i was wondering how long the host request takes usually
[17:16:25] <Unixkitty> What do you mean? Vhost for your hostname?
[17:16:46] <Shaitaan> yeah
[17:16:57] <Shaitaan> the vhost from hostserv on this network/server
[17:17:43] <Soarin> Depends on how the network admins feel :p
[17:17:58] <Unixkitty> Mine hasn't taken longer than a few minutes, I think it depends on whether anyone is online to look at it
[17:18:22] <Soarin> I've had a couple take days, and some instant.
[17:18:31] <Shaitaan> i just have to wait
[17:18:36] <Shaitaan> i don't have to request it again right?
[17:18:47] <Soarin> Nooez request it once
[17:19:15] <Shaitaan> k
[17:19:27] <Shaitaan> thanks Soarin and Unixkitty ^_^
[17:19:28] <Soarin> You will get a notice in your status window saying "your vhost has been approved/denied"
[17:19:36] <Shaitaan> i guess all i can do now is wait :D
[17:20:35] <Soarin> Mhm
[17:35:12] <Seoson> Currently the queue is processed according to IRCops statements from the last couple of day. It could take a day or two - just wait. HostServ offers a few preset ones if you really need one for privacy reasons
[17:35:34] <Seoson>  processed slow* <- Missing word ups
[17:36:19] <Seoson> also days* :D
