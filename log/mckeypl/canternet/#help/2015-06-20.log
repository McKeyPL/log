[09:37:15] <bottles> while it's possible to use chanserv for OP/DEOP, is there some way of hiding channel ownership (~) as well without logging out of nickserv?
[09:39:49] <Dusk> yes
[09:40:41] <Dusk> use /cs deowner #channel user
[09:41:04] <Dusk> or /cs deprotect #channel user if you wanna remove (&) from them
[09:41:12] <Dusk> @ bottles
[09:41:39] <bottles> thanks kindly
[09:41:48] <Dusk> you're welcome!~
[09:41:58] <bottles> and I kan /cs ower #channel user when I'm logged into nickserv and opped, right?
[09:42:00] <bottles> *can
[09:42:09] <bottles> as in, it's reversible?
[09:42:25] <Dusk> as long as you have the chanserv flag +q
[09:42:28] <Dusk> yes

[09:43:25] <bottles> so like if I'm the only channel owner, I do that on myself, I can still reverse it, wonderful
[09:43:36] <bottles> thanks for the help
[09:44:02] <Dusk> no problem~
[10:08:09] <One-Trick> you can remove all your modes
[10:08:24] <One-Trick> then just use chanserv sync to get it back
[10:09:59] <bottles> ah
