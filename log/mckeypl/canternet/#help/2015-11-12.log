[03:27:57] <RedHelper> Homer!
[03:28:07] <HomerMobile> Hey what is up?
[03:28:15] <RedHelper> It's been a while.
[03:28:21] <HomerMobile> ikr
[03:28:37] <RedHelper> Or are you Homers Troll?

[04:12:58] <RedHelper> Colgate what was the ingore command?
[04:13:30] <Fluttershi> believe it was /ignore
[04:13:32] <Colgate> /helpop silence
[04:13:39] <Fluttershi> or maybe /si- ninja
[04:13:53] <Fluttershi> what was the dif between ignore and silence again?
[04:14:09] <Colgate> /ignore isn't a command that the server knows
[04:14:24] <Colgate> some clients might implement it though
[04:15:03] <RedHelper> Thank you Colgate. They were getting annoying...
[04:15:10] <Fluttershi> so ignore is a sometimes client side that might not work at all depending on what you're using, eh?
[04:15:43] <Colgate> actually, I think we have /ignore aliased to /silence server side here, but some clients still implement their own ignore function

[07:29:55] <Sakura> Hmmmm... I could consider taking the answer to that question & extending my identify time because of my connection to a ZNC that other users connect to. This channel does have uses even for the lurker. :3
[07:31:39] <Fluttershi> yep, lurkers can hope to have questions they never considered to ask answered, or might be handy to answer questions if they happen to know some answers, themselves
[07:33:37] *** ama is now known as ama|sleep
[07:38:50] <Sakura> Yep. I'm even learning some things on my own when I set my own server sometimes so I don't have to ask here & maybe might be of use to even the most experienced user who has questions.
[07:42:54] <Sakura> Some people even get ask Google & end up having questions answered by a Yahoo Answers question page that was already answered. #help is exactly that & anyone can idle or lurk just to get new information & chat tricks.
[07:45:55] <Fluttershi> on the subject of question on yahoo or forums or whatever: what's particularly annoying: you find someone ask your question, but it doesn't get an answer, or they go "nevermind, i figured it out" but don't explain what they did
