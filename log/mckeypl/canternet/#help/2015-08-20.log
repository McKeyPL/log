[00:47:21] <Nelly> What is the max number of channels you can register?
[00:53:15] <Colgate> 5?
[00:53:21] <Colgate> I don't remember :P
[00:54:24] <RedHelper> MAXCHANNELS=128?
[00:54:46] <Colgate> that's the number you can join, not register
[00:54:53] <Fluttershi> that might be how many you can be in at the same- ya
[00:55:01] <Colgate> OperServ (OperServ@canternet.org): Maximum number of channels that one user can own: 20
[00:55:04] <Colgate> there
[01:02:01] <Nelly> Ok
[01:02:05] * Nelly starts dropping channels.
[01:02:26] <Fluttershi> lol, how many do you need?
[01:03:29] <Nelly> Oh I'm actually under the limit by 4
[01:04:07] <Nelly> I think I dropped 3 channels recently but it said I was at max for one account. I have two. That's confuzzling. I might have more channels registered than I know about? How can I check that..
[01:04:27] <Colgate> /nickserv info
[01:04:36] <Colgate> says how many you are founder of
[01:05:16] <RedHelper> So I wanna know how I set my own Metadata?
[01:06:05] <Colgate> /nickserv help set metadata
[01:06:14] <Colgate> er, property
[01:06:37] <RedHelper> Thank you Colgate
[01:08:27] <Nelly> Fluttershi when you type /msg nickserv info d you get the number of channels or anything about channels in your reply?
[01:08:57] <Fluttershi> i'm not seeing a list of the channels i own
[01:09:09] <Colgate> for that you want /nickserv listcchans
[01:09:22] <Colgate> /nickserv info only tells you the quantity
[01:09:43] <Nelly> Oh alrighty.
[01:10:13] <Nelly> I didn't see anything on it though.
[01:10:26] <Fluttershi> i didn't either

[01:12:29] <Colgate> /chanserv help flags
[01:12:50] <Nelly> OH sweet, there is a channel in here I didn't know about!
[01:13:01] * Nelly is gonna drop that sucker soooo hard.
[01:13:09] <Nelly> Apparently I was the successor.
[01:13:43] <Nelly> It lists any flag you have in any channel. :3
[01:13:57] <Colgate> not any flag, it doesn't take groupserv into account
[01:14:04] <Nelly> ShianMoon, /msg chanserv help flags.
[01:14:08] <Nelly> without the period.
[01:14:31] <Nelly> oh I'm late.
[01:15:59] <Nelly> Found another channel I apparently own.

[06:02:19] <Phasor_Shift> hey, question
[06:06:00] <Phasor_Shift> we'd like to enable gameserv in #spoilercloudbtv, but we aren't sure how. 
[06:06:58] <Halcyon_Starlight> /msg chanserv set #chan gameserv All|ops|voice|off
[06:07:55] <Phasor_Shift> I don't think we have anyone with permissions to do that...
[06:08:07] <Phasor_Shift> "Says I don;'t have the proper paramiters to do that"
[06:08:21] <Phasor_Shift> wait, parameters. means he typed something wrong
[06:09:27] <Halcyon_Starlight> /msg ChanServ SET #foo GAMESERV VOICE for example
[06:09:51] <Halcyon_Starlight> /msg chanserv set #Channelname gameserv ops
[06:10:08] <Phasor_Shift> says I'm not authorized. how do I be authorized?
[06:10:11] <Fluttershi> who do you want to be able to use it? everyone, or...?
[06:10:42] <Phasor_Shift> we were playing truth or dare >.> we wanted the lottery
[06:10:48] <Colgate> Phasor_Shift: you need the +s chanserv flag to use /chanserv set commands, so someone else would have to do it
[06:11:01] <Phasor_Shift> which is +s?
[06:11:01] <Halcyon_Starlight> ^
[06:11:04] <Colgate> either the owner of the channel or I think SOPs have it
[06:11:42] <Halcyon_Starlight> SOPs can set akicks so... o_o
[06:11:53] <Colgate> akicks are different than set
[06:12:12] * Halcyon_Starlight goes off to check then.
[06:12:16] <Phasor_Shift> well... game kinda fizzled anyway, so never mind.
