[03:54:36] <NyanCat> yes hi
[03:54:52] <NyanCat> i registered my account and i'm waiting for a confirmation email
[03:54:57] <NyanCat> doesn't seem to be happening
[03:55:15] <Fluttershi> are you using hotmail or an ms email?
[03:55:23] <NyanCat> no, i'm using excite.co.jp
[03:55:56] <Cae> Check your Spam folder lol
[03:56:29] <NyanCat> nada.
[03:56:35] <Fluttershi> hm, dunno then, i just know that hotmail and such can't get emails from irc whatever thing for some reason
[03:57:36] <NyanCat> yeah i know
[03:57:37] <Colgate> it didn't bounce yet
[03:57:51] <Colgate> let me check mail server logs
[03:58:16] <Colgate> looks like it is greylisted
[03:58:20] <Colgate> it will go through eventually
[03:58:25] <NyanCat> Colgate, i was registered before
[03:58:29] <NyanCat> i think my nick timed out
[03:58:32] <Fluttershi> greylist?

[03:59:33] <Colgate> the remote mail server is currently rejecting it with a temporary error, that's all I know
[03:59:44] <NyanCat> oh, lovely.
[03:59:55] <Colgate> it is probably greylisted
[04:00:09] <Colgate> which means it will eventually go through after several attempts

[06:27:48] <Compu> hey i need help with a ban evader
[06:27:54] <Compu> theyre using 2 accounts
[06:28:00] <Compu> i banned one and they joined using another
[06:28:45] <Compu> the account theyre using to evade is currently using the nick Blair
[06:29:02] <Compu> the mask i banned is *!*@The.Stallion.of.many.faces
[06:30:11] <Compu> Colgate? someone?
[06:30:26] <Colgate> channel?
[06:30:34] <Compu> #Compu
[06:31:17] <Compu> Colgate: they r saying they r not tyler via use of a tulpa
[06:33:57] <Compu> Colgate: tyler may try to accuse me of ban evading over 6 months ago in a channel he did not own
[06:34:11] <Compu> i am no longer in that channel and nor is my bot
[06:34:22] <Compu> so that is long past, just thought u should know
[06:34:55] <Colgate> I'm not going to care about ban evasion from 6 months ago...
[06:35:01] <Compu> the "ban evading" was me rejoining the channel because i was still an OP in it
[06:35:12] <Compu> he banned me cuz he was the same level OP as me
[06:36:06] <Compu> Colgate: just wondering is tyler now banned from canternet or will they be able to rejoin again?
[06:36:26] <Colgate> it was just a /kill, just a disconnect
[06:36:30] <Compu> alright
[06:36:32] <Compu> just wondering
[06:36:42] <Colgate> if they rejoin, then yes, it will be a ban
[06:36:42] <Compu> if they attempt to rejoin my channel again i'll tell u
[06:36:58] <Colgate> and also revocation of all their vhosts
[06:37:32] <Compu> thanks for all the help Colgate

[10:50:51] <Lia> Unixkitty can you help me please?
[10:51:23] <Googie> What do you need help with ?
[10:51:29] <Unixkitty> Yes Lia?
[10:51:42] <Unixkitty> You can't join #EquestriaDaily ?
[10:51:58] <Lia> I am trying to go to the EquestriaDaily chat at the name SugarWing but it doesn't doing anything
[10:52:18] <Unixkitty> Unfortunately the channel is currently on lockdown, so I'm afraid only registered users are allowed
[10:52:26] <Lia> oooh
[10:52:51] <Unixkitty> You're going to have to either register with NickServ or use an already existing registration to join
[10:53:00] <Googie> You can register with nickserv via "/msg nickserv register <password> <email address>"
[10:53:27] <Lia> ooh okay thank you really much i will contack as soon as i did it
[10:53:36] <Unixkitty> Make sure to be under the nickname you wish to register when you issue the command!
[10:56:07] <Lia> i think i did it but it still doesn't want to work
[10:56:14] <Lia> do i have to wait for a mail?
[10:56:28] <Googie> Yes. You'll have to follow the instructions in the confirmation email.
[10:57:07] <Lia> how much do i have to wait for it?
[10:57:15] <Unixkitty> It should be instant
[10:57:55] * Unixkitty boops Googie 
[10:58:41] <Lia> then something is wrong but the email i wrot is right so that's not the problem
[10:59:21] <Lia> *wrote
[10:59:56] <Unixkitty> You have issued the command correctly, and the email should have been sent, but you may need to double check the address you have sent it to
[11:00:50] <Lia> SugarWing is now registered to ravenlia25@gmail.com, with the password ******
[11:00:59] <Lia> it seems good
[11:01:49] <Unixkitty> You really did not need to post the email in here :P
[11:02:07] <Unixkitty> And Lia, you still need to click the link in that email to verify the registration
[11:02:37] <Lia> i didn't get any e-mail
[11:03:04] <Lia> and my time is running out i have 20 minutes until the class's end
[11:03:34] <Googie> Make sure to check your spam folder.
[11:04:25] <Lia> oh i didn't know there's spam folder in the gmail :$
