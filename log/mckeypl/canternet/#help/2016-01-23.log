[03:26:19] <HyperDash> how to private message?
[03:42:28] <Fluttershi> /query nick message
[03:42:38] <HyperDash> thanks
[04:07:10] <Caerdwyn> Actually, it's /query *nick*, then you write a message
[04:07:25] <Caerdwyn> if you do what you just wrote, Fluttershi, it'll try to open a /query with that person's nickname, plus your message lol
[04:08:41] <Person> Caerdwyn: Incorrect. It'll open a query starting with that message.
[04:08:52] <Person> Unless your client sucks super hard >.>;;
[04:09:09] <Caerdwyn> weechat is screwy then, cause I just tried that, and it just gave me an unknown nick error
