[10:59:17] <MirSar> Hello, I applied for vHost MirSar.com and got denied because of lacking documentation of domain ownership. Who can I talk regarding this? I can get any needed documentation
[11:11:46] <AppleDash> PM an IRC operator (anyone with op or above in this channel) with something like a link to a page on your site saying that you're allowed to use the vhost
[11:12:03] <AppleDash> Then once they check it out, apply again.
[11:12:25] <AppleDash> TXT records work too
[11:13:35] <MirSar> Thanks, may I ask if any of the OP's are more active than others? (no use pinging someone who's mostly lurking)
[11:15:23] <Googie> The process for providing vhost proof is to send a message via "/msg helpserv helpme vHost Proof: <message"
[11:15:47] <AppleDash> This is a new thing!
[11:16:14] <AppleDash> Well... Newer than like half a year ago at least
[11:16:54] <Googie> Nah, it's been around that long at least IIRC, but it wasn't really announced. It's just detailed on the support page.
[11:17:22] <AppleDash> lol
[11:18:38] <MirSar> Ahh, thnks Googie :)
