[17:20:30] <TicTac|Laptop> Okay, I'm having a bit of an issue that's gone over my knowledge of how to fix it. On my desktop, mIRC keeps crashing consistently, either when I join the #FoETavernOOC channel, or simply after I've been on any channel(s) for an extended period of time. Any of you have a clue as to what might be causing it?
[17:23:44] <Shutter> That's weird. If absolutely want to use mIRC you'd have to write them for support. That probably won't lead anywhere so maybe you should just use a different client.
[17:24:11] <Shutter> If you haven't updated mIRC in a while, try to update to the latest version and see if the problem goes away. Worth a shot *shrugs*.
[17:24:43] <TicTac|Laptop> ALready tried reinstalling it to the latest version multiple times, kept on happening >.>
