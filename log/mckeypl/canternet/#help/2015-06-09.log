[04:56:59] <Cloudrunner> Hello
[04:57:10] <Cloudrunner> Someone is ban evading
[04:57:22] <Cloudrunner> And could you admins gline
[04:57:32] <incog> its me, im evading
[04:57:37] <Fluttershi> ?
[04:57:37] <incog> hello, friend
[04:57:38] <Cloudrunner> Yes
[04:57:52] <Fluttershi> hello mister Nito
[04:58:20] <Cloudrunner> If anyone sees incog, zline him for proxy use
[04:58:57] <incog> do you understand the flaw in that statement
[04:59:28] <incog> a ban for ban evasion, just how do you think that ends
[05:00:16] <Selina> incog: I wish you'd not waste people's time. It's incredibly futile on both ends to stop you, and it's quite frankly a nuisance. Can you please for gods sake remember humanity for once?
[05:00:28] <Cloudrunner> You don't have to ban evade, incog.
[05:00:50] <Cloudrunner> You recklessly don't follow rules
[05:01:04] <incog> if i didnt, that would validate the incorrect notion that egotistical channel babysitters have any power
[05:01:50] <Colgate> right, this argument in this channel stops now

[05:05:53] <Fluttershi> hm? i thought (or assumed i guess?) that Colgate was a ~ in here
[05:06:11] <Colgate> oper symbols are meaningless
[05:07:24] <Fluttershi> hm?
[05:08:21] <Cloudrunner> Fluttershi
[05:08:27] <Cloudrunner> Opers are "!"
[05:08:46] <Selina> No, opers only get that if they ojoin a channel
[05:08:53] <incog> the glyph doesnt matter and is different per ircd
[05:08:57] <Selina> ^
[05:08:57] <Twili> I read in a book once that said ^ is used for characters like â and ê. or used for xor
[05:09:29] <Colgate> thanks Twili
