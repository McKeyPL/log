[14:51:49] <Seoson> Cadance has a 2.5 second delay for me. I've switched servers now. This is way too much.
[14:53:28] <Dusk> a 2.5 second delay?
[14:53:42] <Dusk> That's impressive
[14:54:10] <Seoson> Don't know what's going on there. That's the reason I posted it here.
[14:54:31] <Seoson> Discord is .5 for me
[14:54:34] <Dusk> I'm having no issues on cadance and all of my ZNC users are there
[14:54:45] <Dusk> maybe geogrphical issues?
[14:58:16] <Seoson> Even than 2.5 seconds should be too much. There are other servers, so I guess it's fine. I will take a look later on and check trace routes. Normally I'd go for my carrier (They have transit problems), but I'm using my server as a bouncer which eliminates that issue usually.
[15:01:38] <Shutter> Latency to cadance looks okay both from my perspective and from the other servers' perspective.
[15:03:06] <Dusk> ^ the several connections I have are fine
[15:03:31] <Seoson> Thank you for the information. Maybe it's tmp. transit problem.
