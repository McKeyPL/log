[10:42:06] <DudeWithAttitude> I need to assign a vhost to my nick. Any help ?
[10:58:37] <Finwe> The vhost request should be send to a network operator, I think.
[10:59:02] <Finwe> "HostServ Commands
[10:59:03] <Finwe> REQUEST 	[text] : Requests the given vhost(the stuff that comes after the @ symbol). Must be approved by an ircOP, so please be patient."
[10:59:10] <DudeWithAttitude> I have read that already.
[10:59:25] <DudeWithAttitude> did sent the request as well.
[10:59:33] <DudeWithAttitude> how to check if it's approved or not ?
[11:02:03] <Finwe> If you /whois your own nick, the server should show the vhost instead of Pony-xxxxx.tld.
[11:03:24] <DudeWithAttitude> that's what the problem is, its not showing me my vhost.
[11:03:35] <Finwe> Which seems not be the case yet, as you are visible to us as DudeW1th@Pony-1k5r4e.us.to still.
[11:03:48] <DudeWithAttitude> exactly.
[11:04:41] <DudeWithAttitude> Do I need to activate the vhost on my nick ?
[11:06:22] <Finwe> I assume that it's automatically activated once your request has been approved and the necessary changes made to network settings.
[11:07:02] <DudeWithAttitude> -HostServ- You have requested vhost ttitude. <- is that all right ?
[11:07:32] <DudeWithAttitude> I read some where on the page that I need to show the proof of domain as well prior to having a vhost ? what does that suppose to mean ?
[11:08:43] <Finwe> That's only in case you request an existing or free domain with a real TLD as your vhost.
[11:09:43] <DudeWithAttitude> I did not added anything after " ttitude ". Will that be ok ?
[11:10:54] <Finwe> I think it should be. Your user mask would then become DudeW1th@ttitude.
[11:11:11] <DudeWithAttitude> that is exactly what I want.
[11:11:37] <DudeWithAttitude> Plus I am using a psyBNC too, and I tried using my own vhost over the server which is ttitude.us.to
[11:11:52] <DudeWithAttitude> But I suppose servers arent supporting that, I just got us.to at the end.
[11:15:04] <DudeWithAttitude> where to find an IRC operator btw?
[11:15:04] <Finwe> The Canternet servers hash your real domain/server name in order to protect you, I think.
[11:16:05] <Finwe> If you do a /who command you get a list of people in this channel.
[11:16:22] <Finwe> The ones marked with an asterisk are IRCops.
[11:16:27] <DudeWithAttitude> WHO Not enough parameters.
[11:16:52] <Finwe> Possibly /who #channel
