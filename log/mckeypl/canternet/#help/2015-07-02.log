[22:52:35] <Seoson> Hello Shadow2
[22:52:57] <Shadow2> Why can't I use my nick Shadow ? I've registered it few days ago and now the system replies me that is service's name ._.
[22:55:08] <Seoson> According to the stats page the nickname belongs to an account named the same. I don't know any service that would use this name.
[22:55:40] <Shadow2> [22:56:08] Services reserved nickname: Registered nickname. "Shadow"
[22:56:43] <Seoson> Try /msg NickServ RELEASE Nickname Passwort

[22:57:55] <Shadow> o/
[22:58:03] <Shadow> Why did i forget this command 
[22:58:15] <Seoson> ;-)
[22:58:32] <Seoson> The error message can be confusing.
[23:00:08] <Shadow> EeYup, I was wondering ''How can I reg a nick if it's already a service name''
[23:00:12] <Shadow> Anyway
[23:00:13] <Shadow> I'll think about it next time
[23:00:27] <Shadow> Thansk a lot and have a good day
