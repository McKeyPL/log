[05:38:40] <Princess_Pwny> So, I help run a small irc network that only caters to a single channel with 30-50 users are we are current discussing about moving away from running our own gear and instead just residing on canternet. Our talks are in the peliminary, but I wanted to ask about a few things. 
[05:39:33] <Colgate> such as?
[05:40:03] <Princess_Pwny> A: we have explicit content in our channel all the time. Would we need to have something in the topic to warn of it?
[05:40:48] <Colgate> it isn't required, but you might want to include it to dissuade those who are not interested in that stuff from accidentally joining
[05:41:50] <Princess_Pwny> B: we run several bots off the same box, one of them connecting steam users into our channel. I had asked before about this, but would it be possible if we do decide to move to canternet to have the connection limit from that one IP upped to 40? 
[05:42:11] <Colgate> yes
[05:42:21] <Princess_Pwny> Awesome
[05:43:43] <Princess_Pwny> And number 3, the one I think you'll reject: Our steam bot currently uses m_cgiirc.so and webirc to set hostmasks to be the same as the users steam ID. I very much understand if you did not allow us access to webirc as that is a lot of non-standard access, but the bot dev asked about it
[05:43:47] *** Pony_80066 is now known as Ponka_po
[05:43:49] *** Ponka_po is now known as Ponka_Po
[05:43:58] <Princess_Pwny> The bot can be re-written somewhat to function without it, but he asked so I asked.
[05:45:09] <Colgate> that would probably be a no, but I can discuss it with the other staff and see
[05:46:04] <Colgate> alternatively, you could probably use the realname field for that, unless you are using that already for something else
[05:46:36] <Colgate> there is an extban for matching against realname, so you could still do bans against them
[05:46:51] <Princess_Pwny> Yeah, I did suggest using a hash of the steam UID so you could ban *!UIDHAS@* 
[05:47:05] <Princess_Pwny> I'll pass that on
[05:47:09] <Colgate> ah, username would work as well if it wasn't too long
[05:47:59] <Princess_Pwny> yeah the steam ID is too long as a username but if you used a similar method as inspircd's cloaking module you could fit it in
[05:48:11] *** Eventide is now known as Eventide|Sleepies
[05:49:36] <Princess_Pwny> Is there anything of note we'd need to be aware of outside the normal rules if we moved 30-50 users here?
[05:50:42] <Colgate> nothing that immediately comes to mind
[05:51:41] <Princess_Pwny> Cool, I'll pass that on to the mod team. If you think of something feel free to let me know anytime
[05:52:25] <Colgate> yep
[05:52:58] <Princess_Pwny> Thanks for the help!
[05:52:58] <Twili> I read in a book once that said Thanks for the help is there anything I should be made aware of before leave #help?
[05:53:25] * Colgate slaps Twili
[05:59:11] <Finwe> :D
[05:59:58] <Finwe> Just what I needed to know at 7 a.m.
[06:00:27] <LightningCrash> Go drink some coffee.
