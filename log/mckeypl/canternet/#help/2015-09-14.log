[07:23:15] <Fluttershi> curious, what would be a proper wait time after putting one of those in before you start trying to ask about it?
[07:28:02] <Seoson> Considering it's a purely optional and timezone differences I'd wait a day at least. When I requested mine it got approved in a matter of single digit minutes. Being friendly and if you've asked for it saying "Thanks" afterwards probably helps to increase motivation for future requests as well.
[07:29:06] <Colgate> vhosts are pretty much the lowest priority thing, and especially not something I'm going to do on mobile

[23:28:11] <Tree-Hugger> or do I have to remove the first one from the room before I try to bring a new one in?
