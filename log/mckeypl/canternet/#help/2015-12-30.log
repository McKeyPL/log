[08:32:47] <IsmaiL> and when placed a ban on some lamer
[08:32:52] <IsmaiL> someone unbanned the ips
[08:32:55] <Colgate> if they are setting akicks, it says who sets them
[08:33:34] <Colgate> if they are using /chanserv ban, just remove chanserv flag +r from everyone
[08:33:46] <Colgate> then they can't do that
[08:34:59] <IsmaiL> u mean the channel mode +r ?

[08:38:37] <IsmaiL> uh
