[01:50:55] <Apple_Bloom> What the hell
[01:51:36] <Apple_Bloom> Wowaname is bad news
[01:52:32] <Apple_Bloom> They are suspected of carrying out mass spam attacks on  major networks such as Freenode, Mozilla, OFTC, and Rizon.
[01:54:28] <Seoson> I had a little chat with Mr. C (don't want to ping him). He is aware of them.

[02:03:23] <iamalion> wowaname is well known. on many networks.
[02:06:48] <Apple_Bloom> I am well aware of that. It makes me wonder what he would be doing on a brony network. He doesn't seem like that type of person.
[02:07:16] <Seoson> Trolling? As usual?
[02:08:36] <Apple_Bloom> Almost definitely.

[02:15:56] <Midnight_Lilly> Iv never heard of him :p
[02:18:15] <Apple_Bloom> I would expect that most users who don't use many other networks won't have any idea who he is. Oh, you're an IRCCloud user like me Midnight_Lilly. That network has been spammed too.
[02:18:37] <Midnight_Lilly> I also hang out on freenode
[02:18:54] <Dusk> He's definitely known on freenode
[02:19:57] <Midnight_Lilly> Meh iv never ran into him or even seen the name before
[02:20:49] <Apple_Bloom> That is probably for the best. Nothing good ever comes from associating with him.
[02:21:26] <Midnight_Lilly> Oh course I only use freenode to hang with other writers :p
