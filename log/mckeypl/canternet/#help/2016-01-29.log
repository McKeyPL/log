[05:24:18] <Pony_57616> Hello all. I'm having a little trouble regestering my nickname
[05:24:47] *** Pony_57616 is now known as Nick_
[05:26:40] <Nick_> I'm asked to please log in to verify, but when I try to change my name it doesn't seem to work
[05:31:28] <Colgate> /nickserv ID username password
[05:31:38] <Colgate> then do /nickserv regain username
[05:32:25] <Nick_> ID is what?
[05:32:37] <Fluttershi> regain username? hm, haven't heard thatone before
[05:32:42] <Colgate> ID is the command to log in
[05:32:50] <Nick_> Woot. Identified
[05:32:56] <Colgate> IDENTIFY and LOGIN also work
[05:33:02] <Colgate> but ID is shorter ;)
[05:33:17] *** Nick_ is now known as Nicktendonick
[05:33:25] <Nicktendonick> THere
[05:33:29] <Nicktendonick> Much better
[05:33:31] <Nicktendonick> Thanks guys
[05:33:52] <Colgate> nickserv will lock out your name if someone fails to log in in time
[05:33:57] <Colgate> so that's probably what happened
[05:34:19] *** Quits: Duck (Duck@non.stop.nyan.cat) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:34:20] <Nicktendonick> ahhh
[05:35:24] <Colgate> Fluttershi: yeah, /nickserv regain is the "nicer" version of /nickserv ghost, if someone has that name, instead of disconnecting them, it renames them
[05:35:39] <Colgate> though, it is a bit unreliable if someone else is using it
[05:37:02] <Fluttershi> doesn't release do that, too?
[05:37:56] <Colgate> release removes the lock that prevents everyone from using the nick
[05:38:35] <Colgate> then you can /nick to it
[05:38:46] <Colgate> regain will switch you to it automatically
[05:42:35] <Nicktendonick> IC, IC
[05:42:57] *** ama|work is now known as ama
[05:44:05] <Fluttershi> regain directly knocks whoever might me on the nick off of it and switches you to it in one action?
[05:44:47] <Colgate> that's the intention
[05:44:53] <Colgate> it doesn't always work though
