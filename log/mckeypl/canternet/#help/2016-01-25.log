[22:03:24] <Koja> hello
[22:03:31] *** Koja is now known as Shan
[22:03:55] <Shan> is there anyway that i can find out which users are not using ssl in the channel ?
[22:04:08] <Shan> or do i have to go throw by doing /whois for everyone
[22:05:04] <Colgate> the latter is the only way
[22:05:31] <Moonlightning> Unless you wanna set +z and masskick
[22:05:38] <Shan> because i wanted to put +z mode for the channel so if there is anyone who is not using ssl in the channel i can't set this mode
[22:06:20] <Shan> one more thing how can we find out the ssl signature
[22:06:32] <Moonlightning> Ohh, right
[22:07:03] <Shan> <discord.canternet.org>: *** You are connected using SSL cipher "RSA-AES-256-CBC-SHA1"
[22:07:15] <Shan> that's the ssl signature ?
[22:07:41] <Moonlightning> well, in cryptography, /signature/ means something completely different...
[22:07:48] <Shan>  z:	[fingerprint] Matches against SSL client certificate fingerprint.
[22:07:57] <Colgate> /sslinfo <nick>
[22:08:33] <Colgate> it is also in /whois
[22:08:49] <Shan> thanks colgate
[22:08:51] <Shan> it worked
