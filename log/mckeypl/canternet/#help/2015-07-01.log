[06:48:40] <Schism> Hello, folks; my apologies for bothering you, but I've just noticed that a user over in #equestriadaily was g-lined for being, supposedly a spambot - 'Thelema5'.  I'm almost completely certain this is not the case; I was just wondering if this is an automated process.  I know that g-lines expire quickly, I just hate to see someone like him kicked off without cause.  Again, my apologies for bothering you, and thanks for your time.
[06:50:10] <Fluttershi> he might have just so happened to have said something spambots were saying recently and activated some kind of automatic thing
[06:50:57] <Schism> If so, he certainly didn't say it in the channel, but I suppose that if things are automated, that might be the case.
[06:52:50] <Schism> Oh, strike that, looks resolved, thanks everyone.
[06:53:03] <Schism> Have a good night, mods, and hope that things are quiet throughout the night.

[07:12:14] <Colgate> Fluttershi: that is indeed what happened
[07:13:33] <Fluttershi> was whatever is activating these auto g lines a common enough thing to end up said, or is copy pastaing going on or...?
[07:14:06] <Colgate> probably mostly copy+paste
[07:14:07] <Googie> It can basically only be activated by copy+pasting what the spambots said.
[07:14:42] <Lapsus> I wanted to paste some of it but Shutter is asleep and you two would just laugh at me :3
