[00:43:50] <Sour_Sweet> irc.canternet.org is a round robin pool. Every active canternet server should end up in your client eventually
[00:44:04] <Compu> Colgate: r u gonna add derpy and the others to https://canternet.org/stats# ever?
[00:44:14] <Sour_Sweet> By using the pool you avoid connection to servers out of service
[00:44:31] <Colgate> not my thing, ask Shutter
[00:44:52] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: yeah but everytime i try to connect to the round robin pool it gives my derpy which seems to have been having issues, according to those stats it really should be giving my cadance
[00:45:23] <Colgate> that's because you have ipv6, and derpy is our ipv6 server
[00:45:53] <Sour_Sweet> I never had issues with Derpy - just the opposite. Also what Brushie said
[00:45:56] <Compu> mmm
[00:45:56] <Shutter> Compu: Derpy is quick to (re)add, I might do that.
[00:46:10] <Sour_Sweet> You could force your client to use ipv4 though
[00:46:23] <Shutter> Apart from that I try not to add servers unless they're having a substantial number of users. Adding servers to the rrd is a pain in the ass.
[00:46:24] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: dont think quassel has that option
[00:47:11] <Compu> Shutter: looking at the stats u can see the servers that r having the big issues with the DDoS, cadance seems to be handling things best
[00:47:46] <Sour_Sweet> Some networks also have ipv4 and ipv6 only pools, but I don't think Canternet has
[00:47:55] <Sour_Sweet> (never checked it though)
[00:48:16] <Colgate> we used to, but it was deemed unnecessary to maintain :P
[00:48:40] <Colgate> if you want only ipv4 servers or ipv6 servers, just set your client to do that
[00:48:59] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: manually having my client try different servers when the round robin doesnt work works just fine for me, even if it takes a bit longer to find a working server
[00:49:13] <Colgate> if your client can't do that, consider getting a better client that fits your needs better
[00:49:26] <Compu> this client fits my needs very well
[00:49:31] <Sour_Sweet> Yeah but you'll end up on servers like daring ;-)
[00:49:36] <Compu> i love the link previewing feature
[00:49:48] <Compu> Sour_Sweet: only if daring is working
[00:50:05] <Shutter> Daring is working-ish.
[00:50:10] <Compu> and if i get somehow disconnected from daring my client just continues down the list
[00:50:12] <Shutter> Bit to and from. Haven't been too bad lately.
[00:50:23] <Colgate> daring is/was working, it was pulled because the host was... well, bad
[00:50:24] <Sour_Sweet> It is currently afaik, but deprecated
[00:50:45] <Compu> Colgate: its still running
[00:50:52] <Colgate> server names that are defunct just get cnamed to irc.canternet.org anyways
[00:51:12] <Colgate> Compu: it is "running" sure
[00:51:12] <Compu> Colgate: daring is in /map
[00:51:18] <Colgate> but it has had a bad history of network issues
[00:52:04] <Compu> mmm

[01:01:11] <Woonaspork> I tried logging on through the site instead of the client but i forgot my password,so i tried changing it
[01:01:25] <Sour_Sweet> There is a command to recover your password in the topic

[09:19:31] <User_7669> i need a friend
[09:20:58] <Googie> This is the network help channel, for technical issues relating to help with using the Canternet IRC network. You can probably go looking around various channels though if you want to find people to talk to.
[09:21:24] <User_7669> i am banned from most of them though
[09:26:23] <batpony> This isn't the get unbanned from other channels channel. It's for help. :P
[09:28:59] <User_7669> sorry, i'm just desperate
[09:29:44] <Fluttershi> stop doing banworthy things?
[09:30:23] <User_7669> but i got banned months ago
[09:31:03] <Fluttershi> got mass banned all at the same time?
[09:32:14] <User_7669> no back then i used to spam and troll the chatrooms but i have changed now
[09:33:20] <batpony> from what you did in my channel that's a pretty fat ass lie

[09:35:16] <User_7669> i didn't know that what i did would ban me, because what i used to do was much worse
[09:35:30] <Fluttershi> what's he do?
[09:35:43] <User_7669> i did a minor troll
[09:35:52] <batpony> I mean.. it isn't like there are rules in most channels

[09:44:17] <Fluttershi> such generalisations, you already proved it false, unless you're being hypocritical, looking for 'nice', when you aren't
