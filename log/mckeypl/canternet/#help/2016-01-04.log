[00:21:41] <Sour_Sweet> Probably not going to happen
[00:25:50] <Sour_Sweet> If you or your channel members feel offended by a user via private message you can use a server side or your client's ignore function (Alternatively set your own usermode to +c). If you feel there is a violation of network rules (Spam / Floods etc.) report them
[00:27:04] <Sour_Sweet> You might also want to look into the usermodes +R and +d
[00:27:24] <Colgate> probably don't want umode +d
[00:28:01] <Sour_Sweet> +g would also work I guees, but they're all a pain
[00:28:08] <Unixkitty> I think that was a joke.
[00:29:53] <Sour_Sweet> Unixkitty: Actually no. If you get annoyed by other users ... I don't judge what silly people do, I just outline options. +d does have a number of side effects though
[00:30:12] <Colgate> +d makes it so you don't get channel messages
[00:30:19] <Colgate> you still get PMs
[00:30:21] <Sour_Sweet> Ahh ups
[00:30:32] <Sour_Sweet> Never mind they count as channel privmsgs :D
[00:31:28] <Sour_Sweet> I sometimes forget those things ;-) IRC is old and my memory doesn't always work correctly.

[17:36:31] <FluffyXai> Hi there, I could use some help. having touble with the GameServ bot
[17:38:45] *** FluffyXai is now known as Xai
[17:46:44] <Xai> Gameserv says this under the help for roll "-GameServ- Syntax: ROLL [times] <#dice>d<#sides>" so if I typed "roll 5 1d6" it would give me five seperate values. and I remember this used to work. but for some reason now it doesn't. when I type a command like that it just ignores the tiems and jsut does the first dice rol as normal but no more. I asked for help on the irc it comes from and they told me it works fine there, i queried gameserv and tested 
[17:46:44] <Xai> it and it did indeed work. then I did the same on canternet and it still didn't work. so it must be something to do with how it works here. but like I said it used to work.
[17:55:02] <Colgate> Xai: that feature was removed due to abuse
[18:04:14] <Xai> oh, that sucks. i'm sorry to hear that. it did make things more cnvenient. I wish people could learn to behave themselves >.<
