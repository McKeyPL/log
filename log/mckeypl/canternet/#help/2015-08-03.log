[19:27:29] <Starflare> Any webclients that you ponies reccomend?
[19:28:03] *** iam[a]lion is now known as iamalion
[19:28:48] <Dusk> Why're you looking at web clients?
[19:29:22] <Colgate> your choices are basically our embed, mibbit, kiwiirc, irccloud, lightirc or ircanywhere
[19:29:43] <Starflare> 'Cause I have lightIRC and a download is pretty much out of the question
[19:29:59] <Dusk> it is?
[19:30:07] <Starflare> For me, yeah
[19:30:11] <Dusk> Why?
[19:30:11] <Twili> I read in a book once that said Why can't I set channel mode +a by itself without services?
[19:30:18] <Colgate> Twili: forget why
[19:30:18] <Twili> The book on why is empty! Must be invisible ink...
