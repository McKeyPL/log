[01:44:59] <HyperDash> what is the server for an independant IRC client
[01:45:10] <HyperDash> if I wanted to connect from an IRC application
[01:47:28] <Dusk> irc.canternet.org
[01:48:08] <Dusk> I'd suggest using ssl on port 6697
[01:48:25] <HyperDash> it says nodename nor servname provided, or not known
[01:48:31] <HyperDash> and then kicks me off

[01:49:59] *** Joins: Duck (sid3009@Pony-4r56u0.ealing.irccloud.com)
[01:50:17] <HyperDash> any ideas on how I might fix that?
[01:50:21] <iamalion> shouldnt need to
[01:50:22] <iamalion> what client
[01:50:31] <Duck> Is it not possible to register at all using outlook email?
[01:50:38] <HyperDash> LimeChat
[01:50:41] <Colgate> Duck: no it isn't
[01:50:43] <Duck> are there any other free providers that I should be aware of before I try again? 
[01:50:58] <Colgate> microsoft refuses to unblock our email server from their blacklist
[01:51:05] <Colgate> despite *numerous* attempts
[01:51:12] <Duck> Colgate: Who hosts it? o.O
[01:51:17] <Colgate> ovh
[01:51:22] <Duck> o.O
[01:51:40] <Duck> ugh, and I don't have another email
[01:51:42] <Colgate> so any microsoft owned email server is blocked
[01:51:47] <iamalion> HyperDash are you just trying the normal irc.canternet.org or the ssl thing that Dusk suggested
[01:51:48] <Colgate> well, blocking us
[01:52:07] <HyperDash> SSL
[01:52:10] <HyperDash> 6667
[01:52:11] <HyperDash> port
[01:52:14] <iamalion> try normal see if that works
[01:52:15] <iamalion> ¯\(°_o)/¯
[01:52:17] <Dusk> 6697 is an ssl port
[01:52:24] <Dusk> 6667 is a normal port
[01:52:28] <HyperDash> oh
[01:52:30] <HyperDash> ok
[01:52:30] <Colgate> Duck: I mean, there's tons of free email providers out there, gmail, yahoo, etc.
[01:52:38] <HyperDash> well now it's saying this: SSL problem (possibly the server doesn't support SSL or uses a bad certificate)
[01:52:50] <Dusk> Can you accept invalid certs?
[01:53:04] <Dusk> Because Canternet's isn't signed by a CA trusted in your OS
[01:53:10] <HyperDash> oo
[01:53:19] <Dusk> so you'll have to either accept it as an invalid one or add their CA to your trusted list.
[01:53:19] <HyperDash> it's working!
[01:53:21] <HyperDash> yay!
[01:53:23] <Dusk> Neat :D

[22:22:54] <Solo_Act> Alrighty then, how do I keep a channel open?
[22:23:15] <Sour_Sweet> Register it with ChanServ ?
[22:23:31] <Sour_Sweet> /msg ChanServ help
[22:23:46] <Duck> This ^^ Also make sure that you /msg ChanServ HELP SET for various configuration optiosn 
[22:23:52] <Duck> *options
[22:23:56] <Solo_Act> alright! :D
[22:26:16] <Sour_Sweet> While ChanServ's basic features are simple it can get complex. You might want to look at https://canternet.org/support for channelsmodes etc. Also there are more dedicated Wikis with a lot more info
[22:29:01] <Solo_Act> Ok, the AOP explanation makes no sense.
[22:29:20] <Sour_Sweet> What exactly?
[22:29:34] * Colgate doesn't even remember what that is
[22:29:46] <Solo_Act> What is the AOP command, what is it for, etc.
[22:30:14] <Sour_Sweet> AOP as in automatically OP
[22:30:36] <Solo_Act> OP being Original Poster, or OP as in mod?
[22:30:39] <Sour_Sweet> When a user is on this list he/she/it is automatically OPed when joining the channel
[22:30:49] <Colgate> OP means "moderator" in irc
[22:30:54] <Colgate> you are an operator of the channel
[22:31:28] <Solo_Act> OK, so it's essentially adding someone to the VIP list.
[22:31:44] <Sour_Sweet> IRC has different user "ranks" that can be seen as a prefix for the user's nick OP would be @
[22:32:02] <Colgate> kind of? it gives people permissions to do things besides just chat in the channel
[22:32:49] <Sour_Sweet> An OP can not only join the channel, but also kick and ban people or change the topic
[22:33:18] <Solo_Act> So, do i have to disable the commands for everyone but mods or is everything off limits for non-mods?
[22:33:43] <Colgate> if you aren't an op of the channel, you can't kick or anything by default
[22:33:46] <Colgate> all you can is talk
[22:33:53] <Sour_Sweet> By default the channels permission are quite reasonable
[22:33:53] <Colgate> can do*
[22:34:07] <Sour_Sweet> You might want to add a topiclock
[22:34:12] <Solo_Act> Ok, good. Had me worried I'd have to think of everything. That would've sucked.
[22:34:24] <Solo_Act> topiclock, eh? I'd planned on something of the sort.
[22:34:52] <Sour_Sweet> There is a channel mode that prevents normal users from chaning the topic
[22:35:16] <Sour_Sweet> I don't know it's character atm, but Colgate probably does ;-)
[22:35:19] <Colgate> +t, which is set on by default
[22:35:27] <Sour_Sweet> Oh nevermind ;-)
[22:36:00] <Colgate> +n is also set by default, which prevents people from outside the channel from messaging it
[22:36:10] <Solo_Act> Do I retain my status in the channel when I log out, since I'm the founder? or does that go to the next person who logs in when I'm gone?
[22:36:27] <Sour_Sweet> If you registred it with ChanServ yes
[22:36:38] <Sour_Sweet> Otherwise no
[22:37:07] <Colgate> +P is also set on all channels that are registered with chanserv
[22:37:14] <Colgate> those are all the "default" modes
[22:38:00] <Colgate> +P makes the channel stick around when nobody is in it
[22:38:50] <Solo_Act> Colgate: could I ask you to take a quick look at the channel and see if anything's wrong with it?
[22:39:40] <Colgate> uh, it is probably fine?
[22:39:44] <Colgate> the defaults are pretty sane
[22:40:24] <Solo_Act> That's a no, but still reassuring.
[22:40:37] <Colgate> I wouldn't know what to look for :P
[22:41:25] <Solo_Act> OK, I think I get it now; Up top, next to the name of the channel and the number of people in it, is a list of active modes on the channel, right?
[22:41:49] <Colgate> uh... depends on your irc client
[22:41:53] <Sour_Sweet> For most clients, yes
[22:42:14] <Sour_Sweet> You could check it with /mode
[22:42:21] <Solo_Act> Alright. All that's active on my channel is Ptn.
