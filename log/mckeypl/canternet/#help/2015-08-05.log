[01:35:45] <Starflare> How do I use quit message? It never seems to quit......
[01:37:07] <Gigawork> when you quit do /quit message goes here
[01:37:36] <Gigawork> or if you have a client, you can set a permanent message through said client
[01:37:53] <Starflare>  /quit message I'm quiting
[01:37:53] * RainbowHacks doesn't connec tot irc with a client. She uses the microchip in her brain
[01:38:04] <RainbowHacks> Starflare, yup!
[01:38:14] <RainbowHacks> except without the qword message
[01:38:43] <Starflare> What's that XD
[01:38:51] <RainbowHacks> ._.
[01:38:59] <RainbowHacks> type /quit $message
[01:39:28] <Starflare> -__-
[01:39:49] * RainbowHacks pokes Starflare in the face. With a stick.
[01:39:56] <Gigawork> Its like this /quit "message here"    no quotes
[01:40:00] <RainbowHacks> I'm just answering your question o.o
[01:40:10] <Starflare> oh I see
[01:41:21] <Starflare> Thanks!
[01:41:38] <Gigawork> Mhmm!
[01:41:41] <Gigawork> 5 bucks :P
[01:41:44] <Starflare> Wait what is nick grrouping
[01:41:59] * Starflare hands Gigawork 10 bits
[01:42:01] <Gigawork> Nick grouping is for if you have a nickserve account
[01:42:06] <Gigawork> Like.. this
[01:42:09] *** Gigawork is now known as Soarin
[01:42:22] <Soarin> this name is in my account via grouped nick
[01:42:41] <Soarin> Basically you do /Nickserve group "nick here"
[01:42:43] <Soarin> no quotes
[01:42:53] *** Soarin is now known as Gigawork
[01:43:05] <Gigawork> It makes it so others cannot use that nick :P
[01:43:06] <Starflare> So I'm registered for Starflare, and I can register another nick to that password/account
[01:43:17] <Colgate> Gigawork: just /nickserv group, actually
[01:43:27] <Colgate> group command doesn't take any parameters
[01:43:30] <Gigawork> Oh yeah, derp my bad
[01:43:47] <Colgate> it links that nick to your account
[01:43:48] <Gigawork> Listen to Colgate, she is smart mini horse :P
[01:44:02] <Starflare> Indeed skratta h√∂gt
[01:44:13] <Colgate> if you don't use that nick for 30 days, it will expire just like any other nick on your account
[01:44:21] <Starflare> I see
[01:44:44] *** Starflare is now known as Fluffles
[01:45:01] <Fluffles> Is there a limit?
[01:45:14] <Colgate> 30 or something
[01:45:28] <Colgate> of course, we only encourage you to group nicks you actually use
[01:45:42] <Colgate> hence why there is a relatively short period for expiration
[01:46:27] <Fluffles> Ok
[01:46:56] *** Fluffles is now known as Tierce
[01:47:16] * RainbowHacks boops Colgate 
[01:47:21] <RainbowHacks> o/
[01:48:39] *** Tierce is now known as Formel
[01:49:51] <Gigawork> Nick hording is bad, Mkay
[01:49:53] <Formel> Thanks!
[01:50:01] * Formel agrees
[01:50:19] <Formel> I just registered Formel, that's the only one :)
