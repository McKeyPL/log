[15:06:15] <Shan> just had a little question in mind i want to ask ?
[15:06:20] <Shan> if i can get any help regarding this
[15:06:34] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[15:19:23] <Sour_Sweet> Don't ask to ask just ask.
[15:19:35] <Shan> what is this mode 
[15:19:36] <Shan> set to mode +xicT
[15:20:06] <Sour_Sweet> https://canternet.org/support
[15:20:20] <Shan> nope
[15:20:24] <Sour_Sweet> Under user or channel modes depending on what modes you're talking about
[15:20:35] <Shan> this mode is set by ircop
[15:21:42] <Sour_Sweet> +i 	Hides you from /who unless you share a channel with the user. On by default.
[15:21:51] <Sour_Sweet> +x 	Hides your IP address from other users. On by default.
[15:22:00] <Sour_Sweet> +c 	Requires other users to be in a channel with you before being able to PRIVMSG/NOTICE you.
[15:22:10] <Sour_Sweet> So the only one missing is +T
[15:22:18] <Shan> don't worry about +T
[15:22:25] <Shan> the thing is how do we set +c mode
[15:22:40] <Shan> in complete mode
[15:23:18] <Sour_Sweet>  /mode Nickname +c
[15:23:47] <Sour_Sweet> +T is an auth thing and doesn't matter to normal folks

[19:58:19] <Colgate> +T? we don't have a +T umode
[20:02:49] <Sour_Sweet> Don't ask me :P Google it and it said it's used together with w:lines
[20:02:56] <Sour_Sweet> googled*
[20:03:13] <Sour_Sweet> Maybe he took it from a different network?
[20:03:28] <Colgate> w:lines aren't a thing in inspircd
[20:05:35] <Sour_Sweet> Anyhow for someone running a channel there is an awful lack of knowledge. /mode is not exaclty an uncommon command
[20:06:48] <Colgate> I'm thinking they were connecting to some other irc network
[20:12:34] <Eventide> silly gupshups
[20:13:37] <Sour_Sweet> Seen it as block CTCP as well, but with non standard umodes they could basically mean anything depending on the network.
[20:13:51] <Colgate> yep
[20:14:46] <Sour_Sweet> This why it confused whereever he was talking about user or channel modes :P
[20:15:16] <Sour_Sweet> +T is not exactly an uncommon channel mode.
[20:15:24] <Colgate> there is no cmode +x either
