[04:48:47] <Dartz_Locke> Hey I have a question about our whois stats
[04:49:24] <Halcyon_Starlight> What tis ze question? :3
[04:49:41] <Dartz_Locke> I'm sorta confused on my username 
[04:49:55] <Dartz_Locke> what is this: ~WebChat@Pony-nc4kk7.hstntx.sbcglobal.net
[04:50:49] <Googie> You're connecting from (something).hstntx.sbcglobal.net
[04:51:05] <Googie> That something is masked out to prevent people from easily obtaining your IP address.
[04:51:23] <Dartz_Locke> Ah. 
[04:51:51] <Dartz_Locke> Thanks! But is it possible for people to decode this? 
[04:52:07] <Googie> In theory, yes.
[04:52:08] <Dusk> It would take a really long time
[04:52:15] <Googie> It's fairly difficult though
[04:52:21] <Dusk> Like, a realllly long time without the key
[04:52:23] <Dusk> >.>
[04:52:25] <Dartz_Locke> Wow. 
[04:52:29] <Halcyon_Starlight> I've heard users talking about that before.
[04:52:47] <Dartz_Locke> interesting..
[04:52:50] <Halcyon_Starlight> Saying they 'knew' ways to do it and such.
[04:53:08] <Dusk> There are ways to do it
[04:53:15] <Halcyon_Starlight> Mhmm
[04:53:28] <Dusk> but it takes time, and is inconvenient, plus your IP has prolly changed anyway when they've gotten it
[04:55:26] <Halcyon_Starlight> But they still get the information.
[04:56:27] <Dusk> Of history
[04:56:31] <Dusk> sure
[04:56:31] <Dartz_Locke> I see well thanks for letting me know about this. 
[04:56:35] <Dusk> you're welcome
[04:56:43] <Halcyon_Starlight> Dartz_Locke: there are things
[04:56:51] <Halcyon_Starlight> Like ways to further mask your host.
[04:56:59] <Dusk> like requesting a vhost
[04:57:06] <Halcyon_Starlight> You can make a vhost mask for your account and login with Sasl
[04:57:12] <Dusk> or using a bouncer/using tor
[04:57:16] <Halcyon_Starlight> Yeah what Dusk k said
[04:57:24] <Halcyon_Starlight> That toooo.....
[04:57:47] <Dusk> ^.^
[04:58:02] <Halcyon_Starlight> Though those are a bit more obtrusive.
[04:59:27] <Dusk> Less convenient, but my preferred method, as Halcyon_Starlight would know well :p
[05:00:13] <Halcyon_Starlight> Because proxy issues, if you aren't afraid(concerned with anonymity) of your host then proxy isn't necessary.
[05:00:33] *** Quits: Dartz_Locke (~WebChat@Pony-nc4kk7.hstntx.sbcglobal.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[05:00:36] <Colgate> there are ways to find your IP address
[05:00:41] <Halcyon_Starlight> Welp, we killed him.
[05:00:54] <Dusk> Welp
[05:01:00] <Dusk> bored his connection to death
[05:01:04] <Halcyon_Starlight> Lol
[05:01:07] <Colgate> clicking on links will also reveal your IP to whomever controls that website unless you use something to hide it
[05:01:20] * Halcyon_Starlight tors!
[05:01:23] <Colgate> a vpn, proxy, or tor
[05:01:33] * Dusk uses socks proxies to her servers :D
[05:01:47] <Dusk> They're already gone though Colgate
[05:01:49] <Dusk> it's ok
[05:01:52] <Colgate> I am aware
[05:01:52] <Googie> And even then IP leaks happen.
[05:01:57] <Halcyon_Starlight> But we were only talking about users on a network Colgate, like Lunar.net.
[05:02:05] <Dusk> mhm
[05:02:09] <Colgate> I have no idea what you mean by that Halcyon_Starlight
[05:02:18] <Dusk> Lunarnet sucks for that, they don't even have host cloaking
[05:02:19] <Halcyon_Starlight> Sure, there are TONS of ways to get your IP taken. :P
[05:02:20] <Dusk> at all
[05:02:30] <Dusk> and refused to enable it
[05:02:44] <Halcyon_Starlight> Mhmm
[05:02:54] <Colgate> to be fair,  cloaking only prevents casual attacks
[05:02:55] <Colgate> it is easy to find it
[05:03:21] * Halcyon_Starlight feels educated nao.
[05:03:29] <Dusk> Yes, but a /little/ deterrence prevents quite a lot
[05:03:39] <Dusk> because lazy
[05:04:30] <Halcyon_Starlight> The point Colgate is trying to make is tor master race or don't use irc.
[05:04:43] <Halcyon_Starlight> :P
