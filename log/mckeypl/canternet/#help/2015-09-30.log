[06:07:26] <Sakura> I've got my private IRC server set up. Is there a command I can use to send a test Global/Server-wide announcement message?
[06:08:20] <Colgate> /msg $* would send a global message on inspircd, this isn't really the channel for that though, try #techponies
[06:08:42] <Sakura> Alrighty. Thanks!

[22:06:32] <skk> lol
[22:06:33] <skk> sorry about that
[22:06:42] <skk> akalmand is in urdu
[22:06:49] <skk> which means intelligent
[22:07:05] <Colgate> we provide the services needed to block it, it is up to people to actually use them
[22:07:36] <skk> colgate can u set up a rule
[22:07:49] <skk> to limit the number of private msgs at the same time to users
[22:08:04] <skk> like in 2 seconds a user can receive three pms
[22:08:09] <skk> or just set a limit
[22:08:14] <skk> until some one close the private msg
[22:08:22] <skk> like 4 private
[22:08:22] <Colgate> that's not how IRC works
