[07:02:32] <RedHelper|AFK> What the command for ignore?
[07:05:26] <Colgate> /silence
[07:09:01] <RedHelper|AFK> Thank you Colgate
[07:24:26] <Dusk> <3
[07:24:30] <Dusk> who
[07:24:36] <Dusk> oh wrong buffer
[08:26:24] <Sakura> Don't tell me, RedHelper|AFK... Someone else bothering you now?
[08:43:25] <Finwe> Colgate: Is it client specific? Because I'm pretty sure that my IRC client uses /ignore.
[08:43:35] <Colgate> /silence is server side
[08:43:53] <Colgate> your client might have a /ignore or /silence function built in, I don't know
[08:44:01] <Finwe> Right.
[08:46:19] <Finwe> I'm using Irssi. It might require something like /quote silence <usermask>
[08:48:10] <Colgate> maybe, there are a lot of clients out there, I don't know how to do /silence commands on every single one of them
[08:51:47] <Finwe> Hmm, I didn't get the expected error message for giving /silence directly...
[08:52:13] <Finwe> Is there a way to unsilence as well?
[08:52:28] <Colgate> /silence +<hostmask> <flags>
[08:52:39] <Colgate> /silence -<hostmask> to remove
[08:54:09] <Finwe> Yes, thank you.
