[16:57:06] <Finwe> Joker: The port should probably have a preceding -p, but as 6667 is the default port for non-SSL connections, the port can be omitted as well.
[16:57:39] <Joker> he entered Finwe
[16:57:44] <Joker> thanks for your help
[16:57:50] <Joker> he used 6668 port 
[16:58:03] <Joker> i really appreciate your help
