[04:13:30] <Mort> So I did the  /msg NickServ identify with a space, and people saw my password. How can I change it?
[04:16:13] <Dusk> /ns setpass newpass
[04:16:15] <Colgate> /nickserv set password newpasshere
[04:16:21] <Dusk> oh
[04:16:24] <Dusk> whoops
[04:17:18] <Mort>  Invalid set command. Use /msg NickServ HELP SET for a command listing.
[04:17:38] <Colgate> uh, did you spell password correctly?
[04:17:40] <Dusk> use the first one
[04:17:59] <Colgate> /ns setpass is different and won't change your password
[04:18:00] <Mort> I got it working. Thanks a bunch
[04:18:04] <Dusk> it won't?
[04:18:15] <Colgate> no, it is for using after /ns sendpass
[04:18:19] <Colgate> /ns help setpass
[04:18:20] <Dusk> hm
[04:18:25] <Colgate> 10:19:18:03 -- NickServ (NickServ@canternet.org): To set a new password if you know the current
[04:18:26] <Colgate> 10:19:18:03 -- NickServ (NickServ@canternet.org): password, use SET PASSWORD instead of SETPASS.
[04:18:28] <Dusk> got it
[04:18:37] <Dusk> not something I use often :p
[04:19:41] <Dusk> got it mixed up with the way I have to use resetpass on shadownet
[04:19:54] <Dusk> Should really get email set up there eventually
