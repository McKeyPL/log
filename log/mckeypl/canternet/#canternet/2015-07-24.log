[00:30:55] <CloudChaser> i believe is something that goes in the face to hide identity :I
[00:34:25] <KhorneFlakes> I'm looking for a way to use about 70-ish gigabytes of internet bandwidth in two days.
[00:35:06] <KhorneFlakes> Where I live, we pay for X gigabytes of bandwidth per month, but we're well below that quota so far.
[00:42:22] <KhorneFlakes> Currently watching X-Files on Netflix, and Rick and Morty on download.
[00:42:40] <KhorneFlakes> 90's tv is surprisingly good.

[02:34:40] <KhorneFlakes> For some reason, when I try to autojoin this server, I keep getting this error: " Connection failed (unable to get local issuer certificate.? (20))"
[02:35:02] <KhorneFlakes> When I type "/server irc.canternet.org", however, it works fine.
[02:35:14] <KhorneFlakes> Anyone have a clue what's going on?
[02:35:30] <KhorneFlakes> Autojoining the other servers goes by without a hitch.
