[00:58:41] <KhorneFlakes> What do you suppose would happen if there was an earthquake on canterlot? Would the castle still stay floating up in the air, supported with whatever architectural magic is keeping it up right now?
[00:59:03] <KhorneFlakes> Or would it collapse into rubble like everything else around the peak of the mountain.
[00:59:24] <KhorneFlakes> Assuming that most of the mountain just suddenly turns to rubble and gets spread around.
[00:59:34] <KhorneFlakes> Which... isn't really how earthquakes work. At all.
