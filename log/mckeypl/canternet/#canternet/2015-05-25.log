[06:40:18] <texasboykc09> Colgate, what caused the netsplits this morning?
[06:40:47] <Colgate> bad route between the optimal path
[06:41:38] <texasboykc09> ok, so it caused servers to disconnect for each other?
[06:42:05] <Colgate> yes, high packet loss along that path
[06:42:19] <Colgate> so it had to be rerouted to a different server
[06:42:41] <texasboykc09> what would cause that to happen?
[06:44:01] <Colgate> any numerous things that cause packet loss on the internet
[06:44:26] <texasboykc09> yeah, thats true
[06:45:01] <Colgate> best we can do is work around that when it comes up
