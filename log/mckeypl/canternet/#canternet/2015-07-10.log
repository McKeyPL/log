[00:02:58] <LunaticHell> It's only natural to get angry faced with such actions.
[00:08:02] <Sakura> It's natural to be calm & angry at the same time as well.
[00:16:55] <Shutter> Eh, people do it to provoke a reaction. Best reaction is to shrug and wait for it to blow over.
[00:17:12] *** Joins: Lunia (ellen@ChumPony.Enterprises)
[00:17:12] <Lunia> I got some news on recent DDoS'es. It wasn't me.
[00:21:53] * Sakura slap Lunia
[00:21:56] <Sakura> It was Youuuuuuuu
[00:26:30] <Lunia> neey
[00:26:39] <Shutter> *Neigh
[01:23:55] <Asis> Eh. Well who ever preformed the attack is an idot.
[01:24:13] <LunaticHell> Saku: this sounds earily like something I read in "Art of War".
[01:24:16] <Asis> He never attempted to hide his tracks...
[01:24:45] <LunaticHell> I heared he's doing it from someplace in germany.
[01:24:57] <LunaticHell> I feel bad for my country to have such people in it.
[01:25:05] <Asis> He isn't :L
[01:25:37] <LunaticHell> I still feel bad for my country, but to be fair, for other reasons. o3o
[01:26:05] <Asis> Eh. Germany is great place to be.
[01:26:23] <Asis> Just had a bad history... And people try to recreate it a lot :L
[01:27:02] <LunaticHell> A country that did not ask their people for the euro nor for joining the EU, so yeah...they did not really learn from history, did they now?
[01:27:42] <Asis> No one looks back at history. So yea. Even us here in the U.S learned nothing when we went into a great depression.
[01:27:48] <Asis> And here we are almost goinging into one again.
[01:28:53] <LunaticHell> Also we have the "European Arrest Warrant", which is a lot of...bull. o3o
[01:29:21] <Asis> .-.
[01:29:52] <LunaticHell> If used by vicious elements of governments, it would be like Gitmo on steroids.
[01:30:50] <Asis> Hehe..
[01:31:15] <Asis> In the U.S. We just got one of our war flags taken down for "racism"
[01:32:05] <LunaticHell> tl;dr: I, as German who always lived only in Germany, could go into a prison in some eastern europe country on the bases that I look like a criminal, meaning I could sit in a jail up to 2 years BEFORE I see a judge.
[01:32:21] <Asis> o-o
[01:32:49] <Asis> We don't have that. We have the right to a speed trial (meaning we are put into court before thrown in prison.)
[01:32:56] <LunaticHell> And yes, this did happen to a UK citizen.
[01:33:14] <Asis> o-o"
[01:34:06] <LunaticHell> Imagine the power if someone would weaponize this law against his opposition.
[01:34:33] <Asis> It's like corruption all over again
[01:35:10] <LunaticHell> The corruption has never turely gone, to begin with. 
[01:36:31] <LunaticHell> I, for one, would never trust governments with such a law, even if they say they won't missuse it, the opportunity is just too tempting.
[01:37:04] <Asis> Kinda like we agreed to never go into nuclear warfare.
[01:37:21] <Asis> But now we are threatening others for "terrorism" and aiming nukes at people .-.
[01:42:47] <LunaticHell> A-bombs are not the biggest thing in our arsenal, no more.
[01:45:34] <LunaticHell> I know of 3 M.I.R.V. armed with nuclear warheads, 1 would be enough to destroy europe, or at least erase the seats of power in one go.
[01:45:53] <LunaticHell> All three are in posession of the U.S.A.
[01:47:30] <Asis> Yeeep
[01:47:37] <Asis> And we just keep threatening people with them :L
[01:56:07] <LunaticHell> Not to mention hydrogen bombs, aka "thermonuclear warheads".
[01:59:32] <Asis> yeee.
[01:59:44] <LunaticHell> detonating an H-Bomb is equal to creating a small sun.
[01:59:57] <LunaticHell> No, literally.
[02:00:25] <LunaticHell> It's powered by the fusion of hydrogen atoms, the same way the sun produces energy.
[02:01:29] <LunaticHell> If instead an A-Bomb a H-Bomb hit nagasaki, this city and sourrounding cities wouldn't exist, anymore.
[02:02:56] <Asis> yeea
[02:03:09] <Asis> My chem teacher was talking about that.
[02:20:03] <LunaticHell> I'd rather this power used in a fusion reactor, supplying cities...nay countires with all the energy they need.

[02:22:45] <Nedemai> They are still working on sustaining the reaction.
[02:22:56] <Nedemai> I bet they have managed it already >.>
[02:26:48] <LunaticHell> They, too, have to calculate gains and losses from forwarding this kind of technology.
[02:27:52] <LunaticHell> If they had this amazing technology to produce massive amounts of energy, for what excuse would they keep the oil price at the same level?
[02:29:03] <Nedemai> I think its wrong to hold out. Omg it will screw the economy. Who cares? World needs some remodeling anyhow.
[02:29:21] <LunaticHell> Indeed.
[02:29:59] <LunaticHell> Technology that benifits humanity should always be primary subject of research.
[02:31:22] <LunaticHell> We can worry about new war toys AFTER we came up with a plan to support humanity with clean water, nutricious food, a place to live, electricity...the basics, really.
[02:31:40] <LunaticHell> By that I mean ALL of humanity, of course.
[02:32:29] <Nedemai> World needs to stop thinking in country states and start thinking more globally. Not saying to throw out all the beautiful cultures we have, more just... find common ground. Realize we only have this one planet. But eh, some people will think Im just some idealistic hippie fool.
