[15:28:06] <BlackCat> what even is that?
[15:28:16] <BlackCat> Also sounds like a #Help question?
[15:28:47] <DinkyDoo> It tells you when people use the Whois command on you.
[15:29:05] <BlackCat> It might be an IRC operator only command on this network 
[15:30:50] <DinkyDoo> Can I find a operator then?
[15:31:02] <BlackCat> I hope so lol

[22:08:18] <DinkyDoo> Huh?
[22:10:08] <AppleDash> DinkyDoo: Type /join #help, look at the window in your IRC client that opens named "#help", and click on that one instead of the one that says "#canternet" whenever you want to ask a question.
[22:11:18] <DinkyDoo> then whats the point of the channel?
[22:11:45] <AppleDash> This is supposed to be a general chat channel, but if you can't tell, it isn't working.
