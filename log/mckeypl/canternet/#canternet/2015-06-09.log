[01:13:24] <popeye> yes hello
[01:13:30] <incog> yes, hello
[01:13:34] <incog> welcome to my network
[01:13:51] <popeye> * Topic for #Canternet set by Colgate!rabbit@brushie.horse
[01:13:58] <popeye> nice domain name
[01:19:55] <Dusk> fucking incog
[01:20:15] <incog> what did i do now
[01:20:18] <Dusk> nothing
[01:20:21] <Dusk> I've not seen you in awhile
[01:20:39] <incog> everywhere on this net is treating me like a war criminal
[01:20:47] <Dusk> I'm not :P
[01:21:34] <incog> <Sakura> Yeah, you don't know the story about incog. He's this guy from a troll group that used to come on the network.
[01:21:34] <incog> <Sakura> Actually a network legend.
[01:21:34] <incog> <Zuthal> Gay Nigger Association of America, according to google.
[01:21:34] *** incog was kicked by cadance.canternet.org (Channel flood triggered (limit is 4 lines in 5 secs))
[01:21:34] *** Joins: incog (stillfree@Pony-qa037p.cable.virginm.net)
[01:21:55] <incog> <Sakura> He was banned from the network I'm assuming.
[01:21:55] <incog> <Sakura> I think Selina & Misha can shed some light on this. We've all been around before he was kicked off the network.
[01:21:55] <incog> <Sakura> At least the only ones I knew in this chat at the time.
[01:22:38] <Dusk> "maybe he learned how to hack someone else's internet"
[01:22:44] <Dusk> yes that is totally how it works
[01:22:46] <popeye> im here for horse-related chats
[01:22:57] <popeye> have i come to the right place?
[01:23:01] <Dusk> Yes
[01:23:27] *** Dusk is now known as AppleDash
[01:26:05] <SilverSpeed> lel
[01:26:07] <Sakura> I find it surprising you're back, incog. Did you miss this network too much?
[01:26:53] <incog> somebody made me nostalgic, so i decided to connect
[01:27:02] <incog> chanserv didnt like it in many channels
[01:27:19] <incog> lots of vesitgal bans
[01:27:27] <Sakura> I noticed.
[01:28:33] <Sakura> I thought you were permanently Z-lined for awhile there until you surprised us by returning.
[01:29:14] <incog> i was never permanently Z-lined

[01:29:42] <popeye> hello Pi
[01:29:43] <popeye> do i know you
[01:29:45] <popeye> from somewhere
[01:30:04] <incog> i was everything from akilled to zlined but none of them stuck, the entire alphabet of oper abuse
[01:30:09] <Pi> Boop
[01:30:29] <Pi> Neverfree, I guess.
[01:31:27] <popeye> no not that
[01:31:35] <incog> wrong pi
[01:31:43] <popeye> there was a furry that hung out on IRC with us a long time ago also named Pi
[01:31:56] <Pi> eep
[01:32:03] <Pi> Doesn't sound like me
[01:32:45] <incog> you're thinking of the anthrochat owner
[01:33:04] <popeye> i see
[01:33:20] <popeye> who knows i thought maybe he became a horse lover
[01:43:14] <AppleDash> I like that, incog
[01:43:20] <AppleDash> Everything from akilled to z:lined
[01:44:20] <incog> for a while i was fascinated in watching a subsection of your fandom, the tulpa crew
[01:44:40] <incog> they moved off rizon it seems

[01:52:17] <incog> yeah, tulpa.info
[01:52:53] <incog> during my stay there i noticed they have their own set of trolls that came from rizon
[01:53:54] <Colgate> not surprising, trolling is everywhere on the internets
[01:54:07] *** Joins: Zuzu (zuzu@Pony-3eecki.eastlink.ca)
[01:54:57] <incog> it seems to be on a decline, the narative is changing to a more feelings based internet
[01:55:45] <incog> i still cannot tell if that is a counter-culture to it or a genuine push for social justice
[01:56:00] <incog> attribution on the internet is hard
[01:56:54] <incog> seems like ponychat is still around too
[01:57:18] <Ashfire> yep
[01:57:46] <popeye> trolling comes and goes in cycles, like plankton blooms or republican presidents
[01:59:32] <popeye> eventually trolling reaches a point where entire communities seem to be saturated with ironic shitposting and collapse
[02:00:04] <incog> or metatrolls like arab
[02:01:11] <popeye> being deceptive by nature, the cutting edge of trolling may mutate to the point where it appears to be anti-trolling
[02:01:13] <popeye> but dont be fooled
[02:02:24] <incog> that is why i suspect the fyad drive sjw push
[02:02:34] <incog> same techniques, different angle
[02:02:44] <incog> driven*
[02:03:40] <incog> gotta admire how well it has worked for them, oppose and you lose
[02:05:19] <incog> that confused me for a second, tulpa.info refuses any connections with stillfree or the nick incog as bad info
[02:06:32] <incog> so how has the fandom being doing, it seemed like it was in decline when i moved on
[02:06:41] <incog> is it still growing?
[02:08:20] <popeye> i dont have the nostalgia glasses
[02:08:35] <popeye> since i wasnt involved until early 2014
[02:08:53] <popeye> i think a lot of people in this fandom think 2011-2012 were golden years
[02:13:15] <incog> looks like anybody using my nick on rizon is still autoshunned, oddly enough despite moving to their own network, the tulpa.info guys moved their channel back to rizon
[02:15:22] <Colgate> it is always in the decline, all fandoms are in the decline :P

[05:18:26] <incog> im chatting in #tulpa.mods now
[05:19:03] <texasboykc09> incog, how have you been?
[05:19:26] <incog> always interested me that there is a subculture intentionally trying to provoke DID in themselves
[05:19:45] <incog> been good, u?
[05:20:48] <texasboykc09> doing good
[05:21:59] <texasboykc09> incog, what do you mean about that?
[05:22:16] <incog> dissociative identity disorder
[05:22:32] <incog> attempting to split their own personalities
[05:23:18] <incog> that is, if its deeper than simply pretending to do it and rping based off that
[05:23:31] <incog> though there is no way to test this
[05:24:23] <texasboykc09> yep
[05:24:34] <incog> maybe a cMRI while they transition, there isnt much medical knowledge on this
[05:24:42] <incog> which is why its interesting to watch
