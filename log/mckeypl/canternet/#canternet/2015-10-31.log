[08:02:35] <Boss> Ugh, what an ugly user interface.
[08:05:34] <Dawn> Sure
[08:05:38] <Dawn> The server is on
[08:05:55] <Boss> Don't be a wise ass. It's unbecoming of a mother.
[08:06:19] <Dawn> ^^
[08:06:31] <Dawn> You asked and I answered :p
[08:06:35] <Boss> Ow, I accidentally punched a stool trying to stretch.
[08:06:39] <Dawn> oh dear
[08:06:41] <Boss> ANYWAY
[08:06:46] <Boss> To the topic at hand.
[08:07:16] <Boss> I was having a good day today. And then shortly after you left for the first time and I ate dinner, I realised some rather grave news had been delivered to me while I was at work.
