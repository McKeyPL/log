[05:58:49] <RedHelper> Hello Warrior98
[05:58:51] <Warrior98> Do you know about secter 51??
[05:59:00] <RedHelper> About what?
[05:59:09] <Warrior98> And what is this place?
[05:59:24] * RedHelper shrugs
[05:59:27] <Colgate> it is an irc channel
[05:59:41] <Colgate> there are many of them out there, but you are in this one
[05:59:43] <Warrior98> irc? channel??
[05:59:54] <Warrior98> Where the hell am I?
[06:00:06] <Colgate> yoyu are now entering, the twilight zone
[06:00:21] <Warrior98> Ha! seriously
[06:00:32] <Colgate> https://canternet.org/
[06:00:55] <Warrior98> I stumble upon this site, I don't know why anymore
[06:01:53] <Warrior98> But it looks like a catering system, connecting from US to foregn countries
[06:02:43] *** Quits: ColonThree (WebChat@Pony-bdo45j.bredband.comhem.se) (Quit: Page closed)
[06:03:27] <Warrior98> So this site is an international chat system?
[06:03:50] <Colgate> it is an IRC network for my little pony
[06:04:16] <Warrior98> ok... I think I understand now
[06:05:08] <Warrior98> Is this worked by people? Or machines??
[06:05:32] <Colgate> what?
[06:06:01] <Warrior98> Are you a reading system? A machine?
[06:06:18] <Warrior98> Or a living human being?
[06:06:20] <Colgate> a machine of flesh and bone
[06:06:35] <Warrior98> .....
[06:06:55] <Warrior98> That don't sound good
[06:06:56] <Colgate> is this a turing test? am I passing?
[06:07:23] <Warrior98> What the fuck are you? I'm getting confused
[06:08:34] <Warrior98> Is there a person I can talk to? Or are we too facinated by machinery?
[06:08:43] <Colgate> I am pixels on your screen, nothing more, nothing less
[06:08:56] <Warrior98> ??
[06:09:30] <Warrior98> Your a machine.... you ain't real
[06:09:49] <Warrior98> I see it in your textline
[06:10:45] <Colgate> :(
[06:10:58] <Colgate> could a machine express sadness in the form of an emoticon?
[06:11:05] <Warrior98> Or.....are you messing with me
[06:11:28] <Warrior98> In my lifetime......no, machines don't live

[06:13:47] <Lapsus> ooh, ooh, can I be a machine?
[06:13:54] <Warrior98> HA! I did

[06:14:47] <Colgate> I like things
[06:14:57] <Warrior98> What things? I need detail
[06:15:06] <Lapsus> What do you want to talk about? :p
[06:15:18] <AppleDash> You've already been told
[06:15:34] <Warrior98> What is this place? And why is it here?
[06:15:35] <Lapsus> the only thing that anyone has in common on this network is a shared enjoyment or hatred of MLP
[06:16:27] <Warrior98> Soo.....
[06:16:29] <Lapsus> Warrior98: have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat maybe
[06:16:46] <Lapsus> This is a chat network, one of many
[06:16:56] <Lapsus> it's got some people on it who talk about whatever
[06:17:56] <Warrior98> Ok... just a chat area. I got it
[06:19:34] <Warrior98> How long has this been here?
[06:19:50] <Lapsus> to be precise about it, you're in the lobby channel of the network
[06:20:06] <Lapsus> do /list and you should get a list of the channels on the network
[06:20:21] *** RedHelper is now known as RedHelper|Sad
[06:21:21] <Warrior98> I have 1 thing in mind.....
[06:21:49] <Lapsus> I hope it's not spamming all the larger channels
[06:21:55] <Lapsus> we already had someone do that today
[06:21:55] <Lapsus> :p
[06:22:49] <Warrior98> hmm..... I'm not into spamming, but into.....hacking
[06:23:21] <Lapsus> you'll probably want #techponies for that kind of thing

[06:24:06] <Lapsus> What :v
[06:24:13] <Lapsus> Use IRC instead of war?
[06:24:31] <Warrior98> No, use IRC INTO war
[06:25:20] <Warrior98> Call me crazy, but this is who I am, its how I live
[06:26:56] <Warrior98> On a technical level, I could use this to fight "Terrorists". Just need the right system
[06:27:38] <Warrior98> Did I loose anypony?
[06:29:03] <Dusk> I mean I used IRC on my ship...it's fairly common for departments to have their own IRC servers and stuff in the navy

[06:41:47] <Dusk> If you're connected to the internet
[06:41:49] <Dusk> anywhere
[06:42:01] <Dusk> as long as you're not banned you can connect >.> that's how IRC works.
[06:42:12] <Warrior98> ok, Dusk...where are you from?
[06:42:18] <Esis|Tanks> You are connected from everywhere.
[06:42:19] <Dusk> the US.
[06:42:27] <Warrior98> ok...which state
[06:42:28] <Dusk> but I'm connected from france.
[06:42:43] <Dusk> GA.
[06:42:48] <Warrior98> oh, ok
[06:43:33] <Warrior98> Can anyone/anypony else answer my questions?
[06:44:17] <Dusk> most people don't openly give out their location

[06:45:36] <Warrior98> I know, but better safe than sorry, right??
[06:45:43] <Dusk> Not really
[06:45:46] <Dusk> not in this case.
[06:45:52] <Warrior98> ok
[06:46:02] <Warrior98> I like this
[06:46:06] <Lapsus> If you ask for locations you're going to get silly answers.

[06:47:19] <Esis|Tanks> Eh. But yes, Dusk is right. This IRC is connected everywhere.

[06:49:28] <Warrior98> ;)
[06:49:30] <Dusk> ...what does that mean
[06:50:19] <Warrior98> If you interrupt everyday BS from people, and bring what is free. You could actually change the world

[07:12:47] <Esis> Oh btw Dusk, is it true that they are going to add a new branch to the military of the U.S?
[07:12:57] <Dusk> Whereas a steam explosion of a melting reactor core only spreads a light amount of radiation over a localized area
[07:12:57] <Esis> OR are they bsing me ;-;
[07:13:04] <Dusk> Esis: wat
[07:13:14] <Dusk> if anything they'll drop a brance
[07:13:23] <Esis> I heard they were going to move to
[07:13:26] <Dusk> no
[07:13:29] <Esis> cyber warfare. And open a branch on it.
[07:13:33] <Esis> :L
[07:13:34] <Dusk> No...
[07:13:41] <Esis> ALL MY LIFE IS A LIE
[07:13:41] <Dusk> That's called the NSA :v
[07:13:49] <Esis> Oh well.
[07:13:51] <Warrior98> Navy, Army, & Air Force already do that
[07:13:53] <Esis> We meet again enemy.
[07:13:59] <Dusk> Warrior98 is correct
[07:14:01] <Warrior98> NSA too
[07:14:25] <Esis> Eh.
[07:14:46] <Esis> I'll just be a pocket progy.
[07:15:31] <Warrior98> Has anyone ever tried to be soo reasourful it became hell?
[07:15:41] <Warrior98> reasourceful*
[07:15:48] <Esis> For me, yes .-.
[07:16:03] <Warrior98> what was it like?
[07:16:17] <Esis> Well my mentality degraded. And I felt used.
[07:16:17] <Esis> ;-;
[07:16:44] <Warrior98> ok.... do you claim "feeling" for yourself?
[07:16:58] <Warrior98> Cuase I don't
[07:17:08] <Esis> Erm. Not really... Since I lost all emotions due to it ;-;
[07:17:24] <Warrior98> I lost mine due to loving war
[07:17:52] <Esis> Eh.
[07:17:58] * Esis plops on Dusk
[07:18:10] <Warrior98> B-)
[07:18:30] * Dusk hugs Esis
[07:18:48] <Warrior98> *catches an idea*
[07:19:17] <Warrior98> Hey! why not use "love and tolerance" to solve problems?
[07:20:09] <Warrior98> hehehe
[07:20:33] * Esis hugs the dusk and boops
[07:20:44] <Esis> But in order to have peace in the world. You must fight it..
[07:20:52] <Esis> *fight for it.
[07:20:57] <Warrior98> Exactly my point
[07:21:08] <Warrior98> to have peace, you need war
[07:21:09] * Esis has been playing to much metal gear games.
[07:21:10] <Esis> ;-;
