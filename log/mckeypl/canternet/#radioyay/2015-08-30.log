[18:36:06] <McKey> hi Xenmen
[18:36:15] <Xenmen> hej McKey ~
[19:10:32] <Lunia> wilkommen Xenmen
[19:11:11] <Lunia> ich bin ein pferd
[19:12:05] <Xenmen> danke Lunia
[19:12:14] <Xenmen> ego equus est
[19:12:38] <Xenmen> fratres sumus!
[19:12:58] <Lunia> wabbi bowwy wabbidy doo?
[19:13:07] <Xenmen> Lunia, Latin :P
[19:13:19] <Xenmen> I studied Latin a little
[19:13:22] <Lunia> Gibberish :P
[19:13:28] <Lunia> cool :D
[19:13:39] <Lunia> I like latin :D
[19:13:41] <Xenmen> "I am a horse! We are brothers!"
[19:14:01] <Lunia> im not your brother xD
[19:15:45] <Xenmen> How are things in the north? We have wildfires and power outages over here in western Canada
[19:17:28] <Lunia> We have sunny weather and occasional rain :3
[19:18:09] <Lunia> and I think Canada is far more north then denmark
[19:18:16] <Xenmen> better than Ukraine X]
[19:18:23] <Lunia> xD
[19:18:37] <Xenmen> hm; the northernmost parts of Canada reach the arctic, but almost the entire population lives just above the USA border
[19:18:56] <Lunia> Greenland belongs to denmark
[19:20:01] <Xenmen> hm; I thought they had their own elections and such
[19:20:24] <Xenmen> is it treated as a province within Denmark or is there autonomy
[19:20:28] <Lunia> I dont know, 
[19:20:41] <Lunia> -ish
[19:21:37] <Lunia> Hens island is ours
[19:21:57] <Lunia> Hans*
[19:22:07] <Xenmen> XD http://freehansisland.com/
[19:22:08] <Derpi> [ Free Hans Island ] - freehansisland.com
[19:22:41] <Xenmen> [For many years now, the Canadian military has systematically invaded the Danish territory of Hans Island. In doing so, Canada have demonstrated a total disregard for international treaties. Despite repeated pleas for peace, Canada has not shown any remorse on the matter. Because of this, we demand that Canada is excluded from NATO, and apologize to the people of Denmark for their repeated offences.]
[19:22:52] <Xenmen> [The Danish navy has suffered no casualties in the struggle for Hans Island. Canadian losses are unknown, but are at least equal, possibly higher.]
[19:22:54] <Xenmen> this is great

[19:24:30] <Derpi> [ Stephen Harper is Adolf Hitler (Canada) - YouTube ] - www.youtube.com
[19:24:53] <Lunia> I moved to canada like 6 months ago. This place is weird
[19:25:02] <Xenmen> (Really though, Harper is not a good man for Canada. . . it's just every other candidate is much worse)
[19:25:12] <Lunia> I got free milkshakes for a month
[19:25:21] <Xenmen> Lunia, there are many regions in Canada, and each is like a different country
[19:26:27] <Xenmen> the gulf islands are their own little world, and the greater vancouver area is its own world, the Okanagan region of BC is its own world, northern BC is its own world, and that's just one province!
[19:26:33] <Xenmen> are you in Ontario Lunia ?
[19:27:03] <Lunia> fuuck
[19:27:15] <Lunia> I meant to say I moved to Denmark
[19:27:19] <Xenmen> XD
[19:27:29] <Lunia> Mind drifted away
[19:27:40] <Xenmen> Canada, Denmark, what's the difference~
[19:27:45] <Lunia> yeaa
[19:28:26] <Lunia> If you say so >.>
[19:29:35] <Xenmen> I moved around ~5 months ago to the Okanagan region in BC
[19:30:09] <Xenmen> there's no good programming work here, so I'm retraining for HVAC
[19:30:35] <Lunia> I see, WHere you lived before
[19:30:36] <Lunia> ?
[19:30:50] <Xenmen> Burnaby; it's a town beside Vancouver
[19:31:15] <Xenmen> both have grown so large, there's just a street going between them called Boundary St
[19:31:24] <Xenmen> they're separate in name only
[19:31:44] <Lunia> So.. you are a canadian horse?

[19:33:37] <Xenmen> yup, that's Canada right now
[19:34:29] <Xenmen> I. . . have a slightly different solution for the employment problem than most though: https://hackaday.io/project/6148-project-eden

[19:34:45] <Xenmen> Automated food production!
[19:35:28] <Xenmen> Saskatchewan pirates, this is hilarios XD
[19:35:34] <Xenmen> it's right
[19:37:52] <Xenmen> I've not gone to bronycan; even when it happened in Vancouver, I was too broke
[19:38:11] <Xenmen> I think there was a season 3 showing in Chilliwack where a bunch of bronies met, my friend went to that
[19:38:50] <Lunia> I havent been to any cons really
[19:38:55] <Lunia> one kinda
[19:41:38] <Xenmen> I find it's more fun to meet people incidentally
[19:43:36] <Lunia> happen few times. I was once walking with my brony friend throuhg the forest in the middle of nowhere and another brony appeared out of nowhere
[19:43:58] <Xenmen> I custom printed a shirt with this: https://derpibooru.org/62752
[19:43:59] <Derpi> [ #62752 - armor, artist:averagedraw, power armour, powered exoskeleton, purity seal, safe, trixie, warhammer 40k - Derpibooru - My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Imageboard ] - derpibooru.org
[19:44:03] <Lunia> Talk about random encounters
[19:44:30] <Xenmen> well, it's more likely there than here
[19:44:42] <Xenmen> you could walk for months here and never see a sign of humanity
[19:45:11] <Xenmen> and probably more people there take walks. . . in the cities here, people only drive
[19:45:52] <Xenmen> ever have that happen in the city? (random meetings, from people overhearing you or seeing clothing)
[19:46:44] <Lunia> I have tshirt with gamer Luna lying on the steam logo
[19:46:51] <Lunia> yeah
[19:47:30] <Xenmen> ^I was wearing that trixie w40k shirt, and walked into a Games Workshop store
[19:47:41] <Xenmen> no one said a thing, no one even looked X]
[19:47:51] <Lunia> I once went to visit someone and he showed me his pony collection
[19:47:57] <Xenmen> almost anywhere else it was recognized though
[19:47:57] <Lunia> I has no idea
[19:48:05] <Xenmen> huge collection?
[19:48:07] <Lunia> xDD
[19:48:14] <Lunia> not really
[19:48:25] <Lunia> but neither is mine
[19:49:03] <Xenmen> I don't have much space, so I only collect digital art, but people keep giving me ponies X]
[19:49:22] <Xenmen> I only have ~6 but half of them are plush
[19:50:13] <Lunia> haha
[19:50:24] <Lunia> I have like 30
[19:50:35] <Lunia> and ther stuff
[19:50:44] <Lunia> Im also pony artist
[19:53:33] <Xenmen> I was working on a nintendo DS homebrew game some years back, I stopped before I heard of things like Patreon because it'd take hundreds of hours
[19:53:51] <Lunia> heh
[19:54:10] <Xenmen> Pony Party DS, like mario party, but with pone
[19:54:25] <Xenmen> I decided it'd be easier to work on music https://xenmen.bandcamp.com/album/company-of-friends
[19:54:27] <Derpi> [ Company of Friends | Xenmen ] - xenmen.bandcamp.com
[19:54:27] <Lunia> I dont know mario party
[19:54:50] <Xenmen> (the art there was from a friend's attempt to make art for the DS game, he couldn't get the eyes right so he got mad and made them all black X] )
[19:55:09] <Xenmen> it's. . . a collection of minigames people play together
[19:55:21] <Lunia> aah
[19:55:25] <Xenmen> and there's usually a virtual boardgame everyone plays on
[19:56:26] <Xenmen> he went off into the Fallout Equestria community: http://kingsquee.tumblr.com/post/82545470210/ideas-for-how-a-foe-game-could-look
[19:56:27] <Derpi> [ in which Kingsley ] - kingsquee.tumblr.com
[19:57:02] <Lunia> I see
[19:57:45] <Xenmen> I've been meaning to go back and make a full album
[19:58:16] <Xenmen> ^music's a lot of fun if you like your tools
[19:58:27] <Xenmen> I was very frustrated with my tools until a year and a half ago
[19:58:51] <Xenmen> I finally found some art tools I like too; bamboo + Krita
[19:59:03] <Xenmen> gimp is great, Sai is pretty neat
[19:59:07] <Xenmen> but krita is amazing
[20:22:43] <Lunia> I use sai
[20:23:44] <Xenmen> ^Sai really fits certain styles better than the other tools
[20:23:59] <Lunia> true
[20:24:13] <Xenmen> I'm still impressed what that guy managed to do
[20:24:20] <Xenmen> but he's afraid of Adobe patents
[20:24:34] <Xenmen> Poland doesn't recognize software patents though :B
[20:24:44] <Xenmen> it's the perfect place to develop software
[20:25:08] <Xenmen> you don't need to be afraid of corporate lawsuits over implementing "slide to unlock"
[20:25:32] <Xenmen> the Sai developer said he didn't get certain Layer features implemented because Adobe has a patent on them
[20:26:44] <Lunia> patents are bullshit
[20:27:38] <Xenmen> I don't think any justification for them holds water
[20:28:01] <Xenmen> patents impose a tax on development
[20:28:06] <Lunia> you can pretty much pattent wheel
[20:28:07] <Xenmen> an exponential tax
[20:28:36] <Xenmen> a lawyer patented a "method of swinging on a tree swing", with his son, to teach him about filing patents
[20:28:48] <Xenmen> the whole system is a joke
[20:29:12] <Lunia> yep ^^
