[04:53:35] <dGr8LookinSparky> the Tremulous.net forums are being invaded by spam bots btw
[05:03:11] <scv> its never enough with you people
[05:06:15] <dGr8LookinSparky> on the plus side, the forums are more active
[05:12:18] <your_face> deleted. man it feels good to be a moderator again and helping keep the forums safe. i realize what a vital element of my life was missing this past week.
[05:12:34] <your_face> the feeling of emptiness was almost too much.
