[16:40:20] <xali> hi
[16:40:25] <xali> is the master server down?
[16:41:05] <xali> just compiled 1.2.0 and eager to play
[16:43:23] <xali> master.tremulous.net resolved to 109.237.26.52:30710
[16:43:24] <xali> 0 servers parsed (total 0)
[16:43:24] <xali> 0 servers listed in browser with 0 players.
[17:15:40] <xali> is tremulous dead or is there really no package with a 1.2 binary + .pk3 files?
[17:15:40] <xali> i compiled 1.2, took the data files from an rpm and still cant run trem because i dont have the vm in the pk3 file?
[17:19:23] <kharnov> how are you compiling a non-existent release
[17:19:26] <kharnov> or do you mean GPP
[17:21:39] <cu-kai> i'd just download the release client
[17:22:23] <cu-kai> xali, new-edge.org / we're still pretty active (though no players as of late)

[17:56:44] <xali> i compiled from git
[17:56:45] <xali> https://github.com/darklegion/tremulous
[17:57:09] <xali> which one is the release client? 1.1?
[18:00:19] <jkent> if you use git, you'd want to use the "gpp" branch (its compatible with gpp QVMs), *but* there are very few servers supporting protocol 71 at the moment, most servers are protocol 69 (1.1) and 70 (gpp)

[18:13:51] <xali> i compiled the gpp branch and it doesnt run either, "----- Client Shutdown (Client fatal crashed: VM_Create on UI failed) -----"
[18:13:51] <xali> when did it get so hard to run trem? i would even run a ded server to revive this great game!
[18:14:46] *** Joins: illwieckz (~illwieckz@unvanquished/developer/illwieckz)
[18:20:39] <jkent> you have the gpp assets as well as the 1.1 assets, correct?
