[05:50:55] <AbaddoN_7> is tremulous still alive?
[05:51:34] <dGr8LookinSparky> yes
[05:51:49] <AbaddoN_7> bah let me just spill the question i want to ask directly
[05:52:47] <AbaddoN_7> Now that Unreal engine 4 is free, any possibility of you know...
[05:52:57] <AbaddoN_7> Tremulous in Unreal Engine
[05:53:07] <AbaddoN_7> Please dont kill me, just curious
[05:56:43] <dGr8LookinSparky> Maybe, if someone is willing to do the work required.  But trem still has a lot of potential with ioquake3 imo
[05:58:31] <jkent> well, Murnatan is being developed with Unreal Engine 3... maybe they'll switch to 4?
[05:58:59] <AbaddoN_7> but just imagine it, i mean it feels like an opportunity wasted. I mean no offence to the original engine, but sometimes remakes or mods brign new life to an abandoned game
[06:00:12] <dGr8LookinSparky> ioquake3 had some updates relatively recently
[06:01:08] <AbaddoN_7> i agree, but still just a thought to throw
[06:01:09] <dGr8LookinSparky> http://discourse.grangerhub.com/t/trem-with-the-ioq3-gl2-renderer-pretty/422
[06:02:10] <dGr8LookinSparky> that is on a client that was compiled from the most recent code on github
[06:02:29] <AbaddoN_7> that specularity needs some tuning :D
[06:02:42] <AbaddoN_7> but good work, hard work actually
[06:03:42] <dGr8LookinSparky> like I said, there is potential
[06:04:27] <Stannum> what
[06:04:29] <AbaddoN_7> there is potential, there always was, just no one to expose to, just a community of dwindling fans :(
[06:04:35] <Stannum> murnatan switched to ue4
[06:04:37] <Stannum> right?
[06:05:13] <dGr8LookinSparky> GrangerHub is working on a new trem client and server

[20:35:56] <dGr8LookinSparky> be sure to not blindly run into a window room
[20:59:09] <kullervo> also maybe some other maps, unlit half built corridors and rooms with random boxes and construction equipment look just like filler locations
