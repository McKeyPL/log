[03:21:15] <kharnov> oh hey philh
[03:21:17] <kharnov> you're tremulant right
[03:21:35] <`Ishq> Trem limps on. GPP is dead and 1.1 is king.
[03:22:32] <kharnov> tremulous proper is going through the same death throes it's been going through for the last couple of years with a string of successive groups claiming they're going to restore it to some measure of glory while dealing with an eternally dwindling player base
[03:23:08] <kharnov> so basically the same old
[03:26:30] <dGr8LookinSparky> Tremulous lives for as long as anyone wants to work on it and play it.
[03:26:40] <kharnov> lol
[03:27:11] <kharnov> meet your friendly neighborhood cult leader over there
[03:27:47] <philh> hey kharnov
[03:27:48] <philh> and `Ishq
[03:27:54] <kharnov> hey man
[03:27:57] <kharnov> haven't seen you in ages
[03:28:12] <kharnov> what have you been up to
[03:28:43] <philh> the irc client's been gathering dust, for no particular reason, just haven't checked in
[03:28:47] <kharnov> ah
[03:28:59] <kharnov> it's been a while since we've last met

[03:29:40] <kharnov> you know, meis is still around
[03:29:44] <kharnov> sometimes i see cadynum
[03:30:12] <philh> in 1.1?
[03:30:30] <kharnov> no i don't play tremulous anymore
[03:30:34] <kharnov> i see them on IRC
[03:30:37] <philh> oh, irc, i see
[03:30:43] <kharnov> yes
[03:30:45] <philh> is unvanquished still a thing?
[03:30:52] <philh> i realise i could just google this
[03:30:57] <kharnov> haha yes
[03:31:02] <kharnov> we're just making another release tonight
[03:31:40] <philh> nice, how much has the play style diverged from gpp?
[03:31:45] <dGr8LookinSparky> It is highly populated (with bots)
[03:31:47] <kharnov> quite significantly
[03:35:04] <kharnov> so what brings you over here?
[03:35:05] <kharnov> nostalgia?
[03:36:06] <philh> oh, you've got norf onboard?
[03:36:20] <philh> guess so
[03:36:39] <kharnov> yes he's been helping out with gameplay
[03:36:50] <kharnov> has been for a while now anyway
[03:37:30] <kharnov> the project is still very much in alpha
[03:37:31] <philh> nice, so you can make unvanquished as unpopular as gpp ;)
[03:37:35] <kharnov> lol
[03:37:43] <kharnov> certainly seems to be working!
[03:37:57] <philh> heh
[03:38:13] <kharnov> the project is still very much in alpha
[03:38:20] <kharnov> it's not nearly as horribly unstable/broken as it used to be though
[03:38:36] <kharnov> i'm not going to put an official date or ETA on beta but we're not far from it, realistically speaking
[03:38:59] <kharnov> most models are already in-game, we've got our map pack done, and we're just waiting on finishing up the asset base and then we'll spend a couple months doing polishing
[03:39:01] <philh> that granger i spotted in the slideshow on the main page, that's a placeholder, right?
[03:39:12] <philh> the other assets are looking rather good
[03:39:30] <kharnov> it's not a placeholder
[03:39:33] <philh> might have to try and join a game sometime
[03:39:37] <philh> hmm
[03:39:58] <kharnov> i would imagine that it would be a somewhat divisive model considering how much people loved grangers on tremulous, myself included
[03:40:02] <philh> he doesn't look quite as nice as the rest, does he? or is it a bad photo?
[03:40:14] <kharnov> but you would figure that as the head of the old tremulous granger cult i would have some authority on grangers
[03:40:29] <kharnov> and i was very much involved with the design of that model
[03:40:42] <kharnov> i made sure it retained ALL SIX beady, black eyes
[03:40:48] <kharnov> hhhhhh
[03:41:02] <kharnov> also yes, probably a bad photo, i need to update the screenshots on that page, don't shoot me
[03:43:33] <philh> make it a bit more like this and you're on to a winner
[03:43:33] <philh> http://www.oxford-chiltern-bus-page.co.uk/upload031005/GS17%20at%20Amerhsam%20%20021005%20Chris%20Maxfield.jpg
[03:43:49] <kharnov> lol
[03:44:54] <kharnov> man it's been ages since we've last played together
[03:45:32] <kharnov> US Main is pretty much gone forever though
[03:45:37] <kharnov> the old crowd's gone off to whatever
[03:46:06] <kharnov> 1.1 is where the only tremulous games are and it's about as toxic as you remember it
[03:46:30] <kharnov> though, the new edge server (formerly of GPP) is about to do some pretty interesting things there
[03:47:29] <philh> that's rather sad, but yeah, the last few times i bothered to run gpp, us1 was conspicuous by its absence, replaced by bizarrely modded lolfests that make the experienced player physically sick
[03:47:51] <kharnov> yeah, most people have moved on with their lives
[03:47:54] <dGr8LookinSparky> http://tremulous.net/forum/index.php?topic=17521.0
[03:48:36] <kharnov> though, new edge has a coherent, interesting mod to check out
[03:50:11] <philh> but does the server hosting it primarily cycle through mario64 and challenge maps?
[03:50:19] <kharnov> i hope not
[03:51:39] <kharnov> christ i hated those maps
[03:51:45] <philh> will take a look, maybe
[03:51:58] <dGr8LookinSparky> Have you played on New Edge when it was on gpp kharnov ?  Do  you know the game play?
[03:52:36] <philh> do i need a new client for new-edge?
[03:52:40] <kharnov> nah
[03:52:44] <kharnov> just the stock trem one
[03:54:05] <dGr8LookinSparky> what are the main features that are in New Edge's 1.1 mod kharnov ?
[03:54:22] <kharnov> please go back to your corner
[03:54:47] <kharnov> philh, if you want to try out an unv game, come on a sunday, we have scheduled community games then
[03:55:24] <philh> hmm, i've just caught a glimpse of the classic granger and it makes the attempt to emulate it in unv even more disappointing, poor thing
[03:55:42] <philh> might do that sometime, at what hour generally?
[03:55:45] <kharnov> we didn't try to emulate it though
[03:56:00] <kharnov> i mean, in the sense that we didn't try to clone it
[03:56:00] <dGr8LookinSparky> kharnov , is their 1.1 mod starting from where they left off on gpp?
[03:56:03] <philh> it looks like a poor tribute
[03:56:10] <kharnov> we wanted to make it have a more armored appearance like our other aliens
[03:57:18] <philh> i mean, i don't want to reappear and be overwhelmingly negative about something you guys have put a load of time and energy into it, but that's just not fair on the classic granger :(
[03:57:25] <kharnov> i've pinged our channel bot:
[03:57:26] <kharnov> <Unvanquished> Community Game happens weekly, next date is Sunday, 2015-12-13, 20:00 UTC (in 6 days, 17 hours).
[03:57:53] <philh> cheers
[03:58:50] <kharnov> i'm fully aware that any attempt at a new granger model would be divisive because it isn't ever going to be the exact old tremulous one, but really, if we're fucked either way in that situation we might as well make it fit in with our other aliens
[03:59:08] <philh> http://www.groomsandvrooms.co.uk/images/cars/39-thumb.jpg
[03:59:22] <kharnov> yes. cars
[03:59:28] <kharnov> i agree
[03:59:42] <philh> maybe if it were less metallic
[03:59:53] <kharnov> try a raccoon: https://36.media.tumblr.com/a441227c8c1391cc036d5b98f0c5dc10/tumblr_nxlw02A40a1u0gwy7o1_540.jpg
[04:00:13] <dGr8LookinSparky> not green enough
[04:00:17] <philh> that would make a fine granger
[04:01:02] <kharnov> try another raccoon: http://i.imgur.com/XrPBi0o.jpg
[04:01:15] <kharnov> you don't have any of those in the UK do you
[04:02:36] <dGr8LookinSparky> here you go: http://www2.brevard.edu/jefrick/assets/raccoon1.jpg , no need to thank me
[04:03:50] <philh> our indigenous fauna is decidedly procyonid-deficient, i'm afraid
[04:04:13] <kharnov> that's upsetting
[04:04:20] <kharnov> i find them in garbage cans here all the time
[04:04:28] <kharnov> they also like to eat the local cat food
[04:05:02] <philh> but we're also lacking in the rabies dept. so it's not all bad
[04:05:25] <kharnov> there's this one morbidly obese raccoon i've seen waddling around in the trees by a row of houses and it spends every single day eating the cat food that people leave out for strays
[04:05:36] <kharnov> i hope i get a chance to pet it one day
[04:05:43] <kharnov> it doesn't look particularly vicious
[04:06:46] <philh> they're awfully appealing creatures
[04:07:03] <kharnov> yes, this one lady in the UK keeps them as pets and trains them to do various tricks
[04:07:09] <kharnov> https://www.instagram.com/melanieraccoon/
[04:07:37] <philh> i seem to recall a neighbour having some back in the 90s
[04:07:41] <kharnov> woah
[04:08:05] <kharnov> they're very charismatic little animals, and highly intelligent
[04:08:20] <kharnov> but at the same time they're very destructive and their great dexterity means they can really wreck your furniture
[04:08:31] <kharnov> so if anything you should keep them in a large enclosure outdoors
[04:08:47] <kharnov> that being said
[04:08:52] <kharnov> have you seen any interesting plants lately

[04:11:03] <kharnov> dunno, just recall you saw some skunk cabbage a while back
[04:12:06] <kharnov> man, i remember spending more time sitting on US Main admin chat than actually playing the game
[04:14:32] <philh> i don't recall seeing any noteworthy skunkcabbage, lysichiton's a bit dull and i've never seen symplocarpus in person
[04:15:13] <kharnov> i swear i recall you mentioning it

[05:43:05] <philh> meh, i miss so much from gpp
[05:43:39] <dGr8LookinSparky> what do you miss from gpp?
[05:45:34] <philh> the build system, health overlay, adv mara, etc
[05:46:35] <dGr8LookinSparky> the gpp vanilla build system was meh
[05:47:23] <dGr8LookinSparky> the spontaneous exploding unpowered human structures were so annoying
[05:48:23] <dGr8LookinSparky> the bp zone concept was not that great
[05:49:05] <philh> not having to deconstruct and wait for the build timer before moving your reactor was somewhat handy in small games with no semblance of teamwork, though
[05:52:39] <dGr8LookinSparky> check out the test7341 server, that is (GrangerHub's development server)  The game play started from where gpp left off, but we are in process of implementing the best stuff from both 1.1 and gpp game play (gpp did do some things better than 1.1 vanilla), along with some features from other 1.1 and gpp mods, and some new features.  It is still a work in progress and we are only about 1/5 of the way complete from where we want
[05:52:39] <dGr8LookinSparky>  the game play to be.
[05:53:40] <dGr8LookinSparky> at the moment the adv mara is still gpp (I don't think we will be changing that much if at all)
[05:54:47] <dGr8LookinSparky> we are probably going to be doing something completely new for the build system, still planning it though
[05:56:15] <dGr8LookinSparky> you can play on this server with any trem client (1.1 clients, gpp clients, and the new multiprotocol client that we will be releasing in the near future)
[05:57:33] <dGr8LookinSparky> we started changing the UI a bit, the HUD is mostly the same as gpp, but that will be changed a bit more.
[05:58:00] <dGr8LookinSparky> that is regarding the test7341 server
[05:58:51] <dGr8LookinSparky> poison/boosters were way better in gpp imo
[05:59:48] <dGr8LookinSparky> it is annoying in 1.1 vanilla that once you touch a booster, you have to wait until the poison timer runs out before replenishing
[06:00:05] <dGr8LookinSparky> and that you lose the poison when you evolve
[06:01:30] <dGr8LookinSparky> the retractable gpp cades were nice over the cades in 1.1 vanilla
[06:03:12] <dGr8LookinSparky> anyways, there is still a lot to go in the test7341 game play (at the moment it is unbalanced towards aliens), but it is still fun to play
[06:05:51] <dGr8LookinSparky> we have development games on that server on Thursdays and Saturdays: http://discourse.grangerhub.com/t/saturday-grangerhub-development-games/206 , http://discourse.grangerhub.com/t/thursday-grangerhub-development-games/892
[06:06:24] <dGr8LookinSparky> we are also in process of improving the map selection process and voting
[06:07:47] <dGr8LookinSparky> 1.1 vanilla servers leave much to be desired for voting and map selection, and gpp vanilla server weren't much better in that department (except with some bug fixes for voting)
