[06:01:10] <dibblego> where is the source hosted?
[06:01:29] <kharnov> the source for what
[06:01:32] <kharnov> tremulous?
[06:01:45] <kharnov> https://github.com/darklegion/tremulous
[06:02:06] <dibblego> yeah cheers
[06:02:10] <kharnov> there was an SVN repository but i don't think that's active anymore
[06:02:42] <kharnov> what're you looking to do with the source?
[06:04:04] <dibblego> just finding what variables to set, also just curious
[06:04:23] <kharnov> ah
[06:05:17] *** Quits: Stannum (~Robotroni@82-197-195-74.dsl.cambrium.nl) ()
[06:06:10] <kharnov> you're a haskell coder, going off your IRC handle?
[06:06:27] <dibblego> for work mostly, but I use a lot of different languages
[06:06:31] <kharnov> neat
[06:07:39] <kharnov> how'd you find out about tremulous
[06:07:50] <kharnov> have you already been playing it?
[06:09:27] <dibblego> been playing for years, found it under linux games one day when I was setting up a game machine for my childrebn
[06:09:37] <dibblego> we had a 5 year break until recently
[06:09:56] <kharnov> oh neat
[06:10:00] <kharnov> what name did you play under
[06:10:04] <kharnov> (in the past)
[06:10:38] <dibblego> the boys play on the internet servers, we have one on our LAN, I don't play on the internet ones
[06:11:03] <dibblego> amorris and poo LOL are the boys
[06:11:45] <kharnov> lol
[06:11:50] <kharnov> what's yours
[06:12:40] <dibblego> dad
[06:13:14] <kharnov> i don't think i ever saw you in-game
[06:13:17] <kharnov> where did you mostly play?
[06:13:55] <kharnov> back in the day, i started on 1.1 around 2007 and mostly played on the EBSF server, and then dretch storm
[06:14:04] <kharnov> then once GPP was released i played solely on US Main
[06:14:21] <dibblego> yeah I don't play outside the LAN really
[06:14:26] <kharnov> oh, that would make sense
[06:14:51] <kharnov> after US Main (and thus vanilla GPP) died off, i moved onto unvanquished with some other players
[06:14:56] <kharnov> i don't suppose you've heard of it?
[06:17:29] <dibblego> yeah just reading that page now
[06:17:37] <dibblego> for server variables
[06:17:47] <kharnov> what page
[06:17:52] <dibblego> the boys know where all the servers are
[06:18:03] <dibblego> http://forums.unvanquished.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1129
[06:18:03] <kharnov> unvanquished isn't a server, it's a separate project :P
[06:18:07] <dibblego> ah ok
[06:18:12] <dibblego> is it a fork?
[06:18:21] <kharnov> yes
[06:18:22] <kharnov> https://www.unvanquished.net/
[06:18:32] <kharnov> started a while ago
[06:19:00] <kharnov> you might be interested in our code, the engine's in the process of being rewritten from C to C++
[06:19:02] <kharnov> https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished
[06:19:28] <kharnov> you can also ask us things on #unvanquished-dev which would probably be a better place for questions about unvanquished than this channel :P

[13:58:20] <irgendwer4711> Timbo: could you help?
[13:58:28] <irgendwer4711> oh forgotten: on Linux
[14:26:12] <Ingar> weird
[14:26:31] <Ingar> but probably more a version conflict issue than an x64 issue
[14:26:40] <irgendwer4711> I think not.
[14:27:42] <irgendwer4711> someone suggested this: ./tremulous.x86 +set fs_basepath /usr/local/games/tremulous
[14:27:45] <Ingar> you're running trem on reactos ?
[14:27:54] <irgendwer4711> no, on Linux
[14:27:58] <Ingar> k ;)
[14:28:04] <irgendwer4711> why
[14:28:16] <Ingar> your cloak
[14:28:19] <irgendwer4711> yes
[14:28:35] <Ingar> things aside
[14:28:39] <Ingar> that's the 32bit binary
[14:29:04] <Ingar> what are you running exactly ?
[14:29:12] <irgendwer4711> Ubuntu 15.04
[14:29:29] <Ingar> is it the tremulous from the ubuntu repo?
[14:29:39] <irgendwer4711> no, there arent any
[14:29:43] <Ingar> k
[14:29:59] <irgendwer4711> I saw it for 12 but not for 15
[14:30:18] <Ingar> the ubuntu package always was a bit iffy
[14:30:49] <Ingar> so, what package are you running? 1.1? gpp?
[14:30:56] <Ingar> from the trem website or somewhere else ?
[14:31:04] <irgendwer4711> 1.1 from HP
[14:31:43] <irgendwer4711> the error comes inside the game
[14:34:17] <Ingar> doesn't seem like I have "recent" 1.1 binaries around
[14:35:05] <irgendwer4711> ok
[14:35:56] <Ingar> you can try compiling but no guarantees
[14:36:22] <irgendwer4711> oh
[14:36:29] <Ingar> I did found a tjw src http://ingar.satgnu.net/files/tremulous/tremulous-755.tar.bz2
[14:36:48] <Ingar> it's 1.1.0 with some essential patches
[14:36:54] <irgendwer4711> no other idea?
[14:37:07] <Ingar> I haven't run 1.1 in ages
[14:37:30] <Ingar> I found some stuff on my website but it's mostly gpp
[14:38:01] <irgendwer4711> a trick to confire basepath
[14:38:36] <Ingar> the trick with the basepath was necessary because the ubuntu package moved the files around

[14:38:42] <irgendwer4711> ah
[14:38:49] <Ingar> trying to force a "standard" install

[14:43:12] <Ingar> it's quake3
[14:43:12] <irgendwer4711> and the UI files
[14:43:29] <Ingar> it searches home first and the installation location next
[14:43:37] <Ingar> you might have to cd to the install dir though
[14:44:24] <irgendwer4711> no, its not searching other than my home
[14:44:55] <Ingar> in the startup log it should say what zip files it found

[14:48:04] <Ingar> mm apparently it doesnt list the actual files
[14:48:18] <Ingar> tried to install 1.1.0 but it wont load a map

[14:56:02] <Ingar> I'm getting errors that were fixed a long time ago :)
[14:56:12] <Ingar> 1.1.0 had issues with 64-bit anyway
