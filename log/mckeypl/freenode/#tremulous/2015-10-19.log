[01:59:59] <amorris> Hello. I have made a map using NetRadiant (Just a test one) to use in Tremulous but it exports as map file. How do I change the .map file to .bsp I am using Mac so I need a compiler compatible with Mac

[03:17:08] <amorris> I have a map built for Tremulous and it is in .bsp format but I don’t know which folder to put the file in so I can open it up on Tremulous. Can anyone help me?
[03:17:24] <`Ishq> In your fs_homepath
[03:17:33] <`Ishq> Create a maps/ directory
[03:17:40] <`Ishq> PUt your .bsp in there
[03:17:49] <`Ishq> Put your assets in your fs_homepath too
[03:17:58] <amorris> I am using mac
[03:18:01] <`Ishq> Thn start tremulous and start the map with /devmap <namename>
[03:18:13] <`Ishq> fs_homepath = ~/Library/Application Support/Tremulous
[03:18:50] <amorris> What do I put in assets
[03:20:06] <`Ishq> Assets = your textures/models/skyboxes
[03:20:45] <`Ishq> You can alternatively make a pk3
[03:21:00] <amorris> When I try and open it, it says Can’t find map maps/tutorial.bsp
[03:23:54] <amorris> Ok I fixed that problem now it loads but doesnt join the game and says “
[03:24:10] <amorris> “RE_LoadWorldMap: maps/tutorial.bsp not found”
[03:24:51] *** Joins: dGr8LookinSparky (~dGr8Looki@unaffiliated/dgr8lookinsparky)
[03:26:14] <`Ishq> That means the file doesn't exist.
[03:26:24] <`Ishq> Start trem
[03:26:28] <`Ishq> and type fs_basepath
[03:26:34] <`Ishq> And then put your tutoral.bsp here
[03:26:36] <`Ishq> *there
[03:26:45] <`Ishq> I mean
[03:26:49] <`Ishq> fs_homepath in console
[03:27:01] <`Ishq> That will print out the location of fs_homepath for you

[06:27:38] <adammorris> Hi I have have a map that is in the .bsp file format but I have accidentally deleted the .map file that I need to edit it. Is there a way I can convert the .bsp to .map on mac?
[06:28:51] <`Ishq> It is possible but the results aren't pretty.
[06:29:25] <adammorris> So i have to remake it?
[06:29:37] <`Ishq> Well you can see how it looks when you convert it.
[06:29:46] <`Ishq> And if it sucks, you'll have to remake it unfortunately.
[06:29:47] <adammorris> Ok
[06:29:53] <`Ishq> Alternatively, you can try to undelete your map file.
[06:30:10] <adammorris> It’s only a box so it wasn’t hard to make
[06:30:12] <`Ishq> There are some undelete utilities available for free. Not sure about mac but I've used them for WIndows and Linux before.
[06:30:22] <dibblego> adammorris: I have told you to use git.
[06:30:35] <`Ishq> For the record
[06:30:47] <`Ishq> q3map2 -convert -format map path/to/bsp, I believe.
