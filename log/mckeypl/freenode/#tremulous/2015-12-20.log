[02:35:13] <dGr8LookinSparky> specing, there will be a new client Tremulous released by GrangerHub likely within the next couple of months.  keep an eye on grangerhub.com for that release.

[21:45:21] <specing> How come grangerpub has such big games going?
[21:49:08] <kharnov> because there are literally no other tremulous servers left and they lucked out on people running out of money to pay for their servers
[21:49:38] <kharnov> i'm pretty sure people wouldn't be playing there if they had an alternative
[21:49:50] <kharnov> full of obnoxious cult types
[21:50:01] <specing> Master Server reply:
[21:50:02] <specing> TREMULOUS master.tremulous.net 19 servers total, 18 servers responsive, 30 players
[21:50:16] <kharnov> meaningless
[21:51:24] <kharnov> on the other hand you're probably here to be another shill for them, so carry on
[21:51:39] <Undeference> if they are cult types, does that mean they will all suicide if you tell them? or are they the annoying kind that will ask reasons?
[21:51:58] <kharnov> let's hope for the former
[21:52:04] <specing> I haven't played trem for over 4 years now....
[21:52:22] <specing> I think I was mostly on SST
[21:52:33] <tehpaper> heh
[21:52:40] <tehpaper> people still play trem?
[21:53:03] <kharnov> "people"
[21:54:40] <kharnov> it's the same toxic 1.1 circlejerk you know and love from the last five years with much of the same people
[21:54:53] <kharnov> i will never understand these people
[21:54:58] <specing> ?
[21:55:16] <kharnov> i switched to GPP the moment it came out and never looked back
[21:55:24] <specing> I didn't like it
[21:55:34] <specing> the same as I don't like unvanquished
[21:55:40] <specing> I think
[21:55:52] <specing> turned trem into fast-paced anticamp crap
[21:57:49] <kharnov> if sparky was on the channel i'm fairly sure a link to the discourse/freenode FAQ would be posted, along with a generic "we'll be releasing ___ soon!" he's been saying since february
[21:57:58] <kharnov> it's all bullshit
[21:58:37] <kharnov> grangerhub operates off the principle of "if we say tremulous is alive enough times, it'll be true!"
[21:59:13] <tehpaper> soon
[21:59:26] <tehpaper> like before DNF gets released soon
[21:59:30] <tehpaper> right Timbo?
[21:59:56] <specing> looks more alive than unvanquieshed...
[22:00:10] <specing> is there a GPP (1.2?) server list somewhere?
[22:00:42] <Undeference> http://betaserv.tk/tremmaster
[22:01:30] <kharnov> if you knew what was actually going on instead of drinking the kool-aid you'd understand how ridiculous that statement is
[22:02:06] <specing> Undeference: that lists 1.1?
[22:02:17] <Undeference> no
[22:02:17] <kharnov> GPP has literally zero players
[22:02:23] <specing> kharnov: I just looked at unvanquished server list...
[22:02:41] <specing> and don't you have scheduled games now?
[22:02:59] <kharnov> i'm in-game in one right now, so uh
[22:04:46] <kharnov> player counts are meaningless in comparison to actual development going on when referring to the activity of a project
[22:04:53] <kharnov> and i don't consider them to be a project, they're just a modded server

[22:08:12] <specing> What do I do if 99% of textures are missing (using tremfusion)?
[22:08:32] <cu-kai> they aren't a project and he isn't making the "next version of tremulous"
[22:08:35] <specing> kharnov: Wow so much unused shiny code and assets!
[22:08:47] <cu-kai> as for that, i don't know. i've never heard of that issue
[22:09:08] <specing> not to mention my 2007 radeon probably doesen't like 10K tris rants
[22:09:16] <kharnov> you're probably just here to shill for them so i don't have anything else to say to you
[22:09:46] <specing> ...
[22:11:31] <kharnov> the only tremulous server with an actual, proven track record of interesting development is new edge
[22:11:58] <cu-kai> indeed, we recently ported to 1.1 and it works fine with tremfusion.
[22:13:03] <specing> atchhd textures worked
[22:13:48] *** Joins: dGr8LookinSparky (~dGr8Looki@unaffiliated/dgr8lookinsparky)
[22:14:35] <specing> textures still broke
[22:14:38] <specing> hmm
[22:15:02] <specing> perhaps I did not copy enough from vanilla trem
[22:15:16] <specing> only data...pk3 and vms
[22:21:38] <specing> yes, that was the problem
