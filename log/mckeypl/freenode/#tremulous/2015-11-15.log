[06:05:17] <Undeference> what
[06:05:36] <kharnov> i would guess a reference to a defunct clan or server
[06:07:01] <Undeference> https://paste.ee/r/yy8kP
[06:07:13] <Undeference> weird arena file
[06:07:27] <kharnov> "briefing		"Moan if ya want. i got a thick skin. www.ancientsclan.co.uk""
[06:07:30] <kharnov> definitely a clan reference
[06:07:35] <Undeference> also, skirmish.arean.arena nice
[06:08:10] <Undeference> et maybe
[06:08:48] <kharnov> i like coming across assertive statements from long-gone groups
[06:09:04] <kharnov> that link doesn't even work
[06:09:08] <kharnov> the clan one
[06:09:19] <Undeference> yeah, seems like et
[06:09:26] <scv> Undeference do you know nikki
[06:09:40] <Undeference> nikki who?
[06:09:52] <scv> the dev of paste.ee
[06:09:58] <Undeference> no
[06:10:26] <kharnov> is it even a good map
[06:11:04] <Undeference> https://betaserv.tk/paklist.html#map_skirmish_pk3
[06:11:23] <kharnov> Attackers might be trying to steal your information from betaserv.tk (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards). NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID
[06:11:27] <kharnov> lol
[06:11:34] <Undeference> -s
[06:11:43] <`Ishq> THat just means he has a self signed certificate
[06:11:53] <scv> whoa m8
[06:12:15] <Undeference> because self-signed certs are way worse than in the clear connections
[06:12:18] <kharnov> huh
[06:12:26] <kharnov> how are we hosting that map on unvanquished.net
[06:12:26] <`Ishq> You can get signed certificates for free now adays though
[06:12:30] <kharnov> are you hosting it for some reason `Ishq
[06:12:33] <`Ishq> Yes
[06:12:39] <kharnov> why
[06:12:39] <`Ishq> I've mirrored mg
[06:12:42] <kharnov> oh
[06:12:51] <kharnov> do we really have that much room on the server
[06:12:54] <`Ishq> Yes
[06:12:56] <scv> what is "mg"
[06:12:58] <Undeference> lol
[06:13:01] <Undeference> and lol
[06:13:20] <`Ishq> By mirroed mg, I mean their trem download stuff
[06:13:22] <kharnov> welcome to post-tremulous
[06:13:25] <`Ishq> Maps, assets, binaries
[06:13:30] <`Ishq> kharnov: scv is trolling you
[06:13:33] <scv> 2 kewl 4 skewl
[06:13:36] <Undeference> 11GB for 2256 pk3 files here
[06:13:53] <`Ishq> That's basically almost everything created publically for tremulous and posted on forums
[06:13:58] <Undeference> not much at all
[06:14:06] <`Ishq> Indeed
[06:14:12] <scv> are there any copies of the ig_ maps
[06:15:00] <`Ishq> Yes
[06:15:12] <scv> sweet
[06:15:25] <scv> i wonder if i have the patches still
[06:15:58] <scv> aw the patch mesh one isnt there
[06:16:10] <Undeference> (and mg was shy of 4.5GB looks like)
[06:16:42] <`Ishq> My tarball is 5.6G
[06:16:44] <scv> lmao i hope this is my map i just found
[06:16:49] <scv> i'm about to install trem just to see
[06:16:52] <Undeference> scv: like https://betaserv.tk/paklist.html#map_ig_chaos_pk3 ?
[06:16:56] <Undeference> again -s
[06:16:58] <`Ishq> xz compressed, though I doubt that does much for pk3s
[06:17:11] <scv> Undeference: nah that was supertanker's
[06:17:20] <Undeference> i xz compress all my tars of zips
[06:17:21] <scv> i made some really awful one that i guess never got widely distributed
[06:17:33] <scv> patch mesh terrain, awful performance lol
[06:17:37] <Undeference> what's the name?
[06:18:09] <scv> ig_snipe or something along those lines
[06:18:30] <`Ishq> Ah, dl.unvanquished.net shows up twice because you treat https and http separately
[06:18:41] <Undeference> i know
[06:19:36] <Undeference> map-sniperPRO.pk3 map-snipertime.pk3 sniper_lake.pk3 sniper_lake_B1.pk3. no ig_snipe
[06:19:45] <scv> aw
[06:22:43] <scv> cool
[06:22:49] <scv> i did find one of my shitty unfinished maps
[06:22:55] <scv> its totally awful
[06:23:10] <scv> mid 2007 lol
[06:23:29] <scv> no arena file!
[06:24:12] <Undeference> >700 of those
[06:24:27] <Undeference> or the wrong arena file
[06:24:32] <scv> i had no idea what i was doing back then
[06:24:39] <scv> all the floors are like 2GU thick
[06:24:52] <`Ishq> Arena files were completely useless in Tremulous. They were only used for the that one GUI that no one actually used to create servers.
[06:24:59] <Undeference> mandatory https://paste.ee/r/vrd0k
[06:25:12] <scv> i wonder if any of my other shitty maps are there
[06:25:25] <Undeference> and map votes i think
[06:25:27] <scv> too bad i dont remember what most of them were called
[06:25:46] <`Ishq> Only the vote GUI, which again was unused.
[06:25:56] <`Ishq> And even then it was wrong
[06:26:01] <`Ishq> Because it only showed options for client side maps
[06:26:07] <`Ishq> And not all the maps that existed server side.
[06:27:21] <Undeference> kind of silly to call a vote for a map you don't have
[06:29:22] <scv> whoa 13 people playing gpp
[06:29:26] <scv> mindblowing
[06:29:58] <`Ishq> Undeference: Not with www downloads. Especially given the size of trem maps.
[06:30:04] <Undeference> grangerpub is the 69/70/71 multiproto server?
[06:30:11] <scv> i think so
[06:30:16] <`Ishq> I think it's test7233
[06:30:18] <`Ishq> Or whatever the numbers are
[06:30:48] <scv> im getting all nostalgic
[06:31:00] <Undeference> test7341 too
[06:31:29] <`Ishq> Hm, you're right. Both of them are multiproto
[06:31:54] <scv> i found all the code for my alias lookup and old qvm patches a few weeks ago
[06:32:12] <scv> db from d*t, <3 and aa from like 2009-2010
[06:32:26] <dGr8LookinSparky> GrangerClub is also multiprotocol
[06:32:52] <`Ishq> scv: too bad none of those players play anymore :(
[06:32:57] <scv> right lol
[06:33:04] <scv> the db backups are huge though
[06:33:10] <scv> all dem guids
[06:33:24] <`Ishq> lol
[06:33:31] <scv> being able to xref users across servers was really useful
[06:33:39] <`Ishq> Yeah
[06:33:51] <`Ishq> That tool you(?) put up was really useful back in the day
[06:33:55] <scv> yeah
[06:34:05] <scv> thats what i found backups of

[06:38:48] <scv> lets play some h1z1 man
[06:39:06] <Undeference> people still play that?
[06:39:14] <scv> the population comes and goes
[06:39:22] <scv> i havent played for a few months actually
[06:39:47] <yarou> is anyone on 1.1? lol
[06:40:00] <Undeference> https://betaserv.tk/t/master?protocol=69;port=30710;ext=0#P

[06:48:24] <scv> was it? lol
[06:48:28] <`Ishq> ya
[06:48:33] <scv> i miss it
[06:48:37] <scv> i cant believe it was actually popular
[06:48:38] <`Ishq> Was a good server
[06:49:02] <scv> oh shit you're cele
[06:49:10] <`Ishq> ya
[06:49:14] <scv> hi!!
[06:49:15] <yarou> the first server i got admin on was SST Hellfire
[06:49:15] <`Ishq> Hey
[06:49:23] <yarou> i had it for a total of 1 day
[06:49:26] <scv> lol
[06:49:27] <`Ishq> lol
[06:49:27] <Undeference> hellfire?
[06:50:17] <yarou> it was a spin-off server of SST
[06:50:35] <yarou> i was banned from SST for a very long time
[06:50:44] <Undeference> nice
[06:50:47] <`Ishq> Just SST?
[06:50:55] <scv> more than just SST >_>
[06:50:56] <yarou> there was a time where 90% of servers would ban me
[06:50:57] <yarou> lol
[06:51:15] <yarou> that's why i home-hosted my own
[06:51:20] <scv> hell yeah
[06:51:21] <Undeference> i got permanently banned from the mg server for aimbotting, but i only played there like twice so i didn't care
[06:51:30] <scv> lol
[06:51:46] <`Ishq> Avenger banned me for aimbotting on the US1 official servers once
[06:51:52] <`Ishq> Ban was removed shortly though
[06:52:02] <scv> have people ported thz to 1.2
[06:52:07] <scv> or whatever the new fancy bot is
[06:52:07] <yarou> yup
[06:52:15] <scv> silly
[06:52:20] <`Ishq> ya, there are aimbots for GPP
[06:52:40] <yarou> as WarLock eloquently put it: "saying there is no cheat for gpp is like saying meiselli's mother don't suck cock!!![sic]"
[06:53:00] <scv> i cant imagine it being very hard to implement
[06:53:35] <`Ishq> Open source games are always hackable. Need vigilant admins.
[06:54:06] <yarou> it's a problem when the admins themselves hack

[06:54:38] <Undeference> the rule is you don't ban people whose hacks suck worse than yours
[06:55:23] <yarou> auto-aim, wallhack etc don't really help you in trem that much, aside from scrimming maybe
[06:55:46] <scv> yeah but that's really shit in scrims

[06:57:12] <Undeference> it's possible someone couldn't figure it out already would get ideas
[06:58:24] <yarou> that's why you need a grudge match
[06:58:45] <Undeference> i only ever used an aimbot once in a completely different game years ago to see if people a group of people could accurately tell when it was on/off. i thought it was pretty obvious but people failed miserably
[07:00:34] <scv> aimbot is pretty easy to detect anyway
[07:01:53] <`Ishq> Aimbot maybe
[07:01:58] <yarou> nProtect was a funny anticheat system
[07:01:58] <`Ishq> triggerbots are much harder.
[07:02:02] <scv> triggerbot is awful to detect
[07:02:11] <yarou> it would hook into explorer.exe and search for the title of every window

[07:02:17] <scv> yea
