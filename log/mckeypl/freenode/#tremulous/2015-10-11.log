[03:45:16] <DASPRiD> dibblego, since you don't have to count on updates, just get the installer here: http://tremulous.net/files/
[03:46:07] <dibblego> ah ok, just run the installer on any ol linux?
[03:46:10] <DASPRiD> yep
[03:46:38] <dibblego> do these installers include a server, or just client?
[03:47:09] <DASPRiD> both iirc
[03:47:15] <dibblego> oh ok awesome thanks
[03:53:19] <jkent> dibblego: be warned, there is a bug with the 1.1 binaries if you run them under 64 bit linux, but this isn't a problem with gpp
[03:53:43] <dibblego> ok

[04:59:08] <dibblego> why is the gpp installer so much smaller than 1.1?
[04:59:21] <dibblego> $ du -hs tremulous-*
[04:59:21] <dibblego> 102M    tremulous-1.1.0-installer.x86.run
[04:59:21] <dibblego> 6.6M    tremulous-gpp1-installer.run
[04:59:26] <jkent> because it doesn't include the 1.1 assets
[04:59:47] <jkent> you need both for a complete set of assets
[05:00:15] <dibblego> oh right
[05:00:27] <dibblego> is there a README or similar for this setup?
[05:01:03] <jkent> um, not sure
[05:01:16] <dibblego> is it more than run 1.1 installer, then gpp installer?
[05:01:39] <jkent> nope
[05:01:50] <jkent> thats all you need to do
[05:01:50] <dibblego> ok, will fire away, thanks
[05:07:53] <dibblego> oh needs to be 32-bit linux
[05:09:18] <jkent> you can install 32-bit compat libraries
[05:10:32] <jkent> if ubuntu, i think its ia32-libs, but i might be wrong, i don't use ubuntu
[05:10:40] <dibblego> oh yeah cheers
[05:15:29] <dibblego> there is a ubuntu 32-bit version, so  will try that — my goal is to have a virtualbox with a tremulous server installed, then clients on different OSes

[08:44:39] <dibblego> great thanks
[09:18:30] <dibblego> trying to figure out how to change the UDP port from 30720, google is not helping, any tips?
[09:19:22] <Undeference> using newrun or starting directly?
[09:20:49] <Undeference> (if the former, set 'PORT=whatever' in your configuration file. if the latter, '+set net_port whatever' on the command line)
[09:20:56] <dibblego> oh yeah cheers
[09:34:49] <dibblego> can I put "set net_port whatever" in server.cfg? or do you mean that is the configuration file?
[09:36:44] <Undeference> 'set net_port whatever' in server.cfg will work
[09:37:05] <dibblego> ok, so maybe I have something set wrong
[09:37:20] <dibblego> /usr/local/bin/tremded +set dedicated 1 +set fs_basepath /home/tremded/.tremulous/base +exec server.cfg +set net_ip localhost
[09:37:24] <dibblego> this is my process
[09:37:39] <dibblego> the path to server.cfg is /home/tremded/.tremulous/base/server.cfg is this right?
[09:39:01] <dibblego> I ask because I have set net_port but it seems to stay at 30720
[09:39:31] <Undeference> pretty sure fs_basepath should not include the gamename (i.e., remove /base from the end of fs_basepath)
[09:39:46] <dibblego> ok
[09:42:26] <dibblego> hmm I am still doing something wrong
[09:42:29] <dibblego> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/cc0999d5ebdd300df363/raw/4c49cba6e755b4aff3b74846b5fc9b6565176c23/tremded
[09:44:16] <Undeference> what output do you get from the server?
[09:45:13] <dibblego> I haven't set up a client yet
[09:46:10] <Undeference> are you running with newrun? try running the server directly and seeing what output it tells you, specifically near "execing server.cfg"
[09:47:20] <dibblego> I'm not, I found some otherscript at the same time
[09:47:51] <Undeference> ah. and i'm probably confusing the different fs_* cvars wrt the thing about basepath. lemme check
[09:48:44] <dibblego> thanks heaps for your help
[09:50:01] <dibblego> I can run the process and see output
[09:50:52] <Undeference> i think typically your fs_basepath would be /usr/local/share/tremulous or wherever your data is installed
[09:51:13] <dibblego> yeah I think I just figured it out
[09:52:17] <dibblego> it is also looking in /usr/local/games/tremulous/base
[09:52:42] <dibblego> hmm, changing that server.cfg and it is still on 30720
[09:53:56] <Undeference> paste tremded output?
[09:56:15] <dibblego> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/23513a8b7be707729ad9/raw/7cffb89085f64dead2afcc660466f91c44c727b6/tremded.out
[09:57:24] <Undeference> a couple things. it's not a good idea to run as root. it's also a good idea to use a newer client
[09:57:46] <dibblego> oh yeah, that was an accident
[09:57:53] <dibblego> what do you mean newer client?
[09:58:15] <Undeference> apparently the exec happens after net_port is set, so you may have to do a net_restart after exec, and the old server doesn't support it
[09:58:25] <Undeference> oops, server, sorry. tired
[09:58:47] <dibblego> I thought I install the gpp over the top of 1.1
[09:58:58] <dibblego> let me sort that first
[09:59:26] <Undeference> yeah. in that case, use the gpp tremded
[10:00:15] <dibblego> ok, yeah I had it installed, just not running — I will fiddle the scripts
[10:05:07] <dibblego> Couldn't load default.cfg
[10:05:14] <dibblego> what goes in that file?
[10:08:34] <dibblego> I think I've cracked that stuff
[10:08:37] <Undeference> that's in the data-*.pk3 file and it looks like it's just default binds, but it's a fatal error for it not to be present
[10:08:38] <dibblego> I am now missing maps
[10:08:59] <Undeference> missing maps as in they are not found or as in you need more?
[10:09:15] <dibblego> I don't have any
[10:09:20] <dibblego> Can't find map maps/niveus.bsp
[10:10:04] <Undeference> "/usr/local/games/tremulous/base/map-niveus-1.1.0.pk3 (134 files)", so you broke things again?
[10:12:02] <dibblego> ok fixed that
[10:13:03] <dibblego> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/6c07dcceace80f517900/raw/eb33528ea6d6f22c38d64114f610bbb1a9e98cbf/tremded.out
[10:13:38] <dibblego> I'm guessing those maps are for 1.1 ?
[10:14:38] <Undeference> the problem is 'File "vm/game.qvm" found in "/home/tremded/.tremulous/base/vms-1.1.0.pk3"' it needs to find vms-gpp.pk3
[10:14:57] <dibblego> ok, where might I download these?
[10:15:19] <Undeference> you should already have them if you installed gpp
[10:15:43] <dibblego> ok, so to be clear, I need both vm/game.qvm as well as vms-gpp.pk3?
[10:16:02] <Undeference> vm/game.qvm is in vms-gpp.pk3
[10:17:01] <dibblego> ok, shall I remove vms-1.1.0.pk3?
[10:17:49] <Undeference> you shouldn't need to
[10:17:59] <dibblego> ok, I think I have the server up
[10:18:38] <dibblego> it does appear to be the case, yay

[11:42:50] <dibblego> to install a client on osx, do I download tremulous-gpp1.dmg here https://i.imgur.com/kVWiOp8.png or do I need 1.1 first somehow?
[11:43:48] <Ingar> every release I've seen so far needs you to install 1.1 first, and the replace the binaries and install some additional files with gpp
[11:44:12] <Ingar> personally, I did not test the OS X release though
[11:44:37] <dibblego> ok, there doesn't seem to be a download for 1.1 on osx
