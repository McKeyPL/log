[00:12:54] <dGr8LookinSparky> hi ZerGio :)
[00:14:03] <ZerGio> hi
[00:14:12] <dGr8LookinSparky> ZerGio: http://discourse.grangerhub.com/t/installing-tremfusion-for-playing-tremulous-1-1/220
[00:14:13] <ZerGio> i want to install #tremulous in trusty
[00:14:26] <ZerGio> wow, thanks
[00:14:37] <dGr8LookinSparky> you're welcome :)
[00:15:26] <dGr8LookinSparky> Tremfusion is a third party client that is decent quality for playing on Tremulous 1.1 clients
[00:15:45] <dGr8LookinSparky> Tremfusion is a third party client that is decent quality for playing on Tremulous 1.1 servers*
[00:16:01] <ZerGio> well, i'll try to install
[00:16:10] <ZerGio> i used to play  trem, i love it
[00:16:14] <ZerGio> i remember lots of players
[00:16:18] <dGr8LookinSparky> you can also try the gpp client
[00:16:38] <ZerGio> shoulkd i download all the linux64 files?
[00:17:08] <dGr8LookinSparky> there are currently three servers that are accessible from both gpp and 1.1 clients
[00:17:29] <`Ishq> If he's an old player, he probably wants the 1.1 client
[00:18:11] <dGr8LookinSparky> yes, to be able to play on the other 1.1 servers
[00:18:26] <dGr8LookinSparky> you can install both
[00:19:27] <dGr8LookinSparky> incase he wants to try some of the gpp servers, even though the ones that are not multiprotocol are mostly empty at the moment
[00:21:06] <dGr8LookinSparky> which linux64 download for Tremfusion would you recommend `Ishq ?
[00:21:22] <`Ishq> There are multiple ones?
[00:21:43] <dGr8LookinSparky> yeah I think they are different versions
[00:21:50] <dGr8LookinSparky> http://mirror.kdude63.com/mercenaries_guild/archive/Client_Binaries/TremFusion/
[00:22:03] <dGr8LookinSparky> the latest one?
[00:22:24] <dGr8LookinSparky> this one: http://mirror.kdude63.com/mercenaries_guild/archive/Client_Binaries/TremFusion/Tremfusion-0.99r3-linux64.tar.bz2
[00:22:25] <dGr8LookinSparky> ?
[00:22:47] <`Ishq> Yes.
[00:22:48] <`Ishq> That one.
[00:26:28] <dGr8LookinSparky> ZerGio , for the gpp client, here is the download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tremulous/files/
[00:27:04] <ZerGio> thank you so much
[00:27:10] <ZerGio> i'm playing
[00:27:19] <dGr8LookinSparky> nice :)
[00:30:19] <dGr8LookinSparky> ZerGio, also, GrangerHub is working on a new Tremulous client that will be multiprotocol and be able to connect to all 1.1 servers all gpp servers, and the new trem servers.
[00:30:58] <`Ishq> omg dGr8LookinSparky stop spilling our secrets to the general public!!! That's a 2nd class violation.
[00:31:01] <dGr8LookinSparky> so keep an eye out for that on grangerhub.com in the near future
[00:31:23] <`Ishq> If you keep it up, that will become a 3 star violation
[00:32:12] <dGr8LookinSparky> that information was already publicly known `Ishq , where even you knew about it ;)
