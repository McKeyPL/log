[13:06:19] <dibblego> I downloaded a map from the server, then it disconnected, telling me to set cl_Download 1, which I did in the console, but it still tells me the client is impure — what is the right switch?

[14:37:42] <cu-kai> dibblego, are you using 1.1 or gpp
[14:38:29] <dibblego> gpp
[14:42:52] <cu-kai> what server are you trying to play
[14:43:03] <dibblego> my own
[14:43:55] <cu-kai> have you set up the dl server properly
[14:44:32] <dibblego> I'm not sure what that is. A separate server?
[14:45:09] <cu-kai> well first off what map are you trying to play
[14:45:31] <dibblego> trempoline
[14:46:19] <cu-kai> the dl server is a www server where you store your maps for people to download, direct server download is very slow
[14:46:57] <dibblego> oh ok
[14:47:07] <dibblego> do you know a link or keywords to set that up?
[14:50:24] <cu-kai> its just a webserver with your map .pk3s on
[14:51:00] <dibblego> is there a way to point clients to it? or do they download them and put them in base?
[14:51:39] <cu-kai> set your sv_dlurl to your webserver
[14:51:50] <dibblego> ah ok thanks
[14:52:14] <cu-kai> e.g. if your website is www.google.com, on your webserver there would be a /base folder in the root directory containing maps
[14:52:22] <cu-kai> and your sv_dlurl would be www.google.com
[14:52:38] <dibblego> got it cheers
[14:52:42] <cu-kai> np
