[17:12:34] <Obani> Wow
[17:12:48] <Obani> Is this game still in developpement ?
[17:12:59] <cu-kai> no, not officially
[17:13:29] <cu-kai> you should look at unvanquished, tremulous is almost dead sadly
[17:13:40] <Obani> I know Unvanquished
[17:13:48] <Obani> It totally kills my computer
[17:14:08] <Obani> But why are there still so many people on this channel ?
[17:14:19] <cu-kai> oh... well, the last update to tremulous was in 2011. people just idle here
[17:14:26] <Obani> And what is the meaning of "not officially" ?
[17:14:42] <cu-kai> there are mods of tremulous which fix at least some of its many problems
[17:14:50] <Obani> 2011 ? I only have 2006 release
[17:15:18] <cu-kai> tremulous gpp
[17:15:45] <Obani> You mean the program that never worked on any computer I tried it ?
[17:16:00] <cu-kai> no idea
[17:16:12] <cu-kai> http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tremulous/tremulous-gpp1-installer.exe?download
[17:17:45] <cu-kai> oh... if you're on linux: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tremulous/tremulous-gpp1-installer.x86.run?download and mac: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tremulous/tremulous-gpp1.dmg?download
[17:19:42] <Obani> cu-kai, already saw it :)
[17:20:07] <cu-kai> ok, does it work?
[17:20:44] <Obani> no, I don't have the required pk3 I think
[17:22:11] <cu-kai> the required pk3 comes with the game when you install it
[17:23:47] <Obani> Well so it doesn't work
[17:25:52] <cu-kai> are you on windows?
[17:27:58] <Obani> no
[17:28:06] <cu-kai> linux?
[17:28:53] <Obani> yes
[17:29:03] <cu-kai> did you run the installer as sudo
[17:31:44] <Obani> Still doesn't work
[17:31:57] <cu-kai> where did you install 1.1.0 to?
[17:32:06] <cu-kai>  /usr/local/games/tremulous? (default location)
[17:32:14] <Obani> No, I just downloaded it
[17:32:21] <Obani> And still, location doesn't change anything
[17:32:35] <Obani> The binary file isn't working properly
[17:32:40] <cu-kai> chmod +x'd it?
[17:33:04] <Obani> The BINARY isn't working
[17:33:10] <Obani> I've got the good permissions on it
[17:33:28] <Obani> And I always had the same errors as I have here with other computers, on other OSs
[17:33:36] <Obani> (with gpp version)
[17:33:59] <cu-kai> no idea then
[17:34:17] <Obani> a black screen with light-grey borders
[17:34:29] <Obani> afk
[17:34:41] <cu-kai> yes, that's a common problem with 1.1.0 on linux
[17:35:00] <Obani> I never had problems with 1.1.0
[17:35:08] <Obani> -.-
[17:35:19] <Obani> It's just always with gpp version I've got problems
[17:35:38] <cu-kai> http://new-edge.org/gpp/data-gpp1.pk3
[17:35:38] <cu-kai> http://new-edge.org/gpp/vms-gpp1.pk3
[17:35:46] <cu-kai> put those in /usr/local/games/tremulous/gpp
[17:36:02] <cu-kai> then relaunch tremulous-gpp
[17:46:10] <Obani> Are they different from those I should have ?
[17:47:11] <Obani> No, they're the same
[17:47:32] <scv> >playing tremulous in 2015
[17:48:15] <DASPRiD> there are older games which are still played ;)
[17:48:29] <scv> i know, i just like to tease you guys ;)
[17:48:45] <DASPRiD> also, shush, can't you keep the channel dead? :P
[17:50:22] <cu-kai> lol...
[17:50:31] <cu-kai> Obani: no idea why it doesn't work then, try putting them in ~/.tremulous/gpp
[17:51:21] <scv> i still fire up 1.1 from time to time but it's always dead
[17:51:24] <Obani> no, still doesn't work
[17:51:31] <scv> and i'm so damn rusty after 5 years it doesnt even matter
[17:51:37] <cu-kai> scv: yeah... playing tremulous in 2015 is a bit of a joke now
[17:51:47] <cu-kai> Obani: honestly no idea then, sorry :/
[17:51:51] <scv> i miss the golden era of 2006
[17:51:53] <scv> good times.
[17:52:04] <Obani> scv, the golden era of 2008 :)
[17:52:17] <scv> 2006-2010 was when i played heavily
[17:52:55] <scv> operated a popular server from 2008 onwards
[17:53:24] <cu-kai> what server?
[17:54:56] <scv> <3
[17:55:16] <scv> i also hosted dretch*tsunami for some time
[17:55:22] <scv> as well as numerous clan servers
[17:55:45] <cu-kai> ah
[17:56:16] <scv> ah mongodb is truly enterprise grade
[17:56:19] <scv> com.mongodb.MongoException$Network: can't call something
[17:56:27] <scv> very useful
[17:56:35] <cu-kai> lol

[19:10:49] <dGr8LookinSparky> Obani , Tremulous is still being developed.  Tremulous is a free an open source project, and like any other FOSS project it will stay active for as long as people are willing to develop and use it.  Contrary to what some may say, this project still has a lot of potential.  GrangerHub (an independent group of Tremulous enthusiasts) is developing a new version of Tremulous with a new client and new servers, as well as a new web
[19:10:49] <dGr8LookinSparky> site with resources and tools for the Tremulous community.  Both the new client and the new server would be backwards compatible by being multiprotocol, which means all Tremulous clients (old 1.1 clients, old gpp clients, and the new client) can connect to the new servers, and the new client can connect to all Tremulous servers including the old Tremulous 1.1 servers, old gpp servers, and the new servers.  GrangerHub will be
[19:10:49] <dGr8LookinSparky> releasing the source code and binaries to the new client and server in the near future after its development team finishes important milestones.  forum.grangerhub.com has more information about GrangerHub's development of Tremulous.
[19:16:58] <cu-kai> oh and btw Obani, grangerhub is a joke. they can't keep to their releases, which are all "s00n(tm)" ;)
[19:21:26] <cu-kai> "the near future" has been "the near future" for the past year almost
[19:28:16] <scv> dGr8LookinSparky for best tremulous troll 2015
[19:29:58] <dGr8LookinSparky> svc , there are plenty of other people that can beat me out for that title, as is pretty evident ;)
[19:33:53] <dGr8LookinSparky> I don't think just working on a Tremulous project even qualifies me for a runner-up in that position, I just don't have the free time required to compete as a Tremulous troll
