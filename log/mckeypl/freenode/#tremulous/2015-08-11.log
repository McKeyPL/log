[20:40:29] <bobydrack> Bonsoir !
[20:45:13] <kharnov> hello
[20:46:31] <bobydrack> Ouch, sorry ! I'm not disturbing you ?
[20:46:39] <kharnov> ?
[20:46:42] <kharnov> what
[20:46:51] <kharnov> i was just saying hello
[20:47:15] <bobydrack> little joke, because this chan is like...uh..dead
[20:47:54] <bobydrack> or i'm saying some mistakes
[20:48:03] <bobydrack> ?
[20:48:28] <kharnov> well yes, this channel is quite dead
[20:48:48] <kharnov> did you just discover tremulous?
[20:49:15] <bobydrack> no no, i played 7 years ago
[20:49:39] <bobydrack> then I stop to play in 2010
[20:49:53] <kharnov> ah
[20:50:06] <kharnov> what was your name back then
[20:50:29] <bobydrack> bobydrack :)
[20:50:39] <kharnov> were you in any clans?
[20:51:06] <bobydrack> no no, it was just for fun
[20:51:10] <kharnov> ah okay
[20:51:22] <kharnov> so what brought you back to tremulous?
[20:51:45] <bobydrack> and i was very interest to see the next version
[20:52:05] <bobydrack> nothing, I didn't play now
[20:52:09] <kharnov> well, there is no next version :P
[20:52:12] <kharnov> and there won't be one
[20:52:16] <bobydrack> yeah yeah..
[20:52:22] <kharnov> however, there is a successor project
[20:52:30] <kharnov> http://www.unvanquished.net/
[20:52:45] <bobydrack> Now there's "Natural Selection 2"
[20:53:06] <kharnov> yes, but that's different
[20:53:06] <bobydrack> it's the same type of game
[20:54:30] <bobydrack> really ? i'm not agree 'cause, both games are the same
[20:54:59] <kharnov> well, NS2 is the sequel to NS
[20:55:04] <bobydrack> just NS2 is more "strategy" than Tremulus
[20:55:07] <kharnov> the game mechanics are pretty different compared to tremulous
[20:55:18] <kharnov> it's aliens vs humans and FPS/RTS, but that's where the similarities stop
[20:55:29] <kharnov> unvanquished is a continuation of tremulous
[20:56:51] <bobydrack> i don't know this project, i'm searching some information about
[20:58:03] <bobydrack> ok, I see
[20:58:55] <bobydrack> Unvanquished is like Tremulous wth differents graphic
[20:59:09] <kharnov> well, the engine is different too
[21:00:02] <bobydrack> it's not really perceptible
[21:00:53] <kharnov> what do you mean
[21:03:27] <bobydrack> no, nothing ! I understood something different
[21:05:27] <kharnov> okay
