[12:16:03] <`Ishq> <.<
[12:16:49] <furrybandit> this game is still alive? i am actually shocked.
[12:30:38] <`Ishq> We live!
[12:31:09] <furrybandit> well, you live
[12:31:14] <furrybandit> not sure about the others
[12:31:22] *** Quits: Undeference (~msk@2001:470:1f07:1427:809:480f:fbba:2b1c) (Quit: Leaving.)
[12:39:17] <`Ishq> I'm all that needs to live.
[12:39:26] <`Ishq> There are still some 1.1 servers around you can catch games on.
[12:39:43] <`Ishq> There is Unvanquished, which is trying to give trem better graphics and some newer gameplay
[12:39:52] <`Ishq> And yeah
[12:41:15] <furrybandit> fair enough
[12:41:34] <furrybandit> i was just dropping by to see if people were still about.
[12:42:31] <furrybandit> i remember someone else on freenode doing a mod update for the game, they wanted to improve on it, don't know what happened to it.
[12:48:14] <`Ishq> unvanquished?
[12:48:18] <`Ishq> www.unvanquished.net
[12:48:20] <`Ishq> Still around
[12:48:43] <dGr8LookinSparky> hi furrybandit, GrangerHub is making a new version of Tremulous (new client & new servers), where all 1.1 clients, gpp clients, and the new client can connect to the new server, and the new client can connect to all 1.1 servers, gpp servers, and the new servers.  test7341 is the development server for the new server, development games are on Thursdays and Saturdays ( http://forum.grangerhub.com/t/thursday-grangerhub-developme
[12:48:44] <dGr8LookinSparky> nt-games/892 , http://forum.grangerhub.com/t/saturday-grangerhub-development-games/206) keep an eye on the GrangerHub website for its updates on its initial release to occur soon.
[12:49:36] <furrybandit> one of the devs on it was nicked "paradox"
[12:49:51] <furrybandit> i believe he is still one of the chan ops of 4chan.
[12:50:15] <`Ishq> Paradox used to be an Unvanquished dev
[12:50:18] <`Ishq> That was many years ago though
[12:50:24] <`Ishq> He was doing UI stuff
[12:50:28] <`Ishq> I take it you're from SST?
[12:50:50] <furrybandit> SST?
[12:50:55] <`Ishq> The SST Server
[12:51:07] <dGr8LookinSparky> was that a 1.1 server?
[12:51:13] <furrybandit> nah, i'm not that oldschool.
[12:51:22] <`Ishq> Yes, it was an old 1.1 server.
[12:51:28] <`Ishq> Paradox was one of the head admins.
[12:52:00] <`Ishq> Also, paradox was a chanop of reddit
[12:52:01] <furrybandit> i met paradox on the 4chan channel, and my friends at the time were playing tremulous, i brought it up, and he told me they were working on an updated version of it.
[12:52:01] <`Ishq> Not 4chat
[12:52:04] <`Ishq> *4chan
[12:52:11] <furrybandit> oh
[12:52:12] <furrybandit> reddit
[12:52:31] <furrybandit> man, i've been on so many IRC's, i can't remember everyone
[12:52:35] <`Ishq> haha
[12:53:20] <`Ishq> What was your trem alias?
[12:53:35] <furrybandit> zensubzero.
[12:53:42] <`Ishq> Hmm
[12:53:45] <`Ishq> Don't recall
[12:53:47] <`Ishq> Oh well :(
[12:53:59] <furrybandit> i wasn't on the game too long.
[12:54:05] <furrybandit> got busy with things.
[12:54:10] <`Ishq> ya
[12:54:12] <`Ishq> Life happens
[12:54:41] <dGr8LookinSparky> but no 1 can ever leave trem, you can only take long breaks
[12:54:55] <`Ishq> Really really really long breaks it appears :)
[12:55:03] <furrybandit> i really do wish however that tremouslous was released as a triple A game, so that the bar would have been set higher for gameplay mechanics as opposed to the current bland shooty COD versions as current.
[12:55:05] <dGr8LookinSparky> in some cases
[12:55:22] <`Ishq> Well, they tried something similar with NS2
[12:55:27] <`Ishq> And that didn't work out too well
[12:55:53] <`Ishq> Granted I think one of the more fun parts of trem is its faster paced gameplay.
[12:56:27] <furrybandit> there is that
[12:56:42] <dGr8LookinSparky> it needs a better integration of the fast pace fps and real time strategy
[12:56:58] <`Ishq> Define it
[12:57:19] <dGr8LookinSparky> I think we are going to have that on GrangerHub's game play
[12:57:28] <`Ishq> ya, GL
[12:58:17] <dGr8LookinSparky> something I noticed with the 1.1 vanilla game play, it seems to have more focus on fps
[12:58:50] <furrybandit> RTS games suck
[12:58:54] <furrybandit> don't be that guy
[12:58:59] <furrybandit> seriously, don't.
[12:59:46] <dGr8LookinSparky> I didn't play NS2, but is from the videos it looks like the commanders are basically pure rts mode
[13:00:43] <`Ishq> Another game that tried to mix FPS and RTS is the Savage series
[13:00:45] <furrybandit> i prefer the quakelike games
[13:00:57] <`Ishq> Also basically dead
[13:00:59] <furrybandit> in all their fast paced fragging gameplay
[13:01:06] <`Ishq> This genre is a super niche genre
[13:01:27] <dGr8LookinSparky> there needs to be a good amount of strategy in trem, but you should still have the same 3d immersion as its fps component
[13:01:29] <`Ishq> Savage went the NS2 route with a commander.
[13:01:46] <`Ishq> Which isn't bad.
[13:01:59] <`Ishq> The game had a lot of potential.
[13:04:00] <dGr8LookinSparky> I like the way you can build in trem in terms of interacting 3 dimensional so to speak
[13:04:46] <`Ishq> Sure. I guess the next step to break out of the niche is to make trem building minecrafty
[13:04:50] <dGr8LookinSparky> you can build stuff on shelves, aliens can build on all sorts of angled surfaces
[13:05:12] <dGr8LookinSparky> well Cuboid sorta did that
[13:05:23] <furrybandit> my honest take is, i wish borderlands the pre-sequal had the gameplay mechanic as the alians in tremulous, being able to walk upside down.
[13:05:40] <`Ishq> Never played borderlands sadly.
[13:06:23] <furrybandit> i recommend it, it's a good cel-shaded MMORPG/FPS combo game.
[13:06:46] <`Ishq> Yeah
[13:06:52] <`Ishq> Heard nothing but good things about it.
[13:07:09] <furrybandit> not everyone likes it, but i did, just like i liked XIII
[13:07:26] <`Ishq> Talking about FF?
[13:07:32] <`Ishq> Never really played FF either.
[13:08:09] <furrybandit> FF?
[13:08:19] <dGr8LookinSparky> Final Fantasy?
[13:08:23] <furrybandit> oh, fuck no.
[13:08:35] <furrybandit> final faggotry was never a good game.
[13:08:43] <furrybandit> never will be
[13:08:47] <dGr8LookinSparky> I never played it neither
[13:08:49] <`Ishq> Heh.
[13:09:07] <dGr8LookinSparky> unless `Ishq meant FireFox
[13:09:12] <dGr8LookinSparky> I play that everyday ;)
[13:10:02] <furrybandit> i'll steal a line from a critic about final fantasy, it should be renamed to "tortuously drawn out claptrap."
[13:10:55] <furrybandit> XIII is a cel-shaded game (called 13). and well, not to spoil the game, but well, you familiar with JFK?
[13:11:15] <furrybandit> the president of the US that was assassinated.
[13:11:27] <dGr8LookinSparky> I've heard of him ;)
[13:11:40] <dGr8LookinSparky> not Lincoln, right?
[13:12:06] <furrybandit> no, Kennedy
[13:12:35] <furrybandit> there was some conspiracy about who shot and killed him.
[13:12:43] <dGr8LookinSparky> oh, I thought you meant this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley
[13:13:37] <furrybandit> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy
[13:13:44] <furrybandit> that one
[13:14:09] <dGr8LookinSparky> ah, yeah, I've hear of that one too ;)
[13:15:05] <furrybandit> well, the game is kind of like that, it's based around the assassination of a president
[13:15:06] <dGr8LookinSparky> So the magic bullet was fired from the grassy knoll?
[13:15:56] <dGr8LookinSparky> little known fact, the Lincoln assassination was a conspiracy
[13:17:31] <dGr8LookinSparky> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln#Original_plan:_Kidnapping_the_president
[13:19:06] <dGr8LookinSparky> but no one talks about that historically known conspiracy, people just think John Wilkes Booth
[13:20:58] <dGr8LookinSparky> Sorry if I diverted the conversation
[13:21:44] <furrybandit> well, anyways, i do recommend XIII
[13:21:57] <furrybandit> but that's because i like storyline.
[13:22:08] <dGr8LookinSparky> what time period does it take place in?
[13:24:35] <Ingar> conspiracy is what people do
[13:24:47] <Ingar> banding together to push some agenda forward
[13:24:50] <furrybandit> modern times.
[13:26:11] <dGr8LookinSparky> conspiracies are little more specific: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conspiracy
[13:27:29] <Ingar> the only thing I omitted is "evil, unlawful"
[13:27:33] <Ingar> so, exactly what people do
[13:28:05] <furrybandit> conspiracy is uncommonly found to be honest
[13:28:14] <furrybandit> conspiracy theories on the otherhand.
[13:28:29] <dGr8LookinSparky> most people who work together don't have evil/unlawful goals
[13:29:03] <dGr8LookinSparky> conspiracy theory is a misnomer
[13:29:41] <dGr8LookinSparky> But there have been, and there are conspiracies that exist
[13:30:16] <Ingar> < dGr8LookinSparky> most people who work together don't have evil/unlawful goals
[13:30:19] <Ingar> yes they do
[13:30:32] <Ingar> they just want to aquire wealth regardless the consequences
[13:30:40] <Ingar> must people are just never in a position to actually do it
[13:31:34] <dGr8LookinSparky> nah, if that was the case, society would dissolve
[13:34:13] <dGr8LookinSparky> There is a large number of people who have wrongful intentions, but they are still a minority
