[03:54:50] <muesli> jherskowitz: wrt spotify support emails: fetching info won't work right now because spotikea is down
[03:55:11] <theli_ua> spot ikea
[03:55:13] <theli_ua> what
[03:55:50] <jherskowitz> muesli: login too?
[03:55:57] <muesli> theli_ua: a little daemon extracting playlist info from spotify, even if the tomahawk users don't have spotify themselves
[03:56:03] <muesli> jherskowitz: spotify login should work fine
[03:56:12] <muesli> jherskowitz: but i don't think he's complaining about the login not working
[03:56:22] <jherskowitz> muesli: not for me
[03:56:25] * theli_ua is still not sure how ikea is involved
[03:57:15] <muesli> jherskowitz: works fine here
[03:57:50] <muesli> jherskowitz: what error do you get?
[03:59:17] <jherskowitz> muesli: huh… works on this machine, but was failing on my other machine today
[03:59:28] <jherskowitz> said “can’t contact spotify” or something
[03:59:51] <jherskowitz> but there is something weird between the two… both are el capitan
[04:00:00] <jherskowitz> this one won’t load Amazon/Gmusic in the sidebar
[04:00:02] <jherskowitz> the other one will
[04:00:18] <theli_ua> plot thickens
[04:00:26] <muesli> heh
[04:00:35] <muesli> jherskowitz: did you compare / upload logs?
[04:00:51] <muesli> i'm afraid i wouldn't have much time checking them myself right now, but maybe theli_ua can spot something
[04:01:05] <muesli> i'd rather bring back the remaining services / server
[04:01:06] <theli_ua> but
[04:01:14] <theli_ua> but I never used spotify
[04:01:15] <jherskowitz> muesli: my guess is that it is something with the dependencies
[04:01:23] <jherskowitz> I was fighting with openssl
[04:01:27] <jherskowitz> on both machines
[04:01:35] <jherskowitz> maybe I got it right on one but not the other
[04:01:36] <muesli> jherskowitz: oh, is it the one you self-compiled qt on?
[04:01:45] <jherskowitz> oh
[04:01:49] <muesli> remove that again
[04:01:50] <jherskowitz> yeah, that could be
[04:01:57] <muesli> and reinstall qt from bottle (normal brew install qt5)
[04:02:09] <jherskowitz> I forgot about that
[04:02:16] <jherskowitz> will try
[04:02:20] <muesli> the one you self-built had no secure transport support
[04:02:22] <theli_ua> wouldn't that break ssl for him?
[04:02:29] <muesli> theli_ua: the self-built one would
[04:02:43] <theli_ua> eh, I thought its the other way
[04:02:44] <theli_ua> lol
[04:02:58] <jherskowitz> muesli: good memory
[04:02:58] <muesli> theli_ua: no, without using secure transport from qt, you're basically fucked on osx nowadays
[04:03:01] * jherskowitz totally forgot
[04:03:28] <muesli> secure transport enabled did break something else during compilation in tomahawk tho
[04:03:32] <muesli> but that i've fixed a while ago
[04:04:22] <theli_ua> hm, somehow I was sure that NOT self compiled one breaks amazon and gmusic for jherskowitz 
[04:04:55] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: I’m almost positive I wouldn’t have self-compiled Qt5 on the machine that they are working on
[04:05:06] <jherskowitz> *almost*
[04:05:10] <jherskowitz> :)
[04:06:41] <jherskowitz> muesli: I noticed that some of the artist bios get cut off - can I fix that?
[04:13:32] <muesli> it's because last.fm's api doesn't have a "short version" anymore, i guess
[04:13:44] <muesli> the question is: what's the real fix there? i can imagine various ones
[04:13:58] <muesli> a) switch to hatchet api ;-)
[04:14:06] <muesli> b) calculate our own short version
[04:14:09] <jherskowitz> do we have a short version?
[04:14:10] <jherskowitz> heh
[04:14:15] <muesli> c) fade out the text at the bottom
[04:14:30] <jherskowitz> d) scroll box?
[04:15:08] <muesli> yeah, even tho with d) we'd be back at scrollbox-within-scrollbox
[04:15:08] <jherskowitz> although multiple scrolls would suck
[04:15:12] <muesli> which didn't feel good
[04:15:13] <muesli> yeah
[04:15:33] <muesli> i'm seriously leaning towards a)
[04:15:37] <muesli> hatchet got what we want
[04:15:39] <jherskowitz> e) fade text with a link to hatchet to read more
[04:15:40] <muesli> and the api exposes it
[04:16:15] <jherskowitz> yeah
[04:16:17] <jherskowitz> makes sense
[04:17:03] <muesli> also, eating our own dog-food
[04:22:26] <jherskowitz> muesli: theli_ua: ok, brew Qt5 - I see it logging into google music but it doesn’t show up in the sidebar

[04:22:46] <theli_ua> QuotaExceededError what
[04:23:15] <jherskowitz> I also see it sending resolver queries to Amazon
[04:23:18] <jherskowitz> but not in sidebar
[04:23:35] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: I assume that is my storage quote
[04:23:39] <jherskowitz> over 20k tracks
[04:24:10] <theli_ua> hm, yeah, looks like something is wrong with quotas set for websql 
[04:24:34] <theli_ua> but why you only now started getting this error 
[04:25:04] <jherskowitz> good question
[04:26:13] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: and this is what I see for Amazon

[04:26:25] <jherskowitz> but again… only on this machine
[04:26:33] <jherskowitz> that could be an old amazon version
[04:26:39] <theli_ua> well
[04:27:02] <theli_ua> same issue as the other guy reported
[04:27:02] <theli_ua> mathus13>     JAVASCRIPT: "/home/sbarratt/.local/share/Tomahawk/atticaresolvers/gmusic/contents/code/gmusic.js:1" "TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'Tomahawk.resolver.instance.saveUserConfig()')" "undefined" 
[04:27:43] <jherskowitz> huh
[04:32:51] <theli_ua> looks like your amazon uses old style 0.9 api
[04:34:24] <theli_ua> I'll need to merge in master and see if anything broke after MrMaffen's android tomahawk.js merges
[04:34:31] <theli_ua> I don't think I ever updated my build
[04:39:21] <theli_ua> guess I have to
[04:39:33] <theli_ua> as it looks like something have changed in tomahawk.js world
[04:40:20] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: ok, but it’s sending resolve queries, right?
[04:40:35] <jherskowitz> it wouldn’t do that without logging in, yeah?
[04:41:19] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: did you set up your login and password?
[04:41:27] <jherskowitz> yeah
[04:43:29] <theli_ua> ecm-config.cmake
[04:43:34] <theli_ua> wth is that
[04:43:44] <theli_ua> muesli ?
[04:43:56] <muesli> extra cmake modules
[04:44:15] <theli_ua> why didn't I need that before and now do :-/
[04:44:30] <muesli> i think we do require it since qt5
[04:44:30] <muesli> iirc
[04:44:35] <muesli> it's pretty standard tho
[04:45:22] <theli_ua> yeah that would pull qt5 for me
[04:45:55] <theli_ua> not even BUILD_WITH_QT4 can save me
[04:46:03] <jherskowitz> huh, I don’t have the scroll page issues on this machine
[04:46:07] <jherskowitz> wth?
[04:46:20] <jherskowitz> maybe the self-built Qt5 IS on the other machine?
[04:47:26] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: anyhow, all those issues sound like the changes did to tomahawk.js , and I don't have time atm to compile qt5, etc :(
[04:47:41] <muesli> theli_ua: no qt5 package yet?
[04:47:46] <theli_ua> ?
[04:47:49] <muesli> theli_ua: oh, you're on that ancient 12.04 lts or something?
[04:47:50] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: hmm… but both machines are on master
[04:47:56] <theli_ua> eh, I'm on gentoo
[04:47:58] <theli_ua> atm
[04:48:02] <muesli> theli_ua: ah :)
[04:48:05] <theli_ua> at work I'm on 12.04 . yes
[04:48:26] <theli_ua> I also really don't want to install qt5
[04:48:41] <muesli> theli_ua: what's the worry? :)
[04:49:45] <theli_ua> I just don't want to have multiple qts :(
[04:52:07] <theli_ua> alright, made it not need ecm for now
[04:53:03] <theli_ua> tbh it is only used for ecm_add_app_icon ...
[04:55:18] <muesli> ah right, that's fairly new
[04:55:59] <theli_ua> nice
[04:56:11] <theli_ua> it now just segfaults on  me :)
[04:56:46] <theli_ua> looks like when establishing websockets connection to hatchet
[04:57:17] <theli_ua> QSslCertificate::QSslCertificate
[04:58:56] <theli_ua> muesli: any idea what changed there?
[04:59:21] <muesli> got a backtrace / error?

[04:59:56] <tomabee> [ Pastebin | www.irccloud.com |  ]
[05:00:18] <theli_ua> not too helpfull , but as i said - happens when it tries to connect to hatchet
[05:00:32] <muesli> odd
[05:00:38] <muesli> can restart the ws server
[05:00:43] <muesli> but that'd be odd as well
[05:00:51] <theli_ua> well, the version built from my branch works
[05:00:59] <theli_ua> the one after I merged master - segfaults
[05:01:01] <theli_ua> weird
[05:01:20] <muesli> huh, yeah
[05:01:21] <muesli> odd
[05:01:32] <muesli> did you try a clean build (tm)?
[05:02:03] <theli_ua> I think that was a clean build, but lemme recheck
[05:04:32] <muesli> let me rebuild master myself, too
[05:04:54] <theli_ua> it might be that the hatchet plugin wasn't recompiled
[05:05:26] <theli_ua> muesli: yeah, that was it
[05:05:28] <theli_ua> ohwait
[05:05:29] <theli_ua> no
[05:05:32] <theli_ua> segfault :)
[05:06:03] <muesli> looking at the backlog, rotzbouw might have reported the same this morning
[05:07:15] <jherskowitz> nini
[05:07:33] <theli_ua> bah, eastcoasters leave us and go to sleep
[05:08:25] <theli_ua> muesli: weird thing is I have to versions - one compiled from my fork, one with my fork + master on top ... latter one crashes
[05:08:53] <theli_ua> not sure if testing clean master would change anything

[05:16:30] <theli_ua> I wonder if its just me messing with cmakelists
[05:17:42] <theli_ua> in any case this is stupid to require qt5 when building for qt4
[05:17:44] <muesli> theli_ua: i'll let you know as soon as my master compiled ;-)
[05:18:16] <theli_ua> where is domme
[05:18:22] <theli_ua> I'd like to file a complaint :(
[05:19:04] <muesli> haha :)
[05:19:26] <muesli> theli_ua: the extra modules aren't a qt5 thing tho
[05:19:44] <theli_ua> well, extra modules pull in at least qt5-core nowdays
[05:19:55] <muesli> huh
[05:19:57] <muesli> that seems stupid
[05:20:02] <theli_ua> for me at least
