[00:32:46] <tworge1> i have a question
[00:32:47] <tworge1> hello
[00:32:54] <tworge1> why some songs arent playable even though i downloaded the album?
[00:32:55] <muesli> hey there
[00:33:05] <muesli> tworge1: what error message do you get?
[00:33:25] <tworge1> Sorry, Tomahawk coudn't find the track
[00:33:43] <muesli> tworge1: where are you trying to play it from?
[00:33:53] <tworge1> what u mean
[00:33:56] <muesli> did you check the Songs tab of your collection? is it playing fine from there?
[00:33:58] <tworge1> i downloaded the album
[00:34:29] <tworge1> wait
[00:35:03] <muesli> i assume you're viewing the album page
[00:35:07] <tworge1> https://sr.ht/jN8D.png
[00:35:10] <tworge1> yeah i am
[00:35:20] <tworge1> im on ubuntu
[00:35:25] <muesli> ah ok, you're looking at the album page
[00:35:32] <tworge1> oh eah
[00:35:35] <muesli> in which case tomahawk retrieves the album metadata from musicbrainz
[00:35:40] <tworge1> in the songs tab it plays correctly
[00:35:42] <muesli> and it doesn't quite fit your local tags i guess
[00:35:42] <tworge1> ohhhh
[00:35:47] <tworge1> yeah
[00:35:48] <tworge1> nice
[00:35:51] <tworge1> ok
[00:35:53] <tworge1> thanks
[00:35:54] <muesli> the idea is, that you might have many sources
[00:36:11] <muesli> and it tries to resolve the album not only from your collection, but also from youtube, soundcloud, spotify, et
[00:36:12] <muesli> etc
[00:36:12] <tworge1> weird
[00:36:18] <tworge1> once i played them in the songs view
[00:36:23] <muesli> this will change with the next release, and you'll be able to pick the metadata source
[00:36:26] <tworge1> they appeared in the album view
[00:36:35] <tworge1> nice .. are you a dev?
[00:36:39] <muesli> (and if you're coming from your local collection, it will default to that as your metadata source)
[00:36:42] <muesli> yeah
[00:36:58] <tworge1> oh no
[00:37:07] <tworge1> they didnt appeared in the album view
[00:37:22] <tworge1> but it would be nice to be able to just use the album view
[00:37:38] <tworge1> but
[00:37:41] <tworge1> theres something important
[00:37:52] <tworge1> the album art should come from the interwbes
[00:37:54] <muesli> tworge1: yeah, you will be in 0.9
[00:37:57] <tworge1> interwebs
[00:38:16] <tworge1> tell me you agree with me
[00:38:52] <muesli> yeah, as i've said :)
[00:39:26] <tworge1> oh sorry i didnt catch that part
[00:39:31] <tworge1> well thank you man

[15:27:41] <jherskowitz> we should push a 0.8.5 imo - fix gmusic, add all the new resolvers, remove all the dead ones
[15:27:59] <dommex> jherskowitz: we should push a 0.9alpha or something
[15:28:25] <jherskowitz> or somethign
[15:28:30] <dommex> yeah
[15:29:01] <dommex> jherskowitz: the current state is way closer to 0.9 than to 0.8. there's an incredible amount of under the hood changes which doesnt let us port anything easily back to 0.8 (plus we don't have qt4 compile hosts anymore)
[15:29:33] <dommex> a 0.8.5 should have minimal changes and nothing breaking
[15:29:34] <jherskowitz> yeah, no real feature changes though
[15:29:40] <jherskowitz> by I‚Äôm fine with it being 0.8
[15:29:41] <jherskowitz> 0.9
[15:29:51] <jherskowitz> we‚Äôve just said a lot of stuff is coming in 0.9
[15:29:54] <jherskowitz> which we haven‚Äôt done yet
[15:29:59] <dommex> nothing obvious sadly no. 
[15:30:17] <jherskowitz> meanwhile a bunch of stuff is broken in 0.8.4
[15:31:01] <dommex> yeah, we should communicate that we had a lot of challenges during the 0.9 cycle and that we want to get a consolidation release out first. and then focus on features in 0.10 again
[15:34:53] <dommex> and we still have a bit of work to do for a consolidation release too. i.e. we need to port a bunch of resolvers still

[22:12:31] <theli_ua> it shouldn't have it in the first place as that plugin doesn't accept dropping urls
[22:13:20] <theli_ua> also, tidal is broken for exactly the same reason. there that urlllokup is intended. its broken since that is reworked/removed in tomahawk and its not clear what is the proper fix. dommex know more about that
[22:14:04] <dommex> yeah i know what's up
[22:14:45] <dommex> i can fix tomorrow

[22:15:19] <jherskowitz> dommex: I just merged that since we haven‚Äôt shipped Rhapsody yet anyway.  Hope that is ok.

[22:16:00] <jherskowitz> bad login?
[22:16:17] <theli_ua> hm
[22:16:29] <theli_ua> sound like it, but why
[22:16:47] <theli_ua> I mean, it might be either bad credentials or api key/token is extracted incorrectly

[22:36:18] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: let me know if it works for you
[22:40:54] <jherskowitz> MrMaffen: dommex: want to sign up for a trial Napster account to see if the Rhapsody resolver works with it (same company now)?
[22:41:01] *** Joins: jamesaxl_ (~jamesaxl@41.140.221.27)
[22:44:04] <theli_ua> I'm pretty sure it will not work as it is, but after a quick check doing s/rhapsody/napster  should be enough
[22:44:19] <theli_ua> ie all endpoints seem to be present if you replace rhapsody with napster

[22:44:35] <theli_ua> so we should made user controllable napster/rhapsody switch
[22:44:46] <theli_ua> other than that it should work
