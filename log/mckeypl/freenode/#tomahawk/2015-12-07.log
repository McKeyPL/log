[16:32:34] <feepk> dommex: depends on the linker paths
[16:33:17] <dommex> feepk: linker paths? maybe that's what i meant with "fixed up"
[16:34:10] <dommex> i.e. that install-name-tool or however it's called needs to be used to make the libs "independent"
[16:34:28] <feepk> dommex: otool -L library.dylib
[16:34:37] <feepk> Yep, that's it
[16:37:42] <dommex> feepk: okay, so you dont have builds with headers (y u no libvlc.framework? :D) and i need to use install-name-tool myself because it's only run by the build-dmg step not at make install time, right?
[16:49:36] <feepk> dommex: yes, correct
[16:49:52] <feepk> That framework is called VLCKit with an objc API
[16:50:00] <dommex> ah ok :C
[16:50:12] <dommex> feepk does it contain the normal libvlc?
[16:50:15] <dommex> feepk: ^
[16:51:44] <feepk> Yes!
[16:51:54] <feepk> Well, mind of, but yes
[16:52:02] <feepk> Might help to inspire you
[16:52:12] <feepk> Especially the build script
[16:52:47] <dommex> feepk: sooo.. couldn't i just install vlckit via brew and make tomahawk cmake scripts find libvlc inside that?
[16:53:37] <dommex> i'm just looking for an easy way to allow people to compile tomahawk on osx
[16:54:57] <feepk> Need to try once home
[16:54:59] <feepk> Just arrived in Hamburg
[16:55:07] <feepk> Bbl
[16:55:15] <dommex> feepk: alrighty, i'll play around with it some more. thanks already!

[20:12:38] <infandum> Using arch linux with tomahawk, I noticed that it's no longer detected with mpris. Is that just me, or is it a known issue?
[20:19:59] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: btw, the only downside with our current rhapsody resolver is that it will not work for musicfreedom, I just realized that
[20:25:09] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: oh?
[20:25:18] <jherskowitz> they track the app, not the stream?
[20:25:27] <theli_ua> no, but it only works with http streams
[20:26:09] <theli_ua> so I guess this is also true for rdio
[20:26:10] <theli_ua> iirc it also uses rtmp streams in our resolver
[20:27:36] <theli_ua> well, they use a combination of ip ranges and string matching in http stream
[20:28:46] <theli_ua> so its still might work but I highly doubt that. as all of mobile apps dont use rtmp streams
[22:13:15] <dommex> infandum: havent heard of that issue

[23:24:19] <theli_ua> well, you were doing something
[23:24:22] <theli_ua> like fixing things
[23:24:35] <theli_ua> eh, maybe those didn't do any api changes
[23:24:42] <theli_ua> but rather api implementation changes
