[01:36:49] <domme> theli_ua: i don't
[01:36:58] <theli_ua> well, you should!
[01:37:05] <domme> totally
[01:37:15] <domme> but fucking with websockets and localstorage *sigh*
[01:37:42] <theli_ua> basically wanted to see your opinion on should we start porting all resolvers to new api or should this be postponed until we actually support new api on desktop
[01:37:54] <theli_ua> cause its like ... part of resolvers are using new api, part is not
[01:38:05] <theli_ua> er, inconsistent! :D
[01:38:17] <theli_ua> I say if some of them are incompatible make all of them
[01:38:32] <theli_ua> s/incompatible/ready for new api/
[01:38:50] <domme> fine with me
[01:39:23] <theli_ua> mmkay, I'll probably start changing my resolvers to use same style of API android does
[01:39:37] <theli_ua> at least I'll be able to use them both on my desktop fork aand android
[01:41:31] <domme> yup

[02:05:58] <domme> theli_ua: what is params.query?
[02:06:30] <theli_ua> search query?
[02:06:40] <domme> so the full search string?
[02:06:46] <theli_ua> yeah, I suppose so
[02:06:54] <domme> hm mh mh.. i find that a bit odd
[02:06:57] <domme> MrMaffen: ^
[02:07:02] <theli_ua> are you reffering to search method of resolver?
[02:07:07] <domme> yeah
[02:07:29] <theli_ua> yeah, its just with the changes to api all parameters are inside a single object, not separate parameters
[02:07:42] <domme> yes, i know
[02:08:06] <theli_ua> I think its fine, it is consistent
[02:08:13] <domme> i just think.. it should be something else.. searchTerm or queryString or something like that
[02:08:22] <theli_ua> oh, the name
[02:08:59] <domme> yeah, only that
[02:10:09] <MrMaffen> I just used the parameter name that has been used before
[02:11:28] <MrMaffen> afaik it was search( query ){..} before in most cases
[02:13:59] <domme> i just feel we should come up with something better now that we're changing for once
[02:14:22] <domme> that's the downside of the new params approach apparently :)
[02:16:50] <MrMaffen> domme: well if we wanted to we could always have a simple params.query to params.fancyName comp translation in tomahawk.js
[02:16:58] <MrMaffen> so I wouldn't see it as a big deal
[02:17:17] <domme> true
[02:17:28] <MrMaffen> but yea I'm fine with changing the name. I don't care about it that much tbh
