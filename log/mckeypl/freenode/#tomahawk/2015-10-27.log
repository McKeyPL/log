[00:06:09] <domme> hey yurrriq :)
[00:06:18] <domme> nice to meet you, this is @pansenmann writing :)

[00:06:51] <yurrriq> Cheers!
[00:07:14] <yurrriq> Are you a Tomahawk dev?
[00:07:26] <domme> yurrriq: you could say that :)
[00:08:19] <yurrriq> Cool! I’ve been casually following the project for quite a while now and I love it. So thanks for your hard work
[00:08:28] <domme> sure :)
[00:08:40] <domme> yurrriq: so for ios the bad news is ... there is no one else working on anything
[00:08:50] <domme> the good news is, noone will stop you from anything :)
[00:08:58] <yurrriq> Are there any particular roadblocks or just lack of manpower?
[00:09:05] <domme> lack of manpower
[00:09:21] <yurrriq> Ah, I see.
[00:09:38] <domme> so if you want to start anything, it's more than welcome
[00:09:42] <yurrriq> Well, I love over-extending myself, so I’m happy to start taking on the iOS app.
[00:10:08] <yurrriq> What’s the status of the Android app, as in alpha, beta, battle-tested, etc?
[00:10:09] <domme> do you know anything about the internals of tomahawk yet?
[00:10:15] <domme> it's public beta
[00:10:20] <yurrriq> Cool
[00:10:22] <domme> you can probably learn a lot from it
[00:10:25] <yurrriq> re: internals, conceptually only
[00:10:27] <domme> MrMaffen is your man here
[00:10:30] <yurrriq> it’s in c++, right?
[00:10:35] *** Joins: quenne (guest-quen@gateway/web/scrollback.io/x-czxyfvhlsnjmqqty)
[00:10:36] <quenne> yurrriq any of your projects live? 
[00:10:36] <domme> yes
[00:10:57] <domme> it's written in c++, but we prefer our resolvers in javascript
[00:11:03] <yurrriq> My iOS stuff has only been client work and it’s all pretty stale/abandoned at this point
[00:11:24] <domme> so we can share the code between desktop and mobile (and hatchet) ... and we dont need to recompile the application to ship updated resolvers
[00:11:27] <domme> if apis change etc
[00:11:30] <yurrriq> I’m working on an updated Frontend Masters iOS app, univesal in Swift.
[00:11:51] <quenne> cheers 
[00:12:03] <yurrriq> I work there full time now.
[00:12:23] <domme> so the most basic thing to do, to get a tomahawk app is ... to create a javascript runtime to execute resolvers in :)
[00:12:31] <yurrriq> After I pay my iOS dues, though, I’m gonna rearchitect the backend in Lisp Flavoured Erlang :)
[00:12:53] <yurrriq> Core Javascript for iOS should do nicely, yeah?
[00:13:03] <domme> i have no clue :-)
[00:13:25] <quenne> ye Core JS will do 
[00:13:25] <yurrriq> Cool. I’m experienced in Node, ClojureScript, etc, so that part shouldn’t be too tricky.
[00:13:35] <yurrriq> quenne: cool!
[00:13:45] <domme> yurrriq: sounds like a good fit
[00:13:59] <domme> yurrriq: bonus points for having worked with promises yet
[00:14:17] <domme> our new apis are all promise based 
[00:14:20] <yurrriq> I’m all about it.
[00:15:10] <yurrriq> Have you got a link for some example resolver code?
[00:15:43] <domme> yurrriq: wanna see the brand new not yet finished proposal of mine or something that actually works in tomahawk master these days? ;-)
[00:15:59] <domme> (you can also go for "both" :D)
[00:16:15] <yurrriq> re: Android app as reference. I’ve done some Android work and speak fairly fluent Java, so it should indeed be useful wrt iOS
[00:16:27] <yurrriq> domme: definitely both

[00:20:00] <domme> it'
[00:20:32] <domme> it's a kinda straight forward port of the old soundcloud resolver, just to basic es6 class syntax and importing all dependencies (instead of relying on globals)
[00:20:43] <yurrriq> +1 for that
[00:21:21] <domme> but we can do a lot more now. for example using await, which will be a huge win for this extremely async kind of code
[00:21:43] <yurrriq> right
[00:22:00] <yurrriq> looks straight-forward enough..
[00:22:10] <yurrriq> I guess my question is where to start on iOS.
[00:22:39] <yurrriq> Would there be any benefit to going for a cross-platform solution, e.g. using React Native?
[00:23:20] <yurrriq> Also, I don’t have any mental model of the general architecture of a Tomahawk client :/
[00:23:29] <domme> okay, we can help with that :-)
[00:23:51] * yurrriq digging through Android repo now
[00:24:02] <domme> having written basically 3-4 tomahawk envs by now.. we know a few catches :)
[00:24:35] <domme> so there are two core components i'd say.. those which gave (and still give) me the biggest pains on hatchet
[00:24:44] <domme> the pipeline and the audioengine
[00:25:00] <domme> the pipeline is what orchestrates the resolvers 
[00:25:10] <domme> it takes care of looking for results for queries
[00:25:19] <domme> (through resolvers)
[00:25:34] <domme> and then the audio-engine which plays those results
[00:27:09] <domme> regarding the cross-platform solution... dunno, mrmaffen is in strong favor of a native solution for android
[00:28:27] * yurrriq taking notes
[00:28:54] <yurrriq> re: native solution. I feel that.
[00:29:07] <domme> i can almost promise you that you'll be rewriting those components over and over again till they work completely satisfactory :-D
[00:29:12] <yurrriq> any opposition to Swift?
[00:29:38] <yurrriq> ^ for iOS
[00:29:47] <domme> yurrriq: i heard a term the other day... sec
[00:30:40] <domme> "freedom of responsibility"

[00:31:43] <domme> even if you went with html, your choice :)
[00:31:46] <yurrriq> I like that.
[00:32:48] <yurrriq> Are there screenshots of the Android app anywhere? I have neither a device nor the ADK at the moment.
[00:33:26] <domme> MrMaffen: ^

[00:51:51] <domme> yurrriq: i expect a working app by tomorrow morning
[00:52:08] <yurrriq> I’m thinking for the first task, I want to get resolvers working and tested
[00:52:20] <domme> nice
[00:52:20] <yurrriq> domme: so does my boss ;)
[00:52:26] <domme> haha
[00:52:37] <yurrriq> I think Halloween is my real “deadline"
[00:52:52] <domme> i can explain to you how we invoke scripts
[00:52:59] <yurrriq> into it
[00:53:00] <domme> and what you need to implement for that to work
[00:53:11] <domme> it's a bit complex, but also very powerful
[00:56:48] <domme> so basically to bridge c++(or whatever you are using) calls to javascript, you need an id that you can use to map the result back to its caller
[00:57:50] <domme> so in the beginning we had executeJS("search(someId, searchText);") that had the downside of always having to deal with that in resolver code, which is very ugly
[00:58:22] <domme> (you always had to remember passing that back to Tomahawk.addTrackResults() .. *shrug* and global callback function *shrug* *shrug* *shrug*)
[00:58:55] <domme> what we have now:
[01:00:11] <domme> each javascript object that needs to be called functions on, registers itself with tomahawk.. then tomahawk can do PluginManager.invoke(someId, objectId, "search", { searchText: "whatever" }) e.g.
[01:01:29] <domme> this will find the right object, and invoke object.search({searchText: "whatever"}) and when the promise search returns resolves, the pluginmanager will automatically return the results with the corresponding id to tomahawk
[01:03:09] <domme> yurrriq: i guess you can look at the implementation in android for that
[01:03:20] <yurrriq> hmm
[01:03:26] <domme> the implementation on desktop has lots more cruft afaict
[01:03:34] <yurrriq> Yeah, I’ll have to dig in a little deeper.
[01:03:49] <yurrriq> JSContext looks promising in Swift land.
[01:03:57] <yurrriq> I’ve not used JavascriptCore yet.
[01:04:04] <domme> i mean, i can tell you all about it ... but it's hard to find a start somewhere :)

[01:06:12] <yurrriq> So I’ve the ADK installed and I’m trying to run the Android version in a simulator now
[01:06:29] <MrMaffen> yurrriq: be sure to use an x86 platform image

[01:06:41] <MrMaffen> and then install the x86 nightly ofc
[01:06:54] <yurrriq> MrMaffen: noted
[01:07:16] <domme> those are the most basic examples of how to use the scriptobjects 
[01:08:05] <domme> scriptObject()->invoke() returns a Tomahawk::ScriptJob which is pretty similar to a promise
[01:08:10] <domme> (just without the cool chaining stuff)
[01:08:18] <MrMaffen> yurrriq: I think the best way to start would be to design a playback view and try to get tomahawk to play a local file (preferably with libvlc)
[01:08:29] <MrMaffen> domme: js stuff comes later imo
[01:08:49] <domme> 23:52:08 < yurrriq> I'm thinking for the first task, I want to get resolvers working and tested
[01:09:08] <MrMaffen> hm ok
[01:09:26] <domme> yurrriq: i'm sorry this is complex :)
[01:09:28] <MrMaffen> but resolvers only makes sense when there's a way to play songs, no? 
[01:09:28] <yurrriq> I mean, Apple provides some great APIs for playing/streaming audio
[01:09:39] <yurrriq> that part is not so tricky/foreign to me
[01:09:49] <yurrriq> I figured I’d focus on the new stuff first.
[01:09:49] <MrMaffen> ah ok
[01:09:51] <domme> MrMaffen: and displaying playlists makes only sense if you can resolve them ;-)
[01:09:55] <theli_ua> well, I think we use libvlc to be consistent
[01:09:58] <yurrriq> Can’t hurt to have a basic audio player set up first
[01:10:05] <yurrriq> I’ll look into libvlc
[01:10:10] <theli_ua> like, I highly doubt you'll be able to stream rtmp with apple's apis
[01:10:13] <jherskowitz> re
[01:10:14] <MrMaffen> domme: you wouldn't want to display playlists at first. you'd just want to list all local files and play them
[01:10:14] <domme> MrMaffen: and playing tracks makes only sense if there are results 
[01:10:26] <MrMaffen> local only ... that's what I'm suggesting

[01:25:17] <yurrriq> domme: Thanks for all your help!
[01:25:24] <feepk> I should do the same as domme actually
[01:25:33] <feepk> yurrriq: feel free to ping me ;)
[01:25:38] <yurrriq> Sounds good. I should get back to work anyway.
[01:25:41] <yurrriq> This is too exciting.
[01:25:54] <domme> yurrriq: if you need anything, just ping me here or in query.. will respond tomorrow morning
[01:25:55] <yurrriq> I let the build script do it’s thing while I work
[01:26:43] <yurrriq> feepk, domme: sounds good. I’ll try to hang out here. I’m not much an IRC user normally, but this little session has been very informative.
[01:27:09] <feepk> yurrriq: cool! I'm in the same time zone as domme btw.
[01:27:25] <yurrriq> how far off are we?
[01:27:35] <domme> yurrriq: it's 1:30am here :)
[01:27:42] <domme> same goes for MrMaffen btw
[01:27:44] <domme> and muesli
[01:27:49] <yurrriq> good thing I keep odd hours then
[01:27:50] <domme> lots of crazy germans here ;-)
[01:28:02] <yurrriq> haha
[01:28:30] <yurrriq> sounds like jherskowitz and I are in the same timezone, -6 from y’all
[01:28:43] <jherskowitz> yurrriq: I’m EDT actually
[01:28:46] <yurrriq> mm
[01:29:05] <jherskowitz> I forgot I think this is the week in between our timezone changes
[01:29:23] <domme> hehehe.. yeah, we just had our times changed to winter time this weekend
[01:29:57] <yurrriq> well no promises on my time availability/commitment, but I’m pretty excited about the prospect of Tomahawk for iOS 
[01:30:07] <yurrriq> which bodes well for it
[01:30:24] <domme> we all wish we had more time :)
[01:30:53] <domme> and it quickly gets more work than one expects at first, but much appreciated if you try to get anything done :)
[01:30:56] <yurrriq> right? I think my strong desire to use the app myself will be a good driving force
[01:31:04] <domme> that's how oss works
[01:31:08] <domme> scratch your own itch
[01:31:09] <jherskowitz> feepk: any pointers for this sdk error? http://pastebin.com/0QLjareN
[01:31:10] <tomabee_> [ jfm:build jherskowitz$ brew install --HEAD vlc  ==> Installing vlc from tomahawk | pastebin.com | http://pastebin.com/i/fb2.jpg ]
[01:31:45] <feepk> jherskowitz: if this is Xcode 7, you don't have a 10.10 SDK anymore
[01:31:50] <feepk> jherskowitz: so you need to use 10.11
[01:32:26] <jherskowitz> ok, I need to figure out how to do that :/
[01:32:30] <domme> anyway.. i'm off :)
[01:32:33] <domme> nini
[01:32:33] <yurrriq> oops, do I need to install vlc before building vlckit?
[01:32:37] <yurrriq> domme: goodnight
[01:32:40] <feepk> s/10.10/10.11 should be enough
[01:32:49] <MrMaffen> domme: nini
[01:32:58] <feepk> yurrriq: no, this is what the script is doing for you, including all the build system and external libraries we need
[01:33:02] <yurrriq> cool
[01:33:10] * feepk is off, too, good luck!
[01:34:12] <yurrriq> Thanks, everyone. I’m excited to see where this goes. I’ve gotta get back to work here too, but I leave the chat open. I’ll report back on my progress. For reference I’m gonna work on the developer branch at https://github.com/yurrriq/tomahawk-ios
