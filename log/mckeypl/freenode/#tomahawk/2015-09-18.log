[20:47:47] <theli_ua> Its just ... if I'm doing a new resolver I'd like to use it on both android and desktop, aand my 'new api' branch of desktop 
[20:48:06] <theli_ua> and I also want other people to test it as well
[20:48:23] <theli_ua> and other people are most probably using master ... which doesnt have a new api

[21:45:10] <kurros> alastairp: sorry, I had the wrong filter up ;_; still a ton of submit-listen POSTs pending. The page says 64/474 but looking at the library?page= requests, it looks like they all got hit, except for a couple 302 Moved responses. maybe its as you say and the page count just didn't increment correctly.
[21:45:36] <kurros> is there an api.lb request so see lb's count?
[21:46:52] <alastairp> right, there’s a small bug in our scraper where we update the count when we request from lfm library, and not when we submit to listenbrainz
[21:46:57] <alastairp> I have to fix that this weekend
