[00:35:22] <morsik> muesli: btw, Tomahawk has some problem with tracks endings on Google Music
[00:35:58] <morsik> looks like it doesn't always request for last minute stream url or something like that (?!)
[00:36:50] <morsik> well… this actually looks like problem with GMusic anyway. I have similar problem on official Google Music app on Android while 3G loose :<

[03:08:30] <tomabee> [ Crystal Castles | musicbrainz.org |  ]
[03:08:42] <theli_ua> muesli: look at their 3 "Album" releases
[03:08:47] <theli_ua> they the same exact title
[03:08:55] <theli_ua> yet they are totally different
[03:09:10] <theli_ua> the grey-font thing in () is their "disambiguation"
[03:09:21] <theli_ua> which is only available on 2nd and 3rd
[03:09:41] <theli_ua> and this is actually the "title" services like spotify, amazon, etc list them
[03:10:02] <theli_ua> so. without my change .. I'll get a single album "Crystal Castle" listed by tomahawk on artist page
[03:10:27] <theli_ua> with the change I will also get "II" and "III" both of which are correctly resolved for me from numerous services
[03:10:43] <muesli> hmmm... sounds like a real edge case. two things pop in my mind
[03:10:54] <muesli> aren't the spotify (&co) tags wrong then?
[03:11:08] <muesli> shouldn't it be rather title += " " + disambiguation
[03:11:10] <muesli> ?
[03:11:39] <theli_ua> It can be, yeah. Its just whenever I looked they all list just the "disambiguation" part
[03:11:42] <muesli> using just the disambiguation might work in this very case - and this case only
[03:11:51] <muesli> got more examples for album disambs?
[03:16:16] <theli_ua> I'll see if I can find any
[03:18:35] <theli_ua> and btw it would also be nice to be able to select specific editions inside a release group in tomahawk as well
[03:20:01] <theli_ua> muesli: musicbrainz.org/artist/6fe07aa5-fec0-4eca-a456-f29bff451b04
[03:20:26] <muesli> good example indeed :)
[03:21:10] <theli_ua> muesli: funny enough that is linked from musicbrainz docs (thats how I found it) https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Disambiguation_Comment
[03:21:11] <tomabee> [ Disambiguation Comment | musicbrainz.org |  ]
[03:22:04] <theli_ua> muesli: with the change I get "The Green Album" ... I dont know from where ... but also "Green Album" from musicbrainz
[03:23:38] <theli_ua> Spotify lists it as "Weezer (Green Album)"
[03:24:07] <theli_ua> same for amazon
[03:24:36] <muesli> yeah from a logical pov title += " (" + disamb + ")" sounds like the most reasonable
[03:24:48] <theli_ua> same for rhapsody
[03:25:20] <theli_ua> muesli: downside of that would be http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release?query=artist:%22Crystal%20Castles%22%20AND%20release:%22Crystal%20Castle%20%28II%29%22
[03:26:46] <theli_ua> hm, though http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release?query=artist:%22Weezer%22%20AND%20release:%22Green%20Album%22 doesn't work either 
[03:27:04] <muesli> should probably store the found mbid along with the album object instead
[03:27:14] <muesli> or a serviceId
[03:27:19] <muesli> so we can query the album by that
[03:28:43] <theli_ua> heh, that sounds like a much more complex change :D
[03:29:49] <muesli> heh, but a sensible one ;-)

[18:57:24] *** mgue1 is now known as mgue
[19:17:47] <theli_ua> muesli: tbf I would prefer amazon's ASIN for release than mbid :D that way I can easily resolve that via amazon
[19:18:04] <theli_ua> and amazon's ASIN is one of the release's fields on musicbrainz
[19:18:08] <muesli> i'd say it heavily depends on the resolver returning the object
[19:18:21] <muesli> generally speaking tho, mbid is much more universal than the asin
[19:18:26] <theli_ua> I mean, amazon's ASIN is much more widespread than mbid
[19:18:34] <muesli> heh, i'd claim the opposite
[19:18:56] <muesli> but admittedly it's just a feeling, not based on any facts
[19:19:38] <theli_ua> well, I can for sure say that ISRC is more universal than both

[19:20:26] <theli_ua> like, it is available on mb and you can search, say, spotify by it
[19:22:46] <theli_ua> Id say we could use all of "ISRC, ASIN, MBID" 
[19:22:58] <theli_ua> like, have them as additional fields when resolving
[19:23:06] <theli_ua> that way it would be much easier to match albums
[19:23:36] <theli_ua> like, if any of them matches =>  this is THE album we're looking for
[19:23:50] <theli_ua> and we can use either of them to get all of them via mb
[19:24:18] <theli_ua> and that would be a huge step forward being able to distinguish re-releases, etc
[19:24:33] <theli_ua> muesli, domme does that make sense?
[19:25:25] <muesli> imo it should be a simple map.... service-string -> id-string
[19:25:32] <muesli> so we can store any kind of id

[19:49:51] <HorusHorrendus> where are the Go Experts? :) muesli? domme? ;)
[19:51:15] <HorusHorrendus> If I want a very simple webservice in Go, not public, just internally used, receives data from GitLab Hooks (or maybe some other "hooks"), parses the data and sends then requests to another REST api (e.g. JIRA) ... what would I use?
[19:52:43] <HorusHorrendus> as most simple Go Webserver/framework
[19:55:20] <HorusHorrendus> or would I use for such a simple thing a js framework/library? :)
[19:55:33] <HorusHorrendus> not that I can write a line of Go, neither JS :)
[20:03:51] <muesli> beehive ;-)
[20:11:27] <HorusHorrendus> ohh yeah you're right ... that could work
[20:22:36] <HorusHorrendus> so I would probably do a webbee to receive the json data and unserialize it, create a gitlabbee because that should be the one that makes sense of the received data and then forward it to a jirabee (or leave the gitlabbee in the middle out and forward the result from webbee to jirabee)
