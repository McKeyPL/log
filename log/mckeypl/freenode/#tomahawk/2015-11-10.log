[00:02:50] <theli_ua> domme_: MrMaffen cause somewhere in process of changing tomahawk.js it stopped calling testConfig for 0.9 resolvers
[00:03:20] <theli_ua> easy to fix but I just want to make sure I'll fix it in the right place, so I wanna know what was it supposed to be in < 0.9
[00:04:19] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: it's always testConfig for 0.9 resolvers

[00:04:29] <theli_ua> I know
[00:04:30] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: before that it was configTest and _testConfig
[00:04:43] <theli_ua> aha
[00:04:45] <theli_ua> mmkay
[00:04:54] <theli_ua> "before" === < 0.9 ?
[00:04:56] <MrMaffen> I think _testConfig was something that was only used in that one tidal resolver
[00:05:24] <theli_ua> also, MrMaffen if you are indeed going to review amazon resolver please redownload it, I fixed some minor bugs
[00:06:26] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yes "before" == < 0.9
[00:06:29] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: ok
[00:06:34] <theli_ua> thanks
[00:06:41] <MrMaffen> could take a while though. I got loads of other stuff I wanna do first
[00:06:42] <MrMaffen> :/
[00:06:56] <theli_ua> sure, I can bug domme in the meanwhile
[00:07:02] <theli_ua> or domme_  rather
[00:07:43] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: btw, saw your comment on those PRs ... why can't you just put a simple white version of those icons as iconWhite.png s in the images folder? Oo
[00:07:56] <theli_ua> because I would need to create them
[00:08:11] <MrMaffen> the background can be anything from a 1x1 to a 600x600 image
[00:09:04] <MrMaffen> well yea ... otherwise someone else has to create them :D
[00:09:19] <theli_ua> well, if the one intends to use those resolvers on android
[00:09:21] <MrMaffen> and I know that someone :D
[00:09:24] <theli_ua> as desktop doesn't use them
[00:09:31] <theli_ua> and I dont use android version

[00:09:49] <theli_ua> I mean, I just dont listen to music from my phone in general
[00:09:59] <theli_ua> at has nothing to do with tomahawk on android specifically :)
[00:10:00] <MrMaffen> desktop will use them in the long run
[00:10:22] <MrMaffen> nvm I'll create them -.-
[00:10:32] <theli_ua> -_-
[00:10:38] <theli_ua> but why would you bother
[00:10:49] <theli_ua> noone except me will most probably use those resolvers anyway

[20:43:58] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: which was only extended by the Tidal resolver
[20:44:08] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: you can safely disregard _testConfig
[20:44:09] <theli_ua> which you changed?
[20:44:31] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: I changed it to testConfig yes
[20:45:04] <theli_ua> so, if you say this wasn't even supported by 0.8 ... then I should remove references to it from non-Promies API as well
[20:46:31] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: well it wasn't supported by tomahawk desktop. but there are  <0.9 resolvers that do have a configTest-function
[20:47:27] <theli_ua> alright
[20:47:34] <MrMaffen> in other words: I only used that configTest-function in tomahawk-android
[20:48:50] <theli_ua> so testConfig for <0.8 and configTest for >= 0.9 it is then
[20:50:35] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: wait, so why, would you want it to be called directly?

[20:59:14] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: no I'm not, because I don't know the magic that is being done in tomahawk-desktop :D
[20:59:25] <theli_ua> >_<
[20:59:29] <MrMaffen> all I can say is that we only have to support testConfig
[20:59:36] <MrMaffen> domme_ has to comment first ...
[21:00:42] <theli_ua> I mean, if we want to keep backwards compatibility it doesn't matter what we make tomahawk call, either way we'll have wrapper in tomahawk.js
[21:01:11] <theli_ua> and the wrapper was done so that resolver could just throw an error or something
[21:02:52] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yea true. the only downside might be some redundant compat code
[21:03:01] <MrMaffen> but I guess that's not a problem
[21:03:10] <MrMaffen> considering the amount of compat code we already have :D
[21:03:22] <theli_ua> we could just drop pre 0.9 compat
[21:03:38] <theli_ua> everything would be much cleaner
[21:04:58] <MrMaffen> yep that's the plan
[21:05:05] <MrMaffen> 0.9 should be that kind of release
[21:05:41] <MrMaffen> we also plan on getting rid of synchrotron and instead have a solid resolver distribution system with version management
[21:06:17] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: btw, could you explain the logic behind artistDisambiguation in collection implementation? also, how does it handle compilations/multiple artists on a release
[21:07:55] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: artistDisambiguation is a concept that I copied from how things are handled on hatchet. it's not being used right now as you probably know. it's just a string that is being used for multiple different artists with the same name
[21:08:36] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: compilations should in theory be done through using the albumArtist properly. but as you probably also know, that's just a stub implementation for now
[21:08:55] <theli_ua> well, its just that current 0.9 collection on desktop have no way to view releases with multiple artists on them (apart from track view ofc)
[21:08:59] <MrMaffen> I did all that just to have the proper concepts in place when we address those issues in future releases
[21:09:58] <domme_> MrMaffen: i dont remember the details
[21:10:02] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yea that obviously has to be changed
[21:10:27] <domme_> i just remember is i did a lousy hack with testConfig
[21:10:29] <MrMaffen> domme_: do you think it's safe to only support the testConfig-function?
[21:10:34] <domme_> yeah
[21:10:37] <domme_> if it works
[21:10:55] <domme_> there was no support before 0.9 anyway
[21:10:59] <MrMaffen> yea
[21:11:06] <theli_ua> domme_: but there are resolvers using it
[21:11:29] <theli_ua> well, only 2 are
[21:11:37] <theli_ua> beatsmusic and grooveshark (which is obsolete)
[21:12:13] <domme_> well.. i did a lousy hack: i changed testConfig to configTest (i used what MrMaffen wasnt using on android) because it had a slightly different semantic
[21:12:21] <domme_> maybe just that it returned a promise
[21:12:26] <theli_ua> yes
[21:12:28] <domme_> and _adapter_foo wasnt a thing at that point
[21:12:43] <domme_> anyway:
[21:12:52] <domme_> in 0.8 there was no support for whatever
[21:12:53] <domme_> nada
[21:12:59] <domme_> so only nightlies might break
[21:13:06] <domme_> which is a natural risk of using nightlies

[21:19:32] <theli_ua> and all the wrappers 
[21:19:39] <theli_ua> and add default implementation for testConfig
[21:20:03] <theli_ua> aand do we really not need wrappers? (ie what if resovler throws when testing config)
[21:21:15] <domme_> throwing should be handled as a rejected promise
[21:21:20] <domme_> MrMaffen: oh, i see
[21:21:39] <domme_> the _adapter_ logic is in the legacy resolver code
[21:22:25] <domme_> thus the _adapter_testConfig is not automatically called
[21:22:29] <domme_> puh
[21:22:34] <theli_ua> yes
[21:22:36] <domme_> gimme a bit, i'll think about it
[21:22:51] <theli_ua> thats why there is no _adapter_testConfig
[21:23:16] <theli_ua> eh, in my branch anyway
[21:23:35] <domme_> yes yes
[21:23:49] <domme_> ah
[21:24:09] <domme_> so.. this calls _testConfig which is in the baseclass, which in turn calls testConfig on the subclass
[21:24:21] <theli_ua> eh
[21:24:24] <theli_ua> yes
[21:24:32] <domme_> this kinda makes sense
[21:24:50] <domme_> so https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/blob/bfe30fd983a387e4c632ca02fb0f5acac1897816/src/libtomahawk/accounts/ResolverAccount.cpp#L527 is actually right

[21:24:57] <theli_ua> well, the wrapper is still outdated since it doesn't check if resolver even returned Success
[21:25:06] <theli_ua> ie if resolver returns Error it'll report success
[21:25:07] <theli_ua> :D
[21:25:32] <domme_> no
[21:25:37] <theli_ua> yes
[21:25:39] <domme_> no
[21:26:00] <theli_ua> :-/

[21:26:39] <theli_ua> ohwait
[21:26:41] <domme_> ah, you mean literally return
[21:26:42] <theli_ua> eh
[21:26:59] <theli_ua> domme_: well, thats how new-age resolvers behave
[21:27:09] <theli_ua> they can return all kinds of errors 
[21:27:09] <domme_> we were talking about different things
[21:27:11] <theli_ua> just return
[21:27:28] <domme_> yes, it should take the return of testConfig into account
[21:27:37] <theli_ua> yes, thats what I was talking about
[21:27:38] <domme_> i just did not implement it, because tomahawk does not handle it yet
[21:27:49] <domme_> i was talking about throwing errors
[21:27:54] <theli_ua> I know
[21:28:02] <theli_ua> but I said return error not throw error
[21:28:04] <theli_ua> :P
[21:28:51] <theli_ua> domme_: I'm confused, if tomahawk doesn't handle it , how does it differentiate if test failed or succeed?
[21:30:26] <domme_> just by resolving or rejecting the promise
[21:31:49] <domme_> MrMaffen: so are you doing it in android with promises?
[21:35:21] <domme_> theli_ua: ah
[21:35:29] <domme_> i think the idea was ... just throw the error :P
[21:36:05] <domme_> but we can also add a convenience wrapper that throws errorneous return values

[23:00:01] <lfranchi> btw OS X qt4 build is broken -- known?
[23:00:05] <lfranchi> QMacToolbar is qt5 only
[23:00:22] <domme_> lfranchi: we dont mean to support qt4 anymore
[23:00:26] <domme_> if we do it's by accident
[23:00:34] <lfranchi> ah k
[23:00:47] <lfranchi> does qt5 on mac look usable e.g. the settings dialog? :)
[23:00:49] <domme_> and i dont feel like removing ifdefs before all qt5 issues are ruled out
[23:01:01] <domme_> lfranchi: i think jherskowitz is on qt5 on mac
[23:01:07] <domme_> you'd have to ask him :-)
[23:01:10] <domme_> or muesli
