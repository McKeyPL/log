[00:00:07] <dommex> okay, a bit more context:
[00:01:14] <dommex> i implemented "link parser" plugins. they even work by now.. just when a song is provided by such a plugin, it has no connection to a resolver or collection (which kinda makes sense) ... but that now means there's no source icon or nice source text
[00:02:32] <dommex> now i'm wondering what's the correct approach how to handle this
[00:03:07] <dommex> the plugin is supposed to have a connection to the scriptaccount ... so i could use the icon and name of the scriptaccount.. does that make sense?
[00:04:02] * theli_ua is confused
[00:04:12] <theli_ua> I dont really get what you are talking about
[00:04:13] <dommex> so am i :-D
[00:04:43] <dommex> ah ok. i see. the linkparser thing sets a result hint on the query
[00:04:52] <theli_ua> how there could be a result from a plugin if a plugin is not a resolver or connection
[00:04:57] <dommex> which is no proper result with a connection to a resolver or an account
[00:06:46] <dommex> theli_ua: jherskowitz: before i broke everything :P, how did it look when a song was dropped to a playlist? did the playlist entry have a proper source icon / name? or did it always look a bit quirky?
[00:07:44] <dommex> oh.. i have an old dropped track that behaves the same as the new one.. i think i can just commit this and optimize ... later
[00:08:33] <theli_ua> it wasn't looking like its from any resolver
[00:08:40] <theli_ua> just as an unresolved track
[00:08:44] <dommex> yeah ok
[00:08:50] <dommex> that's shit. but at least no regression
[00:08:52] <theli_ua> well, iirc
[00:09:00] <dommex> yeah, it'S what i'm seeing now
[00:09:13] <theli_ua> I was mosttly "dropping" playlists ... and those resulted in ... well ... playlists 
[00:09:39] <theli_ua> not different to any other playlists
[00:13:19] <dommex> okies, cool

[00:26:04] <dommex> theli_ua: wanna give this a spin? ^
[00:26:34] <dommex> you will have to do a superduperovercomplicated fix to any resolver you wanna test tho
[00:26:39] <theli_ua> :(
[00:26:52] <dommex> -        Tomahawk.reportCapabilities(TomahawkResolverCapability.UrlLookup);
[00:26:58] <dommex> +        Tomahawk.PluginManager.registerPlugin('linkParser', this);
[00:27:17] <theli_ua> I'm not qualified for that kind of stuff
[00:27:40] <dommex> yeah, i was afraid it was way beyond your js skills
[00:31:04] <dommex> theli_ua: are you going to try it?
[00:31:09] <theli_ua> yeah
[00:31:14] <dommex> great, thanks
[00:31:15] <theli_ua> give me a minute
[00:31:29] <dommex> sure, just wanted to know whether you were going to or not. no rush :)
[00:32:45] <theli_ua> I'm compiling tomahawk
[00:32:48] <theli_ua> it takes a while
[00:32:51] <dommex> yeah, i know
[00:33:03] <dommex> especially when *someone* has changed externalresolver.h
[00:37:47] <theli_ua> so, I dropped the link http://listen.tidal.com/playlist/53daf5f3-b0b7-401c-b455-149146d44fd2 and nothing happened
[00:38:58] <theli_ua> and it won't allow me to drop artist or album links from tidal either
[00:39:44] <theli_ua> dommex: 
[00:40:00] <dommex> meh
[00:40:14] <dommex> is the above a track link?
[00:40:33] <theli_ua> playlist
[00:40:39] <theli_ua> I don't have track links
[00:40:57] <dommex> ah ok :|
[00:47:14] <theli_ua> dommex: why not just use spotify-metadata resolver? o_O
[00:47:32] <dommex> mhhh.. ah, yeah
[00:47:35] <dommex> let me see
[00:48:05] <theli_ua> it doesn't require account
[00:48:27] <theli_ua> just drag https://play.spotify.com/artist/0oSGxfWSnnOXhD2fKuz2Gy 
[00:49:21] <theli_ua> https://play.spotify.com/album/2w1YJXWMIco6EBf0CovvVN for album and https://play.spotify.com/track/0Fao855T3klV3REFRFHRF3 for track
[00:50:05] <dommex> yeah, i just ... need to port it ...
[00:54:00] <theli_ua> also, there quite a few PRs for tomahawk and resolvers, some more than 4 years old
[00:54:25] <theli_ua> those should either accepted or rejected at this point imo
[00:54:27] <muesli> theli_ua: non finished ones tho
[00:55:15] <theli_ua> there are also a bunch of finished ones nor accpted nor rejected :P
[00:55:36] <theli_ua> https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/pull/258  there was no reply, nothing
[00:56:14] <muesli> theli_ua: will is/was part of the irc channel. github isn't the only way to communicate ;-)
[00:56:18] <theli_ua> this should just be rejected https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/pull/298 if not acceptable
[00:56:46] <theli_ua> muesli: I haven't seen him in a while, and wheres the audit trail????!!!
[00:57:01] <muesli> the audit trail for 5 lines of code?
[00:57:05] <dommex> theli_ua: is the track link blackstar by david bowie? :P
[00:57:15] <theli_ua> dommex: I think so
[00:57:21] <dommex> so that works :P
[00:57:33] <theli_ua> muesli: if there was some communication on the state of that change. 
[00:57:39] <dommex> theli_ua: where can i drop artist and album links at all?
[00:58:41] <theli_ua> dommex: I think that area where the currently playin track is displayed? muesli should know
[00:58:59] <dommex> or jherskowitz 
[00:59:04] <muesli> anywhere i would assume
[01:00:23] <theli_ua> dommex: might also try playlist https://play.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/7MQd3rOe8kuP2KDjtuiynJ
[01:00:38] <theli_ua> I usually dropped/saved those into my playlist list
[01:00:39] <theli_ua> iirc
[01:03:53] <dommex> where do you drop it then?
[01:03:59] <dommex> onto the create row?
[01:04:16] <theli_ua> I think just somewhere where the other ones where?
[01:04:31] <dommex> ah
[01:04:33] <theli_ua> the result was created playlist, yes
[01:04:33] <dommex> crashed
[01:04:37] <theli_ua> nice
[01:04:46] <theli_ua> my guess would be you dropped it correctly
[01:04:49] <theli_ua> :D
[01:04:51] <dommex> yep
[01:06:50] <dommex> wat
[01:06:57] <dommex> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/RAWH1tZu/
[01:08:02] <theli_ua> it went inside spotify resolver
[01:08:09] <theli_ua> not spotify-metadata it seems
[01:08:09] <dommex> yeah
[01:08:17] <theli_ua> disable it?
[01:08:20] <muesli> dommex: seen this one before btw
[01:08:33] <dommex> muesli: really? :|
[01:08:45] <jherskowitz> dommex: URL lookup should be independent of source imo
[01:09:17] <jherskowitz> First it looks it up and populates metadata.  Then resolves. 
[01:09:26] <dommex> jherskowitz: maybe, but the result hint makes it look ... non nice. anyway.. that's for later, i didnt break anything ;-)
[01:09:57] <dommex> yeah, maybe if a result returns the same url as a result hint ... we could match it up ... or something
[01:10:05] <muesli> dommex: yeah, last couple days in the crash reports
[01:10:42] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: sometimes having result hints when importing playlist was the only way for me to listen exactly to what I wanted to
[01:10:54] <theli_ua> also, shouldn't you all be sleeping by now >_<
[01:11:03] <dommex> theli_ua: it's only 1am?!
[01:11:15] <dommex> that's when muesli and i used to start working ;-)
[01:12:25] <theli_ua> :-/
[01:15:44] <theli_ua> hm, doesn't look like resolver's weight is being accounted for
[01:16:29] <theli_ua> i have 2 resolvers, one having weight 76, another one 91 and 76 one is being preffered without any apparent reason
[01:18:55] <dommex> muesli: any idea how spotifyparser.cpp relates to spotify metadata js?
[01:21:51] <muesli> theli_ua: define preferred
[01:21:56] <muesli> theli_ua: preferred when and for what
[01:22:12] <muesli> dommex: no idea
[01:22:33] <theli_ua> muesli: used as a top-level result, aka the one played by default
[01:22:57] <muesli> theli_ua: weight defines the order in which resolvers are executed
[01:23:18] <muesli> since we changed it to always retrieve results from all resolvers, weight has become meaningless
[01:23:22] <theli_ua> uh, whats the point of that?
[01:23:25] <theli_ua> alright
[01:23:53] <theli_ua> so how would one make results from one resolver be preffered from another one?
[01:23:54] <muesli> it used to be, that we only ran through the pipeline until we found _one_ result
[01:24:20] <muesli> theli_ua: by returning correct metadata. then only the score decides the sorting
[01:24:45] <theli_ua> but metadata is the same
[01:24:56] <muesli> then we could still rely on weight i guess
[01:25:16] <dommex> muesli: btw, what has happened to the dropjob-menu thing mzanetti (iirc) did back in the day?
[01:25:25] <muesli> kicked it
[01:25:30] <theli_ua> I would be fine with weight being "tie-braker"
[01:25:57] <theli_ua> I'll see if I can implement that
[01:26:07] <theli_ua> that would be fine with you muesli dommex ?
[01:26:34] <muesli> theli_ua: yeah, definitely
[02:11:03] <dommex> wtf, i could reproduce it all the time
[02:11:13] <dommex> (the spotify crash ... but now i cant at all)

[02:38:55] <jayt> hi
[02:39:17] <dommex> jayt: i read you wanted to work on the remote control api? :)
[02:41:25] <jayt> Yes, it would be great if the remote control could select which music one wanted to play, not just starting/stopping playback.  Trying to get a feel for whether the architecture would support that easily.

[02:42:55] <dommex> jayt: it shouldnt be tooooooo hard
[02:43:49] <dommex> especially if you start with just the local database
[02:46:45] <jayt> sure. is there a general api for supporting the various resolvers? are there multiple different types of resolvers? is there a resolver used just for local storage?
[02:47:01] <dommex> yes, yes and yes
[02:47:03] <dommex> :-)
[02:47:30] <jayt> that's good
[02:48:25] <dommex> well, the third yes is a "kinda"
[02:48:51] <jayt> when I used the program I saw that one resolver for Google music, created an icon on the side and allowed lots of interaction.  whereas the youtube resolver behaved very differently from user perspective.  No icon.  I thought it was broken at first.
[02:49:03] <dommex> there is Resolver which is the baseclass for everything... then there are different implementations of that api: e.g. database resolver (which is for local but also for remote tomahawk collections), there are javascript resolvers and external (stdio) resolvers
[02:49:34] <dommex> icon on the side? in the sidebar? you mean the collection?
[02:49:45] <dommex> the thing is ... there is no such thing as a youtube collection
[02:51:07] <jayt> yes.  I came into this cold just the other day.  I guess collection is the term.
[02:52:25] <jayt> so a resolver for a collection ultimately derives from this same base class?
[02:54:59] <dommex> jayt: i juggled things around a bit lately. a collection is a resolver as well, yes
[02:55:25] <dommex> most importantly any resolver has a bit of metadata (like a name, icon, etc) and a resolve method
[02:56:00] <dommex> the collection adds artists(), artistAlbums() and albumTracks() methods for the artists view, albums() for the album view and tracks() for the flat view
[02:57:21] <jayt> cool.  I can't wait to learn more about the code base.  Do you have a recommendation on where I should start? Are there any architecture docs? Is the project confifigured for doxy?
[02:57:44] <dommex> jayt: unfortunately we don't have really meaningful docs :(

[02:59:38] <jayt> I built the source code the other day at the command line and installed it.  I then used the cmake -G generators to create an eclipse .project.  Was able to build there as well.  It didn't seem to run but it may have been because I already had the daemon running  before I tried to run it within eclipse single stepping environment.
[03:00:00] <dommex> never tried to run it from eclipse :)
[03:00:06] <dommex> what platform are you on?
[03:00:36] <jayt> I was ecstatic that it built and at least began to start!  What is your method of development with IDE, etc?
[03:00:55] <jayt> Linux Mint
[03:01:04] <dommex> depending on my mood, i use kdevelopr or qtcreator
[03:01:08] <dommex> or often simply kate
[03:01:22] <dommex> shouldnt matter really
[03:01:34] <dommex> but yeah, you can run only one instance of tomahawk at a time
[03:01:45] <dommex> so if there was one running already, it makes sense that you couldnt launch another one
[03:02:36] <jayt> ok.  I work well in eclipse.  So you just make at the command line and run from the directory with simple text editor?
[03:03:17] <dommex> yup
[03:03:34] <dommex> i have this command line habit. but nothing should stop you from working with eclipse if you're used to that
[03:04:24] <dommex> i just can't help you with cmake generating eclipse files, as i never tried to do that
[03:05:42] <jayt> No prob.  Like I said, I was impressed that it was able to generate the working eclipse project files that actually worked...  I'll probably just start looking at the codebase and generate a list of questions for you.  I hope it doesn't get too daunting for you to field lots of stupid questions.
[03:07:05] <dommex> jayt: nah, it will just make me feel bad for not having written documentation.
[03:07:12] <jayt> :)
[03:07:38] <dommex> jayt: i know tomahawk is a huge beast, feel free to shoot any question you have, no matter how stupid it may seem
[03:07:48] <jayt> what is your role in the project? are you currently one of the lead developers?
[03:08:23] <dommex> at least i'm the most active one currently :-)
[03:09:01] <jayt> what is your real name?
[03:09:22] <dommex> jayt: i'm dschmidt on github if that's what you wanna know
[03:10:25] <dommex> and Dominik Schmidt in the source file headers ;-)
[03:10:47] <jayt> ok.  Is this the best way to contact you? I'm new to IRC.  Can I send a personal note or should I just blast to the overall group?
[03:11:20] <dommex> jayt: irc is usually your best bet to contact me
[03:11:33] <dommex> feel free to ask anything here, chances are that other people are able to answer
