[11:50:43] <muesli> moin gordie
[11:51:04] <gordie> hi muesli, how are u ?
[11:52:01] <muesli> quite alright. how about you?
[11:52:11] <gordie> I was just fantasizing about this idea : you know, on spiff-radio.org (I'm currently reworking on it), there is dynamic stations that have a form the visitor can fill
[11:52:41] <gordie> and it would generate a dynamic playlist (for BBC, for Last.fm, for Spotify, ....).  Was wondering if it would be one day possible to include this into THK
[11:53:06] <muesli> got an example how that works?
[11:54:41] <gordie> Yeah... The basic idea is to recognize variables is urls, eg. https://open.spotify.com/user/%user_id%/playlist/%playlist_id%
[11:55:04] <gordie> THK could get the %% variables and build form inputs based on that... And then fetch the "feed". 
[11:55:17] <gordie> It could be coded like resolvers, in javascript
[11:55:29] <gordie> So people could extend it
[11:55:45] <gordie> (because some URLs need to be redirected to parse the tracklists, etc)
[11:55:52] <muesli> w
[11:55:59] <muesli> so what would it do with those variables?
[11:56:30] <gordie> allow the user to "fill" them inside THK with form inputs
[11:56:36] <gordie> live example here on spiff-radio : http://www.spiff-radio.org/station/radionomy-station/
[11:56:54] <gordie> you can try with, for example, "http://www.radionomy.com/fr/radio/alternativeradio/index" (great station !)
[11:59:07] <gordie> so THK would be able to receive all kinds of URLs (not only spotify ones)
[12:00:21] <gordie> you see what I mean ?
[12:01:28] <gordie> 1/ someone codes an extension for radionomy or another service 2/ user loads a radionomy url :)  
[12:02:06] <gordie> then drag-drop the url, and it's done... :>
[12:02:20] <muesli> i don't quite understand it yet, sorry :)
[12:02:47] <muesli> what exactly do you do with those urls / variables?
[12:02:59] <gordie> ah ah :) well, as THK allow user to extend it with resolvers, it could allow to extend supported playlist urls too
[12:03:19] <gordie> to grab playlist from every service possible
[12:03:58] <gordie> those extensions would just be "bridges" allowing to parse an HTML/XSPF/RSS/JSON... feed and load it as a playlist
[12:04:05] <muesli> i see
[12:04:27] <gordie> like spiff-radio is.  I'm still reworking on it, but my presets looks actually like this : https://github.com/gordielachance/xspf-playlists-generator/tree/master/station-presets
[12:09:21] <gordie> and I guess this could be achieved in JS too
[12:15:41] <gordie> I still think one of the best thing in THK is this idea of dynamic playlists and that it could be improved a lot :)
[12:15:55] <muesli> i kinda hate them :D
[12:16:02] <gordie> Oh yeah ?
[12:16:29] <muesli> just from a technical pov :)
[12:17:49] <gordie> ah, that's another thing :)  I LOVE them because I can listen to radio without ads...  And just inside THK, no needs to go to a website everytime
[12:18:21] <gordie> I listen, mark the tracks as favorites, and never forget them doing so :)
[12:18:52] <gordie> So, what are u working on actually ?
[12:28:17] <gordie> will the next release include the "various artists" stuff ?
[13:47:15] <muesli> a few improvements there, yeah
[13:51:08] <gordie> cool
[14:41:21] <dommex> Hey gordie!

[19:54:54] <justin_time> Hey, pushing tomahawk into the debian sources will be very hard. I argued that Clementine also uses company logos but this could lead to an Release Critical Bug against Clementine because of violating the debian free software guideline. :-( It looks like that the package will not be ready until the DebianImportFreeze of ubuntu 16.04. And so I decided to try to update the old tomahawk package on ubuntu directly. But I really 
[19:54:54] <justin_time> do not know how. It's really frustrating.
[20:37:40] <muesli> hey justin_time
