[02:37:03] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: working on it ... :D
[02:37:22] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: well, it works perfectly for me for most of the tracks
[02:37:25] <theli_ua> just not for that one
[02:37:48] <theli_ua> from what I figured it doesn't work at all on android, right MrMaffen ?
[02:38:49] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yea but that's not what I'm trying to accomplish right now. my goal is to first and foremost fix the search function and to make the whole thing maintainable
[02:39:00] <MrMaffen> after that I'll test it on android and see why it doesn't work there
[02:39:28] <theli_ua> oooh , making it maintainable sounds too good to be true
[02:39:33] * theli_ua is excited
[02:40:40] <MrMaffen> heh
[02:40:56] <MrMaffen> well I don't think I'll touch the parsing logic for now, but the rest looks pretty good already
[02:41:17] <MrMaffen> btw can you paste me the response you get from https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?key=AIzaSyD22x7IqYZpf3cn27wL98MQg2FWnno_JHA&part=snippet&maxResults=5&order=relevance&type=video&q=Queen+Auto-generated+by+Youtube ?
[02:41:52] <MrMaffen> I'd really like to know if that "Auto generated by YouTube" query really makes a difference
[02:42:31] <MrMaffen> but I have a feeling that I might not get relevant results because I'm in germany :/
[02:43:14] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: nvm, I'm simply using a proxy
[03:14:09] <theli_ua> Do you get the differences MrMaffen ?

[04:09:08] <theli_ua> Well but it uses both queriez
[04:09:08] <MrMaffen> I'll go get some sleep now. nini
[04:09:21] <MrMaffen> yea it does
[04:09:26] <theli_ua> And some tracks only resolve for me with it
[04:09:45] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: which ones?
[04:09:52] <theli_ua>  I'm fine with taking only first one from auto query
[04:09:55] <MrMaffen> would be nice to have some example tracks I can try
[04:10:08] <theli_ua> Afk right now
[04:12:01] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: ok, just send me some example tracks when you can

[16:12:12] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: oh nvm ... looked at the wrong response
[16:13:47] <HorusHorrendus> I have an idea for the YouTube resolver
[16:14:27] <HorusHorrendus> often people in videos (esp. when they cover songs or on their own songs) do a section at the beginning or end where they are like: "hey guys ... check out my other videos, subscribe to my channel and blabla"
[16:15:04] <HorusHorrendus> remove those sections via the YouTube resolver ;)
[16:15:54] <MrMaffen> HorusHorrendus: you mean you want to remove silence at the beginning/end of a youtube video?
[16:17:44] <MrMaffen> that would have to be done in the audioengine then
[16:18:09] <HorusHorrendus> MrMaffen: no not silence ... speaking parts
[16:18:38] <HorusHorrendus> e.g. at the end YouTubers often say things like: "hey guys watch my other videos and click the subscribe button" or things like that
[16:19:27] <MrMaffen> HorusHorrendus: so you want to analyze a video and determine which parts are speech and which parts are actual music?
[16:20:02] <MrMaffen> doesn't sound feasible to me ... at all
[16:21:12] <HorusHorrendus> MrMaffen: yeah probably not ;)

[17:41:57] <MrMaffen> jherskowitz: I can, but only the last one from february obviously :S
[17:42:04] <zaphar_ps> ummmm hrmm
[17:42:12] <zaphar_ps> I think your website is down or under heavy load
[17:42:13] <jherskowitz> MrMaffen: that‚Äôs the last OS X nightly I think
[17:42:21] <jherskowitz> zaphar_ps: yeah, known issue
[17:42:24] <MrMaffen> zaphar_ps: it's down :( yea
[17:42:27] <jherskowitz> we are fighting with it right now
[17:42:31] <zaphar_ps> okie,
[17:42:32] <MrMaffen> zaphar_ps: I'll upload the latest nightly to my gdrive
[17:42:44] <zaphar_ps> ah nice thanks
[17:43:15] <jherskowitz> MrMaffen: good thing you have them, I had to free up space on my MBA to install new xcode
[17:43:21] <jherskowitz> so I deleted all of my old nightlies

[17:44:03] <MrMaffen> jherskowitz: I don't have them, but for w/e reason I am able download nightlies from http://download.tomahawk-player.org/nightly/mac/?C=M;O=D
[17:44:04] <tomabee> [ Index of /nightly/mac | download.tomahawk-player.org |  ]
[17:44:22] <jherskowitz> MrMaffen: odd.  muesli ^
[17:44:33] <MrMaffen> zaphar_ps: here you go https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0OEIHngt2GhN2J1bmt1M09GR00/view?usp=sharing
[17:44:33] <tomabee> [ Tomahawk-20150205.dmg | drive.google.com |  ]
[17:44:34] <MrMaffen> hope that helps
[17:45:23] <zaphar_ps> cool
[17:45:27] <zaphar_ps> I'll give it a shot.
[17:48:09] <zaphar_ps> okay! interesting factoid that I either missed earlier or wasn't present earlier but tomahawk is complaining about a cert error connecting to android.clients.google.com
[17:48:16] <zaphar_ps> would that be related?
[17:48:46] <theli_ua> that'd be related to cert issues on osx
[17:48:59] <theli_ua> jherskowitz , muesli ^
[17:49:32] <zaphar_ps> still no dice on the tracks showing up it's reporting 3241 tracks in the sidebar which sounds about right
[17:49:41] <zaphar_ps> but no artists or albums are showing up.
[17:50:12] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: nightlies are built from master, right?
[17:50:35] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: not lately due to switch to Qt5
[17:50:42] <theli_ua> ohwait, nvm, in any case nightly for osx is ancient
[17:50:43] <theli_ua> yeah
[17:50:43] <MrMaffen> zaphar_ps: yes that's definitely related ... there's a known issue with cert problems on osx
[17:50:49] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yep
[17:50:59] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: normally nightlies are built from master though
[17:52:08] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: did I get it right that despite comments on youtube pr you took everything in your hands and I shouldn't worry about that one anymore?
[17:52:19] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yes :)
[17:52:25] <theli_ua> alright, nice
[17:52:45] <theli_ua> haven't had any free time lately, still want to address those comments on other resolvers' prs
