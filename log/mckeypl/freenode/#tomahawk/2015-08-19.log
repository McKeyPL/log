[02:28:52] <theli_ua> no clear examples on usage
[02:29:06] <theli_ua> not clear if its still uses qid or I shoudl return promises
[02:33:26] <theli_ua> and like, I don't get any arguments passed into function in call to 'albums'
[02:33:53] <theli_ua> am I supposed to respond with all albums in collection regardless of artist?
[02:34:12] <theli_ua> ... why is there a call to get artist names then ..

[20:39:12] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: nice!
[20:39:26] <jherskowitz> does it support flat tracklist view too?
[20:39:52] <theli_ua> It is possible to implement that
[20:40:07] <theli_ua> basically w/e web player supports is possible to do
[20:40:16] <theli_ua> and web player supports flat album and flat tracks view
[20:40:18] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: awesome
[20:40:25] <jherskowitz> I’m looking forward to that
[20:40:47] <theli_ua> I think I'll switch now to making it work for everyone before completing collection support
[20:41:05] <jherskowitz> I don’t suppose you want to do a dropbox and box.net resolvers next? :)
[20:41:27] <theli_ua> nope
[20:41:34] <jherskowitz> heh, worth a shot
[20:41:42] <jherskowitz> really lfranchi should do a dropbox resolver
[20:41:47] <jherskowitz> :P
[20:41:53] <theli_ua> well, the problem there is getting the metadata
[20:42:27] <theli_ua> unless you want to rely on filenames only :D
[20:42:48] <jherskowitz> heh.. there has to be a way to get it, no?
[20:43:38] <domme> theli_ua: i hope i can ewview in september
[20:44:16] <theli_ua> I'm not gonna post a pr for that domme
[20:44:17] <domme> maybe cows will kill us tonifht because were camping on their land :p
[20:44:33] <theli_ua> I'll just send it to you in PM and let you do all the fun stuff

[20:47:43] <lfranchi> :)
[20:47:54] <lfranchi> i don't think a dropbox resolver makes much sense really
[20:48:24] <jherskowitz> lfranchi: why?
[20:48:42] <lfranchi> b/c why store media files in dropbox?
[20:49:09] <theli_ua> yeah, just upload them to gmusic
[20:49:12] <theli_ua> and amazon
[20:49:17] <theli_ua> and combine them in tomahawk
[20:49:20] <jherskowitz> lfranchi: b/c they are already there
[20:49:40] <lfranchi> i guess i don't really see the big use case of storing your media files in dropbox
[20:49:46] <lfranchi> is that meant to be as a backup?
[20:50:07] <jherskowitz> lfranchi: well, I used to do it for sync across multiple machines
[20:50:21] <jherskowitz> I’d download stuff at work and it would show up in my iTunes at home
