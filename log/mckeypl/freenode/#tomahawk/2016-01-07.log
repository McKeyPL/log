[17:03:55] <justin_time> dommex: Hey, today I tried to build a tomahawk nightly manually, but it failed because there is a new dependency called "ECM"… but what is ecm and which package are you using for opensuse/fedora?
[17:04:11] <dommex> extra-cmake-modules
[17:04:23] <dommex> justin_time: basically all of kde needs it
[17:04:36] <justin_time> ah ok, thanks!
[17:04:46] <justin_time> I've found it.
[17:04:52] <muesli> extra-cmake-modules usually
[17:04:54] <muesli> as package name i mean
[17:06:23] <justin_time> Btw… now I'm also a co-maintainer of libquazip… I hope the tomahawk-player package for debian will be ready before ubuntu's debian import freeze :-/
[17:06:48] <muesli> that'd be sweet, yeah
[17:06:51] <jherskowitz> dommex: that’s a qt4 nightly?
[17:06:58] <dommex> jherskowitz: no?
[17:07:07] <jherskowitz> hmmm
[17:07:10] <jherskowitz> let me try again
[17:07:18] <dommex> jherskowitz: why would you think so?
[17:07:28] <jherskowitz> the app header
[17:07:54] <muesli> jherskowitz: got a screenie?
[17:08:12] <jherskowitz> I think it was user error… one sec
[17:08:14] <muesli> possibly compiled with the wrong sdk if the header is weird
[17:08:46] <dommex> muesli: it's pretty certainly compiled with the right sdk :)
[17:08:54] <muesli> cool
[17:09:13] <jherskowitz> I’m sure it was user error
[17:09:18] <dommex> :)
[17:09:25] <dommex> looking good now?
[17:12:43] <jherskowitz> dommex: yeah
[17:12:54] <dommex> jherskowitz: cool, any obvious issues?
[17:13:21] <jherskowitz> not yet
[17:13:28] <dommex> great
[17:13:42] <jherskowitz> well… 
[17:13:53] <jherskowitz> amazon locker shows up, but doesn’t play
[17:13:58] <dommex> hehe
[17:14:01] <jherskowitz> same with google
[17:14:12] <jherskowitz> so still SSL issues I think
[17:14:27] <dommex> jherskowitz: can you send me your log?
[17:16:40] <jherskowitz> dommex: y, on it’s way
[17:18:11] <dommex> jherskowitz: okay
[17:18:37] <dommex> jherskowitz: i might need you to run it with --verbose, vlc verbose log isnt logged to the logfile without it
[17:18:43] <dommex> but we'll see
[17:21:08] <justin_time> dommex: Is there a way to find the quazip library without FindQuaZip.cmake module? For example there is no problem with the Qt4 build but the Qt5 build of tomahawk is unable to find libquazip5.so…
[17:21:34] <dommex> justin_time: maybe you need the *upstream* patch to rename the library properly
[17:21:43] <dommex> or you need to patch tomahawk to find the system version
[17:22:10] <justin_time> I've tested a new package… this package includes the upstream patches of CMakeList.txt…
[17:22:32] <dommex> no
[17:23:03] <justin_time> I've patched 0.7.1 with the newest changes of the upcoming release.
[17:23:49] <dommex> mhhh
[17:24:00] <dommex> so you have the QUAZIP_LIB_VERSION_SUFFIX stuff in it?
[17:24:10] <justin_time> Wait a moment…
[17:24:26] <justin_time> I'll show you the git repository of the debian package…
[17:25:25] <justin_time> This is the patch I used: http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-med/libquazip.git/commit/?id=a73f424e3278613b951e4991661d8f53e5cb1a80
[17:26:00] <justin_time> I also push a commit upstream to add the suffix to a static lib, too.
[17:29:37] <justin_time> oh ok, sorry it's my mistake… the official debian package has separated the headers from the development package… I forgot to include the headers… I hope it will work now.
[17:30:22] <dommex> uh oh, ok
[17:33:21] <justin_time> it works :-)
[17:34:14] <justin_time> Yes! All dependencies of the Qt5 builds of tomahawk will be in the debian/ubuntu sources very soon! It's done :-)
[17:34:32] <muesli> nice
[17:35:37] <justin_time> And now I know why the old libquazip-qt5 package didn't work. The maintainer had forgotten to include header files for the qt5 build…
[17:36:29] <dommex> justin_time: you're the man!
[17:36:44] <dommex> we owe you a beer or two .. at least :)
[17:37:17] <justin_time> dommex: Could you instead prepare me a special tomahawk 0.8.4 build for debian, please ;-)
[17:37:52] <dommex> justin_time: a special 0.8.4 build?
[17:38:29] <justin_time> dommex: yep, you know the "debian restriction" … no font, no javascript files,… the bugreport...
[17:38:44] <dommex> oh that..
[17:38:51] <dommex> yeah.. i can try to make some progress on that soon
[17:38:53] <muesli> justin_time: anyone can create a branch essentially :)
[17:40:06] <justin_time> muesli: I also need the CMake tweaks to  use the external packages… and I've not enough time to patch them on my one… sorry.
[17:47:18] <justin_time> Another question... does anyone know why the font of a Qt4 build is bigger than the font of the Qt5 build?
[17:58:31] <dommex> jherskowitz: without having looked at the log, you might just have too old version
[17:58:32] <dommex> s

[19:32:40] <dommex> le wild lfranchi appears
[19:32:51] <jherskowitz> dommex: I didn’t a minute ago
[19:32:53] <jherskowitz> restarting
[19:33:02] <dommex> lfranchi: i hear you wanna finish the dropbox resolver? :P
[19:33:07] <lfranchi> lol
[19:33:08] <jherskowitz> hah
[19:33:11] <lfranchi> doesn't really make sense imho
[19:33:17] <lfranchi> dropbox isn't really a music locker :P
[19:33:26] <dommex> so? :P
[19:33:30] <jherskowitz> dommex: btw, this is what happens on first launch of OS X nightly https://www.dropbox.com/s/2apss4fxf513yzi/Screenshot%202016-01-07%2013.33.18.png?dl=0
[19:33:40] <jherskowitz> until I select something in the sidebar
[19:33:53] <dommex> urgh
[19:33:58] <jherskowitz> related: “discover” section is closed on launch
[19:34:09] <lfranchi> i don't thikn many people store all their music in dropbox
[19:34:24] <lfranchi> also b/c space on dropbox is expensive. why not use a real music locker in that case?
[19:34:34] <lfranchi> (also btw if anyone needs/wants more dropbox space... let me know)
[19:34:52] <jherskowitz> dommex: theli_ua I just pulled latest resolvers
[19:34:55] <jherskowitz> both lockers show up
[19:34:57] <jherskowitz> and resolve
[19:35:02] <jherskowitz> but don’t stream
[19:35:10] <dommex> where did you pull them from?
[19:35:20] <jherskowitz> tomahawk-resolvers
[19:35:24] <dommex> amazon branch?
[19:35:29] <jherskowitz> heh, no
[19:35:53] <lfranchi> dommex: for some reason on my work machine i need this diff to be able to configure properly:
[19:35:54] <lfranchi> -  macro_optional_find_package(Qca-qt5)
[19:35:54] <lfranchi> +  macro_optional_find_package(Qca2)
[19:36:41] <dommex> lfranchi: with qt5?
[19:36:46] <lfranchi> yeah
[19:36:51] <dommex> osx?
[19:37:01] <lfranchi> indeed
[19:37:33] <dommex> lfranchi: did you install this https://github.com/tomahawk-player/homebrew-tomahawkqt5/blob/master/qca.rb ?
[19:37:43] <lfranchi> probably? it's been a while
[19:37:45] <jherskowitz> dommex: git checkout amazon?
[19:37:52] <dommex> jherskowitz: c
[19:37:52] <lfranchi> actually
[19:37:58] <lfranchi> no i self-built against qt5 most likely
[19:38:05] <lfranchi> i don't have the homebrew-tomahawkqt5 tap
[19:38:07] <jherskowitz> dommex: I’m forgetting my git
[19:38:18] <lfranchi> so i had to install most deps w/ qt5 manually
[19:38:34] <dommex> lfranchi: dunno maybe you used some oldish version
[19:38:59] <dommex> lfranchi: make sure to use this one http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/kde/stable/qca-qt5/2.1.0.3/src/qca-qt5-2.1.0.3.tar.xz
[19:39:13] <dommex> or git://anongit.kde.org/qca.git
[19:39:26] <lfranchi> yeah i think i used git, but may be too long ago

[19:59:32] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: well that working amazon resolver is in a branch still

[21:26:36] <theli_ua> nice
[21:55:23] <theli_ua> dommex: there are other amazon domains not listed in resolver ( like es/jp/etc ) but I have no idea do we have music there or not, etc ... So i guess those could be added if some users request them

[23:07:06] <TheOneRing> dommex: with amazon resolver vlc still asserts

[23:08:45] <theli_ua> I totally forgot TheOneRing had vlc assert issues
[23:08:45] <theli_ua> yeah, those wouldn't be fixed by resolver changes

[23:11:08] <alough> can tomahawk work on Raspberry Pi?
[23:11:42] <theli_ua> I can't see why not but you'd need all dependencies compiled for arm
[23:12:02] <alough> so it's not a commonly done thing.
[23:12:37] <theli_ua> I dont think we have nightlies for something like raspbmc
[23:12:37] <theli_ua> and I dont know if someone uses it on rpi
[23:13:51] <alough> Thanks for the info.  Presumably it can be compiled for ARM since it is used on Android.
[23:14:41] <theli_ua> alough: Android is a separate codebase
[23:15:03] <alough> cheers.
[23:15:18] <theli_ua> it doesn't share code with tomahawk (well apart from js resolver  parts)
[23:15:44] <alough> I mean there is a version of tomahawk for android.
[23:16:13] <theli_ua> yes, but its a separate code written specifically for android
[23:16:19] <theli_ua> it doesn't share code with desktop version
[23:16:35] <theli_ua> desktop version is written in C++  and uses Qt+webkit
[23:16:44] <theli_ua> android version is written in Java and uses android apis
