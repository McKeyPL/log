[19:16:24] <domme> lfranchi: isnt that the same? :)
[19:16:28] <domme> hope you enjoyed it
[19:17:05] <lfranchi> haha
[19:17:14] <lfranchi> i did! 2 weeks of camping out and climbing and hiking :)
[19:33:35] <domme> nice
[19:33:41] <domme> envious :)
[19:33:55] <domme> (although i had camping and hiking as well this summer :))
[20:59:19] <domme> feepk: ping
[20:59:24] <feepk> domme: yeah?
[20:59:36] <domme> feepk: do you have crash reports for vlc on ios?
[20:59:42] <feepk> domme: yes, of course
[20:59:56] <domme> hehe
[20:59:58] <feepk> domme: both by Apple and by hockeyapp.net
[21:00:13] <feepk> domme: why that question? :)
[21:01:17] <domme> feepk: sentry is looking for contractors to work on breakpad support for/on ios.. wondered if that was relevant to you in any way
[21:03:32] <feepk> domme: I'm not available to hire or to contract
[21:03:40] <feepk> domme: and breakpad is bad
[21:03:45] <domme> feepk: hehe, why?
[21:03:54] <feepk> domme: use hockeyapp and be happy with 2 lines of code
[21:03:57] <feepk> domme: it's even FLOSS
[21:04:41] <feepk> domme: no, but seriously speaking, the time of third party crash reporting tools is kind of over
[21:04:45] <domme> (you was plural, didnt mean you in person neccessarily but you as a project)
[21:04:53] <feepk> domme: the Apple provided services are quite decent these days
[21:05:06] <domme> okay, fair enough :-)
[21:05:58] <feepk> domme: thanks for letting me know though
[21:06:11] <feepk> domme: and if you need contracting help on libvlc, we are always interested :p
[21:22:59] <domme> anyone else interested in doing some paid ios work? ;-)
[21:23:34] <domme> if someone helped them to integrate breakpad with ios foo, it would pave the way for desktop crash reports too
[21:23:43] <domme> which would in turn help tomahawk :-)
[21:29:24] <jturney1> hmmm
[21:29:37] <jturney1> isn't ios and OSX supposed to work anyhow?
[21:29:47] <jturney1> *already
[21:29:57] <domme> jturney1: yeah, it's not about adding it to breakpad itself
[21:30:23] <domme> it's more about creating an sdk that makes it easy for app creators to integrate it with sentry
[21:30:34] <domme> (instead of socorro)
[21:30:46] <domme> (i think)
[21:31:41] <domme> jturney1: https://paste.kde.org/pnuy9jx1h/rcntxu/raw
[21:34:19] <jturney1> I see
[21:41:06] <jturney1> I don't think they want to use breakpad at all :)
[21:41:58] <domme> yeah, also noticed when i looked at the libs he mentioned
[21:42:58] <jturney1> well, what I meant was "it's design decision" :S
[21:43:23] <domme> jturney1: ?
[21:43:42] <jturney1> heh
[21:45:49] <jturney1> erm, I guess what I was trying to say is that they could use breakpad, or not, and that's a design decision
[21:45:52] <jturney1> and I'm not sure that using breakpad is the right choice :D
[21:46:23] <domme> haha ok
[21:47:33] <jturney1> I guess it depends on the advantages of using minidumps as a cross-platform dumping format to their service...
[21:48:55] <domme> yeah, that's why i'm advertising it... we would benefit from it, we have javascript and go errors already on sentry for hatchet.is
[21:49:26] <domme> would be nice if we could use it for desktop c++ crash reports too
