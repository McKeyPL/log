[18:58:12] <lfranchi> hmmm
[18:58:17] <lfranchi> yeah i never had openssl errors in the first place :-;/
[18:58:20] <lfranchi> i had other weird issues
[18:58:27] <alastairp> hmm. related to that tweet, what do we need to do to make listenbrainz and tomahawak and hatchet play nice?

[18:59:42] <HorusHorrendus> cool
[19:00:09] <alastairp> I’m just trying to work out how I can share part of this presentation to you
[19:00:16] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: listenbrainz, hatchet & last.fm (as long as it still lives)
[19:00:32] <HorusHorrendus> 3-way merging of listening data sounds like fun or? ;)
[19:00:47] <alastairp> yeah :(
[19:01:01] <alastairp> one of our plans was to have some sort of firehose feed
[19:01:09] <alastairp> that could feed between instances of our servers
[19:01:50] <alastairp> can I share a google doc to your email? or do you have a different address?
[19:02:27] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: google doc? yeah I think you can
[19:02:47] <HorusHorrendus> it will automatically then use my gmail adress or so

[19:05:50] <alastairp> I’ll try and chat with him again tomorrow. I guess our biggest unknown is how much time is needed on our side for the mentor part

[23:25:46] <muesli> why look for it in the first place on a non-x11 platform?
[23:25:47] <domme> on linux is a bad bet e.g. 
[23:25:55] <domme> because linux is not the only x11 platform
[23:26:13] <domme> it's a better idea to "duck type" these things

[23:44:56] <theli_ua> I suddenly realised we are doing wrong with our youtube resolver. we should just use the audio-only format of the videos ... most of the recent ones have it
