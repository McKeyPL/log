[19:33:40] <SolarAquarion> Japanese titles are boxes
[19:37:37] <SolarAquarion> theli_ua: the netease bug was fixed?
[19:46:25] <theli_ua> SolarAquarion: sorry, but what bug are you talking about?
[19:47:28] <SolarAquarion> theli_ua: songs not playing?
[19:50:35] <SolarAquarion> It was changed to m5
[19:52:35] <theli_ua> Well m2 also works if you're inside China or use China's DNS servers
[19:52:53] <theli_ua> But yeah, we can change it to m5 
[19:53:31] <theli_ua> I'll look into it on Monday probably
[19:53:34] <SolarAquarion> Also in tomahawk the name becomes boxes
[19:53:58] <SolarAquarion> I think it resolves correctly but it comes out in the UI as bozes
[19:54:02] <SolarAquarion> Boxes
[19:54:13] <theli_ua> Iirc Chinese names showed up correctly for me
[19:54:27] <theli_ua> I don't think that's resolvers problem
[19:54:34] <SolarAquarion> Ok
[19:54:43] <theli_ua> Does it work for you in any other resolvers?
[19:54:47] <SolarAquarion> It's Japanese names perhaps
[19:59:05] <theli_ua> SolarAquarion: so, does it work for you in any other resolvers?
[19:59:34] <SolarAquarion> What do you mean in other resolvers
[20:03:09] *** Joins: modeno1 (~modeno1@gateway/web/scrollback.io/x-qpqyerrnlgkdqlrg)
[20:03:10] <modeno1> Can someone give me a hand with setting up tomahawk on qt?
[20:04:19] <theli_ua> SolarAquarion: well, does tomahawk show proper symbols for Chinese/Japanese titles for results from other resolvers or local collection
[20:05:26] <SolarAquarion> What other resolvers show Japanese names?
[20:15:38] <lfranchi> modeno1: go ahead and ask and people can try to help
[20:17:05] <modeno1> ok, so i cloned the repo, installed qt (on windows, btw) what do I have to do next? the instructions document is offline
[20:20:36] <lfranchi> OK building from source on window is a bit of a challenge
[20:20:46] <lfranchi> I would recommend using our releases if you are on windows :)
[20:22:03] <modeno1> that's the thing though, I was trying to setup the source so i could run the test that are available and check the coverage for a college assignement xD
[20:24:22] <lfranchi> I'm not sure tomahawk has ever been compiled natively on windows
[20:24:28] <lfranchi> our windows releases are cross-compiled on open-suse
[20:25:00] <lfranchi> in general c++/qt development of apps with dependencies on windows is a gigantic pain in the ass. you'd have to  download+compile manually each dep
[20:25:10] <lfranchi> i've done it before and... it's not fun
[20:31:48] <modeno1> crap... well, i have an ubuntu vm, would it be easier there?
[20:32:27] <jherskowitz> re lfranchi 
[20:48:16] <modeno1> ?
[21:00:38] *** Joins: meaning (~meaning@095-097-075-204.static.chello.nl)
[21:03:18] <lfranchi> modeno1: yeah for sure :)
[21:03:34] <lfranchi> building on linux is easy, just a matter of installing the deps via your package manager and compiling tomahawk
[21:04:02] <lfranchi> jherskowitz: btw looks like the wiki is gone?

[21:54:21] <modeno1> lfranchi2: ok, so I have qt on ubuntu vm, should I use the software center to download the dependencies?
[22:27:50] <modeno1> In any case, can someone tell me what the code coverage percentage is for the tests that are in /src/tests/ ?
[22:40:11] *** Joins: apb__ (~apb@174-134-224-109.res.bhn.net)
[23:29:10] <modeno1> and btw, what is a servent in Tomahawk's context
[23:32:55] <muesli> modeno1: the coverage isn't all too high, i'm afraid. we desperately need more tests
[23:32:58] <muesli> (and some decoupling)
[23:34:19] <muesli> modeno1: the servent is used for connecting two tomahawks
[23:42:35] <modeno1> muesli2: so apart from eye examination, pull requests aren't tested in any other way?
[23:43:08] <modeno1> the only tests are the ones that are present in /src/tests/
