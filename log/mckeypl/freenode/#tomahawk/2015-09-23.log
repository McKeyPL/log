[00:28:28] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: I thought we played RTMP streams
[00:28:44] <jherskowitz> we did that for an Rdio hacky resolver years ago I thought
[00:28:46] <jherskowitz> ?
[00:29:01] <theli_ua> you do, but there are issues
[00:29:25] <theli_ua> basically there are 3 components to rtmp streams - host, app, playpath
[00:30:00] <theli_ua> ffmpeg and vlc through transition  ... use a single URL for rtmp streams and ffmpeg tries naively split components using '/' ... so host/app/path
[00:30:14] <theli_ua> the thing is - app has '/' in it for rhapsody
[00:33:48] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: does what I said make sense to you?
[00:34:46] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: heh, not really.  I mean I’m sure it makes sense… just not to me. :)
[00:35:04] <theli_ua> :(
[00:35:51] <jherskowitz> ffmpeg is ultimately what will handle it?
[00:37:32] <theli_ua> yeah, ffmpeg/libav is libvlc's decoding backend

[00:43:15] <theli_ua> more flexibility for resolver in specifying rtmp stream parameters
[00:44:09] <theli_ua> though I kinda prefer to figure out how did I make http rhapsody streams work for me yesterday

[01:17:06] <domme> jherskowitz: theli_ua: isnt beatsmusic rtmp too?
[01:18:24] <domme> i think xhochy sent some patches to vlc, libav/ffmpeg and librtmp or something :D
[01:31:28] <theli_ua> domme: maybe, I dunno
[01:31:46] <domme> i think i added rtmp handling code just for that to hatchet :P
[01:32:00] <theli_ua> domme: I'm not saying that rtmp doesn't work, just doesn't work if rtmp "app" string contains slash
[01:32:22] <theli_ua> because ffmpeg uses slash to split app from playpath in the url
[01:33:35] <domme> theli_ua: oh uh mhh.. https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk-resolvers/blob/master/beatsmusic/content/contents/code/beatsmusic.js#L205

[01:34:05] <theli_ua> domme: ?
[01:34:17] <domme> do you concatenate the parts of the rtmp url by slist too?
[01:36:16] <theli_ua> no, why would I? that has nothing to do with the problem I'm talking about
[01:38:29] <domme> theli_ua: well either i'm too late to the party or you're really withholding with anything concrete.. maybe just be a little more concrete then i can maybe follow and be of any actual help :P
[01:38:54] <theli_ua> i was just explaining this to jherskowitz 
[01:39:22] <theli_ua> there are 3 things to the rtmp stream usually - host, "app" and "playpath"
[01:39:50] <theli_ua> if ffmpeg is provided a single url it just uses "/" character to get those from the url
[01:40:07] <theli_ua> so it just does   host, app, path = url.split('/')
[01:40:21] <theli_ua> but if app has "/" in it then this just doesn't work
[01:40:34] <theli_ua> and you need to specify app as additional parameter
[01:41:06] <theli_ua> through rtmp_app parameter
[01:42:15] <domme> rtmp://host[:port]/[app]?slist=[playpath]
[01:42:19] <domme> in that format it breaks?
[01:42:29] <theli_ua> slist?= is not part of rtmp
[01:42:44] <theli_ua> its totally specific to that beatsmusic or cdn they use
[01:42:44] <domme> theli_ua: but it's supported by ffmpeg

[01:43:56] <domme> as i said xhochy upstreamed that to *all the libs* because it was not possible to pass through additional arguments through vlc easily iirc
[01:44:42] <theli_ua> oh it was accepted, this should work, yeah
[01:45:04] <theli_ua> "because it was not possible to pass through additional arguments through vlc easily iirc"  yeah , pretty much the problem I was trying to explain
[01:47:50] <domme> theli_ua: hehe, then i got you right from the beginning on :P
[01:47:59] <domme> just 23:36:16 < theli_ua> no, why would I? that has nothing to do with the problem I'm talking about

[01:49:25] <domme> theli_ua: let me know how it goes :)
[01:49:42] <theli_ua> that slist= thing is usually a part of playpath on some cdns
[01:49:43] <theli_ua> so
[01:49:57] <domme> eh meh
[01:51:01] <theli_ua> doesn't work
[01:51:36] <theli_ua> i can easily stream with rtmpdump, no success with vlc/ffmpeg
[01:52:01] <theli_ua> though it might be that my ffmpeg is old
[01:54:01] <theli_ua> also, looking at that code you linked domme, looks like its stripping all other query params from the url, and I have & and ? as parts of the playpath
[01:54:03] <theli_ua> so
[01:54:29] <domme> theli_ua: then ... you know what you have to do *sigh*
[01:54:41] <theli_ua> yeah, forget about it 
[01:54:46] <domme> hahaha
[01:55:00] <domme> xhochy: how about another round of patching libav, ffmpeg and librtmp?
[01:55:21] <theli_ua> its really easier to do that with just tomahawk frankly
[01:58:08] <theli_ua> like, have a custom url scheme something like tomartmp://proto=rtmpe&app=a4376%2fv3  where it would just call libvlc_media_set_option to set those on a stream
[02:00:51] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: rtmp streams do not work in tomahawk on android, do they?
[02:01:16] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: they do
[02:01:37] <theli_ua> oh, really? o_O  what do you use to play them there?
[02:01:47] <MrMaffen> libvlc
[02:02:13] <theli_ua> oh, didn't realise android version uses libvlc as well
[02:02:50] <MrMaffen> yea it does :) plays flac and ogg and all that good stuff
[02:26:57] <theli_ua> rievic2: its not even in beta atm, tomahawk does not support rtmp urls rhapsody uses and there is no ETA on that
[02:31:59] <theli_ua> eh, I take that back
[02:32:10] <theli_ua> I just played rhapsody rtmp stream in vlc
[02:32:20] <theli_ua> I need more coffeine and vacation

[18:44:59] <domme> lol wut.
[18:45:41] <theli_ua> I dunno, after that either vlc or ffmpeg split url correctly 
[18:45:48] <domme> kk
[18:47:00] <theli_ua> domme: I still have my rhapsody_mobile branch where I get http urls ... though as I now know android suports rtmp as well I'm less motivated to work on it
[18:47:29] <theli_ua> also, the one in PR parses out all of needed api keys, etc out of web app's js files, while in mobile one they are hardcoded

[18:49:14] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yes I currently bundle resolvers with every apk I build
[18:49:46] <MrMaffen> in the long-term domme and I want to replace synchrotron with a better sync manager (maybe relaxe) wiht proper versioning support
[18:50:08] <MrMaffen> as soon as we have that I will obviously no longer bundle resolvers with the apk

[19:46:36] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: so is that one (I got it from their style guide)… that app icon is specifically mentioned for use with “mobile apps” but they use this flat icon everywhere else
[19:48:14] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: http://www.rhapsody.com/marketing/images/RhapsodyStyleGuide2012.pdf
[19:51:07] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: is there any ETA on new release? I'm interested in bundling rhapsody, amazon and my small bandcamp resolvers on android
[19:51:43] <theli_ua> amazon one is kinda .. tricky .. I guess .. I want it upstream but I don't want to post a pr or be mentioned anywhere related to it

[19:58:24] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: I did mine as transparent png
[19:58:27] <jherskowitz> so no white box
[19:58:51] <theli_ua> well thats the one I got from your link
[19:59:24] <jherskowitz> weird
[20:00:01] <jherskowitz> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/8JbSYyjq/logo.png
[20:00:32] <jherskowitz> it’s transparent on osx
[20:00:40] <jherskowitz> maybe something screwy with the file
[20:00:53] <theli_ua> wait no, I got log.png link extracted by tomabee
[20:01:06] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: I don’t have religion on it… I just think their “app icon” looks like it was made in 2009… which it was. :)
[20:01:16] <jherskowitz> I just looked at what they were using on Twitter, FB, etc.
[20:02:20] <theli_ua> still looks pretty shitty imo http://i.imgur.com/gqbITbQ.png
[20:03:22] <theli_ua> imo this looks a bit better http://i.imgur.com/1FO1AIp.png 
[20:03:34] <theli_ua> domme: opinions on last 2 image links?
[20:04:31] <domme> theli_ua: just the icon?
[20:04:35] <theli_ua> yes
[20:04:50] <theli_ua> jason prefers transparent one, I prefer solid one
[20:05:18] <theli_ua> I think transparent one looks fine in track view but blends with background in now playing view
[20:05:21] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: also look at it inline
[20:05:36] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: yours is fine
[20:05:36] <domme> theli_ua: and i dont care :D
[20:05:43] <jherskowitz> I’ll just change mine locally :)
[20:06:08] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: file muesli a jira issue to not only allow user to set priorities for resolvers but also a user set icons :D
[20:08:01] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: btw, I took a look at mixcloud ... while technically its possible but I don't thinnk it'll work good with tomahawk's philosophy
[20:21:04] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: if the legality of those resolvers is questionable then we shouldn't bundle them with tomahawk-android
[20:21:43] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: legality is exactly the same as legality of bundled, say, gmusic resolver
[20:21:52] <MrMaffen> no eta for a new release sry. but I can guarantee you that I want a a new release just as much as you do
[20:23:25] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: hm ok. yea then we might want to bundle it. maybe not with the next release but with the one after that
[20:23:36] <MrMaffen> did you already get it to work through manually installing it as an axe?
[20:24:19] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: I mean, nor gmusic nor tidal endorse listening to their streams from 3rd party apps, I'd say rhapsody is the same in that regards
[20:24:44] <theli_ua> as long as we wont allow saving of those streams ...
[20:25:27] <theli_ua> I'd say almost all of the resolvers (with the exception of spotify which has an official API) are in the grey area
[20:25:46] <theli_ua> which is kinda sad tbh

[20:30:00] <MrMaffen> all media server resolvers are also not in the grey area
[20:30:20] <theli_ua> yeah, i was more talking about commercial streaming services
[20:30:53] <MrMaffen> yep but rdio deezer and spotify are fine. even beatsmusic had an official api
[20:31:05] <theli_ua> had
[20:31:25] <theli_ua> and I didn't know that deezer and rdio have official api
[20:32:06] <theli_ua> but still, you do bundle gmusic and tidal :)
[20:34:01] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yea maybe we should go the aggressive route and just bundle them and see if anyone complains about it
[20:34:39] <theli_ua> that'd be cool but honestly I'd be more cautious since its pretty easy to have your play store dev account locked forever afaik
[20:35:11] <theli_ua> if anything I wouldn't bundle anything at all except for ampache and friends and have an online repo with resolvers available from within app
[20:35:51] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: guess that wouldn't make a difference as far as google is concerned
[20:36:04] <theli_ua> maybe :(
[20:36:14] <MrMaffen> you'd just avoid the automatic check 
[20:36:24] <MrMaffen> we'll see
[20:36:32] <MrMaffen> first we'll have to release before we get banned :D

[23:13:03] <alastairp> lfranchi: for now it’s a way that we can crowd source accessing the data, and not give last.fm a way to lock us  out
[23:13:21] <lfranchi> i see... last.fm isn't happy with you folks I guess>
[23:13:24] <lfranchi> jherskowitz: fwiw worked for me
[23:13:32] <alastairp> future plans are to import the downloadable archives (from the old lastfm), and probably some api interface too
[23:13:54] <alastairp> the api gives more data, too (second resolution - the website only minute, and mbids)
[23:14:00] <alastairp> we’ve not heard anything from them 
[23:14:40] <jherskowitz> alastairp: oh, maybe wrong page
[23:15:06] <jherskowitz> I was on /overview

[23:21:44] <jherskowitz> I think that happened last try too
[23:22:49] <alastairp> yeah. I thought I had fixed this, but it looks like there’s still a probem somewhere :(
[23:22:57] <alastairp> I’ve not had these problems
[23:23:06] <alastairp> not sure if it’s because I have too few pages
[23:23:19] <alastairp> or people have odd scrobble data
[23:23:41] <alastairp> (this is about the point where we admit that the api would be a better choice)
[23:24:36] <alastairp> do you have any errors in the developer console?
[23:24:57] <alastairp> if you run it again, does it stop on the same page?
[23:25:37] <jherskowitz> alastairp: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)
[23:25:45] <alastairp> ooooo
[23:26:03] * alastairp looks at logs
[23:32:32] <lfranchi> yeah mine hung
[23:32:47] <lfranchi> on 3054 of 3335 pages
[23:33:26] <lfranchi> can also report some 500s
[23:33:36] <alastairp> hung is such a harsh word :)
[23:33:55] <alastairp> yeah, I found the 500 error. I was catching the psycopg2 exception, not the wrapped sqlalchemy one :(
[23:34:02] <lfranchi> hung is harsh? :P
[23:34:05] <lfranchi> i was being gentle ;)
[23:34:14] <alastairp> “it’s a piece of crap stop trying"
[23:34:27] <lfranchi> <3
[23:34:44] <lfranchi> but fo realz last.fm needs to live on
[23:34:53] <alastairp> so, I added a bunch of fixes, but it still stops working
[23:35:03] <alastairp> I’m going to have to add some debug values
[23:35:35] <lfranchi> should i try to restart?
[23:44:45] <alastairp> one sec
[23:46:42] <alastairp> OK. can you run it again
[23:46:56] <lfranchi> trying
[23:47:04] <alastairp> when it stops, inspect element on the popup, there’s a hidden span with some debug info
[23:47:40] <lfranchi> k
[23:51:14] <alastairp> I should have fixed the 500s, too
[23:53:58] <lfranchi> dispatched 2472, reportedScrobbles 2472, enqueueReport 2472, getPage 2471, number4xx 0, number5xx 0, page 4942
[23:55:30] <alastairp> wait. page looks funny
[23:55:37] <alastairp> what page did it stop on?
[23:57:09] <lfranchi>  Sending page 2471 of 3335 to ListenBrainz
[23:58:30] <alastairp> right
[23:59:20] <alastairp> so it sent that 2471, went to send the next one. for some reason incremented the page counter by… something
[23:59:40] <alastairp> 4942 is 2x 2471, wich is suspicious
