[22:54:57] * theli_ua hates javascript
[22:59:08] <theli_ua> muesli: why does 'albums' view in collection is totally different to artists and tracks?
[22:59:42] <theli_ua> ie both artists and tracks actually represent w/e is in the collectoin, while 'albums' view is basically a list of links to standard albums and artists pages
[23:02:14] <muesli> theli_ua: yeah that'll change with 0.9
[23:02:22] <muesli> you'll get to pick the source of the track listing
[23:02:38] <muesli> which can then default to "My Collection" instead of "MusicBrainz" when coming from the local collection
[23:02:48] <theli_ua> so whats the eta on you guys starting to work on tomahawk?
[23:02:50] <theli_ua> :)
[23:03:48] <theli_ua> muesli: could you explain how is filter supposed to work on collections?
[23:03:58] <theli_ua> ie when I open track listing from the album from artists view
[23:04:13] <theli_ua> does filter need to be applied to .. artists? albums? tracks? everything?
[23:04:19] <muesli> everything
[23:04:35] <theli_ua> eh
[23:04:40] <theli_ua> every one, or all combined?
[23:05:54] <theli_ua> ie applied 
[23:05:54] <theli_ua> 'artist album track' LIKE filter
[23:05:54] <theli_ua> or
[23:05:54] <theli_ua> arist LIKE filter AND album LIKE filter AND track LIKE filter
[23:08:04] <theli_ua> muesli: ?
[23:08:32] <muesli> artist.contains(filter) ....
[23:08:39] <theli_ua> ... yes but
[23:08:44] <muesli> AND ... AND ...
[23:08:58] <theli_ua> oh
[23:09:03] <theli_ua> that doesn'tmake sense
[23:09:23] <theli_ua> why would all of artist album and track contain the same string o_O
[23:09:30] <muesli> er sorry
[23:09:34] <muesli> i'm really really really tired
[23:09:58] <muesli> WHERE artist.contains(filter) OR album.contains(filter) OR track.contains(filter)
[23:10:11] <theli_ua> ok, that does make sense

[23:15:17] <theli_ua> I think support for filter in that JS collection for 0.9 support is the only thing I'm missing so far
