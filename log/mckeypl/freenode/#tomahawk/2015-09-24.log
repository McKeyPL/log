[01:09:40] <theli_ua> domme: that is actually a copy from tidal which is a ... I have no memory of where it came from
[01:10:30] <theli_ua> its a way not to lose search until login process is done
[01:11:17] <domme> theli_ua: but then it should be done through login().then() and maybe have login() internally handling the _loginPromise thing
[01:12:09] <theli_ua> login is called from init which sets resolver.loginPromise
[01:12:41] <domme> theli_ua: yes
[01:12:53] <theli_ua> getLoginPromise is split into a function as it is also used to testConfig
[01:13:01] <domme> theli_ua: i'm just saying ... if you call it again, it could simply return the loginPromise if set ... then you don't need that defer
[01:13:15] <theli_ua> probably
[01:13:20] <theli_ua> I don't understand javascript
[01:13:52] <theli_ua> but yeah, I see what you mean
[01:13:59] <theli_ua> actually, let me try this
[01:14:19] <domme> theli_ua: could be much more readable
[01:14:25] <theli_ua> domme: though I think this should be handled outside of resolvers
[01:14:33] <domme> theli_ua: what exactly?
[01:14:44] <theli_ua> waiting till resolver becomes "ready"
[01:15:06] <domme> yes
[01:15:32] <domme> in fact ... i was preparing that with my scriptobject refactor early this year, i just never got around to finishing it
[01:15:58] <domme> ultimately the idea was ... have a script account that handles the state and registers a resolver as scriptPlugin when it's ready
[01:16:15] <domme> and removes it again when it knows it's not logged in anymore or something
[01:16:24] <theli_ua> makes sense
[01:16:49] <domme> yup, it's just a bunch of work still.. basically it's more or less blocked by an accountmanager refactor
[01:17:05] <domme> (maybe)
[01:17:47] <domme> the initialisation of accounts and resolvers right now is completely flawed, it makes my head hurt whenever i open those classes. i'm surprised it works kinda well atm :-\
[01:19:51] <domme> i wish i could spend more time on that, i'll try to get source maps working with my tomahawk-compiler tomorrow to see if they actually work with qtwebkit... then we know a bit more about the way forward
[01:19:56] <theli_ua> domme: so .. if loginPromise is already resolved i can still .then it?
[01:20:01] <domme> yep
[01:20:07] <theli_ua> what if promise was errored?
[01:20:13] <domme> then it will fail again
[01:20:17] <theli_ua> nice
[01:20:24] <domme> yep, it's one of the niceties of promises
[01:20:56] <domme> theli_ua: https://promisesaplus.com/ <-- if you're really interested in the semantics
[01:20:57] <tomabee> [ Promises/A+ | promisesaplus.com | https://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png ]
[01:22:07] <domme> theli_ua: also you can always trust the callback to be only executed in the next runloop iteration, i.e. as if it was invoked with setTimeout(0)
[01:22:21] <domme> it will never execute immediately
[01:22:37] <domme> even if the promise is already in resolved state
[01:23:07] <theli_ua> btw, whats the plan on making android and desktop api-compatible ? :)
[01:24:48] <domme> theli_ua: talking about the collection foo?
[01:24:59] <theli_ua> eh, everything
[01:25:08] <theli_ua> every single method is incompatible atm
[01:25:55] <domme> theli_ua: i want to spend a bit of time on all that during the next weeks.. i.e. not working full time on it, but a few hours every day
[01:26:00] <theli_ua> well, from what I understood my pr for that "make it at least compatible" would be discarded in favor of "make a new clean tomahawk.js for both desktop and android"
[01:26:12] <domme> theli_ua: first i want to sort out my compiler work to have a clearer way forward
[01:26:13] <theli_ua> So I am wondering what is a way forward
[01:26:17] <theli_ua> I see
[01:26:18] <domme> ah no
[01:26:21] <domme> we can merge it now
[01:26:28] <domme> sorry
[01:27:49] <theli_ua> its just I kinda don't like the way I'm making new resolvers - that hacky way to detect if I'm running under "new 0.9" pr "old 0.9"
[01:27:57] <theli_ua> *or

[01:30:10] <theli_ua> it works for me

[01:32:45] <domme> theli_ua: mind cleaning that up as well? and the other newApi hacks?
[01:33:02] <theli_ua> domme MrMaffen speaking of that ... you need to update gmusic, tidal etc in syncrotron now as well
[01:33:14] <domme> hehe
[01:33:21] <theli_ua> otherwise people who use nightlies will get broken resolvers

[01:33:49] <domme> theli_ua: just that android doesn't use synchrotron yet :)
[01:34:21] <theli_ua> sure, i'm just saying that versoins currently in synchrotron are incompatible with master 
[01:34:26] <theli_ua> as of 5 minutes ago
[01:34:28] <theli_ua> :D
[01:34:57] <domme> mhh.. but the new versions arent compatible with old tomahawks no?
[01:35:26] <domme> sooo ... i really need to get up a second synchrotron instance
[01:35:54] <theli_ua> define "old tomahawks"
[01:36:03] <theli_ua> not compatible with 0.8 yes
[01:36:04] <domme> annything released e.g.
[01:36:07] <domme> yup
[01:36:12] <theli_ua> well, tidal never was
[01:36:35] <domme> so we would break everyone on a release tomahawk .. for the sake of keeping nightly builds in tact.. nope, not going to happen :)
[01:36:36] <theli_ua> and now, tidal in synchrotron is not compatible with nightlies either
[01:36:54] <domme> oh well, can update then yes
[01:37:00] <theli_ua> because the one in synchrotron uses "old style 0.9"
[01:37:04] <domme> just not the ones that used to work with 0.8
[01:37:21] <theli_ua> sure
[01:40:26] <domme> theli_ua: i dont see tidal in synchrotron
[01:40:40] <theli_ua> oh, hm, I thought its there
[01:40:46] <domme> :)
[01:41:02] <theli_ua> so ... there are no 0.9 resolvers in synchrotron?
[01:41:12] <domme> theli_ua: shouldnt be no
[01:41:18] <theli_ua> ah, ok then
[01:41:39] <domme> theli_ua: btw ... talking about tidal .. which used to be one resolver for two services, right? 
[01:42:01] <theli_ua> domme: the wimp branch of tidal was merged
[01:42:14] <domme> theli_ua: with the system i have in mind we can actually handle that a bit nicer soon. i.e. having two resolvers which share code ... not via copy and paste
[01:42:22] <theli_ua> ie when tidal was acquired by jay z everything got merged under the same brand/endpoint
[01:42:35] <domme> yup, just saying..
[01:42:54] <domme> e.g. there's also hmv that uses the 7digital api
[01:45:59] <domme> theli_ua: i'll start with that stuff tomorrow morning, i'll let you know how it goes. if it works out well, i could use your help modularizing tomahawk.js :)

[19:04:05] <domme> so much for the compiler ... now ... i should probably start porting a first resolver

[19:04:19] <theli_ua> Wat
[19:04:27] <domme> theli_ua: your latest additions were very simple, right? i'd start with one of those
[19:04:28] <theli_ua> Should be nvidiaStrict
[19:04:33] <domme> theli_ua: LOL
[19:04:57] <domme> theli_ua: amd is async module definition :)
[19:05:04] <theli_ua> Domme bandcamp is tiny
[19:05:26] <domme> theli_ua: okies, will take care of that later
[19:05:38] <domme> before i should get some actual work done tho :)
[19:05:46] <theli_ua> But you can accept all pending prs while you're at it 😁

[19:19:15] <domme> that's how i imagine resolvers should look from now on

[19:54:58] <domme> theli_ua: that's the same as {url:url} in es6
[19:55:03] <domme> it does not work in es5
[19:55:12] <theli_ua> domme: so I'm asking why not do this then :)

[19:57:12] <domme> theli_ua: ah, i did a bunch of updates after i first sent you the link
[19:57:41] <domme> e.g. the match result destructuring: var [, , band_id, id] = track.hint.match(/^bandcampm:\/\/([a-z]+)\/(\d+)\/(\d+)$/)
[19:57:43] <theli_ua> domme: btw, this resolver needs one more thing .. while you at it :)
[19:57:52] <theli_ua> domme: yeah, I just took a look at updated version
[19:58:14] <domme> in fact i'm not saying everyone has to use all these shiny new syntactic sugar features.. just wanted to show off, what's possible now
[19:58:50] <theli_ua> domme: you can notice that we're only searching for track name ... while taking only first 3 results .... we should try and look at results ourselves to see if theres a matching artist not in first 3 results
[19:59:11] <domme> theli_ua: i just wanted to have a syntax showcase
[19:59:12] <domme> ;-)
[19:59:16] <theli_ua> :P
[19:59:39] <domme> while i can compile this ... it doesnt actually work in tomahawk yet, because that needs of course adjustment too
[19:59:53] <domme> but right now i'm looking into a hatchet issue for realz
