[00:02:15] <dommex> TheOneRing: great :) 
[00:02:22] <dommex> i didnt change anything about that recently
[00:02:28] <TheOneRing> ^^
[00:02:30] <dommex> TheOneRing: why do you tell me? :P
[00:02:46] <TheOneRing> because your the only one responding?
[00:02:52] <dommex> lol
[00:02:58] <dommex> TheOneRing: file a bug and i'll look into it soonish
[00:03:00] * theli_ua just merged master, got tidal broken
[00:03:14] <dommex> theli_ua: likely
[00:03:22] <theli_ua> Q.Q
[00:03:38] <dommex> what is broken? just streaming?
[00:03:40] <theli_ua> gmusic collection appeared though
[00:03:51] <theli_ua> dommex: I'm looking into it, not resolving
[00:04:13] <dommex> you know --show-inspector=tidal right?
[00:04:15] <theli_ua> also, gmusic not streaming
[00:04:18] <dommex> and console.log *g*
[00:05:22] <theli_ua> also multiple undefined error logs from all the places (multiple resolvers)
[00:05:28] <theli_ua> why did I do this >_<
[00:05:32] <theli_ua> amazon still works though
[00:06:28] <theli_ua> dommex: I do know we have inspector
[00:06:55] <dommex> yeah, i need to fix ... things
[00:09:28] <theli_ua> undefined when evaluating Tomahawk.reportCapabilities(TomahawkResolverCapability.UrlLookup)
[00:10:14] <theli_ua> dunno why gmusic stopped working
[00:14:56] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: wouldn't that line make tidal broken on android as well? https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk-resolvers/blob/master/tidal/content/contents/code/tidal.js#L92
[00:15:12] <theli_ua> I dont think TomahawkResolverCapability.UrlLookup is defined anywhere now
[00:37:31] <dommex> theli_ua: commented on your bug report
[00:37:36] <dommex> theli_ua: it's not a thing anymore
[00:37:47] <theli_ua> yeah, i saw it
[00:38:01] <theli_ua> and I have it in my other resolvers :(
[00:38:08] <theli_ua> like, vk.com
[00:41:25] <dommex> maaaaaaaaaaaybe .... i just planned to implement it -_-
[00:42:31] <dommex> i never used it, so that might explain why i forgot about it
[00:47:59] <theli_ua> oh
[00:48:28] <theli_ua> so, tomahawk desktop doesn't support dropping track/playlist/album/artist links?
[00:48:50] <dommex> atm not, no -_-
[00:48:51] <dommex> sorry :(
[00:49:03] <dommex> but ... it's rather easy to add
[00:49:21] <dommex> either i can guide you through implementing it ... or can try to do it early next week
[00:50:47] <theli_ua> oh I'm not in a rush, I might poke it later 
[00:51:47] <dommex> at least i'm optimistic that i will actually get to writing code soon again ... :)
[00:52:06] <theli_ua> :)
[00:52:07] <dommex> not like in the last months when i always had to do shittiest deployment tasks :P

[15:17:31] <jherskowitz> dommex: theli_ua: so I’m running the same nightly + same resolvers on two different MacBooks (both running 10.11.2). gmusic streams on the Macbook Pro but fails on Macbook Air.  How is that possible?
[15:18:20] <dommex> jherskowitz: dunno. are you sure you got it from current tomahawk-resolvers master both times?
[15:18:32] <dommex> jherskowitz: or was it once installed via synchrotron maybe?
[15:18:38] <dommex> dunno if we have it there
[15:18:42] <jherskowitz> no, reinstalled both from master
[15:18:46] <dommex> mhmhhh :\
[15:18:59] <jherskowitz> unless I’ve got it installed multiple times maybe
[15:20:30] <dommex> jherskowitz: yeah, hard to tell from afar.. 
[15:20:32] <jherskowitz> huh… the gmusic on the Pro (that works) is 0.6.3
[15:20:42] <jherskowitz> the one that doesn’t work (Air) is 0.6.4
[15:20:56] <dommex> that's fishy to say the least
[15:21:05] <jherskowitz> yeah
[15:21:09] <dommex> i mean if they were installed from the same source they should at least be the same version
[15:21:30] <dommex> wat
[15:21:35] <dommex> in master it's 0.6.3
[15:21:45] <dommex> no clue where that 0.6.4 is from
[15:22:20] <jherskowitz> the one I just reinstalled from master is (now) 0.6.4
[15:22:32] <dommex> ah nope
[15:22:38] <dommex> sorry, my master was outdated
[15:22:44] <dommex> interesting
[15:22:50] <jherskowitz> and that doesn’t work
[15:22:51] <jherskowitz> now
[15:23:02] <jherskowitz> so something broke between 0.6.3 and 0.6.4
[15:23:04] <dommex> that would also explain why amazon branch worked and master did not
[15:23:09] <jherskowitz> right
[15:23:12] <dommex> MrMaffen must haven broken it in the meantime :P
[15:23:23] <dommex> jherskowitz: okay, i will look into this
[15:23:25] <jherskowitz> glad I figured it out though… was driving me crazy
[15:24:25] <dommex> jherskowitz: yeah thanks
[15:24:50] <dommex> jherskowitz: what's broken exactly? just the streaming?
[15:26:00] <jherskowitz> dommex: y
[15:27:46] <jherskowitz> yeah, went back to 0.6.3 and works again
[15:28:05] <dommex> jherskowitz: cant be bad

[19:15:11] <endich> just a question, is it a known bug that the album view isn't working properly?
[19:16:56] <theli_ua> jherskowitz, dommex  the difference between purchases and prime hls streams is: with purchases resolver gives https mp3 link, that is handled by tomahawk itself, passing mp3 data to vlc. Now with prime's HLS stream - we get https link to m3u, that m3u is being downloaded by tomahawk itself, but it contains other https links to stream chunks which are handled
[19:16:56] <theli_ua> by VLC itself.

But when i choose a album, dubbel click on it, then i only see the track "grayed out" and get a error "sorry couldn't find the number 'xxx' from 'xxx' "
[19:21:05] <theli_ua> do the track names in album view match track names in your files?
[19:21:14] <endich> yes!
[19:21:30] <endich> also a lot of album covers are missing, never had that with banshee / xnoise / itunes before

[19:25:35] <jherskowitz> so, album view of your collection works a bit different than most expect
[19:25:38] <endich> my library is so clean that it almost did work in every music programm, sometimes just a few songs which weren't ordered by the alubms
[19:25:56] <jherskowitz> it actually looks up the album tracklist first, then tries to resolve to your available sources
[19:26:12] <jherskowitz> so you will often see tracks listed (grayed out) that you don’t have in your library

[19:39:36] <jherskowitz> ah

[19:45:58] <jancoow> just a question; why not fetch is like any other music player on id3 tags?
[19:45:59] <jherskowitz> my recommendation is to use the tracklist and sort by artist
[19:46:32] <jherskowitz> we plan on adding a feature to let you choose where to get album info for
[19:46:34] <jherskowitz> from
[19:46:54] <jherskowitz> but given we streaming from so many sources, we do a lot of things differently :)
[19:47:06] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: with gmusic ssl is handled by tomahawk itself, with prime's hls streams it is handled by libvlc used by tomahawk
[19:47:16] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: ah, interesting
[19:47:27] <jherskowitz> but it plays in VLC

[19:48:16] <jancoow> yeah never seen a application that could stream from so much platforms

[23:42:34] <jancoow> jherskowitz: why not? i'm sure it will improve matching the songs
[23:45:04] <jherskowitz> jancoow: lots of other stuff to do :) 
[23:45:19] <jancoow> also noticed that some of my songs are not matched because there is (Feat. Patrick Stump & Travis Barker) for example in the name
[23:45:34] <jancoow> ah oke :)
[23:46:30] <jancoow> would like to help but i'm not that good at c++
