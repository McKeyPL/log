[00:41:00] <domme> i suck so much at c++ apparently, that i don't understand why or why it wont fix that issue :P
[00:42:52] <theli_ua> it always allocates memory even when size is zero
[00:43:07] <theli_ua> but when deleting it'll only call 'free memory' thingy if the size is more than zero

[22:41:34] <theli_ua> domme: I guess this one is for you since it relates to resolvers
[22:45:55] <domme> theli_ua: i don't think i like that, can't you make that part of http requests?
[22:46:04] <theli_ua> no
[22:46:08] <domme> why?
[22:46:50] <theli_ua> because js resolvers are implemented through webkit in a way that they are just "js scripts running on a page" and js does not allow you to set user agent
[22:47:40] <domme> theli_ua: not completely true: https://github.com/theli-ua/tomahawk/blob/user_agent/src/libtomahawk/resolvers/JSResolverHelper.cpp#L895

[22:47:42] <theli_ua> if that would be done through native request then I'll loose cookies I believe
[22:48:17] <domme> meeeeeeeeeh
[22:48:18] <domme> :|
[22:48:24] <theli_ua> ohwait, I know
[22:48:28] <domme> then you need to implement cookies on that
[22:48:41] <theli_ua> I remember now - native request won't follow redirects, thats why i wasn't able to use it
[22:49:44] <theli_ua> domme: whats the big deal with having a per-resplver user agent? if anything, resolver wanting to fully pretend like some particular agent would be the most common use case
[22:52:05] <domme> theli_ua: then we need to implement request following (with a limit) then
[22:52:09] <domme> theli_ua: that's crap
[22:52:15] <theli_ua> ?
[22:52:22] <theli_ua> could you elaborate?
[22:52:27] <domme> theli_ua: it's inflexible, if you want something like that ... you need to implement it in a wrapper function per resolver
[22:52:39] <theli_ua> well, it is per resolver
[22:52:52] <domme> it badly couples things
[22:53:12] <domme> right now every resolver has its own webkit instance
[22:53:18] <domme> maybe it wont in the future
[22:53:18] <theli_ua> in fact, i want every request to be issued with the same user agent
[22:53:28] <domme> yes, then add a wrapper function to do that
[22:54:39] <theli_ua> I'll see if I can do that, next week maybe
[22:55:36] <domme> i just don't want to add api that i can have a bad timing maintaining in the future
[22:55:38] <theli_ua> you guys are inconsistent, this is inflexible and you are not ok with that, but you are ok with breaking head of resolvers with head of tomahawk for months :-/  weird
[22:55:45] <domme> :P
[22:55:56] <domme> breaking is not inflexible
[22:56:00] <domme> theli_ua: patches welcome
[22:58:54] <theli_ua> also, cookies are also inconsistent between android/tomahawk 
[22:58:57] <theli_ua> :-/
[22:59:25] <theli_ua> tomahawk-android wont handle Set-Cookie header while tomahawk will
[22:59:57] <domme> theli_ua: okay, let me elaborate more: when doing Tomahawk.get() (or whatever) and it takes the useragent from the resolver .. it couples two globals together in a very intransparent way
[23:01:09] <domme> theli_ua: i would be probably ok, if you added a account.ajax() wrapper around Tomahawk.ajax (or whatever that function is) and if only that adds the useragent
[23:01:50] <domme> ah
[23:01:54] <domme> that doesnt work... mhh... 
[23:02:07] <domme> i believe the correct solution is really to do it through native request 
[23:02:08] <domme> :-\
[23:02:28] <domme> theli_ua: you can also see if qtwebengine offers more possibilites to intercept requests
[23:05:40] <theli_ua> I just see it as resolver configuring its environment
[23:05:56] <domme> yes, and it's bad to magically couple the environment
