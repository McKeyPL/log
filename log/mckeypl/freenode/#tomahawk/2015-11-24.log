[15:08:43] <ishets1> just attempting to open Charts causes it (after a few moments for the response)

[17:28:35] <bronin> is it kind of linked to IRC or such ?

[17:37:32] <bronin> oki, cool to know :) thx
[17:37:47] <domme> :)
[17:38:06] <bronin> what the status of tomahawk next release ? I understood you guys are working on a website (hatchet ? )
[17:39:23] <domme> bronin: yes, we are working on hatchet.is a lot
[17:39:40] <domme> but we are also fighting a few last issues with qt5 on osx.
[17:40:09] <domme> i personally have been working on making the resolvers completely compatible on all platforms again. i.e. in the last year all platforms slightly diverged (desktop, android, hatchet)
[17:42:30] <bronin> ok, and how is hatchet fitting with desktop app tomahawk ? as the social server ?
[17:44:03] <domme> yes
[17:45:00] <bronin> would I want to get to this website or it will be better experiences through desktop app ?
[17:45:25] <domme> both has benefits, it's certainly not one or the other :)
[17:45:40] <bronin> k, it seems pretty neat when surfing on it sofar
[17:45:46] <bronin> you guys really outdone yourself

[20:27:43] <howudodat> hey guys am looking for advice on how to do something that /seems/ stupidly simple. I have all my music organized into categories on the filesystem.  Each artist has it's own playlist of my favorite songs.  In windows, I was able to search for .m3u and grab all the playlists drag and drop them into media player and then sync to my phone / sd card.
[20:27:56] <howudodat> I can drag and drop a single playlist onto tomahawk, but not multiple
[20:34:27] <domme> howudodat: oh
[20:34:37] <domme> howudodat: interesting, can you file a bug report for that?
[20:34:54] <domme> can certainly be solved, but sounds like someone needs to do the work of actually implementing it
[20:35:07] <howudodat> ok

[21:10:42] <HorusHorrendus> howudodat: yes Tomahawk is OpenSource

[21:19:48] <howudodat> hmm..ok, I'll play with this a bit.  of the build instructions pages lead to 404 errors.  and cmake isnt' happy with one of the config files...I'll poke on it after lunch

[21:55:22] <domme> howudodat: our server died the other week
[21:55:35] <domme> that's why build instructions point into void
[22:01:52] <howudodat> oh, sorry to hear that.  can you give me a quick start for ubuntu?
[22:11:45] <domme> howudodat: well, basically exactly like you build any other program with cmake
[22:12:05] <domme> e.g. in the source folder: mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
[22:12:11] <domme> then it will tell you what deps it's missing
[22:12:14] <howudodat> that;s what I figured too...I'm probably just missing a dependency
[22:13:08] <howudodat> do I need extra cmake modules?
