[01:06:49] <theli_ua> wa
[01:07:15] <theli_ua> what are those desktop files even for
[01:16:37] <dommex> theli_ua: don't ask
[01:16:41] <dommex> synchrotron oddness
[01:16:54] <dommex> actually they are supposed to be autogenerated ... but the script that does it ... seems to be lost
[01:17:02] <dommex> need to find someone who still has it :P
[01:17:19] <dommex> guessing lfranchi or teo might have it - at least .rb sounds like them :P
[01:17:58] <dommex> theli_ua: anyway .. in master you should be able to install amazon from our servers directly, no manual fuckery with tomahawk-resolvers/ git
[01:18:28] <theli_ua> well, I'm using my own fork with resolvers (as well as player) anyway
[01:25:22] <dommex> theli_ua: hehe, as you like.. just saying it's easier for people now to get it
[01:25:31] <theli_ua> thanks :)
[01:26:22] <dommex> jherskowitz: ^ if you could test the nightly, it would certainly be much appreciated... it's very well possible tho, that updating the resolvers wont automatically work.. as the desktop files arent updated from the .json files automatically.. will try to get the json2desktop.rb asap to fix
[01:29:57] <dommex> github is down ... what sorcery is this?
[01:30:16] <theli_ua> huh
[01:33:06] <theli_ua> We're investigating connectivity problems on http://github.com .
[01:36:15] <theli_ua> heh, https://status.github.com/  server availability graph dropped to zero

[11:22:01] <teo-> wat
[11:22:06] <teo-> I do have configure buttons
[11:22:07] <muesli> last.fm is part of tomahawk
[11:22:13] <dommex> not the js part
[11:22:26] <dommex> it's a mixed attica-js/cpp account

[11:23:36] <muesli> linux
[11:24:29] <muesli> interestingly subsonic has a configure button
[11:24:33] <muesli> i do see error messages for it tho
[11:24:35] <teo-> dommex: do you want me to nuke the attica resolvers dir and retry, or should I get you a log first?

[11:28:01] <teo-> dommex: I don't seem to have upgrade checks in my log at all
[11:38:02] <dommex> no clue really
[11:38:16] <dommex> it should be all the same as before basically
[11:38:27] <dommex> that things are now more broken than before doesnt make any sense
[11:38:51] <dommex> muesli: teo-: maybe move your atticaresolvers/ dir aside.. might be good for debugging later.. but with a fresh install it should all work
[11:39:50] <teo-> dommex: welcome to the magical world of synchrotron, where things function the way they do "because fuck you that's why"

[22:43:47] <dommex> theli_ua: you are supposed to distribute it with your application
[22:44:04] <dommex> theli_ua: there's some crazy rule that you may not distribute it with your code
[22:44:10] <dommex> but only with your compiled binary
[22:45:31] <theli_ua>  Instead, you should copy it into your applications folder and deploy it 'application local' with your Win32 desktop application.
