[15:20:29] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: does the YT resolver support drag/drop of YT playlists?
[15:38:40] <dommex> jherskowitz: right now dragndrop is b0rked anyway :C
[15:38:53] <dommex> i got a PR fixing it, but it's still wip
[15:38:58] <dommex> jturney: ping
[15:39:49] <jturney> dommex: pong
[15:41:07] <dommex> jturney: i'm reinstalling our windows crash reports right now and i'm seeing mangled symbol names, any ideas what could be up?
[15:41:16] <jturney> mangled?
[15:41:36] <dommex> jturney: 10  libtomahawk.dll!_ZN8Tomahawk10JSResolverC2ERK7QStringS3_RK11QStringList + 0x461
[15:41:41] <dommex> something like this
[15:42:02] <jturney> hmmm
[15:42:18] <jturney> and you think that should be unmangled?
[15:42:34] <dommex> yeah, i dont see line numbers or filename either
[15:43:21] <dommex> hold on
[15:43:31] <jturney> does the .sym file have the symbol data in it?
[15:43:38] <jturney> for that symbol
[15:46:11] <dommex> jturney nope.. mhh.. wondering if maybe the dump-syms tool needs updating after the update to gcc5
[15:46:29] <jturney> possibly
[15:47:39] <jturney> hmm... I'm trying to think what would be doing the unmangling
[15:49:17] <dommex> jturney: huuuuh. do you think ... maybe it could be a runtime thing in dump_syms? depending on the native binutils or something like that?
[15:49:35] <jturney> I don't think so
[15:49:45] <jturney> It gets all the data from the dwarf sections
[15:50:05] <dommex> jturney: because on my home machine it works, but the files generated on our server (running suse enterprise linux) seem to be b0rked
[15:50:14] <jturney> or should do
[15:50:21] <jturney> the .sym files are borked?
[15:50:31] <dommex> i mean, yeah.. they lack the interesting data :)
[15:50:47] <jturney> are you sure you are using the right dump_syms?
[15:51:17] <dommex> pretty much, at least i'm using the same revision. i packaged it in a distribution package
[15:51:45] <jturney> but a different gcc?
[15:51:45] <dommex> but yeah, let me update everything once more and see if there's some inconsistency somewhere
[15:55:54] <dommex> jturney: uh oh. probably my bad. ran the deployment script several times on the same build dir .. and probably overrode the proper dumps with dumps of stripped binaries
[15:56:06] <jturney> yeah, that makes sense
[15:56:13] <dommex> sorry for the noise
[15:56:26] <dommex> fixing deployment scripts is so annoying and time consuming :C
[15:56:33] <jturney> if the binary is stripped, the .sym will just contain information about the exports, because that's all the information it can get
[15:56:41] <dommex> yup
[15:56:54] <jturney> np
