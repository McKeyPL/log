[17:23:21] <blitz3r> i've been thinking about this issue: https://bugs.tomahawk-player.org/browse/THA-237
[17:23:22] <tomabee> [ Using self-signed certs fails | bugs.tomahawk-player.org |  ]
[17:24:57] <blitz3r> Network access is apparently done by XMLHttpRequest. Is the javascript run by WebView? Shouldn't the cert check succeed if the CA imported into Android trust store?

[21:33:22] <HorusHorrendus> no idea
[21:33:47] <HorusHorrendus> foobar is another music player ... a plugin to read the collection of it? a plugin to play songs from tomahawk in foobar?
[21:33:52] <HorusHorrendus> a bit confusing ;)
[21:34:52] <HorusHorrendus> or maybe he means some really cool music service we all haven't heard of yet?
[21:35:41] <jherskowitz> HorusHorrendus: yeah, just making sure I wasnâ€™t crazy and/or dumb
