[01:37:28] <jherskowitz> btw, I added a note about force linking openSSL
[01:37:30] <muesli> did it install in 5 minutes or 5 hours? :D

[18:29:52] <theli_ua> nice
[18:30:05] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: didn't I ping you when I implemented that ? :D
[18:30:12] <theli_ua> I was going to compile my own version though, and see if I can make cookies work (and amazon resolver)
[18:30:35] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: you did iirc , just wanted to confirm it is not disabled or anything in the build
[18:30:52] <MrMaffen> cool, feel free to ping me when you run into problems regarding the build setup
[18:31:17] <theli_ua> oh, I have it set up, in fact I think I am running my own build with couple of own resolvers built in
[18:31:24] <theli_ua> albeit pretty old version I think
[18:31:28] <MrMaffen> ah ok
[18:31:59] <theli_ua> its just I mostly listen to 'radio' thus I mostly use pandora on my phone
[18:33:22] <theli_ua> oh, wow, jherskowitz tmo even has bandcamp and soundcloud in freedom music
[18:34:22] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: yea same for me. I really want to have stations in the android app. I'll add that right after the release
[18:34:37] <theli_ua> using what, echonest?
[18:34:42] <MrMaffen> yep
[18:35:08] <theli_ua> nice, theres another similar service musicdiscovery, gordie was talking about it here recently
[18:35:27] <MrMaffen> yep read that. I'll look into it
[18:35:39] <theli_ua> we just might want to abstract that and introduce "radio plugins" or something
[18:36:13] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: that's the plan. that'd just be a js infoplugin
[18:36:24] <gordie> yeah, i'm still testing musicovery but for now, I have the feeling the recommandations are better than Echo Nest, but maybe i'm wrong
[18:36:29] <MrMaffen> the tomahawk api is almost ready for js infoplugins
[18:36:39] <MrMaffen> cross-compatible magic all the way
[18:36:41] <theli_ua> oh and btw, are you planning to fix Tomahawk.UrlType vs TomahawkUrlType in tidal MrMaffen ?
[18:37:40] <MrMaffen> yup
[18:40:17] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: domme: btw, do we really need that canParseUrl-function?
[18:40:32] <MrMaffen> I currently ignore that in the android app and just push every url into lookupUrl directly
[18:40:42] <theli_ua> I dunno
[18:40:50] <MrMaffen> either it successfully parses the url or it doesn't
[18:41:07] <MrMaffen> the check in canParseUrl seems redundant to me
[18:41:23] <theli_ua> I think it is used to check if it even allows dropping a particular url on desktop
[18:41:29] <theli_ua> muesli might know
[18:43:25] <MrMaffen> hm yea could be. still seems redundant even if that were the case
[18:43:49] <MrMaffen> drag&drop needs a refactor in tomahawk-desktop anyways
[18:44:55] <theli_ua> isn't there a similar mechanism on android to check whether an app can open a particular url?
[18:45:32] <theli_ua> ie it makes sense to provide tomahawk-android in the list of apps to open spotify/playlist/x and not for spotify.com 
[18:47:02] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: unfortunately I can't dynamically register tomahawk-android as an app that can handle certain urls
[18:47:12] <theli_ua> I see
[18:47:19] <MrMaffen> I need to do that in the androidManifest when building the app
[18:48:10] <theli_ua> yeah, I just googled that, its intent filter in the manifest, not dynamic thing :(
[18:48:33] <MrMaffen> I think it would even make sense to put the lookupUrl code in separate plugins that will always get shipped with the app
[18:50:20] <MrMaffen> that's something I need to think about when we switch over to a proper resolver sync manager 
[18:50:30] <MrMaffen> gnarf ... so much to do ... so little time ^^

[20:23:39] <MrMaffen> domme: well then we should get rid of it with 0.9
[20:24:25] <MrMaffen> sync functions should no longer be a thing. and we can simply throw an Error when lookupUrl can't parse the given url, thus making it also low latency

[21:23:44] <EvilAaron> Still wrestling with last.fm here as its the only 3rd person last.fm scrobbler I can't get working atm. Looking for info to submit to them to help issue. Odd that in desktop app when I test last.fm connection I get a success and I can sync loved tracks and history but in tomahawk log I am getting this,

[22:59:00] <jherskowitz> EvilAaron_: I think they are having issues with their scrobbling endpoint
[22:59:15] <jherskowitz> but history/loved tracks endpoints are ok
[23:00:28] <jherskowitz> muesli: any way for me to see if Qt5 *actually* installed with openSSL support?
[23:02:49] <EvilAaron_> well just fired up the mint virtual box I run tomahawk on back when spotify win 64 was killing me. Last.fm scrobbles fine from the mint install. Guess its back to Tomahawk from a VR box again for a while :)
[23:03:39] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: grep -Hr "define QT_NO_OPENSSL" /location/to/qt/headers ?
[23:04:52] <jherskowitz> EvilAaron_: are you normally on Windows 10?
[23:05:52] <jherskowitz> if so, I have a theory
[23:06:45] <jherskowitz> we found an SSL issue with Qt4 on Win10 - maybe scrobble endpoint is https?
[23:06:48] <jherskowitz> muesli: ^?
[23:10:52] <muesli> hmm... that wouldn't match the error tho, i think

[23:23:54] <CaptainKnots> hi. I was wondering if tomahawk supports playback of 24/96 flac files
[23:24:16] <muesli> CaptainKnots: it should yeah
[23:24:58] <muesli> generally speaking, we use the vlc backend. so anything vlc can play, tomahawk can too
[23:25:08] <CaptainKnots> ok cool
