[12:30:11] <alastairp> I did. thanks for the reminder
[12:31:40] <alastairp> HorusHorrendus: do you have an area that you're interested in?
[12:31:53] <alastairp> signal processing, machine learning, database curation, ...?
[12:43:02] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: no idea ... as I said probably not to low-level :)
[12:43:48] <HorusHorrendus> and I did write acousticbrainz because at that time listenbrainz wasn't out yet ... so if you have any idea there ;)
[12:43:48] <alastairp> ok, so I guess you'd be looking at something like data curation 
[12:44:22] <alastairp> listenbrainz isn't really affiliated with the university, so not sure if that would impact the choice
[12:45:22] <alastairp> 2 things we're looking at currently in AB: 1) given 100 submissions of the same mbid, are they actually the same audio? if the same song is submitted with 2 mbids, can you work out that they're the same thing?
[12:45:50] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: no that has no impact as to my supervisors I will anyways pitch it as an opensourceproject
[12:46:23] <alastairp> 2) start looking at the audio data and metadata that we have and look into see if we can start building machine learning models to guess aspects of the music
[12:46:25] <HorusHorrendus> about ab: well I'm also recently interested (or already since a long time) in structure of songs ... but also happy with other stuff as long as it's interesting and fits the scope :)
[12:46:45] <alastairp> we're already doing this with genre a bit, though we don't really have anything good yet
[12:46:59] <alastairp> one thing to know about AB is that we don't have that resolution of time-level data
[12:47:16] <alastairp> most of the features are a mean + standard deviation over the whole duration of the track
[12:48:45] <HorusHorrendus> ahh ok ... time-level data probably can give more info
[12:51:31] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: 1 seems interesting, but not sure if enough work ... 2 seems hard, but doable ... although my machine learning skills aren't the best ;)
[12:52:40] <alastairp> We're not sure about 1 either. One thing we want to do is collect some audio and make our own changes to it (different encoders, formats, bitrates, etc) and see how much the data from the extractor changes
[12:53:02] <alastairp> this would give us an indication of the threshold of how much a value can change
[12:53:15] <alastairp> then we have 2.5 million tracks that need to be optimally compared with each other

[16:02:48] <muesli> imo
[16:04:11] <TheOneRing> ok, I changed the icon handlingin snorenotify to qicon^^ and the local file cache for the icon uses the kacheKey, now for every notification needing a local file a new one is written to the qtempdir, but this shouldnt be a problem
[16:04:30] <TheOneRing> and it should still be faster than the old code

[22:56:59] <alastairp> we had a bit of downtime this evening
[22:57:08] <alastairp> I have a patch I want to release, but it requires a bit more work
[22:57:46] <alastairp> maybe I‚Äôll release as-is since the changes are better than what‚Äôs out there now
[22:57:56] <alastairp> and just add the other stuff separately
[22:58:41] <wmp> ok, goodnight
[22:58:45] <alastairp> I think http://tickets.musicbrainz.org/browse/LB-40 is a partial cause
