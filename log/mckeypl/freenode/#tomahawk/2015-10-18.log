[00:00:18] <luxifer> any tips/heads up?
[00:17:16] <luxifer> I found where the shortcuts are set up. Now I'm looking for something along the lines of create playlist.
[00:23:14] <muesli> hey luxifer 
[00:23:31] <luxifer> hello
[00:23:34] <muesli> luxifer: what exactly do you wanna fix?
[00:24:03] <luxifer> reading the todos, I want to add ctrl+n as a shortcut to make a new playlist.
[00:24:22] <muesli> i'd probably hook that up to a menu entry
[00:24:34] <muesli> which also takes care of assigning the shortcut for oyu
[00:25:39] <luxifer> okay. this is my first time contributing to the project and working specifically with qt. 
[00:26:08] <luxifer> I'm getting a feel for the layout of the application.
[00:45:45] <luxifer> found where the togleMenuBar shortcut is set. Figure I can take a similar approach, but I would have to make a createPlaylist menu entry, right?
[00:47:09] <muesli> luxifer: almost
[00:47:17] <muesli> luxifer: just make a new menu entry "Create Playlist"
[00:47:29] <muesli> and you can directly assign a shortcut to that menuentry
[00:47:41] <muesli> which will take care of everything for you
[00:49:06] <muesli> luxifer: sorry, overread what you wrote... yeah, similar to the toggle menubar then

[00:56:14] <luxifer> I think I might have got it. have to recompile
[00:57:11] <luxifer> how might I do that?
[00:57:19] <luxifer> recompile, I mean.
[00:57:34] <muesli> just run make in your tomahawk build dir again

[01:03:04] <luxifer> it threw an error compiling
[01:04:37] <luxifer> By not providing "FindQt5Svg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Svg", but CMake did not find one.
[01:17:01] <luxifer> I can't build the master branch, even without any modifications.
[01:24:55] <luxifer> trying a vm. apparently an issue with arch / cmake.
[01:39:57] <muesli> you're compiling on arch linux?
[01:40:09] <muesli> sounds like you're missing th qt5-svg library
[01:40:09] <luxifer> it's my host, so yes.
[01:42:31] <luxifer> hmm, I picked up the package and it gave me 7 more required packages.
[01:45:37] <luxifer> do I need the qt5 version of all the packages?
[01:46:03] <luxifer> I have the qt4 version of most, but cmake still throws the packages as missing
[01:53:08] <theli_ua> depends on whether you want to build tomahawk using qt5 or 4

[02:16:35] <muesli> luxifer: yeah, you'll probably want the qt5 stuff by now
[02:23:21] <luxifer> got it building. will an existing install of the application conflict with it?
[02:24:29] <muesli> shouldn't
[02:24:32] <muesli> hint
[02:24:34] <muesli> don't run make install
[02:24:41] <muesli> just start tomahawk from within the build dir
[02:24:47] <muesli> cd build
[02:24:50] <muesli> $ ./tomahawk
[02:25:44] <luxifer> got it.
[02:26:42] <muesli> nice
[02:48:20] <luxifer> got it to compile, I mean. Couldn't link the create playlist functionality to the keybinding.
[02:50:57] <luxifer> I added the option to the control menu and gave it a keybinding. Looking at it, I think I have to add the action in the tomahawk window, too.
[02:51:05] <muesli> correct
[02:59:52] <luxifer> okay now I did it.
[03:00:03] <luxifer> I want to add the other shortcuts, though.
[03:01:07] <luxifer> I was wondering though. I saw bits commented out that seemed to link previous to left and next to right. What happened with that?
[03:02:11] <luxifer> What about the implementation of those shortcuts was undesireable?
[03:03:38] <muesli> luxifer: you'd react to it when using left/right in a line-edit, e.g.
[03:03:44] <muesli> so that'd have to be filtered depending on the focus
[03:03:57] <muesli> essentially using key-events
[03:04:09] <theli_ua> muesli: qt4 is fine :D , why would someone want to update
[03:04:57] <luxifer> 5 > 4
[03:05:05] <luxifer> :p
[03:05:37] <theli_ua> I dont understand what is your point luxifer :P
[03:05:52] <theli_ua> though I would probably update to qt5 if I could get rid of qt4
[03:06:13] <theli_ua> but skype wont let me do it
[03:07:06] <luxifer> @muesli so if I understand correctly, the link between those keys and their respective functions were based on the focus of the window?
[03:07:41] <muesli> yeah, if we'd apply them there, they'd overwrite the behaviour of line-edits and other elements that use left/right keys for navigation
[03:08:19] <luxifer> theli_ua: well the clear solution is to get rid of skype.
[03:08:54] <muesli> theli_ua: you could install it parallely tho?
[03:09:12] <luxifer> why not make the shortcuts work only when the main window is in focus?
[03:09:28] <luxifer> what are the challenges with that approach?
[03:09:49] <theli_ua> Well qt5 will give me nothing while Skype gives some functionality
[03:10:29] <luxifer> fair enough.
[03:11:25] <muesli> luxifer: yeah, that's what i meant: we need to catch them in the keyboard events
[03:12:14] <luxifer> muesli: i'll try to figure it out. 
[03:27:15] <muesli> luxifer: let me know if you need any clues
[03:28:16] <luxifer> using the same approach I used on createPlaylist isn't working for createStation. what might be causing this? what differences are there in the methods?
[03:29:33] <muesli> not sure. can you pastebin the diff?
[03:29:41] <muesli> or just push to a branch in your github fork of tomahawk
[03:33:07] <luxifer> pushed

[03:35:55] <muesli> luxifer: this isn't necessarily bad (even tho in this case it seems to be, heh)... but if you plan to get those changes merged, you'd have to put them in a separate "Whitespace fix" commit
[03:35:56] <luxifer> I hadn't noticed.
[03:36:10] <muesli> luxifer: no worries, that's why i'm mentioning it

[03:36:19] <muesli> see the diff here ^
[03:37:21] <muesli> luxifer: you seem to have forgotten to add the "createStation" action to controlsMenu in ::createMenuBar
[03:37:26] <muesli> hence the shortcut won't work
[03:37:32] <muesli> and the menu item wouldn't show
[03:38:10] <luxifer> ahh. my mistake. I'll throw that in there, fix the white space and push again.
[03:43:33] <muesli> you could just undo your whitespace changes and push a fresh commit
[03:43:54] <muesli> so we don't have those lines changing at all, causing potential merge conflicts for others
[03:57:26] <luxifer> fixed everything.

[03:59:27] <muesli> that can potentially break others' work by inducing merge conflicts
