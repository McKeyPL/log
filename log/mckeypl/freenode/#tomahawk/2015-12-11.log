[12:44:51] <Kalendium> Hi there, why do I need a premium spotify account to add it to tomahawk?
[12:45:33] <Kalendium> I could not be like the web inferface?
[12:55:56] <HorusHorrendus> Kalendium: yes you need a premium account
[12:56:07] <HorusHorrendus> only premium account allows streaming in 3rd party apps
[12:58:44] <Kalendium> And it couldnt be done throught the web interface?
[13:06:29] <Kalendium> HorusHorrendus: Or even having spotify on the background
[13:07:21] <HorusHorrendus> Kalendium: no that would be not very much integrated
[13:07:28] <HorusHorrendus> just pay for spotify if you like it
[13:07:38] <HorusHorrendus> otherwise you can still use spotifys own app or the web interface
[13:07:51] <HorusHorrendus> and listen to advertisments :)

[14:54:17] <r_rios> dommex: Thanks for the help on libcrashreporter-qt. Just FYI: it seems I made it work with my program, but, for now at least, I decided to stick with StackWalker, since I just need the backtrace, not a full dump file.
[14:54:28] <r_rios> So, the library works seems to work normally with MSVC; the only change necessary for me was in this line: https://github.com/dschmidt/libcrashreporter-qt/blob/master/src/libcrashreporter-handler/CMakeLists.txt#L21
[14:55:16] <r_rios> I needed to make it if(WIN32 AND NOT MSVC), since MSVC was having some trouble with unicode
[14:55:46] <r_rios> I figured you might like to know that, so there it is
[14:55:55] <r_rios> Anyway, thanks again for the help

[19:36:27] <justin_time> modeno1: Which OS are you using? Ubuntu or debian? In debian sid there is libechonest2.3.1-0.3 soon. Tomahawk is working with this package.
[19:36:29] <dommex> not at home right now, so a bit hard to help
[19:36:53] <modeno1> justin-time: ubuntu 14.04
[19:37:00] <modeno1> dommex: no problem
[19:37:45] <justin_time> Ok, libechonest of the ubuntu packages is too old. Aren't you using the tomahawk ppa?
[19:39:05] <modeno1> I have no idea what that is, can you clarify please?
[19:40:05] <justin_time> Oh ok: You can simply install tomahawk into ubuntu 14.04 by using a PPA. A Personal Package Archive.
[19:40:05] <justin_time> https://launchpad.net/~tomahawk/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
[19:40:52] <justin_time> http://askubuntu.com/questions/4983/what-are-ppas-and-how-do-i-use-them/40351#40351
[19:41:23] <modeno1> oh but i want to build it on my own, try some changes in the source code. Does ppa allow for that?
[19:43:18] <justin_time> Yes, you only need to install the package libechonest-dev of this ppa, this should work.
[19:44:08] <modeno1> ok I'll try that, will come back with the results :)
