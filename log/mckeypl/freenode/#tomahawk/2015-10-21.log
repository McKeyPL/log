[19:36:01] <jechun1> you mentioned http probs on mac?
[20:01:12] <theli_ua> yeah, jherskowitz , https still doesn't work for you with tomahawk on mac, right?
[20:05:47] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: gmusic doesn't
[20:06:11] <theli_ua> so is youtube, right?
[20:19:49] <theli_ua> I got new Guitar Hero game yesterday
[20:19:51] <theli_ua> I like it
[20:20:11] <theli_ua> and monetization (apart from initiall cost) is very similar to streaming services
[20:20:28] <theli_ua> there are 2 "radio" (well, music videos) stations with programming you can play to
[20:20:38] <theli_ua> and you pay for on-demand or cosmetics
[20:20:52] <theli_ua> well, its like a mix of freemium games and streaming services
[20:23:54] <HorusHorrendus> theli_ua: so it's a full price game with paid addons :)
[20:24:13] <theli_ua> there is a a "story" mode you play
[20:24:26] <theli_ua> which is offline
[20:24:40] <theli_ua> where you dont pay for anything and its kinda similar to old gh games
[20:25:08] <theli_ua> and there is also a new online-only mode with social and cosmetics, more like a usuall online game
[20:25:23] <theli_ua> initial investment is mostly for offline mode and controller
[20:26:11] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: does it make sense?
[20:26:40] <theli_ua> also, I enjoyed yesterday's "hour of metal" program on on of the channels a lot, didn't have any desire for on-demand
[20:27:21] <theli_ua> oh, and I got a bunch of internal currency to spend on cosmetics and like 100 of tokens to spend for on-demand catalog 
[20:27:25] <theli_ua> which i think is fair
[20:27:43] <theli_ua> they have to support video streaming infrastructure somehow
[20:28:30] <theli_ua> so if'll have a party where people would want to try it out I would just buy "24h party all access" just to support that ... but for my own casual gaming I'll just play w/e is on the tv
