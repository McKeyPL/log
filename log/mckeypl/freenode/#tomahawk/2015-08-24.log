[21:46:45] <theli_ua> I was working on improving that. Actually google does recognise a track in those videos and adds proper artist and track title on the page itself, as well as links to buy the track on itunes/amazon/etc

[21:47:15] <rotzbouw> search?
[21:48:07] <theli_ua> when you try to resolve "Greg Brown - Loneliness House" current plugin will get that second one as first result in its search requiest to youtube api but will not consider that one as it doesn't have both artist and track in title

[21:48:42] <rotzbouw> theli_ua: okay, now I understand
