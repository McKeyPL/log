[23:04:29] <ciss> hi, i hadn't used tomahawk in years and had just installed it again. i (believe to) vaguely remember being able to reorder resolvers. how does the current version deal with multiple resolvers serving results for the same track (as in which one takes priority)?
[23:04:51] <theli_ua> you can not
[23:05:23] <ciss> theli_ua: does that mean that priorities are hardcoded?
[23:08:39] <ciss> found an old jira issue in google's cache that references resolver.settings.weight, so i guess the answer is "yes"
[23:09:06] <ciss> targeted fix version was 0.9, but apparently it hasn't been migrated to github
[23:09:25] <ciss> (the issue id was TWK-566, btw)
[23:11:39] <ciss> also found https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/pull/292 - looks like tomahawk uses something like a "reliability" score
[23:14:20] <ciss> aaand here are more details on the weight: https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk-resolvers/blob/master/examples/javascript/content/contents/code/example.js#L11
[23:14:38] <ciss> i guess my question has been sufficiently answered - thanks guys :D
[23:22:41] *** Quits: lll7 (~q@37.44.96.101) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:34:59] <theli_ua> sorry, was afk for a meeting
[23:35:36] <theli_ua> ciss: at least this is one of the things that I planned for improvements
[23:37:22] <ciss> theli_ua: as pointed out in the merge request, probably a tricky thing to get right. is the weight only used for ordering, or does the value directly affect scores?
[23:38:13] <theli_ua> eh, I have no idea :)
[23:38:37] <theli_ua> and yeah, jira is dead as well as wiki, etc
[23:39:09] <ciss> what happened? a ... "premature" migration to github?
[23:39:44] <theli_ua> I think server's hard drive died (hosted on vps or something)
[23:39:59] <dommex> ciss: sorry the resolver weighting is poor we knoe
[23:40:01] * theli_ua is just tomahawk's user so he doesn't have all the information
[23:40:04] <dommex> Know
[23:40:08] <dommex> Yes
[23:40:19] <ciss> dommex: hey, i'm neither complaining nor pointing fingers :D
[23:40:28] <ciss> it's probably a power user feature anyway
[23:40:42] <theli_ua> well, tbf I really miss that feature
[23:40:43] <dommex> ciss: dont worry, no offense taken
[23:40:47] <dommex> Yes
[23:40:57] <dommex> Its one of the most requested features
[23:41:00] <theli_ua> also, I would really like tomahawk to stop prefering p2p for tracks
[23:41:11] <theli_ua> as because of that I turned off all my xmpp accounts in tomahawk
[23:41:32] <dommex> Yes yes yes
[23:41:33] * theli_ua likes to complain and whine
[23:41:34] <ciss> dommex: surprising, as i didn't see any issues. where do you guys keep track of your feature requests?
[23:41:57] <dommex> Premium accounts should likely be preferred over p2p
[23:42:11] <dommex> It needs to be .... done
[23:42:25] <ciss> theli_ua: i'm going out on a limb here, but maybe you can alter the weight directly in the resolver's js file
[23:42:44] <theli_ua> ciss: p2p collections do not have js file
[23:42:45] <dommex> ciss: in github now. We just havent been able to migrate the issues from jira yet
[23:43:26] <ciss> dommex: how long ago did you move?
[23:43:47] <dommex> theli_ua: ciss: the database resolcer has a weight of 100 iirc
[23:43:51] <dommex> Thats the issue
[23:44:03] <dommex> ciss: a few weeks
[23:44:23] <ciss> do you internally support higher weights than 100?
[23:44:36] <dommex> Dunno likely not
[23:46:00] <dommex> It all needs a bit of love
[23:46:31] <theli_ua> everyone needs
[23:47:03] <dommex> dont you want somebody to love?
[23:47:14] <theli_ua> ciss: I could lower internal ones as I use my own ones anyway, I'm just too lazy for that :D
[23:47:46] <dommex> :)
[23:48:05] <dommex> theli_ua: you could work on a proper solution ;D
[23:48:12] <theli_ua> no way
[23:48:21] <theli_ua> I have no time nowdays
[23:48:51] <theli_ua> we moved, wife got job, everything changed, still unpacking things, etc, 
[23:49:02] <theli_ua> I have absolutely zero free time these daus
