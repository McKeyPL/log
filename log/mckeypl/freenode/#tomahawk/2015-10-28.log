[20:45:12] <jherskowitz> veduck: you mean caching google play tracks for playback offline?
[21:06:41] <domme> muesli: what's the right QT_OS_WHATEVER check for osx again?
[21:06:44] <domme> QT_OS_MAC?
[21:07:03] <domme> apparently not :-)
[21:07:26] <domme> Q_OS_MAC
[21:07:39] <veduck> yeps...
[21:08:15] <domme> veduck: caching is always a legal problem
[21:10:51] <veduck> Well so, we can only do that via Google Play Music, and won't be an option for Tomahawk for the foreseeable future, cause of legal issues?
[21:12:46] <domme> veduck: not saying it wont happen, just.. we are very careful to add features like that :)
[21:14:17] <jherskowitz> veduck: it depends on the service - for example, the Spotify sdk will let us cache (I think) since it‚Äôs all managed inside their code.  Google Play doesn‚Äôt have an SDK.
[21:15:21] <jherskowitz> but Google Play also has their ‚Äúlocker‚Äù that you can upload your own tracks to - those may be possible to be dowloaded (aka ‚Äúwirelessly synced‚Äù) to your phone
[21:18:07] <veduck> Thanks for all the clarification... As i said, not a developer, but i'm glad that this product is out... Will make sure that it gets the attention it deserves! :)
[21:19:04] <muesli> veduck: thanks :)

[21:45:47] <muesli> haven't noticed any problems so far
