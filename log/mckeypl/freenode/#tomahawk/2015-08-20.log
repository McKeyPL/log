[20:33:06] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: correct
[20:34:49] *** Quits: soee (~soee@u28n61.nowanet.pl) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[20:41:58] <theli_ua> I also found an API to get 30s preview for pretty much any track on amazon
[20:42:09] <jherskowitz> nice
[20:42:13] <theli_ua> not sure how usefull that is
[20:42:21] <jherskowitz> it’s a nice fallback
[20:43:05] <theli_ua> well, would only work as a separate resolver with a really low priority I guess
[20:43:38] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: we did a resolver from HMV that supported: 30s samples, full-streams from locker, downloads and buy buttons
[20:43:55] <theli_ua> HMV ?
[20:44:08] <jherskowitz> domme can tell you all about it when he’s back
[20:44:12] <jherskowitz> yeah
[20:44:18] <jherskowitz> hmvdigital.com
[20:44:25] <theli_ua> There is no way I could do that via js resolver
[20:44:37] <theli_ua> I mean, tomahawk just doesn't have API for that
[20:44:43] <jherskowitz> well, the download and buy button stuff is in tomahawk
[20:44:56] <jherskowitz> but supported functions in the resolvers now
[20:45:53] <jherskowitz> we could be a full-blown client for Amazon if you wanted ;)
[20:46:03] <muesli> theli_ua: for what exactly?
[20:46:14] <theli_ua> for buying?
[20:46:52] <theli_ua> also iirc you can only have a global weight for resolver, thus having both full streams and 30s previews with same weight doesn't really make sense
[20:47:12] <muesli> theli_ua: samples/previews get sorted last
[20:47:28] <muesli> theli_ua: and you indicate per result whether it's just a sample
[20:47:30] <theli_ua> well, how do I indicate that its a sample?
[20:47:56] <theli_ua> also, muesli , mu "allow resolvers to specify user agent header" PR involves cpp code changes, so not sure who would be the best person for it
[20:48:00] <theli_ua> *my
[20:48:16] <theli_ua> thats the one blocking amazon resolver
[20:48:20] <muesli> probably both domme and me. will take a look at it either way
[20:48:43] <theli_ua> another thing would be hls streams deadlock in vlc
[20:48:59] <theli_ua> not sure what vls version you use for nightlies and if it has the needed fix by jb
[20:54:08] <theli_ua> though purchased/uploaded tracks should work regardless as those are mp3 links
