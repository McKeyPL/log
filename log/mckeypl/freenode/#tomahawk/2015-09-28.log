[01:06:06] <kurros> Anyone know how I can force Tomahawk to use the Spotify binary in Linux? Or what needs to be changed? https://paste.kde.org/pl4rqr4do
[01:06:08] <tomabee> [ KDE Paste | paste.kde.org |  ]
[01:06:48] <muesli> might be a missing qca plugin
[01:07:39] <muesli> kurros: which package / distro?
[01:08:13] <kurros> hmm, that is possible, qca got an ABI bump in Ubuntu Wily 15.10.
[01:08:18] <kurros> built tomahawk from git
[01:08:24] <muesli> with qt5 or 4?
[01:08:57] <kurros> 4
[01:10:17] <muesli> hm, check your installed qca* packages
[01:14:59] <kurros> that was it, needed the ossl plugin package
[01:15:03] <kurros> you rock
[01:16:40] <kurros> apt-get build-dep didn't catch that one
[01:17:52] <kurros> though it was probably stopped by depending on libqca2 and not libqca2v5
[01:18:01] <kurros> thanks
[01:36:37] <muesli> no problem. the official ubuntu package is sadly terribly outdated. not sure about its build deps
[01:36:49] <muesli> the ppa stuff should contain it though
[01:38:34] <kurros> ppa isn't building for wily yet, dunno how much work that is.
[01:41:14] <kurros> the libqca abi bump is the only reason thats important, really. can't have both simultaneously
[01:42:26] <kurros> also, if anyone else had anxiety that Tomahawk plays don't count towards Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist, all API plays do https://community.spotify.com/spotify/board/message?board.id=content&message.id=1681#M1681

[14:57:22] <morsik> hello there. I'm trying out Tomahawk, but it can't scrobble trakcs to Last.FM.
[14:57:32] <morsik> I logged in, synced loved tracks, synced playback history…
[14:57:44] <morsik> but I just can't scrobble even it says that login is correct :<
[14:57:55] <morsik> what should I looking for?
[14:58:50] <muesli> morsik: it sounds like an issue on last.fm's side right now
[14:59:15] <muesli> morsik: you could check your logfile
[14:59:22] <morsik> denied Tomahawk, or what? Spotify scrobbles (but i'm trying Google Music right now)
[15:00:13] <muesli> morsik: it only fails for some users. they didn't ban tomahawk
[15:00:18] <morsik> void Tomahawk::InfoSystem::LastFmInfoPlugin::onAuthenticated() "Got error in Last.fm authentication job: Authentication Failed - You do not have permissions to access the service" 
[15:00:35] <muesli> aha!
[15:01:00] <morsik> muesli: but trying "Check Login" says "Success"
[15:01:06] <morsik> (just tried wrong pass, and it tells "Failed")
[15:01:41] <morsik> it's 0.8.4 on Fedora 21 (from Fedora's repo). The same problem on Fedora 22 (afaik 0.8.4 too)
[15:02:05] <muesli> morsik: i'd mail them. it usually recovers after a while for most users
[15:12:35] <morsik> actually I hate Tomahawk's UI… but i'll give it a change. And there's nothing else that can use Google Music :D
[15:12:53] <morsik> Clementine can't talk with Google Music, and Nuvola… ugh… I just don't like web players.
[15:18:36] <morsik> muesli: now I see:
[15:18:39] <morsik> pon. wrz 28 2015 - 15:18:15 [0]: void Tomahawk::InfoSystem::LastFmInfoPlugin::nowPlaying(const QVariant&) LastFmInfoPlugin::nowPlaying no m_scrobbler, or cannot convert input! 
[15:18:42] <morsik> pon. wrz 28 2015 - 15:18:15 [0]: void Tomahawk::InfoSystem::LastFmInfoPlugin::nowPlaying(const QVariant&) No scrobbler! 
[15:18:49] <morsik> doesn't looks like previous error…
[15:23:02] <muesli> yeah, means those entries probably get cached right now since it couldn't auth
[15:32:59] *** Joins: WillisMan (~Thunderbi@88.96.238.246)
[15:52:17] <morsik> muesli: btw, how Tomahawk uses Google Music? It this implementation is copied from gmusicapi or what?
[15:55:54] <muesli> morsik: yeah, it's the reverse engineered api
[15:57:33] <morsik> muesli: oh, most important question for me… don't laugh… it's possible to sort albums by year? :D
[16:22:06] <muesli> morsik: i wouldn't laugh, it's often requested and will come in one of the next releases
[16:22:47] <morsik> put year before album name ;)
[16:23:22] <morsik> muesli: Tomahawk looks quite advanced if we say about technologies, but it's quite naked if we talk about configuration options…
[16:23:47] <morsik> i looked thorugh menus multiple times to find some Preferences cause I couldn't believe it's just that simple window with plugins…
[16:24:11] <muesli> morsik: what kind of preferences do you look for?
[16:24:36] <morsik> not sure yet hah :D but looking into prefs is first thing i'm doing in almost every app
[16:25:06] <morsik> also gui (for me) is not really intuitive so I was just looking for some UI settings
[16:26:09] <morsik> also strange is that Google Music doesn't works in "flat" view… shouldn't it be 1 model behind that displays flat model/tree views/album view/artist view/etc?
[16:26:38] <morsik> for now it's impossible to play eveyrthing and shuffle (or I just don't see such option?)
[16:26:58] <muesli> morsik: no, because not all services would support the flat model
[16:27:18] <muesli> flat collection will be supported with 0.9 tho
[16:27:44] <muesli> e.g. for some you can only first list artists, then drill down to albums, then tracks from there
[16:28:22] <morsik> yeah I know, but shouldn't be store in some backend model anyway that could be used by all those views?
[16:28:43] <morsik> (yeah, in such cases that model could be not filled with all data…)
[16:29:06] <morsik> (or could be pre-loaded after logging to service) ;)
[16:29:26] <muesli> sounds rather hacky ;-)
[16:37:30] <morsik> not for me… but well :D
[16:37:40] <morsik> muesli: also… cloud services need some update button.
[16:37:58] <morsik> as i see I need to restart Tomahawk to update Google Music libary… :<
