[13:18:50] <michelsedgh> hey guys so in 8.4 it cant correctly search youtube i think, because in youtube for example if you search Coldplay Magic, the first two results would be the official ones, but Tomahawk wouldnt find any Magic. i have seen other songs have this problem as well.
[13:19:16] <muesli> michelsedgh: hey there
[13:19:57] <muesli> michelsedgh: it's obviously a bit problematic with "(official video)" and additional tags, but we have some ideas how to improve this situation
[13:20:06] <muesli> i think theli_ua in here talked about it the other day
[13:21:52] <michelsedgh> hm, go youtube search coldplay magic there are many but no results in tomahawk, i have no idea why. i have added many plugins but they dont work either :/
[13:22:30] <michelsedgh> btw thanks, its a great app :)
[13:22:52] <muesli> michelsedgh: none of them seem to be tagged as "Coldplay - Magic" tho
[13:22:59] <muesli> michelsedgh: which tomahawk version do you run?

[17:38:10] <pukkamustard_> Hi! I'm trying to write a resolver. Not going as well as I hoped.
[17:38:50] <pukkamustard_> I'm playing around with the example resolver in the tomahawk-resolvers repo. I'm not able to see any logs.
[17:38:59] <muesli> hey
[17:39:09] <muesli> pukkamustard_: are you using 0.8.4 or git?
[17:39:18] <muesli> pukkamustard_: also, domme is your guy here :)
[17:39:33] <pukkamustard_> hi! 0.8.4
[17:39:36] <muesli> he recently changed the resolver infrastructure a bit and i'm sure he's willing to help you out
[17:42:48] <muesli> dommex: ^
[17:43:48] <dommex> indeed :)
[17:43:50] <dommex> hey pukkamustard_ 
[17:43:56] <pukkamustard_> hi dommex
[17:43:57] <dommex> great your trying to get your hands dirty
[17:44:24] <dommex> pukkamustard_: what totally helps is to start tomahawk with --show-inspector yourresolvername
[17:44:35] <dommex> that will give you a webkit web inspector
[17:44:42] <dommex> in which you can log with console.log
[17:44:54] <dommex> otherwise there's Tomahawk.log to write on the std out of tomahawk
[17:48:21] <pukkamustard_> Still not able to see anything from Tomahawk.log or console.log...
[17:48:38] <pukkamustard_> I get "17:47:57 [1]: Adding resolver "Example Resolver" "
[17:48:43] <pukkamustard_> and nothing after that
[17:49:47] <pukkamustard_> Maybe something funny as well. I'm using the beets resolver, which works fine. But if I add the js from tomahawk-resolver it doesn't do anything.
[17:50:33] <muesli> pukkamustard_: which example resolver do you use and how do you test it?
[17:51:24] <pukkamustard_> This example resolver: https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk-resolvers/tree/master/examples/javascript/content
[17:52:24] <muesli> dommex: that's ^ new api and requires tomahawk from git, right?
[17:52:26] <muesli> (apiVersion 0.9)
[17:52:35] <pukkamustard_> aha
[17:52:37] <muesli> pukkamustard_: how do you test it?
[17:53:00] <dommex> yeah, you totally need a current build
[17:53:11] <dommex> we have changed around a lot of things during the last year

[17:54:00] <pukkamustard_> thank!
[17:54:03] <pukkamustard_> thanks!
[17:54:39] <muesli> pukkamustard_: more than welcom
[17:54:40] <muesli> e
[17:54:46] <muesli> pukkamustard_: never hesitate to ask in here
[17:54:52] <muesli> pukkamustard_: what resolver are you working on if i may ask?
[17:55:38] <dommex> pukkamustard_: yeah totally.. if i dont respond here straight away, feel free to mention my name in your message. that will make me get a notification
[17:56:45] <pukkamustard_> I want to sync my beets library to the cloud (Amazon S3) and then have a mini-API exposing my library so I can listen to music while I'm on the go.
[17:57:00] <pukkamustard_> It's all here: https://github.com/pukkamustard/pastan
[17:57:57] <pukkamustard_> basically my own little spotify (with my own music)
[18:02:28] <dommex> okies :)
[18:04:43] <muesli> jherskowitz: wrt default file type associations on windows... we do that in the installer
[18:04:48] <muesli> which format is he trying to associate it with?
[18:05:01] <dommex> yeah and we dont ask for it ... that's bad :C
[18:05:19] <jherskowitz> muesli: dommex: I was going to tell him to come in here and talk to you guys :)
[18:05:31] <muesli> dommex: we don't default to it tho
[18:06:30] <dommex> muesli: mh? 
[18:06:43] <muesli> dommex: we don't set tomahawk as a default tho
[18:06:48] <muesli> which is what we should really ask
[18:06:55] <dommex> aah
[18:07:03] <muesli> adding us to the list of apps supporting a format is imo always fine
[18:07:09] <dommex> yeah sure
[18:07:18] <dommex> maybe win xp was handling it differently for jessica
[18:07:29] <dommex> i think for her the associations changed ... anyway.. needs looking at at some point
[18:07:30] <dommex> not now ;-)
