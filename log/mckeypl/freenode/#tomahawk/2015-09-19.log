[00:33:57] <theli_ua> SolarAquarion: well, what features are you interested in exactly?
[00:34:22] <theli_ua> I'm not even sure what the features are as site is in chinese and app wont work for me and I'm lazy to root my phone and install exposed
[00:37:38] <SolarAquarion> theli_ua: it seems that there are playlist stuff and what not seemingly  
[00:37:58] <theli_ua> yeah, playlists are possible, someone would just need to implement it
[00:38:03] <SolarAquarion> that can be done later
[00:38:17] <SolarAquarion> much later when you feel less lazy?
[00:38:21] <theli_ua> sure, I'm just not interested in those enough to do that myself
[00:38:27] <SolarAquarion> ok
