[04:47:49] <theli_ua> of what
[04:48:41] <pralut> tomahawk
[04:49:04] <theli_ua> tomahawk is nice
[04:49:22] <theli_ua> I use it for last like 6 months and pretty happy with it
[04:49:38] <pralut> are you on windows or mac?
[04:50:11] <theli_ua> I am on linux

[05:01:19] <muesli> random appearances... :)
[05:06:32] <theli_ua> there are some things I'd really like to be improved in tomahawk
[05:06:37] <theli_ua> but other than that I'm happy muesli 
[05:06:53] <muesli> theli_ua: shoot, like what?
[05:07:38] <theli_ua> well, controlled catalog radio (favorites in particular) but I have that in my fork anyway
[05:07:51] <theli_ua> other than that , biggest issue is metadata handling
[05:08:09] <theli_ua> ie - no support for compilations, no support for variations of releases
[05:08:34] <theli_ua> like, my library on amazon often has multiple versions of same release - [clean], [deluxe], [explicit], etc
[05:08:36] <muesli> the latter should be fixed for 0.9 indeed
[05:08:52] <muesli> that is for album metadata
[05:08:59] <theli_ua> they are even usually listed on musicbrainz
[05:09:10] <theli_ua> its just that tomahawk just picks one "canonical" one
[05:09:56] <theli_ua> I'd also appreciate caching of tracks (aka keep user defined... something like 1g of downloaded , most recently listened to tracks)
[05:10:21] <theli_ua> but that is just "nice to have", if that would reaaly be a must have for me I could probably just implement that
