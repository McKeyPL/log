[13:52:40] <justin_time> dommex: What's up? Have you some time, today? (sorry, if I annoy you with the debian packaging problem…)
[13:54:13] <dommex> justin_time: yes, we can talk about it today :)
[13:54:20] <muesli> justin_time: you don't annoy at all :)
[13:55:03] <justin_time> ok, that's cool! Thank you, guys!
[13:58:20] <justin_time> dommex: ping me, when you are ready and you have time.
[14:01:07] <dommex> Yeah 10-15
[14:01:12] <dommex> Min
[14:03:13] <justin_time> ok, don't hurry! Today, I have time enough :-)
[14:15:19] <dommex> justin_time: cool, here i am. and indeed, you don't annoy me. i'm sorry i'm not as responsive as you ask me for :)
[14:17:28] <justin_time> dommex: no problem! You do not need to apologise :) Ok, then let's start…
[14:18:48] <dommex> justin_time: so basically we can rather easily patch most of the things so you can do rm -rf thirdparty/ in the beginning
[14:19:09] <dommex> most patches in there shouldnt be runtime fixes but build fixes for various platforms and adjustments to comply with our build system
[14:19:33] <dommex> so if you already have packages for those in debian, it shouldnt be too hard to make tomahawk compile against them
[14:20:02] <justin_time> At the moment there exists only a package for qxt.
[14:20:33] <dommex> okay
[14:20:42] <dommex> libportfwd is our own wrapper around miniupnc
[14:20:50] <justin_time> And I really do not know if it's a good idea to package the other third-party programs.
[14:21:01] <dommex> yeah, they are packaged for a reason
[14:21:08] <dommex> i mean.. shipped in tomahawk
[14:21:30] <justin_time> Let's take a look of every file: SPMediaKeyTap is for mac, correct?
[14:21:40] <muesli> justin_time: correct
[14:21:43] <dommex> correct. you can wipe that in your build recipe
[14:21:52] *** Parts: kfunk (~krf@kde/kfunk) ("http://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.")
[14:22:04] <dommex> kdsingleapplicationguard ... is not released as a standalone library afaik
[14:22:23] <muesli> and we'll probably switch away from it, soon enough
[14:23:04] <justin_time> Ok. libportfwd is your own wrapper, correct?
[14:23:14] <dommex> muesli: which doesn't help with packaging tomahawk *now* :-)
[14:23:20] <muesli> true
[14:23:28] <muesli> just a word of caution tho :)
[14:23:51] <dommex> or do you mean the time to package kdsingleapplication guard should be better spent into porting to qtsingleapplication? is that released as a proper library by now?
[14:23:56] <dommex> iirc it was just a code dump too
[14:24:06] <dommex> or part of an even bigger code dump
[14:24:15] <dommex> justin_time: correct
[14:24:39] <justin_time> Maybe it could be enogh to exclude miniupnpc...
[14:24:58] <dommex> https://github.com/qtproject/qt-solutions/tree/master/qtsingleapplication
[14:25:08] <dommex> justin_time: must be. otherwise it gets really absurd
[14:25:13] <muesli> dommex: not sure it's qt5 compatible actually (qtsingleapp)
[14:25:28] <dommex> https://github.com/qtproject/qt-solutions/commit/ad9bc4600ce769a8b3ad10910803cd555811b70c
[14:25:45] <dommex> justin_time: "you are not allowed to put your own code in a directory called thirdparty"
[14:25:48] <muesli> dommex: justin_time: yeah, just because something has "lib" in its name, doesn't really warrant it being packaged separately, as i see it at least
[14:26:53] <muesli> miniupnp is indeed an external dep tho
[14:32:23] <dommex> justin_time: miniupnpc-devel is available on opensuse too, i can fix that rather easily
[14:34:14] <justin_time> dommex: ok, fedora also uses miniupnpc-devel. And so it should be available on the most linux platforms.
[14:37:41] <justin_time> muesli: dommex: There is also another problem of some thirdparty libs. It looks like the origin sources libqnetwm and libportfwd do not get any update in the last year. And the source of qt-certificate-addon does not exist any longer.
[14:38:12] <muesli> justin_time: what's the issue with not having updates within the last year?
[14:40:02] <justin_time> muesli: sorry: libportfwd last seven years and libqnetwm looks abandoned  and archived. 
[14:40:55] <muesli> justin_time: pretty sure i only uploaded libportfwd with tomahawk's initial import
[14:41:09] <muesli> anyway. what's the issue with not having updates in $x years?
[14:45:21] <justin_time> Sorry that I answer in german now: "Es hat eher etwas damit zu tun, ob ich dann bereit bin Energie ins Paktieren eines Programms zu setzten, welches aussieht, als ob es nach der Veröffentlich nicht weiter gepflegt wurde. Obwohl dies in diesem Bespiel wohl kein gutes Argument ist, denn wenn ein Wrapper einmal funktioniert, wieso dann ändern."
[14:46:20] <muesli> justin_time: yeah, i don't really expect any updates to libportfwd anytime soon
[14:46:30] <dommex> https://github.com/RJ/libportfwd hehehe
[14:46:41] <dommex> Latest commit 0e93633  on Jul 14, 2009
[14:46:48] <muesli> dommex: that's not the libportfwd we wanna use tho
[14:47:03] <dommex> no?
[14:47:09] <muesli> no
[14:47:11] <justin_time> muesli: https://github.com/muesli/libportfwd/network this?
[14:47:16] <muesli> yeah
[14:47:49] <dommex> yeah oh well
[14:49:05] <justin_time> muesli: do you think it is helpful to pack libportfwd into a extra package, or not?
[14:49:37] <muesli> justin_time: libportfwd is really an edge case. i don't know of any other users of it but tomahawk
[14:49:47] <muesli> so probably not
[14:51:21] <justin_time> ok, if tomahawk is the only one app, would it be possible to rewrite the code and include it in tomahawk directly? And use only miniupnp as external dependency?
[14:51:40] <dommex> using external miniupnp i'm already working on right now
[14:51:49] <muesli> justin_time: yeah, we'd just have to exclude miniupnp
[14:51:54] <muesli> and use the external one
[14:51:57] <muesli> included it already is
[14:52:01] <muesli> (libportfwd)
[14:52:21] <dommex> eh?
[14:53:10] <muesli> dommex: ?
[14:53:34] <dommex> ah, you mean libportfwd is already included
[14:53:52] <muesli> yeah
[14:59:51] <dommex> actually.. 
[15:00:59] <dommex> hacky hack hack
[15:01:10] <justin_time> What's about libqnetwm? For me, it looks like it would be senseless to exclude it to a external package because it is only used in tomahawk, too. Correct?
[15:01:26] <dommex> isnt qnetwm obsolete anyway in qt5?
[15:01:40] <dommex> not sure, do you know what it's used for?
[15:01:45] <dommex> only in bringToFront()?
[15:01:51] <dommex> or was that something else?
[15:02:00] <muesli> dommex: iirc, yeah
[15:08:17] <justin_time> ok, and qt-certificate-addon? I'm unable to find the source of this files. And without original sources, how shell I package it…
[15:19:51] <muesli> dommex: ^
[15:20:00] <dommex> seen, dunno
[15:27:59] <muesli> justin_time: dommex: seems to be a digia thing?
[15:28:21] <dommex> the qt certificate addon? no idea
[15:28:34] <justin_time> muesli: yes, and digia is offline...
[15:30:53] <muesli> https://gitorious.org/qt-certificate-addon
[15:30:59] <muesli> this was the git source
[15:32:19] <justin_time> yep, I'm going to say the debian developer that I'm unable to pack this package because the git source is not available any longer and tomahawk has modified it.
[15:32:37] <muesli> i don't think we actually have modified it
[15:32:39] <muesli> but yeah
[15:32:45] <muesli> not sure what's best practice there :)
[15:35:41] <justin_time> muesli: dommex: Ok, and the last one: qxt. There exist a lib for debian/ubuntu: libqxt-dev and for fedora/opensuse: libqxt-devel. And so would it possible to exclude this library, too?
[15:36:02] <muesli> yeah, sounds like
[15:36:07] <dommex> "kinda"
[15:36:15] <dommex> qxt itself says it's not meant for packaging
[15:36:26] <dommex> also on opensuse it's certainly not a qt5 package
[15:37:01] <justin_time> dommex: could you send me a link of this qxt statement please :)
[15:37:10] <dommex> i can dig it up
[15:37:12] <dommex> gimme a few
[15:37:19] <dommex> first wanna finish miniupnpc fuckery
[15:37:24] <justin_time> ok, thanks :)
[15:41:13] <justin_time> Maybe this statement: "Qxt will likely not work with newer Qt versions due to usage of internal api. We recommend that you pick out the parts you want instead of using the entire libqxt."
[15:44:48] <dommex> pretty much dead, sigh
[15:45:03] <dommex> xhochy: always said he wanted to port it to some other qt web library

[16:08:22] <justin_time> Ok, I'm going to review it: 
[16:08:26] <justin_time> 1) SPMediaKeyTap → only for mac; 
[16:08:28] <justin_time> 2) kdsingleapplicationguard → will be replaced with qtsingleapplication in the next release; 
[16:08:30] <justin_time> 3) libportfwd → only used in tomahawk, it's modified 
[16:08:34] <justin_time> 4) libqnetwm → only used in tomahawk and obsolete in the next release; 
[16:08:37] <justin_time> 5) qt-certificate-addon → Source is not available and it's modified for tomahawk; 
[16:08:40] <justin_time> 6) qtx → qtx developers say that its better to to use the libs directly instead of the distribution package
[16:08:46] <justin_time> Correct?
[16:10:17] <dommex> 2) no promises here, i can try though
[16:10:58] <dommex> 3) it's written in tomahawk and maintained there, the external one might or might not be updated at all
[16:11:48] <dommex> 4) it's only used in qt4 and X11 anyway. the codepath is dead on qt5
[16:12:57] <dommex> 5) not sure it's modified. but the project seems dead and not having a true "upstream" yeah
[16:13:45] <dommex> 6) dunno, the build system is a nightmare. they don't really care to allow proper packaging. in opensuse there's not even a qt5 package for it
[16:16:30] <justin_time> Ok thanks! I'll write this to the debian developer who reviewed the package.
[16:21:42] <justin_time> Now, there are some other blocker, too. What is about the logos, like Spotify, GMail and co? Are they licensed under a free licence?
[16:22:26] <dommex> unlikely
[16:23:12] <dommex> you probably need to find free replacement artwork for it
[16:23:15] <dommex> or create some
[16:26:52] <justin_time> ok. The resolvers are available throw KDE's synchrotron, right? Could it be possible to add the logos throw this system, too? To avoid shipping the logos in the code?
[16:33:24] <dommex> could, but it's a rather shitty thing to do
[16:36:50] <justin_time> first, I'll take a look on the clementine package. It looks like it also uses icons from spotify, soundcloud and google... I want to know what are the replacements for the debian build.
[16:39:01] <dommex> perfect
[16:40:25] <justin_time> Indeed, the debian package includes all this logos, too. I'm confused…
[16:42:30] <dommex> slipped through probably
[16:43:01] <justin_time> probably…

[17:29:55] <dommex> yeah, sure
[17:30:19] <muesli> that's cool until you discover that spotify doesn't permit that
[17:30:39] <muesli> (only use the officially designated logos yada yada)
[17:30:53] <justin_time> muesli: And if I use the old style?
[17:31:06] <muesli> not sure they care enough, just saying it's a bit ridiculous

[17:31:31] <muesli> justin_time: i guess that's fine yeah
[17:32:06] <muesli> i'd try not going down that road tho, if possible
[17:32:12] <muesli> refer to other packages doing the same thing
[17:33:02] <justin_time> muesli: yes, you are right, I ask the debian developer, what to do…
[17:33:09] <muesli> copyrighted images are one thing, freely distributable logos are clearly an edge case in my opinion
[17:39:05] <justin_time> muesli: But if Spotify does not like using other logos, you should update the spotify logos provided by tomahawk, or?
[17:39:40] <muesli> justin_time: it still used to be an official logo at least. i don't think they mind that. it's more about derailing their brand by associating them with shitty logos ;-)
[17:40:21] <justin_time> muesli: ah yes, I understand
[17:40:31] <muesli> but yeah sure, we should update it if there's a newer one
[17:41:07] <muesli> justin_time: you can also mention, that according to spotify's ToS we need to show their logo in the app if we're using their api or libspotify
[17:41:57] <justin_time> muesli: I wrote exactly this argument to the debian developers.
[17:42:06] <muesli> justin_time: perfect :)
[17:43:55] <justin_time> Ok, next points on the never ending list of the reviewer... What's about cryptojs? Is it modified for tomahawk?
[17:44:04] <dommex> unlikely
[17:44:23] <dommex> i have plans to remove it from tomahawk itself
[17:44:37] <dommex> in short: will be shipped with resolvers through synchrotron (or whatever)
[17:45:01] <justin_time> for the next release? Or for 0.8.x?
[17:46:01] <dommex> unlikely to happen for 0.9 :(

[17:48:40] <justin_time> yes
[17:51:04] <justin_time> Because they do not like javascript code in other packages… → http://mentors.debian.net/package/tomahawk-player
[17:51:29] <justin_time> There is a "source-is-missing" error of all javascript files…
[17:52:29] <dommex> well i can most certainly make the source path for the javascript files configurable
[17:52:47] <dommex> then you can pass -DCRYPTOJS_PATH=/some/path/foo to cmake
[17:55:02] <justin_time> I think this would help.
[17:59:48] <justin_time> dommex: Could you also provide a source path for the roboto font? -DROBOTO_PATH=/some/path/foo?
[18:00:00] <dommex> yes
[18:00:07] <dommex> those changes are supereasy
[18:00:22] <dommex> at least i hope so :P
[18:04:57] <justin_time> The file data/www/js/html5shim.js is not necessary for linux, or?
[18:14:23] <dommex> no clue what it is
[18:14:37] <dommex> mhh
[18:14:54] <justin_time> "The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x."
[18:15:04] <dommex> hehe
[18:15:15] <dommex> yeah it'S used in the webinterface somehow
[18:16:36] <justin_time> webinterface? What does the webinterface to? Connection to hatchet website?
[18:16:42] <justin_time> *do
[18:17:33] <dommex> justin_time: that too, yeah. http://localhost:60210/
[18:19:24] <justin_time> Ah ok, I didn't know this webpage!
[18:20:43] <justin_time> Ah ok, and the Internet Explorer needs this file as workaround?
[18:22:22] <dommex> apparently
[18:22:28] <dommex> some ancient internet explorer
[18:22:36] <dommex> but we can also think about just removing that
[18:26:54] <justin_time>  html5shim.js is only used for IE lower than IE9. And this would only affects Windows XP. 
[18:31:57] <dommex> yeah
