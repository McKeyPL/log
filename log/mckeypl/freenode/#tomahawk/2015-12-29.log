[11:46:54] <gordie> hi jherskowitz, are u here ?
[12:29:31] <gordie> anyone ?
[12:42:27] <muesli> sure
[12:42:28] <muesli> moin gordie
[12:43:39] <gordie> hi, how are u ?
[12:45:19] <muesli> pretty good, glad xmas is done with :)
[12:48:45] <muesli> how are you?
[13:03:59] <gordie> i'm fine too :) working a bit on spiff-radio.org.
[13:04:11] <gordie> No news about hatchet.is widgets ?
[13:05:57] <gordie> sorry I didn't saw you had replied to me
[13:06:42] <muesli> gordie: only the track widgets still need some love :) i know we keep saying this, but you hopefully see all the other progress we've made, too :)
[13:06:47] <muesli> sooo... not much longer
[13:07:01] <muesli> dommex: anything you can / wanna add?
[13:07:11] <gordie> do you know that one ? http://tuneefy.com/
[13:08:03] <muesli> nope, haven't seen it yet
[13:08:31] <gordie> seems quite similar to some stuff you want to achieve with hatchet
[13:11:31] <gordie> It would have been awesome that their is a widget that is just a "play" button; without too much stuff in it.  It would have allowed to embed it without being forced to use hatchet design.  But I'm not sure this has been decided like that
[13:13:37] <gordie> tuneefy seems quite nice, no ?
[13:14:16] <muesli> looks like toma.hk a bit :)
[13:19:49] <gordie> so, you made progresses on hatchet or THK ? Didn't saw much activity on github so I don't know if you're working secretly :)
[13:25:08] *** Joins: jturney (~jon@host217-43-11-230.range217-43.btcentralplus.com)
[13:25:43] <muesli> yeah, working on the new js resolver api, new mac packaging for 0.9, a new hatchet release is pretty much ready for deployment
[13:33:01] <gordie> so, secret work ? :)  and 0.9 soon ?
[13:33:27] <gordie> the nightly is already available ?
[13:33:29] <muesli> no, not really secret, heh :) most of that stuff you can see on github (albeit in branches possibly)
[13:33:38] <muesli> gordie: nightlies are coming back, too, yeah. finally :)
[13:34:41] <gordie> can't wait !

[14:21:24] <dommex> hey gordie 
[14:21:29] <dommex> hope you had a merry christmas
[14:21:31] <gordie> hi
[14:21:36] <gordie> yes, and yours ?
[14:22:24] <dommex> lot's of family business
[14:22:31] <dommex> in different cities, quite exhausting
[14:22:34] <dommex> otherwise fine yeah
[14:23:43] <dommex> nightlies are pretty much ready, two things missing still: 1) signing them on the new build machine (muesli, any news? ;)) 2) uploading them to tomahawk-player.org (muesli, any news? ;))
[14:23:52] <dommex> for osx that is
[14:24:06] <muesli> 1) the ball is in your park, no?
[14:24:21] <dommex> 1) signing scripts? do i have them somewhere?
[14:25:02] <muesli> yeah, copied them on the server, remember?
[14:25:33] <dommex> let's hop into query :)
[14:27:52] <dommex> gordie: i'm afraid i dont have anything to add, we took the chance to fix some long outstanding issues and do things right (tm) when our server died 
[14:28:04] <dommex> like moving forward to qt5 finally for good on all platforms
[14:28:15] <dommex> fixing nightlies for that etc
[14:28:42] <dommex> it all seems (and it indeed should be) very easy, but it's a horribly annoying task to deploy a project like tomahawk
[14:33:53] <gordie> :)  so the dev is not slowing down ?
[14:37:55] <dommex> gordie: it just looks like because we work on things that we pushed away for progress, so.. nope :)
[14:38:04] <gordie> ok, cool then !
[14:38:10] <gordie> was afraid of this
[14:38:19] <dommex> dont worry :)

[16:32:39] <gordie> hi jherskowitz, are u here ?
[16:36:46] <gordie> got a problem with tomahawk://import/playlist links
[16:36:54] <gordie> can't make them work..
[16:37:00] <muesli> gordie: what's the issue?
[16:37:48] <gordie> well, tomahawk://import/playlist?xspf=http://www.spiff-radio.org?p=172&xspf=1 does not work, while THK>import> for the same link works
[16:38:25] <gordie> using tomahawk://, it says the file does not exists.  I don't know why...
[16:38:41] <muesli> so it's not even making it to tomahawk?
[16:39:48] <gordie> yes, it does, but I have a notice inside THK that says the file does not exist
[16:44:05] <muesli> gordie: will check, can you file me a ticket on github?
[16:44:36] <gordie> ok - I don't know if this may be related to the URL formatting (two "?" inside), but anyway, ...
[16:46:28] <gordie> muesli : well, seems that's the cause of it : tomahawk://import/playlist?xspf=http://bit.ly/1TnQaSw works (same page) - but then I don't know how to make my URL for tomahawk.. ?
[16:47:01] <muesli> try urlencoding them
[16:50:09] <gordie> muesli : tomahawk://import/playlist?xspf=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiff-radio.org%3Fp%3D172%26xspf%3D1 > not working
[16:57:20] <gordie> muesli : https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/issues/375
[17:00:50] <muesli> thank you!
