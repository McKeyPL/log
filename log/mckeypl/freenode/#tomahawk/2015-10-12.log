[00:26:28] <emilsedgh_> Arent there any Debian packages available for Tomahawk?
[00:30:43] <jherskowitz> emilsedgh_: unfortunately no one has stepped up to help package for debian https://tomahawk.uservoice.com/forums/224204-feature-requests/suggestions/6705009-package-tomahawk-for-debian

[00:31:14] <emilsedgh_> ah, i see
[00:32:10] <emilsedgh_> there are so many dependencies.
[00:32:23] <emilsedgh_> and I have phonon-qt4 installed from packages, phonon-qt5 installed from sources
[00:32:33] <emilsedgh_> but its not finding it
[00:33:13] <emilsedgh_> and it would've been nice if the cmake log said what part of boost it requires.

[00:46:14] <emilsedgh_> yeah i know how to build it, its just that the number of requirements has grown
[01:18:41] <liori> emilsedgh_: ~3 months ago i managed to rebuild ubuntu packages on sid using not much more than `apt-get build-dep` and `apt-get source -b`, wasn't that difficultâ€¦ except for few trivial problems with ubuntu packaging
[01:19:10] <emilsedgh_> you are absolutely right.
[01:19:51] <emilsedgh_> most deps are already on debian
[01:20:58] <liori> stuff like german weekday acronym in debian/changelog breaking dch
[01:21:26] <liori> (that one was fun. not easy to spot Thr instead of Thu (-:)
