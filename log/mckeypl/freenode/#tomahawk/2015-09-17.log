[02:05:04] <theli_ua> I mean, on desktop it used to be py protocol
[02:06:04] <theli_ua> Is it just basically "if this url is from this resolver run it through this resolver's getStreamUrl before playing" ?

[19:01:50] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: were those logs good for anything?
[19:03:19] <theli_ua> well, good for seeing the change still didn't help on your system :(
[19:03:35] <theli_ua> I'll try to check on my macbook to reproduce the problem 
[19:03:41] <theli_ua> might be osx+qt5 or something like that
[19:21:58] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: yeah, doesn't work for me on osx either
[19:26:05] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: I can try with the nightly
[19:26:29] <jherskowitz> if you want me to
[19:26:56] <theli_ua> hm, doesn't hurt to try I guess
[19:27:32] <theli_ua> btw, whats the status with master+osx+gmusic? its broken, is it?
[19:29:35] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: fwiw, this is on the OS X nightly (Qt4) Thu Sep 17 2015 - 13:29:09 [0]: JAVASCRIPT: "/Users/jherskowitz/tomahawk-resolvers/youtube/content/contents/code/youtube.js:0" "TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function" "undefined" 
[19:29:59] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: yes, SSL issue with streaming gmusic
[19:30:04] <jherskowitz> been broken a while
[19:30:45] <theli_ua> i wonder if its the same with youtube then
[19:31:45] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: well, it’s flipped
[19:31:53] <jherskowitz> YT doesn’t work on Qt5
[19:31:56] <jherskowitz> sorry
[19:32:00] <jherskowitz> scratch theat
[19:32:09] <jherskowitz> it is broken in different ways
[19:32:21] <jherskowitz> YT on OSX/Qt5 = resolves, fails to stream

[20:33:51] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: yay for launching ListenBrainz :)
[20:34:05] <alastairp> thanks!
[20:34:23] <alastairp> although, you’ve just reminded me that I forgot completely about your email
[20:34:29] <alastairp> I’ll chase that up tomorrow
[20:34:42] <alastairp> so. endpoint for listenbrainz in tomahawk.. when?
[20:35:53] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: hehe no problem
[20:36:04] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: soon ... why not  ... if the protocol is the same ...
[20:36:22] <alastairp> we’re not api compatible yet, but that’s in the list
[20:38:18] <HorusHorrendus> ahh o
[20:38:20] <HorusHorrendus> ok
[20:38:31] <HorusHorrendus> api compatible to original audioscrobbler?
[20:38:39] <HorusHorrendus> but last.fm no longer api compatible to it?
[20:40:51] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: and when can tomahawk throw away echonest and use recommendbrainz ;)
[20:41:11] <alastairp> we have all the parts, but now someone needs to join them together!
[20:41:25] <alastairp> currently we’re not compatible with as or with lfm
[20:41:49] <alastairp> though I’ll take requests for which one you want first
[20:42:17] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: ahh OK I thought you based it on AS
[20:42:21] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: probably last.fm
[20:42:23] <theli_ua> wasn't hatchet supposed to have similar to lastfm recomendations ?
[20:42:41] <theli_ua> also, why through out echonest? its totally different to how lastfm-style recommendations work iirc
[20:42:48] <alastairp> no, we had no desire to limit ourselves to their api. our endpoint is a lot richer in what people can send to us
[20:42:55] <alastairp> but backwards compatibility is a good idea
[20:43:06] <HorusHorrendus> theli_ua: well ... I believe more in alastairp & co then in hatchet :)
[20:43:30] <alastairp> !!
[20:43:36] <HorusHorrendus> theli_ua: hatchet can do "last.fm recommendations", I think music/acoustic/listenbrainz wants to do echonest style recommendation
[20:43:57] <theli_ua> I see
[20:43:59] <alastairp> for now, listenbrainz is supposed to be more akin to just audioscrobbler, that is, we just keep a copy of the data for now
[20:44:22] <muesli> theli_ua: yeah we'll have recommendations
[20:44:26] <HorusHorrendus> And I believe that echonest style stuff is better than what e.g. last.fm could do
[20:44:28] <alastairp> I don’t think *brainz has any real interest in recommendations yet - we’re doing all we can to keep our heads above the water with all these projects
[20:44:37] <alastairp> but plenty of data for other people to play with though
[20:44:53] <alastairp> and who knows, maybe we’ll be feature complete in about 100 years and can try some stuff out :)
[20:45:01] <HorusHorrendus> muesli: we could help *brainz with writing one for them ;)
[20:45:32] <HorusHorrendus> hatchet can probably do a "people who listened to this, also listened to this"-recommendation ... which is probably good enough mostly
[20:45:39] <HorusHorrendus> depends on the data set
[20:45:40] <alastairp> how can we interoperate with hatchet? is there any overlap or advantage in sharing stuff?
[20:46:07] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: talk with muesli & jherskowitz about it :)
[20:46:36] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: and overlap ... well hatchet does scrobble what I listen to in Tomahawk
[20:47:59] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: bug! bug! :)
[20:48:07] <HorusHorrendus> but have to check on which side
[20:48:37] <HorusHorrendus> last.fm side ... wtf
[20:48:48] <HorusHorrendus> Christoph & Lollo is displayed there as "Christoph"
[20:48:51] <alastairp> please report to tickets.musicbrainz.org
[20:49:22] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: no it is on the last.fm side
[20:49:42] <alastairp> well. given lastfm’s last 4 weeks, I’m not surprised
[20:49:53] <alastairp> we’re seeing really interesting differences between their website and api, too
[20:50:05] <HorusHorrendus> wondering if I can leave the beta or if your import has problems with their beta?
[20:52:35] <alastairp> only the beta exists now
[20:52:45] <alastairp> old site isn’t around
[20:52:52] <alastairp> our import is based on the beta
[20:53:03] <HorusHorrendus> ahh ok
[20:55:49] <jherskowitz> HorusHorrendus: we have an open-source collaborative filter written in Go
[20:56:21] <jherskowitz> https://github.com/muesli/regommend
[20:56:22] <tomabee> [ muesli/regommend · GitHub | github.com | https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/146378?v=3&s=400 ]
[20:56:55] <HorusHorrendus> jherskowitz: yeah I know ... but that can be data that listenbrainz can do
[20:57:16] <HorusHorrendus> but with such a filter/recommendation engine you can't do stuff that echonest can do or acousticbrainz data could do
[20:59:35] <HorusHorrendus> also of course regommend can be expanded (using hatchet or whatever data) but there are 2 problems: the hatchet dataset is very small (and I don't believe it grows to a point like the last.fm or echonest dataset anytime soon) and the algorithms are simple (ok they can be extended)
[21:00:36] <HorusHorrendus> alastairp: Sending page 689 of 692 to ListenBrainz <- seems stuck ... 
[21:00:46] <alastairp> yeah, don’t worry. it’s finished :)
[21:00:57] <alastairp> we have our update code in the wrong callback
[21:02:25] <HorusHorrendus> ok ;)
[21:28:54] <jherskowitz> HorusHorrendus: correct, it doesn’t do what EN does - it does what lfm does
[21:29:37] <jherskowitz> HorusHorrendus: well, Hatchet can receive data from all Tomahawks
[21:29:43] <jherskowitz> and on Android from all other music apps
[21:30:15] <HorusHorrendus> last.fm only based its recommendations on "user a listen to this and user b also listen to this and also to that, so a might like that"
[21:30:19] <HorusHorrendus> ?
[21:30:23] <jherskowitz> Tomahawk on Android can just be a scrobbler
[21:30:36] <HorusHorrendus> jherskowitz: I know ... but how many people will set that :)
[21:30:38] <jherskowitz> HorusHorrendus: and some user feedback
[21:30:44] <HorusHorrendus> either they use tomahawk or don't
[21:30:51] <HorusHorrendus> jherskowitz: plays/skips?
[21:30:56] <HorusHorrendus> love?
[21:30:57] <HorusHorrendus> probably
[21:31:14] <jherskowitz> but generally speaking, Last.fm uses a “you did x, and y did x and z, so you might like z"
[21:31:41] <jherskowitz> yeah, you can tweak the data that goes in
[21:32:06] <jherskowitz> don’t count skips, a play from a year ago is worth less than a play from today, etc
[21:32:54] <jherskowitz> a love from a friend of yours is worth more than a love from someone you don’t know
[21:33:29] <jherskowitz> I’m sure alastairp has much better insight into it though
[21:38:34] <alastairp> Hah, I think you explained more in 2 minutes than I would ever think of implementing myself ;)
[21:38:48] <alastairp> collaborative filtering doesn't interest me that much
