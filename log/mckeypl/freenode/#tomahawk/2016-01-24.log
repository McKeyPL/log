[12:35:34] <justin_time> yofel: Do you have a contact to members of the kubuntu devel team, who maintain the tomahawk package in the ubuntu sources? Could you help me to contact the maintainer?
[12:37:04] <muesli> [23:22] <yofel> muesli: when you see justin_time again, please point him to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess#Requesting_Sponsorship
[12:58:32] <justin_time> muesli: ok, thanks.
[12:59:04] <muesli> justin_time: hopefully with the help yofel this shouldn't be as painful as debian
[13:03:05] <justin_time> muesli: hmm… my problem is that I have no one who answer my questions there… I try to contact the group, who maintained the old package because they have the permission to update the package directly but I get no response. Some of the documentations are inconsistent. And so it is hard to me to find out what to do. 
[13:03:55] <muesli> you mean debian or ubuntu now?
[13:06:06] <justin_time> ubuntu
[13:07:33] <justin_time> on debian, the rules are stricter than on ubuntu, but there are more people who are willing to help me… ubuntu feels like a "exclusive club"…
[13:07:59] <muesli> justin_time: what's the name of the old maintainer, do you know?
[13:09:37] <muesli> lel, why are we in the kde section of ubuntu anyway? :)
[13:09:50] <muesli> "Kubuntu Developers"
[13:09:55] <justin_time> exactly
[13:09:57] <muesli> yofel: is that you? ^
[13:10:59] <justin_time> nop, it is a group, and I'm unable to contact them. They mailing list is restricted and I can not write them a mail…
[13:11:36] <muesli> lol
[13:11:39] <muesli> :-/
[13:11:41] <muesli> yofel: ^
[13:14:11] <justin_time> btw: could it be, that I have to subscribe to a mailing list to be able to write a e-mail to the list? On some debian mailinglists, I can write to mailing lists without subscription.
[13:14:40] <muesli> possible. worth trying it
[13:16:23] <justin_time> ok, I'll try it.
[13:35:11] <justin_time> ok, this is interesting: I ask on #kubuntu-devel directly and I get the following response: "<soee> talk to yofel - he did tomahawk packaging once i think. he can also point oher packager to do this maybe (clivejo, sglarck or ovidiu-florin)"
[13:35:28] <muesli> heh, hence me pointing to him, too ;-)
[13:40:42] <justin_time> muesli: ok, I was not sure, because yofel's last change on the tomahawk package was Jul 2012 and after this many other people updated the package.

[14:21:32] <justin_time> muesli: another topic… the nightly builds: Did you use this code-import function of launchpad: https://code.launchpad.net/+code-imports/+new ?
[14:22:20] <muesli> justin_time: nah, it's a custom script we wrot
[14:22:21] <muesli> e
[14:22:57] <muesli> if they can do this "properly" now, that would be awesome
[14:24:40] <justin_time> shell I try?
[14:24:47] <muesli> go ahead :)
[14:24:58] <justin_time> ok
[14:26:38] <justin_time> hmm… an error occurred: There is already an existing import for tomahawk with the name of master. ?!
[14:27:09] <justin_time> maybe because of "https://code.launchpad.net/~tomahawk/tomahawk/master"?
[14:29:28] <justin_time> Is it ok, to delete the old launchpad tomahawk master branch?

[15:24:23] <muesli> wtf
[15:24:49] <muesli> ridiculous
[15:32:32] <justin_time> this is Canconical… Bazarr is their own distributed revision control system which is not compatible with existing ones… This is typical for them.

[17:06:30] <dawnson> i cant get my google mussic account show up in either the linux (archlinux, just built the git version) or windows (windows 10)
[17:06:33] <dawnson> any ideas?
[17:07:16] <dawnson> i use a OTP so i created an app specific password
[17:07:33] <dawnson> i also played a few songs in the official client already
[17:11:13] <dawnson> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8306716b8da8daf6f8d2 this is the terminal output
[17:29:40] <muesli> hey dawnson
[17:30:02] <muesli> dawnson: google changed their auth mechanism, which means we'll have to release a 0.9 first
[17:30:02] <dawnson> o/
[17:30:07] <dawnson> ah i see
[17:30:16] <dawnson> and the git versien wont work right now as well?
[17:30:25] <muesli> git should be fine-ish
[17:30:38] <dawnson> hm then i will try again with the git version
[17:30:41] <muesli> you'll also have to get the new resolver then, tho
[17:30:46] <muesli> (which won't be compatible with 0.8)
[17:30:50] <muesli> dawnson: :)
[17:30:50] <dawnson> hm how would i do that? :D
[17:31:05] <muesli> on arch i might be as easy as: yaourt -S tomahawk-git
[17:31:32] <muesli> and you can find nightlies of the resolvers here: http://teom.org/axes/nightly/
[17:31:42] <muesli> (or the sources for them on github)
[17:33:28] <dawnson> ok, i will try that, thanks :)
[17:36:47] <dawnson> unfortunately building it from git takes a while on an 1.3GHz i5 xD
[17:37:05] <muesli> haha. i did it on a raspberry pi before ;-)
[17:37:08] <dawnson> :D
[17:37:41] <dawnson> http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/images/product/nuc-kit-d34010wyb-10500194-2x1.jpg.rendition.cq5dam.webintel.310.155.jpg i am running on this one
[17:42:56] <muesli> media pc? :)
[17:46:37] <dawnson> no, its a "NUC"
[17:46:41] <dawnson> just a really small PC
[17:46:52] <dawnson> i5 , SSD intel chipset with intel grpahics
[17:47:03] <dawnson> EFI :)
[17:47:17] <muesli> next unit of computing ... interesting
[17:47:18] <dawnson> so modern hardware ina tiny box
[17:47:42] <dawnson> its an older model though i think you can get ones with an 2.8GHz i5 now
[17:47:50] <dawnson> it is also great as a media PC yes
[17:48:02] <dawnson> but i use it as my linux desktop machine :D
[17:49:46] <muesli> nice, those look rather interesting actually
[17:49:49] <muesli> a bit like a grown up raspi
[17:49:54] <muesli> or a nano-mac-mini
[17:50:01] <dawnson> yepp :)
[17:50:17] <dawnson> we got 2 actually, this one for me and a newer one as our plex media server
[17:50:39] <dawnson> which is more powerfull so it can transcode multiple HD streams in real time
[17:59:27] <dawnson> whee it is working
[17:59:58] <dawnson> but i guess it will never support the google music special features where it recommends me music etc?
[18:00:23] <dawnson> or charts inside a genre
[18:02:01] <dawnson> whats also strange is that inside the player i can see the cover but not in the notification etc
[18:05:13] <dawnson> hm ok that seems to work now
[18:06:06] <xhochy> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/b6kjXbHF/
[18:06:20] <xhochy> dommex: muesli: do you know what's missing here?
[18:10:27] <dommex> xhochy: wat. No. Never seen
[18:13:10] <xhochy> meh, will retry with GCC
[18:13:52] <dommex> clang works just fine
[18:14:31] <dommex> But you need to compile boost and lucenepp with clang and c++11 too. Or what other compiler are you trying?
[18:14:39] <dommex> xhochy: ^
[18:15:09] <xhochy> dommex: meh, I compiled boost and lucenepp with gcc
[18:15:18] <xhochy> but that should not be related to a header issue
[18:15:37] <xhochy> (yes, I was trying clang)
[18:15:40] <dommex> Right
[18:16:37] <dommex> No clue about that issue. Seems like a standard issue, like a missing devel package
[18:16:53] <xhochy> I'm on Gentoo, there are just devel packages :P
[18:17:02] <dommex> :p
[18:17:05] <xhochy> GCC works fine. So weird Clang issue.
[18:18:31] <dommex> Linking (lib)tomahawk will fail if you dont link boost and lucenepp against libstdc++
[18:18:50] <dommex> Just saying :p
[18:19:25] <xhochy> I'm now using GCC all the way, so nothing should go wrong.
[18:20:46] <dommex> Okies
[18:21:27] <dommex> xhochy: planning on starting to hack again on tomahawk? :p
[18:24:08] <xhochy> dommex: I'd love to, but I'm still struggling to find the time
[18:24:52] <dommex> Hehe ;/
