[18:35:59] <theli_ua> and it reliably works 
[18:36:45] <theli_ua> weird
[18:40:54] <domme> whatever
[18:41:19] <domme> MrMaffen: theli_ua: undefined://youtube://track/PlFbsxoEQR8 <-- this undefined:// is from the _adapter_init register custom url hack thingie, right?
[18:41:38] <theli_ua> yes
[18:42:03] <domme> ah got it
[18:42:11] <domme> removed the init wrapper but not the _convertUrls call
[18:42:15] <theli_ua> the issue was -  updated API does not require resolver to register getStreamingUrl instead of always calling it and default implementation just returns url
[18:42:38] <domme> nvm :)
[18:42:39] <theli_ua> so to make compatible I made it always register url handler with file name as schema
[18:42:55] <domme> yeah, fair enough
[18:43:03] <domme> i'm replacing it with a proper implementation now :-)
[18:43:06] <domme> i mean on c++ side
[18:43:11] <theli_ua> sounds good
[18:44:07] <domme> AAW YIIISS
[18:44:10] <domme> apparently it works
[18:44:14] <domme> MrMaffen: ^ :-D
[18:44:19] <domme> yay yay yay
[18:47:09] <theli_ua> nice
[18:47:13] <theli_ua> how did you implement it?
[18:47:41] <theli_ua> I mean, does it call getStreamUrl always ? does it call only on that resolver that returned a specific url?
[18:47:45] <domme> gotta rush out, will let you know in a bit ~1hr
[18:47:50] <domme> always
[18:48:00] <domme> to behave the same as android
[18:48:22] <theli_ua> I'm more curious on "does it call only on that resolver that returned a specific url?"
[18:48:40] <domme> yes of course
[18:48:46] <domme> or on the collection
[18:48:49] <theli_ua> alright, thanks
[18:49:09] <theli_ua> oh, did you also make it resolve through collection directly instead of my hack wrap?
[18:49:21] <domme> not yet
[18:49:28] <domme> i mean yes and no
[18:49:32] <domme> but really need to rush out
[18:49:38] <theli_ua> alright :)
[19:02:14] * theli_ua have soundcloud disabled because most of results are not exactly the match but someone's remix/etc
[19:02:30] <theli_ua> and there is no way to deprioritize resolver from UI yet
[19:47:55] <domme> theli_ua: still want to know anything about my implementation? 
[19:48:36] <domme> basically it gets rid of the cutom url handler thing.. instead i do result->providedBy()->getStreamUrl()
[19:48:51] <domme> which by default returns result.url (basically)
[19:49:18] <domme> but if it's provided by a js resolver or a js collection it will ask the scriptobject for the stream url
[19:54:33] <domme> and yes, the result can be resolvedBy a collection. i'm just not sure if your hack is still needed, likely yes
[19:54:44] <domme> but have plans for that too
[20:00:31] <domme> e.g. i could imagine that collections (implicitly) emit their own resolvers or something
[20:03:53] <domme> or maybe the pipeline will handle collections too ... or or or.. but in fact resolve() will be called on collections one day i hope :)
[20:04:03] <domme> js collections at least
[20:08:42] <theli_ua> alright
