[02:13:07] <dimits> guys i've been scratching my head with this for a while: are my playlists supposed to scan sources again every time i reboot the windows client?
[02:13:09] <dimits> :oo
[02:14:44] <theli_ua> yes
[02:16:22] <dimits> that's pretty inconvenient, isnt it :/
[02:16:58] <dimits> 100+ song playlist with youtube+soundcloud+spotify takes forever
[02:17:22] <theli_ua> I know, it is
[02:17:39] <theli_ua> thats why I never close it
[02:17:46] <dimits> :P
[02:18:32] <theli_ua> I guess it should cache results or smth
[02:19:06] <dimits> yeah would make sense
[02:19:14] <theli_ua> a lot of open question though then .. like what if there wasn't a song on some service when you first resolved and now there is , etc
[02:20:15] <dimits> well could be resolved by keeping the cache until a new scan finds something?
[02:20:41] <theli_ua> I guess
[02:32:24] <HorusHorrendus> it could resolve in the background
[02:33:08] <theli_ua> I guess
[02:33:19] <HorusHorrendus> "cache" (how do you find out if it is still valid ... not so easy maybe ;) ) it and if you find sth better (could be related to resolver ordering, which is also somewhere on my wishlist) exchange the result

[03:59:23] <muesli> HorusHorrendus: it kinda does, doesn't it?
[04:03:22] <HorusHorrendus> muesli: not really because when I start tomahawk all results are not resolved
[04:03:52] <HorusHorrendus> but yeah I think it does replace results with results from "better" resolver
[04:11:12] <muesli> what's your definition of "in the background" then?
[04:17:41] <HorusHorrendus> muesli: well I meant that in regard to caching results
[04:17:49] <HorusHorrendus> cache them, but still re-resolve them
[04:18:25] <HorusHorrendus> not cache them and never really check them again (at least as long as they work)
[04:18:30] <HorusHorrendus> and not not cache them ;)
[04:26:18] <HorusHorrendus> soo late already ... time to get some sleep ;)
