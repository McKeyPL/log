As far as i can see, there is only the streaming api. Or would I have to modfiy the source code of tomahawk myself, etc?
[04:46:44] <theli_ua> yeah, there is no specific support for external devices
[04:47:07] <theli_ua> and I believe there are no plans for something like that atm

[20:54:06] <theli_ua> well, what you should care about depends on who you want to attract I guess :)
[20:55:43] <justin_time> muesli: Is there a roadmap for tomahawk 0.9? I ask myself if I should prepare tomahawk 0.8.4 for debian or prepare all needed Qt5 packages and try to push tomahawk 0.9 after the release.

[20:59:09] <justin_time> theli_ua: ok thanks. I think pushing 0.8.4 into debian is work enough, for now...
[20:59:38] <theli_ua> well, everyone might just start working 24/7 on 0.9 tomorrow and we'll see release next week

[21:35:53] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: oh hmm... did you remove the migrator code from tomahawk.collection?
[21:36:39] <morsik> ehh… why Tomahawk cannot into such basic thing like Queue? :(
[21:36:59] <morsik> I'm selecting album, right-click, "Add to Queue", and different trakcs are Queued from Google Music
[21:36:59] <MrMaffen> morsik: there is a queue
[21:37:38] <MrMaffen> morsik: hm. can you please file a bug report here https://bugs.tomahawk-player.org/browse/TWK ?
[21:37:38] <tomabee_> [ Tomahawk Bugs | bugs.tomahawk-player.org |  ]
[21:38:26] <morsik> MrMaffen: it even don't queue different album. It just queued some "random" tracks. "random" in quote, cause those are always the same everytime I click "Add to Queue"
[21:38:30] <morsik> and from different albums…
[21:38:44] <morsik> will fill report after going back to home
[21:44:14] <MrMaffen> morsik: ok ty
[21:45:39] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: hm it seems like you removed the migrator. why did you do that?
[21:48:46] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: because it wasn't functional
[21:49:13] <theli_ua> same as to why I completely changed how sql calls work 
[21:49:15] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: huh? I tested it
[21:49:21] <MrMaffen> what :D
[21:49:29] <theli_ua> MrMaffen: might've worked on android for you
[21:49:41] <theli_ua> and that sql part was just wrong i recall
[21:49:41] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: I thouroughly tested the whole thing on chrome and android

[21:56:24] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: ah ok I see
[21:56:34] <MrMaffen> guess I got lucky with android and chrome then
[21:56:39] <MrMaffen> worked without a hitch there
[21:56:52] <theli_ua> yeah, as I said - it might work in certain conditions
[21:56:55] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: and why was the migrator not working for you?
[21:57:46] <theli_ua> as i recall it was something similar, and causing invalid state exceptions for websql, I also found a website/blog where that migrator supposedly originated and later it stated that yeah, it was indeed not always working
[21:59:07] <theli_ua> I certainly wanted to have some kind of migrator, the one in that implementation was just not working for me on multiple systems
[21:59:32] <theli_ua> I think it *sometimes* did work, but far less than in 100% of the tests
[21:59:38] <MrMaffen> hmpf well I also tested that thouroughly iirc
[22:00:08] <MrMaffen> guess my testing procedures are flawed af :D
[22:00:33] <theli_ua> well, you didn't test it inside tomahawk desktop, right?
[22:00:48] <theli_ua> shouldn't be too different from testing in chrome though
[22:02:11] <MrMaffen> theli_ua: that's what I thought. I didn't test it in tomahawk desktop for obvious reasons
[22:02:18] <MrMaffen> I tested it in chrome

[22:02:53] <theli_ua> the one which was in tomahawk.js was the original one, and even that blog states that it wasn't working on safari/webkit at least
[22:03:21] <theli_ua> I dont remember if I tried latest one from github
[22:04:01] <theli_ua> I *think* I did but still run into some issues and didn't investigate much, postponing migration implementation until at least basic functionality works

[22:09:48] <theli_ua> oh
[22:09:51] <theli_ua> but why
[22:10:07] <theli_ua> I mean, ideally tomahawk would just compile them on load
[22:10:08] <domme> because it's a separate thing, it depends on nodejs
[22:10:14] <domme> ah yeah, no
[22:10:23] <domme> we would need to ship nodejs for that
[22:10:25] <theli_ua> well, we can make tomahawk depend on nodejs!
[22:10:38] <domme> how about no?
