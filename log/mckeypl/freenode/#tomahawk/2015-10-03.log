[08:45:50] <lorenzh> More widespread? Google sold 20 million of those things!
[08:46:39] <lorenzh> It's an amazing device which could only be made better by my TV being less shit
[08:47:53] <lorenzh> Seriously, chromecast is amazing, please don't spend a year building the super generic dlna player solution when you could have chromecast in a week
[08:48:30] <lorenzh> (there is an interesting pulse audio plugin that you could look at, I'll have to dig it up later)
[08:49:10] <theli_ua> pulseaudio-dlna works fine, yes
[08:50:13] <theli_ua> but chromecast is much less widespread than dlna capable devices are
[08:50:18] <lorenzh> That would be the "I want it now" solution
[08:50:36] <theli_ua> heck, even airplay capable ones are probably more spread
[08:51:06] <theli_ua> and again, why would you want your tv on for listening to music
[08:51:28] <lorenzh> Chromecast Audio was announced last week
[08:51:33] * theli_ua is not sure how easily chromecast is controllable without visual feedback
[08:52:09] <theli_ua> yeah, chromecast audio sounds better in that regards (streaming music to it)
[08:52:12] <lorenzh> the controls are in the client, the client should show you the state anyway
[08:52:36] <theli_ua> then again, why not just stream from the phone
[08:52:47] <theli_ua> its easier and you have it in your pocket
[08:53:40] <theli_ua> dont get me wrong, chromecast is probably a nice device
[08:53:48] <theli_ua> and I'm not arguing against direct support for it
[08:54:15] <theli_ua> in the end each developer is free to work on w/e he is up to
[08:54:18] <lorenzh> EvilAaron_: are you on linux with pulseaudio? Then you can try https://github.com/masmu/pulseaudio-dlna for instant Chromecast

[08:55:22] <lorenzh> it would probably be fairly easy to support it
[08:56:14] <theli_ua> depends on your definition of "fairly easy" 
[08:56:24] <theli_ua> say, I, personally, hate working on UI stuff
[08:56:56] <theli_ua> hacking in hardcoded support is easy, yeah, in fact its already there
[08:57:18] <theli_ua> but making it stable and user-friendly still requires work
[08:58:43] <theli_ua> lorenzh: how your  tv can be shit for chromecast?
[09:02:29] * theli_ua off to sleep
[09:02:32] <lorenzh> theli_ua: 720p, uses tons of power, bad audio output, and no volume control over the headphone jack without navigating menus (normal volume controls just control the builtin speaker)
[09:02:42] <lorenzh> good night
[09:02:53] <theli_ua> just get a receiver for sound
[09:02:56] <theli_ua> and speakers of course
[09:03:02] <lorenzh> I have speakers
[09:03:08] <lorenzh> And I have a bluetooth dongle
[09:03:49] <theli_ua> eh, bluetooth compresses sound
[09:03:55] <theli_ua> lossy
[09:04:22] <lorenzh> yeah, but I don't really hear a difference
[09:04:38] <lorenzh> maybe because I've never really done a side by side comparison
[09:04:56] <lorenzh> but it sounds good enough and the usability is very good

[17:27:00] <EvilAaron_> Bluetooth stream sound like crap wish was more Aptx support, as much as I hate propietory crap chromecast audio dongle will fill a cool void around my house and get rid of all this flat sounding BT stream I fall into the trap of using :D BT pairing is a pain and usage is a battery drain on mobile for long term listening. Also synced audio accross dongle ala Sonos be a killer feature when it gets added if its good implementation that 
[17:27:00] <EvilAaron_> is.
[17:28:45] <EvilAaron_> BT stream quality isnt all in the recieving device or dongle but also in the sending hardware. Many older phones and tablets will re code audio as low as 128 kbps I have seen :/
