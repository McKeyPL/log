[00:00:15] <ciss> and my c++ reading skills apparently aren't even sufficient enough to figure out where the actual weight comparison happens :/
[00:00:20] <ciss> well. worth a try.
[00:01:34] <dommex> ciss: maybe in pipeline, maybe in query
[00:01:42] <dommex> Git grep weight
[00:02:31] <ciss> used github's search so far
[00:07:35] <ciss> dommex: btw, do you still have a backup of your jira db/instance? otherwise one might be able to pull/parse the issue data from google's cache

[00:10:09] <dommex> Yes the data is there. Just the table metadata is corrupted

[00:14:15] <ciss> theli_ua: ^
[00:14:26] <theli_ua> yeah, I saw
[00:14:54] <ciss> just mentioning it because "and yeah, jira is dead as well as wiki, etc"
[00:16:35] <theli_ua> thanks, I meant I saw your message that it got imported, not that I saw the wiki :)
[00:16:52] <ciss> :)
[00:18:55] <ciss> anyway, thanks for taking the time, guys. i'll go on fiddling around with tomahawk for a bit. and i'll try to keep an eye out in case something pops up that i may be able to contribute to.
[00:34:14] <theli_ua> tidal resolver behaves weirdly for me
[00:34:30] <theli_ua> looks like it wont ever resolve if query has album in it
[00:37:21] <theli_ua> yup
[00:40:28] <dommex> ciss: any bug reports or PRs on github are welcome :-)
[00:40:40] <theli_ua> yeah
[00:40:46] <theli_ua> dommex: do my prs :D
[00:40:53] <ciss> :D
[00:41:16] <ciss> btw, you guys sure have a lot of branches ...
[00:41:21] <dommex> theli_ua: i'm currently setting up a mac env
[00:41:30] <dommex> ciss: yup, most of them are merged
[00:41:42] <dommex> but there's also a bunch of things going on right now (yay)
[00:41:44] <ciss> ever considered using branch namespaces?
[00:41:53] <dommex> never heard of it
[00:41:56] <ciss> like feature/xyz ?
[00:42:04] <dommex> oh well
[00:42:15] <ciss> "successful branching model" and stuff
[00:42:26] <dommex> github just lacks this nice "remove source branch" button that gitlab e.g. has
[00:42:43] <dommex> we should be more actively removing outdated branches
[00:42:59] <dommex> otherwise ... handling a handful of branches ... should be doable without
[00:43:07] <dommex> not that i object.. it's just hard to remember
[00:43:34] <dommex> i often don't know if i will push a branch or just push to master... often things evolve over time when i'm working on it
[00:43:35] <ciss> there are actually tools for that, git-flow e.g.
[00:43:46] <dommex> and not being able to change source branches on github .... 
[00:44:14] <ciss> uhm - can't you do that in the repo settings?
[00:44:35] <ciss> even the api allows it (although it's a bit fragile for new repos)

[00:48:57] <dommex> will merge, when the other resolver stuff is merged

[00:49:14] <theli_ua> yeah, thats what I figured
[00:49:22] <theli_ua> but that'll require changes to other resolvers I submitted as well iirc, no?
[00:49:39] <ciss> well, it's great to see that tomahawk is still alive and well ... and *popular* :D
[00:50:44] <dommex> theli_ua: yeah ;/
[00:50:50] <dommex> luckily not tooo much
[00:51:09] <dommex> it just needs to be done, it's nothing like the changes in the earlier cycles of 0.9 resolver api changes
[00:51:47] <theli_ua> do you plan to get rid of js collection before 0.9 ?
[00:52:04] <dommex> you mean resolver.collection: {...}?
[00:52:24] <theli_ua> well, there are plans to move that into the native code iirc
[00:52:32] <theli_ua> just not sure if before or after 0.9
[00:54:56] <dommex> ah that
[00:55:01] <dommex> implementation detail :-)
[00:55:07] <dommex> i thought we were just talking about apis
[00:55:25] <dommex> tbh i don't care for the implementation at this point, i just want to get all the apis straight and stable
[00:55:37] <theli_ua> heh
[00:56:53] <dommex> theli_ua: in fact, in my branch it should be *kinda* straight forward to implement that in c++
[00:57:16] <dommex> because scriptcollections are actual `Tomahawk::Resolver`s now
[00:57:25] <dommex> (all collections are)
[00:59:22] <dommex> you would need to override the resolve(query) method
[00:59:39] <dommex> the only "issue" is to know when to use the native fuzzy-indexed-collection... and when not
[01:11:58] <dommex> feepk: heeey

[14:09:17] <dommex> feepk: also.. i guess you recommend vlc 2.2 for shipping with tomahawk?
[14:09:57] <feepk> dommex: it should "just work" ;)
[14:09:58] <feepk> dommex: and for now, yes
[14:10:09] <dommex> feepk: okies, good :)
[14:10:16] <feepk> dommex: even though we start to deploy 3.0 on the Apple TV and iOS really soon
[14:10:21] <dommex> cool
[14:14:18] <feepk> dommex: I'll be on a plane for some of the afternoon, but feel free to ping me anytime ;)
[14:14:35] <feepk> dommex: so you are maintaining both win32 and OS X now?
[14:14:48] <feepk> dommex: what happened to mueslix?
[14:14:54] <dommex> feepk: taking a bit of load off mueli's shoulders :)
[14:15:31] <dommex> it all started with: qt 5.5.1 bumped it's webkit version, which bumped its webm version ... which doesnt work on 10.7 anymore
[14:15:38] <dommex> and muesli's mac mini couldnt be updated to that
[14:16:03] <feepk> Oh crap, yep, this is how it starts
[14:16:27] <dommex> then he tried to get another one from a friend, said "osx, please update yourself to 10.9" ... osx went and updated itself to 10.11
[14:16:33] <feepk> dommex: FYI, we broke compilation permanently for 3.0 on 10.7. Execution on 10.7 will still work
[14:16:42] <dommex> ah :)
[14:16:49] <feepk> Yeah, that's not a problem
[14:16:59] <feepk> Using 10.11 full time for 6 months now
[14:17:20] <dommex> well, everything needs to be compiled using the right sdks... 
[14:17:36] <dommex> and we cant use brew anymore
[14:18:04] <feepk> dommex: no, SDKs are not too much the problem. Just take care of the min macosx version compiler flag
[14:18:11] <feepk> dommex: huh, why?
[14:18:41] <feepk> dommex: any chance for a win32 iTunes scrobbler for hatchet as well as an import of last.fm data?
[14:18:47] <dommex> because it won't set the right sdks for all tools.. not? i thought if i wanted to compile for - say 10.7 - i needed to set the sdk version to 10.7
[14:18:56] <feepk> No
[14:19:07] <feepk> You take the latest SDK
[14:19:20] <feepk> And set the min version to the deployment target you want
[14:19:20] <dommex> interesting
[14:19:38] <feepk> That's the theory at least
[14:19:43] <dommex> hehehehehehe
[14:19:46] <feepk> And should work for your use-case
[14:19:56] <feepk> As we do some magic in VLC
[14:20:08] <dommex> yeah, anyway: brew prebuilt binaries are downloaded for the platform we're currently on
[14:20:23] <feepk> Ok
[14:20:26] <dommex> yeah not saying vlc is the problem here, rather a gazillion of other deps
[14:20:52] <feepk> Maybe it is time to do a contrib system similar to that within VLC?
[14:21:05] <dommex> maybe you want me to run away screamingly?
[14:21:18] <feepk> Always
[14:21:22] <dommex> :)
[14:21:23] <feepk> How is that even a question?
[14:21:54] <dommex> yeah dunno.. it might be an option, but also very time intensive.. for the time being we rented a 10.9 mac :P
[14:21:59] <dommex> which i'm setting up right now
[14:22:01] <feepk> I'm just preparing reasons for you guys to attend FOSDEM again
[14:22:08] <dommex> will try to
[14:22:09] <feepk> Rented?

[14:23:55] <dommex> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/hzMEiRsi/
[14:24:10] <dommex> any idea on that? brew says xz and lzma are installed
[14:25:27] <feepk> Incorrect PATH or invalid version
[14:25:39] <feepk> Did you bootstrap and make in extras/tools?
[14:26:14] <dommex> feepk: https://github.com/tomahawk-player/homebrew-tomahawkqt5/blob/master/vlc.rb#L67
[14:27:23] <dommex> i'm not sure of all the stuff in there ... looks like a lot of people patched it over time
[14:28:02] <dommex> instead of debugging it, i might as well just start from scratch

[15:00:55] <dommex> what qt version are you using?
[15:06:48] <r_rios> dommex: 5.5
[15:06:56] <r_rios> 5.5.1, to be exact
[15:07:04] <dommex> okay, cool
[15:07:06] <dommex> 4 or 5 was all i wanted to know
[15:07:14] <r_rios> On Windows, compiled with MSVC
[15:09:00] <r_rios> All I did so far was to create a 3rdparty subdir in my project, then add libcrashreporter-qt as a submodule inside it
[15:09:20] <dommex> in tomahawk we have this code: 
[15:09:23] <dommex> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/JNxkmMvR/
[15:09:42] <r_rios> Ah, right
[15:09:54] <dommex> by now it might be time to switch the default

[15:13:59] <dommex> jherskowitz: sure, i'm starting with a clean formula now
[15:16:04] <jherskowitz> dommex: also the formula in our tap needs an if statement for newest OSX 
[15:16:30] <dommex> according to feepk it doesnt need them at all :)
[15:16:32] <r_rios> dommex: It worked, but now I have more than 80 compilation errors: https://paste.kde.org/psm2rigaf/1lebdr

[15:18:41] <dommex> r_rios: yeah, i havent seen that one... :\ maybe something with automoc/autouic?

[16:47:36] <dommex> do tell
[16:47:49] <r_rios> My project happens to also have a file called crashreporter.ui
[16:48:28] <dommex> ouch
[16:48:33] <r_rios> So, CMake confused the two generated headers and got the one from my project instead of the one from libcrashreporter-qt
[16:48:47] <dommex> glad it's not my fault :)
[16:48:57] <r_rios> I just realized that when I saw some strings from my own project inside the generated header
[16:49:07] <r_rios> I'm glad as well
[16:51:12] <dommex> let me know how it goes in general
[16:51:54] <r_rios> Sure
[16:56:45] <r_rios> Yep, that was it. Renamed the ui file from my project and it compiled
[16:57:10] <r_rios> Thanks a lot for the help
[17:06:03] <ciss> evil
[17:07:54] <dommex> r_rios: np, as i said.. just let me know if it works out in the end. very curious as i don't know anyone using it with msvc
[17:08:18] <dommex> jturney patched the shipped breakpad to be compatible with mingw, i doubt he broke anything.. but who knows :)
[17:08:22] <dommex> interesting to have confirmation
[17:08:43] <dommex> r_rios: also i'm open to any changes that prevent people from having to fork it
[17:09:04] <jturney> I always break stuff
[17:09:05] <dommex> if you have anything else you need, talk to me here or send a PR and we'll certainly find a solution
[17:09:05] <jturney> :)
[17:14:39] <r_rios> Sure. If this works for me, it will be a godsend. StackWalker doesn't seem to work quite well with Qt and plain breakpad seems too painful to set up
[17:16:43] <r_rios> One thing, though. Does this library have the same license as Tomahawk?
[17:16:59] <r_rios> (That is, GPL)

[17:33:07] <jturney> the breakpad code itself is MIT licensed
[17:33:22] <jturney> not sure about the stuff that domme wrote
[17:33:32] <jturney> (I think)
[17:44:16] <muesli> ciss: hey
[17:44:48] <muesli> ciss: the web frontend is used for the playdar js api
[17:49:42] <ciss> muesli: thanks. reading up on it now.
[17:50:04] <muesli> http://www.playdarjs.org/
[17:57:16] <ciss> nice. thanks again.
[17:58:27] <ciss> ah, the port is hardcoded to 60210. alright.
[17:59:26] <ciss> (at least for now, according to the TODO)
[18:06:16] <ciss> btw, it seems that playdar hasn't seen any development since 2010. am i right to assume that playdar will be replaced by another api in the (far) future?

[19:22:10] <dommex> r_rios: well, we can certainly talk about relicensing to LGPL if that's enough for you
[19:23:05] <dommex> making it bsd/mit ... i wouldnt fancy it, but.... let'S see
[19:24:24] <r_rios> dommex: If I can compile it as a shared library instead of a submodule, that will certainly be enough
[19:25:15] <r_rios> Let's see if it'll work for me first, though. I'm still looking into Tomahawk's source code to see how it works
[19:25:35] <dommex> we can also make the submodule create a shared lib 
[19:25:39] <dommex> (optionally)
[19:25:51] <dommex> r_rios: yeah, make it work, then we'll solve licensing issues

[20:27:58] <feepk> dommex: you are mixing 2 different c++ standard libraries so linking fails
[20:28:16] <dommex> feepk: thought so, but any idea how that happened?
[20:28:40] <r_rios> dommex: After I linked crashreporter-handler to my application: LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'mingwex.lib'
[20:29:21] <dommex> feepk: https://paste.kde.org/p3samymfw/cyabtt
[20:29:31] <r_rios> (Which is to be expected, since I'm not using MinGW)
[20:29:55] <feepk> dommex: your contrib libraries are based on our binary package maybe(
[20:29:57] <feepk> ?
[20:30:15] <dommex> feepk: eh yep. do they only work with latest osx?
[20:30:24] <dommex> in other words, no make prebuilt for me?
[20:30:55] <feepk> dommex: well, are you using homebrew for the other libraries?
[20:31:03] <feepk> dommex: this won't fly I fear
[20:31:08] <dommex> for a bunch yeah :{
[20:31:18] <feepk> Not good
[20:31:27] * dommex cries
[20:31:34] <feepk> Use our binary contrib package
[20:31:43] <feepk> And make sure homebrew is not used
[20:31:51] <feepk> So you don't have a mix of both
[20:31:56] <dommex> wondering why it worked outside of brew
[20:32:08] <dommex> but yeah, probably easiest to just use yours
[20:32:25] <feepk> Yes, so I have the pain, not you ;)

[22:25:10] <dommex> r_rios: i dont remember in detail, tbh.. you can look at what tomahawk does
