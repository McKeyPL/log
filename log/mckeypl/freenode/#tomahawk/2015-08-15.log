[19:06:30] <liori> hi, apparently tomahawk requires libechonest > 2.2, yet the .deb packages' control file accepts any version; the control file could be improved to explicitly require 2.2. i'd submit a pull request, but the ppa repository is not hosted there, and i don't see a way to do so on launchpad
[19:26:49] <liori> and another problem is with libechonest's .deb changelog file, bad timestamp prevents running the build

[23:13:25] <sullso> I enabled (both) spotify extensions, yet I'm not seeing anything like a cloud section on the left hand site as depicted on tomahawk-player.org with google music
[23:13:26] <sullso> where is it?
[23:19:24] <sullso> thouhg, it does seem to play from spotify.. i'd just like a spotfy section with playlists
[23:19:47] <sullso> *though *spotify 
[23:39:19] <theli_ua> it doesn't have a cloud section 
[23:39:42] <theli_ua> cloud section for google doesn't list ALL the music in all access either, its just your uploads/purchases
[23:40:18] <theli_ua> I think you can drag playlist urls form spotify web player into tomahawk but I'm not entirely sure about that
