[19:16:04] <muesli> twelth1: https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/issues
[19:16:58] <theli_ua> oh
[19:17:00] <theli_ua> we have issues

[19:30:41] <jturney> um
[19:30:56] <jturney> https://github.com/jon-turney/google-breakpad/commits/pecoff-dwarf-on-git-20151115 seems to be later
[19:31:45] <dommex> github being weird
[19:31:53] <dommex> on https://github.com/jon-turney/google-breakpad/tree/pecoff-dwarf-on-git-20151115 it shows latest commit was in october 
[19:32:10] <dommex> ah
[19:32:13] <dommex> commited vs pushed
[19:32:21] <jturney> yeah, I think so
[19:32:42] <jturney> I think I got distracted in the middle of doing that
[19:32:55] <jturney> I was going to update cygwin and msys2 packages but didn't get around to it
[19:33:23] <jturney> I think some of the mingw-specific patches aren't needed anymore with the latest mingw64

[19:44:07] <dommex> oh great
[19:44:11] <dommex> jturney: know which?
[19:44:17] <dommex> or you mean in breakpad?
[19:44:50] <jturney> no, I mean that some of the extra patches I have may be redundant
[19:45:35] <jturney> I don't know which of the top of my head.  I'd have to check.
[20:33:27] <theli_ua> should resolver issues be filed under tomahawk-resolvers or in the main repo?

[20:52:51] <jherskowitz> dommex: ^
[20:53:11] <dommex> theli_ua: depends on the error :-)
[20:53:50] <dommex> if you can tell where the problem is, file it in the appropriate repo

[22:38:33] <theli_ua> tbh I'm not sure if they changed something or if I didnot do a good job of porting youtube-dl's code
[22:42:15] <theli_ua> oh and dommex I hope you'll have time to take a look at that one youtube pr I posted
