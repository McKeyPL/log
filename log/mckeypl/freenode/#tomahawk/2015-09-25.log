[20:14:14] <theli_ua> I mean, tidal never was working on 0.8 releases, but it should just work on nightly
[20:14:36] <outhre4> how to use it? i could find plugin for Tidal
[20:14:52] <outhre4> ok, i have 0.8.4 prom PPA
[20:15:16] <muesli> outhre4: wouldn't work on that release yet, sorry. upcoming 0.9 will support it tho

[20:24:51] <outhre4> hm I use PPA with nightly but still don't have plugin for Tidal 
[20:25:07] <outhre4> now I have 0.8.99
