[00:33:51] <dommex> pubparisporn: any resolvers (except the seed warning in gmusic) give you any error/warnings in the sidebar?
[00:36:25] <theli_ua> meh, netease blocked their servers to outside world
[00:37:08] <dommex> hehe
[00:37:14] <dommex> theli_ua: anything i can do for you? :P
[00:37:34] <dommex> won't get to HLS on windows before sunday :P

[00:37:53] <theli_ua> eh I dont care about windows tbh 
[00:37:55] <theli_ua> :D
[00:37:57] <theli_ua> fix lookupUrl ?
[00:38:06] <theli_ua> review my PRs?
[00:38:31] <theli_ua> do something about various artists?
[00:38:33] <dommex> looking what needs to be reviewed...
[00:38:45] <theli_ua> make resolver's metadata matter?
[00:38:55] <theli_ua> make rearranging results possible?
[00:39:36] <theli_ua> I think I can always find something
[00:40:35] <dommex> that's the problem if you fix all the small issues.. people want you to fix the bigger ones :P
[00:42:19] <theli_ua> I was talking about resolver prs , lol
[00:42:24] <theli_ua> I think I have something there
[00:42:32] <theli_ua> I didnt even remember about that disambiguation one
[00:45:46] <dommex> theli_ua: what was the deal with the bandcamp simple resolver again? it has poor sound quality but works without an api key?
[00:46:06] <theli_ua> it works without the key, provides 128kbps streams
[00:46:20] <dommex> theli_ua: does it work on current master?
[00:46:39] <theli_ua> I'm pretty sure, but let me recheck
[00:48:27] <theli_ua> dommex: it does as far as resolver foes
[00:48:28] <theli_ua> goes
[00:48:37] <dommex> okies
[00:48:38] <theli_ua> I mean, tomahawk rejects its' urls,lol
[00:48:40] <dommex> no warnings?
[00:48:44] <dommex> oh lol -_-
[00:48:51] <theli_ua> because they are 302 redirects I guess
[00:49:12] <theli_ua> so either tomahawk needs to be fixed or resolver needs to say "checked: true"
[00:52:50] <dommex> ah uh eh
[00:57:08] <theli_ua> and I have no idea why tomahawk started rejecting bandcamp results , used to work just fine, and urls work perfectly fine outside of tomahawk as well
