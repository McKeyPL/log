[00:22:01] <tomabee> @Allanitomwesh mentioned: @tomahawk how do I set it up? I don't think setting up the plugin for last FM was enough. Should I also install last FM on my PC? [<no value>]

[18:41:56] <modeno1> Out of curiosity, what steps do I need to go through in order to implement a new feature and getting it accepted in the master branch?
[18:43:44] <modeno1> As in, will it go throught some kind of tests (and if so, what kind) and who is responsible for them (project manager, any major contributor, etc)
[18:44:17] <jherskowitz> modeno1: desktop?
[18:44:27] <jherskowitz> it would go through either muesli or domme generally
[18:44:41] <jherskowitz> android would go through MrMaffen 
[18:47:44] <modeno1> Jherskowitz2: thanks for the answer
[18:48:27] <modeno1> is there a public list of features "to be implemented"?

[19:06:12] <modeno1> and what kind of testing does it go through after the main coding part is done?
