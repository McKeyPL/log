[00:29:21] <domme> TheOneRing: is resolving to collections supposed to work in gmusic?
[00:29:49] <TheOneRing> domme: did you ping the wrong one?^^
[00:29:49] <domme> eh
[00:29:51] <domme> theli_ua: ^
[00:29:53] <domme> yes
[00:30:20] <theli_ua> yes
[00:30:27] <domme> mhmhmh
[00:30:43] <theli_ua> iirc only gmusic and amazon make use of new js collection
[00:31:09] <theli_ua> well, js on desktop, its native on android MrMaffen says
[00:31:15] <domme> yes, i know
[00:31:19] <domme> i'm talking about desktop
[00:31:33] <domme> so.. resolving is supposed to work through your hack?
[00:32:07] <domme> through Tomahawk.collections...
[00:32:14] <theli_ua> that is how it is working in master
[00:32:32] <domme> now.. why doesnt it work for me? :P
[00:32:35] <domme> what did i break? :P
[00:32:47] <theli_ua> parent resolver class has a resolve wrapper that apart from calling resolve implementation also calls resolve on collections, concats results and returns that
[00:33:15] <domme> yeah
[00:34:15] <theli_ua> iirc there was also a hook for when collections are registered to add collection to a list which that resolve wrapper iterates
[00:34:22] <domme> yep yep
[00:34:33] <domme> i'm seeing that, and actually it should work, but it doesnt :-)
[00:34:36] <domme> investigating
[00:36:27] <theli_ua> well, ideally pipeline should resolve through collections or smth
[00:37:07] <theli_ua> not sure how much value would investigation on why current implementation doesn't work give you
[00:53:34] *** Quits: soee (~soee@u28n61.nowanet.pl) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[00:56:06] <domme> theli_ua: everything right with that implementation, gmusic all access was broken
[00:56:34] <theli_ua> huh
[00:57:11] <domme> using undefined variables, just crashed without error
[00:57:20] <domme> and the promise never resolved nor finished with an error
[00:57:21] <theli_ua> шр
[00:57:23] <theli_ua> *oh
[00:57:42] <theli_ua> eh, what are you doing, it woks perfectly fine for me :(
[00:58:06] <domme> then you probably don't use all access
[00:58:11] <domme> or webkit on qt4  behaves differently
[00:58:27] <theli_ua> I dont use all access anymore
[00:58:34] <domme> see
[00:58:38] <domme> only all access is broken
[01:05:15] <domme> MrMaffen: theli_ua: need your helpz
[01:05:34] <domme> so now with that fixed ... gmusic returns the same track twice once from all access and once from collection
[01:05:49] <domme> any idea how to dedupe?
[01:05:50] <theli_ua> so
[01:05:55] <theli_ua> why would you want to
[01:06:01] <MrMaffen> domme: with the same exact id?
[01:06:06] <theli_ua> s/want to/bother
[01:06:07] <domme> MrMaffen: unfortunately not
[01:06:15] <MrMaffen> yea that's what I thought
[01:06:18] <domme> theli_ua: because the collection result is linked to the collection
[01:06:21] <MrMaffen> they're two separate results actually
[01:06:22] <domme> all access track isnt
[01:06:45] <theli_ua> there is no way for you to know if one is better than the other
[01:06:48] <domme> yeah but i'd argue that one would want the collection result and be able to jump to the collection
[01:06:59] <MrMaffen> hm I'd argue the opposite :D
[01:07:01] <domme> yeah, maybe we can do with a different icon
[01:07:08] <theli_ua> I'm with mrmaffen on that one
[01:07:13] <domme> o.O
[01:07:13] <MrMaffen> shitty track in collection, I want the official all access one
[01:07:19] <theli_ua> ^
[01:07:21] <domme> mh
[01:07:26] <MrMaffen> but both points are valid
[01:07:28] <domme> yeah, let's do different icon
[01:07:30] <theli_ua> indeed
[01:07:31] <domme> at some point
[01:07:35] <MrMaffen> sometimes you have a specific version in your locker that you want
[01:07:36] <domme> dont care enough right now
[01:07:41] <domme> fine? :-D
[01:07:44] <theli_ua> yes
[01:07:46] <MrMaffen> yep
[01:07:52] <theli_ua> its the same for me with amazon
[01:08:02] <theli_ua> one from collection, one from prime music
[01:08:10] <domme> theli_ua: MrMaffen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YmMNpbFjp0
[01:08:12] <tomabee> [ That was easy | www.youtube.com | https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3YmMNpbFjp0/hqdefault.jpg ]
[01:08:26] <MrMaffen> :D
[01:08:50] <domme> theli_ua: MrMaffen: yeah, thinking about it more i agree it's bad to hide one or another result
[01:09:07] <theli_ua> also, speaking of amazon domme  MrMaffen 
[01:09:11] <domme> actually a lot of the logic that makes distinguishing them both possible already ... was implemented for hmv
[01:09:21] * domme coughs
[01:09:26] <domme> gotta go
[01:09:47] * MrMaffen runs
[01:10:11] <theli_ua> that easy button reminds me of that aws iot buttons from amazon
[01:10:18] * theli_ua wants to play with home automation
[01:10:26] * theli_ua bought a house
[01:10:33] <domme> congrats!
[01:11:16] <theli_ua> well, technically even though all approvals came in the deal is not considered closed yet, signattures should be made this thursady or friday, but thanks

[01:18:06] <theli_ua> so, are we moving to console.log as opposed to TOmahawk.log ?

[01:18:54] <domme> did i commit that?
[01:18:58] <MrMaffen> yup
[01:19:04] <domme> ah, yeah, by mistake
[01:19:12] <TheOneRing> btw where can I download the amazon axa? the prime collection sucks but I guess it could be useful :)
[01:19:40] <domme> MrMaffen: i don't have strong feelings about it, but i want Tomahawk.log to be much better than it is right now
[01:20:21] <domme> i don't care if we make our runtimes log console.log to the actual application console or if we have a wrapper that logs to javascript console and application console

[01:21:37] <theli_ua> oh really??? thats cool TheOneRing 
[01:21:54] <TheOneRing> at least in germany not sure about the rest
[01:22:01] <theli_ua> domme: MrMaffen I would really love you to test if prime music works for you

[04:45:19] <domme> theli_ua: quick question only: is gmusic resolver going through nativeAsyncRequest on desktop too?
[04:47:07] <theli_ua> I'm not sure. Depends on if we need that to access setcookie header
[04:47:23] <domme> yeah we do apparently
[04:47:45] <domme> but i can't seem to figure out ... where tomahawk on desktop would add that header to the native request result

[04:48:37] <domme> it does only have Content-Type afaict

[05:14:50] <domme> ( theli_ua if you have any idea how this set-cookie thing used to work ... let me know :C)
[05:15:51] <theli_ua> I'm not actually sure it is needed on desktop tbh
[05:15:58] <domme> why?
[05:16:31] <theli_ua> there were some differences in when native request was needed between android and desktop
[05:16:46] <domme> i was kinda expecting this ...
[05:16:51] <theli_ua> I *think* to get that set cookie header it is not needed to do native on desktop, but I might be wrong
[05:18:46] <theli_ua> domme: looks like it wasn't doing native if it wanted a cookie before android tomahawk.js got merged in https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk/blob/10fc1adf6e1c21f59cb00ad9d323e23a6bc59988/data/js/tomahawk.js

[05:26:12] <domme> theli_ua: uh yes
[05:26:20] <domme> apparently non-native requests work
[05:27:19] <domme> so i broke gmusic addiotionally by adding debug output in a then() but forgetting to return the data again

[05:27:44] <domme> okay, the good news is, it works again
[05:28:01] <domme> the bad news is: why is it a native request now?
[05:29:57] <domme> apparently because the shouldDoNativeRequest implementation is flawed

[05:48:46] <theli_ua> domme: I think this happened when mrmaffen was merging android's tomahawk.js
[05:50:45] <theli_ua> wait, master shouldn't do a native request, theres something wrong with your branch domme  I guess
[05:51:00] <domme> yeah
[05:51:09] <domme> shouldDoNativeRequest() was behaving differently
[05:51:17] <domme> not sure which one is right tbh
[05:52:11] <theli_ua> domme: oh, its actually not a cookie
[05:52:30] <theli_ua> it started using native because we added custom useragent to gmusic
[05:52:41] <domme> yeah
[05:52:53] <theli_ua> I dont know why
[05:53:07] <theli_ua> it also seems to be not needed as it is set to 'tomahawk-gmusic;
[05:53:22] <theli_ua> it should still work with native though

[05:57:04] <theli_ua> dunno, maybe you just broke native request

[05:59:05] <domme> EXACTLY
[05:59:08] <theli_ua> it is supposed to go to native because of useragent
[05:59:25] <domme> right now it works again
