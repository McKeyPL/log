[20:50:30] <theli_ua> wow, jherskowitz http://i.imgur.com/dcX3FZo.png  wrt classical music
[20:51:36] <jherskowitz> ugh, classical
[20:52:04] <theli_ua> heh
[20:52:15] <theli_ua> I need to find a service with those resolvable 
[20:54:23] <jherskowitz> theli_ua: problem is we look for “artist” for those you probably want “composer” + “conductor” + “orchestra” + “performance” + “composition” + “movement”. :P 
[20:54:59] <theli_ua> yeah, and the organ/place its played on
[20:55:23] <theli_ua> wrt those particular pieces on the screenshot
[20:56:33] <theli_ua> though some of those could be resolved via youtube if we had access to those music fields on youtube
[20:57:45] <theli_ua> jherskowitz: do you build your own tomahawk or do you use nightlies?
[20:58:15] <jherskowitz> build
[20:58:48] <theli_ua> oh, I wonder would you like to build my branch and test if amazon resolver works for you?
[20:59:08] <theli_ua> as it requires tomahawk changes :-/
[21:02:27] <domme> theli_ua: yeah we added quite a bit of jsapi
[21:02:39] <domme> not sure what we ported back to zomahawk yet
[21:03:23] <theli_ua> domme: wat, I mean, I;m not sure what you talk about

[22:02:44] <theli_ua> ohwait, nvm, looks like quotes around the track title o_O

[23:44:51] <theli_ua> meh, youtube resolver fails to extract corrects url in a lot of pages
[23:54:00] <theli_ua> oh, we seem to be blocked by user agent
[23:54:06] <theli_ua> well, that sucks
[23:57:53] <theli_ua> yeah, tomahawk is blocked to access tracks like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8SBdvrotnM where there is a proper track with proper user - title info
