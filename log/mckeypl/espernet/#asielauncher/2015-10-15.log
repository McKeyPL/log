[21:07:10] <asie> jakimfett: Great idea!
[21:07:25] <asie> The problem is, BC cannot go on there much. I'd love for it to, but I really need a BC-centric test server as I will be breaking a lot of things in BC 8
[21:07:34] <asie> (on top of that, having tons of alternatives doesn't help find what is missing in BC itself)
[21:07:46] <asie> so I'll probably miss out on it
[21:08:31] <jakimfett> I'm curious...why can't bc go on it? Too bleeding edge at the moment, or...?
[21:09:12] <asie> Well, it can
[21:09:17] <asie> But with a BC server, it's not just for bugtesting
[21:09:20] <asie> it's for featuretesting and playtesting
[21:09:54] <asie> Bugtesting would work fine there
[21:10:06] <asie> a lot depends on whether it's creative or survival
[21:10:31] <asie> and I'm conflicted about it
[21:10:39] <asie> I was trying to make my own BC server for a while, but Id on't have the time to maintain it
[21:11:30] <asie> not to mention, there's a lot of people who were testing BC
[21:11:33] <asie> and I'd like to eventually make them a home
[21:11:44] <asie> I had a semi-official testing server once, ran by another group... good times...
[21:11:47] <asie> sorry for being a bit incoherent btw
[21:12:53] <jakimfett> well, the server I'm running is pure survival
[21:12:57] <jakimfett> 's totally ok
[21:13:35] <jakimfett> if I added BC back in, it'd solve my pump problem.
[21:13:38] <asie> i've been going for a more BC-centric experience
[21:17:14] <asie> jakimfett: also, i'm curious
[21:17:20] <asie> why does it say "Have a Patreon?" in your tweet?
[21:19:32] <jakimfett> if you're a patreon creator, and you want to add dev server access as a reward for your $#+ donators 
[21:19:35] <jakimfett> was what I meant
[21:21:34] <jakimfett> So, asie...in an ideal world, the server would have fewer mods to push more people through the buildcraft experience?
[21:22:52] <asie> jakimfett: Yeah, of course.
[21:23:02] <asie> And it would also have much more BC connection
[21:23:05] <asie> the people would give their input, etc.
[21:23:25] <asie> it'd be a hand-picked team of BC veterans, past developers and streamers - people who generally live with BuildCraft on a regular basis *and* can see through its flaws *and* still use it.
[21:23:28] <asie> Not a lot of people.
[21:26:16] <jakimfett> I'm open to adding buildcraft to the mix. It would let me trim a few things from my modlist, eg extra utilities because nobody has a bloody water pump
[21:27:01] <asie> well
[21:27:02] <jakimfett> there's still going to be other mods, but I do know people will use it and give feedback...in general, I know everyone on the server, and they talk to me via skype/twitter/IRC regularly...if something is borked, they let me know
[21:27:06] <asie> you could, i'd be more than happy
[21:27:08] <asie> you can always trim BC down
[21:27:11] <asie> the pump is in Factory
[21:27:30] <jakimfett> do you have an open build server somewhere?
[21:29:41] <jakimfett> asie ^
[21:36:16] <asie> jakimfett: yes, nallar's
[21:36:34] <asie> nallar's is agreed upon to track the latest stable branch, though
[21:36:49] <asie> for the BC 8 branch... i don't recommend it
[21:36:52] <asie> BCCompat won't work for ages etc
[21:36:56] <asie> things will break
[21:37:07] <asie> http://nallar.me/buildservice/job/Buildcraft/
[21:37:53] <jakimfett> Duly noted.
[21:40:40] <asie> BC 8 will slowly be happening, but it's redesigning a lot of things
[21:40:49] <asie> gates, the pipe balance, quarries, refining, etc.
