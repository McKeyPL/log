[12:07:54] <BeboBobo> good morning
[12:18:02] <BeboBobo> long time no see. hope everything is still goin good with you and your server. I was curious if you were working on asielauncher to update it to 1.7.10? I saw on the asielauncer site that it does not work with 1.7.10
[12:45:24] <McKey> Ah... Ok thx for reply :3
[12:45:39] <McKey> after... long time but thanks

[18:19:51] <BeboBobo> so i am guessing by the github and download link that asielauncher has not been updated for 1.7.10?
[19:10:23] <jakimfett> McKey: the asielauncher is dead. There is, and will be, no further update, and no support.
[19:10:30] <jakimfett> BeboBobo: same as I told McKey.
[21:08:10] <BeboBobo> ok, ty for the clarification. is there an alternate that you could suggest?
[21:12:40] *** cbcercas is now known as cbcercas|AFK
[22:15:59] <jakimfett> personally, I'm switching to the Curse launcher ASAP
[22:16:14] <jakimfett> it's not quite the same, but it's getting there
[22:17:14] <jakimfett> at some point in the future, if my Patreon blows up and I'm able to take time off my day job to mod, I've got an idea for a server based mod distribution architecture...but it'll not be this month, that's for sure.
