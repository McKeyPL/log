[06:21:58] <Algido> Hello Futashy 
[06:22:02] <samonuh> To me debating philosophy is equivalent to telling somebody that their interpretation of the world is wrong, which to me is ridiculous because it's all personal interpretation and trying to claim that your interpretation is objective reality is robbing people of their individuality.
