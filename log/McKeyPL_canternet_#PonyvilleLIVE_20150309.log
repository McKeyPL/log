[12:35:15] <Hoofy> nope
[12:35:48] * MirSar floats over to StarStream's plushies and spreads all over
[12:36:04] * StarStream use vacuum cleaner on the plushies
[12:36:24] * MirSar o_O <- not as planned!
[12:36:51] * StarStream collect the ash and stuff it into an empty plush skin 
[12:37:10] * StarStream stuff it fully and sew it up 
[12:37:11] * MirSar can't see what plush he/it is
[12:37:42] <MirSar> (afk - fuudz)
[12:37:55] <StarStream> oh ok

[12:42:57] <Electron> hair-drier?

[12:43:36] <StarStream> well bad for the hair dryer
[12:43:50] <StarStream> can work 
[12:47:08] <StarStream> but only on low heat setting

[12:49:07] <StarStream> so he is my lucky charm in bear form 
[12:53:24] <StarStream> and i highly highly respect him 
[12:54:57] <Electron> what lifetime do a plushie have?
[13:02:47] * MirSar re-animates the plushie and starts walking around making zombie noises
[13:04:03] <Electron> what was for food, MirSar?
[13:04:23] <MirSar> Pasta and meat balls ^^
[13:04:49] * Electron drools a little
[13:04:58] <MirSar> tasty tasty balls of meat :3
[13:05:22] * Electron drools a lot
[13:05:47] * MirSar chuckles and keeps his mind to himself

[14:13:56] <MirSar> StarStream is not the perverted type (unlike others here) ^^
[14:16:06] <StarStream> thank you 
[14:16:59] <Electron> hey! :\
[14:17:23] * Electron looks daggers at MirSar
[14:18:10] <MirSar> What.. I ment myself and probbobly TheFlutterGuy and Lunia in spesiffic, you can join too if you really wanna
[14:19:08] <StarStream> i tend to become a pervertish if i see a very nice looking plushies :P 
[14:19:20] <Hoofy> oh
[14:19:56] <Electron> it is contagious
[14:19:59] <Electron> D:
[14:20:13] <Hoofy> oh
[14:20:19] <StarStream> maybe
[14:20:24] <StarStream> then again i am asexual 
[14:21:54] <MirSar> I beleave most (if not all) asexual persons stil are sexualy exited by something, either afraid to admitt it or just not found out yet :3
[14:22:07] <StarStream> correct
[14:22:21] <StarStream> for me its my plushies which may or may not get me excited
[14:24:31] <StarStream> so hoofy what do u think of the picture ?
[14:25:03] * MirSar pats StarStream "good you found your fetish" ^^
[14:25:12] <Hoofy> yep
[14:25:20] <StarStream> uhm... i found it ages ago mir 
[14:25:26] <StarStream> just i dont say it out 
[14:25:37] <StarStream> other than bragging about nice plushies i own 
[14:26:12] *** Ashleep is now known as Ash[Away]
[14:27:09] <MirSar> You don't hear me talking about my fetishes either. Yes I talk about Porn and sexual stuff, but not my actuall fetish
[14:27:28] <StarStream> oh i didnt know u have a fetish ?
[14:28:35] <MirSar> I know everyone got one, of some kind. Just didn't knew what your was until now :3
[14:29:08] <StarStream> well.. its kind of obvious 
[14:29:29] <StarStream> i am a plushophile and i tend to brag my plushies a lot so of course it would link to my fetish also 
[14:30:31] <MirSar> You could just like Plushies normally very much, well that's what I've thought until now.
[14:30:41] <StarStream> true also 
[14:31:01] <StarStream> i do like them like normal also 
[14:32:04] <MirSar> If i had a RD Plushie, I'd probbobly be in love too. Only downside is the family, would be embaresing :P
[14:33:17] <StarStream> hey u know i own many plushies... tho still not enough compared to some people 
[14:33:25] <StarStream> but size wise i am pretty satiesfied 
[14:33:32] <StarStream> i do have huge disney plushies 
[14:33:47] <StarStream> i have 4 of them 
[14:37:03] <MirSar> nice, do you stil live home or on your own/with a partner?
[14:41:41] <StarStream> home 
[14:45:12] <StarStream> feel so weird after i give my bear a shower and despite drying up like decent 
[14:45:18] <StarStream> it feel like there is some weight on the bear
[14:47:22] <MirSar> You'll have to dry it for a few days for all the water to evaporate
[15:02:35] <StarStream> yea
[15:05:31] <StarStream> feel kind of nice tbh 
[15:05:39] <StarStream> smelling him 
[15:05:43] <StarStream> cuddle him 
[15:06:23] <StarStream> sad tho if i wanna shower with a giant plush it would be near impossible
[15:06:34] <StarStream> because of the ridiculous amount of time needed for drying that said plush 
[15:14:01] * MirSar sneaks in StarStream's backdoor and lays down with all the plushies, pretending to be a plushie himself
