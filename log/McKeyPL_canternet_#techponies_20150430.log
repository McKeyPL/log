[00:29:12] <DataByteBrony> i imagine it's riddled with typos.. but i'm generating a dictionary based on fimfiction (because, why not), and it's now twice the size of the unix dictionary, and i'm not even halfway through
[00:34:07] <DataByteBrony> hm.. using a program and a free merriam-webster api, it would take... one full year to check all of these entries

[01:08:54] <johnsey> DataByteBrony: a dictionary tends to be a bit more than just a plain listing of words
[01:09:31] <DataByteBrony> indeed - but what good are words without meaning?
[01:09:55] <DataByteBrony> without a dictionary, language degrades
[01:10:03] <DataByteBrony> and evolves into something else

[01:16:44] <JustAberrant> carbon steel is easy to mill?
[01:16:55] <tiwake> its a low carbon steel
[01:17:08] <tiwake> 0.1% or so
[01:17:17] <JustAberrant> I'll take your word, I'm a simple minded programmer not a metallurgist ;p
[01:17:36] <tiwake> 12L14 has lead mixed in for easy machining

[22:19:27] <Gigabit> I want to use a port other then 80 to access my webserver, can I tell the router to use say.. 7787 as the public and forward that to my webserver? So they would have to use whatever.net:7787 ?
