[20:57:30] <Littlepip> Because people do a whole lot less uploading than downloading and usually upload less data at a time, and it's probably cheaper for ISPs to pay for less bandwidth on their upstream to the rest of the Internet?
[20:59:57] <Stik> with adsl it was to do with the technology choices i think
[21:00:04] <Stik> don't know if it's the same with modern cable and things
[21:01:27] <Littlepip> DOCSIS can support up to 120Mbps upstream with 4 upstream channels, or up to 250 or so with 8.
[21:01:45] <Littlepip> That's sufficient for my ISP to offer a symmetrical upstream/downstream on every plan they offer
[21:02:07] <Stik> neat
[21:05:46] *** \m is now known as mniip
[21:07:06] <johnsey> it also prevents people from (mis)using home lines as business lines
[21:07:22] <johnsey> which tend to be much more expensive
[21:07:41] <Littlepip> Mmhmm
[21:07:45] <Littlepip> Which is dumb :(
[21:09:09] <johnsey> not from the ISP's perspective ;)
[21:09:20] <Littlepip> I just looked at my ISP's side
[21:09:22] <Littlepip> site*
[21:09:36] <Littlepip> Their business plans are the same up/down as the home plans
[21:09:49] <Littlepip> Only difference is a static IP and +50$ price per month
[21:10:26] <johnsey> maybe your ISP sells hosting-oriented plans over a different website
[21:10:43] <johnsey> possibly even under a different name
[21:10:52] <Littlepip> Maybe
[21:11:00] <johnsey> quite common practice
[21:11:48] <Littlepip> I'm with Cogeco... I'm still not sure if they have anything to do with the similarly-named Cogent.
