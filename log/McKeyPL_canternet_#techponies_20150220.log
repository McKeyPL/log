[00:00:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> its suggestive dbecuase thats that is the name of a generic ssl ad injection module
[00:00:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> so the same key might be used by everyting that implments komodia
[00:00:58] <Colgate> that would be trivial to check
[00:01:21] <ShivalPonyWolf> if this is the main key to everything komodia based then it could be far more wide spread then just the superfish adware

[13:03:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> or you dont give idiots root
[13:03:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> and have backups
[13:05:07] * Phase4 uses btrfs snapshots
[13:05:55] <Moonlightning> Indeed.
[13:08:14] <Moonlightning> btrfs: the Fluttershy filesystem
[13:08:44] <Phase4> $ ls /var/snapshots/ | wc -l
[13:08:45] <Phase4> 111
[13:08:52] <Phase4> i should clear these out at some point
[13:10:12] <Moonlightning> I keep hearing abotu btrfs
[13:10:15] <Moonlightning> Is it better than ext4?
[13:10:36] <Phase4> it's more powerful
[13:10:40] <Googie> Depends on what you mean by better.
[13:10:45] <Googie> But yeah, more powerful certainly
[13:11:32] <Googie> It's kinda... there's still the occasional question of stability and maturity. Personally I'm fine with it on my personal stuff.
[13:11:42] <Phase4> Moonlightning, checksums (data+metadata), theoretically unable to leave the filesystem in an inconsistent state, efficent atomic snapshots
[13:11:57] <Phase4> the multi device stuff has awesome potential but needs work
[13:12:13] <Phase4> Moonlightning, but slow as balls on spinning disks
[13:12:19] <Moonlightning> Ahhhh
[13:12:21] <Googie> Think a slightly less mature competitor to ZFS if you've read about that.
[13:12:31] <Phase4> CoW from the ground up, naturally fragments damn near everything
[13:13:28] <Moonlightning> Wasn't it started in 2008?

[13:13:38] <Googie> Yes :P
[13:13:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> i just realised i only ahve 1 physical linux box in my control
[13:13:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> every other box of about the 50-60 i look after is virtual
[13:14:53] <Moonlightning> How does it still have questionable stability|maturity? >.<
[13:15:14] <Phase4> Googie, sorta, ZFS has a block layer that btrfs doesn't
[13:15:51] <Googie> Moonlightning: Because when dealing with file systems, everyone is really cautious.
[13:15:59] <Moonlightning> …fair enough.
[13:16:14] <Phase4> i will say that it won't eat your data
[13:16:23] <Moonlightning> What do /in-band/ and /out-of-band/ mean?
[13:16:24] <Phase4> and if it does explode, recovery is a breeze
[13:16:26] <Googie> Some of the userland tools are underdeveloped also last I checked
[13:16:30] <Moonlightning> As in /in-band data deduplication/
[13:16:46] <Phase4> Moonlightning, in-band deduplication means it tries to deduplicate on write()
[13:17:00] <Phase4> which consumes far more ram than it's worth imo, but ZFS will do it
[13:17:37] <Moonlightning> How's that work? o.o
[13:18:22] <Moonlightning> (I guess I could use btrfs for my mane personal stuffs, anyway, and stick with ext4 on backup volumes…problem is, only my Mac has an SSD. xP )

[13:20:03] <Phase4> but to be effective: a lot
[13:20:09] <Phase4> lota ram
[13:20:20] <Moonlightning> Aha.
[13:20:41] <Moonlightning> …dat `cp --reflink` o.o
[13:20:57] <Phase4> Moonlightning, raw vm images with efficent snapshots ftw
[13:21:11] <Moonlightning> Mmm?
[13:22:19] <Moonlightning> … O.O
[13:22:26] <Moonlightning> Apple's Time Machine should use btrfs o.o
[13:22:35] <Moonlightning> btrfs backup volume
[13:22:51] <Googie> But yeah, ZFS and BTRFS are both pretty much competing to be "next gen" file systems, they both have a lot of neat stuff. At some point BTRFS will probably start to become the default Linux file system for most distros... at some point.
[13:23:00] <Moonlightning> last I heard, they use this directory-hardlinking black magic
[13:23:25] <Googie> ZFS exists for Linux, but licensing prohibits distributing it directly in the kernel.
[13:23:27] <Moonlightning> And just hardlink entire directory trees if they haven't changed since the last backup
[13:23:31] <Moonlightning> licensing O.o
[13:23:32] <Googie> Or something :V
[13:23:55] <Googie> Although there are easy to use packages for it.
[13:24:35] <Googie> Yeah, ZFS came out of the old OpenSolaris code IIRC, and the CDDL isn't compatible with the GPL
[13:25:21] <Phase4> Oracle owns the ZFS code now
[13:25:42] <Phase4> and since btrfs was their thing, it's not looking like they have any interest in opening ZFS
[13:26:32] <Googie> Yeah
[13:27:11] <Moonlightning> Ahhh
[13:27:28] <Phase4> the block layer is mostly why i'd love zfs to stay around
[13:28:29] <Phase4> btrfs isn't great with images, but you can export part of a zpool as a block device
[13:28:35] <Phase4> i think it even does snapshots
[13:28:42] <Moonlightning> Huh?
[13:29:24] *** Quits: nscoots (FreyGrimrod@Pony-pgr.ff4.191.107.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[13:29:53] <Phase4> other thing that's fun with zfs is software tends to assume that writing to the same spot in a file does not consume more hard disk space
[13:29:59] <Phase4> btrfs', not zfs
[13:30:30] <Phase4> because in btrfs that's very explicitly not true, absolutely any action which changes filesystem state requires new space
[13:30:58] <Phase4> which makes running out of space an incredibly painful thing
[13:31:24] <Googie> For stuff that does heavy writing like that though, COW can be disabled on a per-file level, although ideally it shouldn't need to be, and yeah, if you run out of space...
[13:31:32] <Moonlightning> o.o;
[13:32:05] <Moonlightning> But, I mean… 6_9
[13:33:00] <Googie> Oh yeah, that's the "funny" thing, space in general on BTRFS, it's difficult to know exactly how much free space there really is left.
[13:33:06] <Phase4> good to turn cow off for vm images
[13:33:18] <Phase4> yeah, it's a very fuzzy concept in btrfs
[13:34:01] <Phase4> btrfs files are not just a chunk of disk space
[13:35:33] <Phase4> allocation is a bit funny at times too, you'll want to run a btrfs balance every few months
[13:36:55] <Moonlightning> balance?
[13:37:35] <Phase4> if you've ever used postgresql/sqlite, it's similar to a vacuum
[13:38:24] <Phase4> colapses the allocated space into contigious areas, reclaiming unused areas, and balances allocation across disks if there's more than one
[13:44:40] *** Joins: nscoots (FreyGrimrod@Pony-pgr.ff4.191.107.IP)
[13:45:15] <Moonlightning> That sounds an awful like a defragment
[13:45:48] <Phase4> not quite, defragmenting tries to allocate files as contigious areas of disk
[13:46:00] <Phase4> btrfs also has the ability to defragment
