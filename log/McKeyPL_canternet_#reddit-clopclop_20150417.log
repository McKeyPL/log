[00:02:00] <Vulpixbrew> cloppyhooves!
[00:02:03] <cloppyhooves> Things that were probably a bad idea:
[00:02:06] <cloppyhooves> What I just did
[00:02:08] <cloppyhooves> Hi Vulpixbrew c:
[00:02:48] <Wikkit> ?
[00:02:55] <Vulpixbrew> wjhat did you just do?
[00:03:51] <cloppyhooves> I had chai tea in the morning
[00:03:56] <cloppyhooves> And htere was a thing with free coffee
[00:03:59] <cloppyhooves> So I just had vietnamese coffee
[00:04:05] <cloppyhooves> Most of an israeli iced coffee
[00:04:08] <cloppyhooves> And I still have a thai iced tea
[00:04:11] * cloppyhooves vibrates
[00:04:31] <Wikkit> Is that bad?
[00:04:44] <cloppyhooves> Prooooobably shouldn't have had that much caffeine
[00:04:52] <Wikkit> oh you're just wired lol
[00:04:54] <cloppyhooves> Oh well, I usually keep it amount pretty low :o
[00:05:01] <cloppyhooves> So one day of indulgence probably won't hurt c:
[00:05:01] <Vulpixbrew> cloppyhooves is a caffeine lightwieght
[00:05:12] <cloppyhooves> Actually, I used to drink like two cups of coffee a day
[00:05:13] <Wikkit> well If I don't have caffeine for a while I tend to be extremely sensitive
[00:05:14] * Vulpixbrew sips on his 3rd cup of coffee of the day
[00:05:20] <cloppyhooves> And then I got heart palpitations
[00:05:27] <cloppyhooves> So I try to keep it to about one cup a day
[00:05:30] <Vulpixbrew> (not to mention i had a soda+sweet tea earlier
[00:05:36] <Wikkit> right now I consume caffeine every day so my tolerance is relatively high
[00:07:02] <Vulpixbrew> prsonally my meds makje me sleepy so the cofee is fighting the meds

[00:09:06] <cloppyhooves> But heart palipations are not one of my favorite things
[00:10:46] <Wikkit> I did that one time when I was a teenagerI was Determined to clean my room and I had a ton of energy drinksSo I drink like One every hourOr soAnd I've never done that since
[00:11:03] <Wikkit> It was like six in totalThroughout the day

[00:12:02] <Vulpixbrew> through college
[00:12:09] <cloppyhooves> I've never intentionally drank an energy drink

[07:40:47] <Vulpixbrew> I know the gamecube has one and ps2 has a working one
[07:41:49] <Giggles> Nah you can't emulate PS3 yet
[07:41:55] <Giggles> It will probably be a good long while as well.
[07:42:05] <Giggles> PS3 is a bitch to emulate.
[07:42:31] <weisey> Xbox 360 is being worked on
[07:43:12] <Vulpixbrew> is there an xbox one yet?
[07:43:25] <Vulpixbrew> not the xbox one but an xbox
[07:43:43] <Giggles> Not sure
[07:43:44] <Vulpixbrew> why the hell didnt they call it 720?
[07:43:49] <Giggles> Not to my knowledge
[07:43:54] <weisey> There's a 2001 Xbox and a 360 emulator
[07:44:26] <weisey> Unfortunately the 2001 Xbox emulator can only run some tech demos and the futurama gamd

[11:48:09] <cloppyhooves> Last week I got 2 sets
[11:48:16] <cloppyhooves> Which is fine, I guess it was an inevitability
[11:48:21] <cloppyhooves> This week I have 2 sets again D:
[11:48:28] <cloppyhooves> And apparnetly next week the order doesn't even change
[11:48:32] <cloppyhooves> So I'll have 2 sets again >.<
