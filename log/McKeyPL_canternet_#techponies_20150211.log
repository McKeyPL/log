[22:27:40] <Leaf_Runner> Hey, need some help with a Steam game
[22:28:40] <locodash11[server]> what kind of help?
[22:29:40] <Leaf_Runner> The kind where Jedi Academy says it has a corrupted or missing file.
[22:29:47] *** McKey is now known as [A]McKey
[22:30:33] <locodash11[server]> tried running cache check?
[22:30:51] <locodash11[server]> or even just reinstalling?
[22:31:35] <Leaf_Runner> Tried reinstalling, verified cache
[22:32:14] <locodash11[server]> hmmm
[22:32:27] <locodash11[server]> running this in windows, right?
[22:32:58] <Leaf_Runner> Yup
[22:33:41] <Leaf_Runner> It says it'll reaquire the file, then doesn't.
[22:34:39] <locodash11[server]> you could try deleting all the game files yourself, then removing dependancies of them in the registry
[22:35:09] <Leaf_Runner> How so?
[22:36:35] <locodash11[server]> after deleting them, open up regedit, save a backup of the current form, then search for anything like "jedi academy"
[22:37:11] <locodash11[server]> or run a registry cleaner like jetclean I guess, but that might not fix it
[22:37:27] <Leaf_Runner> Gonna need a step-by-step, not that good with computers
[22:38:04] <locodash11[server]> you running windows 8?
[22:38:30] <Leaf_Runner> Yeah
[22:38:50] <locodash11[server]> I don't know how to use that hardly
[22:39:08] <locodash11[server]> so I can't help too much
[22:39:44] <locodash11[server]> google it maybe? or just try jetclean first, it's a free program
[22:46:35] <Leaf_Runner> Holy shit...
[22:46:50] <Leaf_Runner> So many problems...
[22:46:56] <locodash11[server]> heh
[22:47:24] <locodash11[server]> make sure to look through it if you care to keep your recycle bin, or browser history
[22:50:42] <Leaf_Runner> GODDAMMIT, JASP.EXE!
[22:51:23] <locodash11[server]> mmm?
[22:52:08] <Leaf_Runner> The single player keeps crashing!
[22:52:25] <locodash11[server]> erm
[22:53:14] <locodash11[server]> how old is that game btw?
[22:53:36] <Leaf_Runner> Dunno
[22:53:50] <locodash11[server]> because I know battlefront2 had problems like that
[22:54:18] <locodash11[server]> the fix was to have a microphone plugged in
[22:55:15] <AppleDash> lol
[22:55:57] <locodash11[server]> the amazing quality of the earlier starwars games
[22:57:12] <Leaf_Runner> So, how to fix Jedi Academy...
[22:58:05] <locodash11[server]> guess I'm not sure then
[22:58:52] <locodash11[server]> just google lots, because more often than not, you aren't the only one that has had those problems

[23:04:03] <Leaf_Runner> Hopefully this helps...
[23:08:24] <Leaf_Runner> God dammit, GabeN! Fix this shit!
[23:09:07] *** Joins: SpikeDragon (Spike@sorting.those.books)
[23:11:32] <Leaf_Runner> It opens, brings up a console, then black screens like it's going into the game and crashes
[23:14:00] <Leaf_Runner> Can you go off that?
[23:14:25] <Colgate> â€‹thats about as much help as saying "it doesn't work"
[23:14:39] <DataByte> heh
[23:17:57] <Leaf_Runner> It says it unexpectedly stopped working, and that a file is missing.
[23:18:54] <DataByte> does it say /what/ file is missing?
[23:19:27] <Leaf_Runner> Some setup.exe in GameData
[23:20:22] <Colgate> verify local integrity
[23:21:31] <JustAberrant> :)
[23:21:38] <Leaf_Runner> I did. It said it got the file, then didn't.
[23:26:30] <Leaf_Runner> And Steam says jackshit about it.
