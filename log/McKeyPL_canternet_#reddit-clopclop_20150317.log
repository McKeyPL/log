[00:43:04] <Frosty> You have your own board?
[00:43:05] <OmarianVolcae> The snow sucks because it's been like 50 degrees for days.
[00:43:07] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah
[00:43:10] <OmarianVolcae> I own two boards
[00:43:13] <Frosty> What kind?
[00:43:22] <OmarianVolcae> I have a Rome SDS with Rome SDS bindings
[00:43:23] <OmarianVolcae> and
[00:43:36] <OmarianVolcae> a K2 Hit Machine with Burton Custom bindings.

[00:43:43] <OmarianVolcae> I wear SDS boots.
[00:43:50] <OmarianVolcae> I just have one pair of boots.
[00:43:58] <OmarianVolcae> Can't imagine why I'd need another pair.
[00:44:07] <Frosty> The only one I've used so far that I really liked was this 5150 I borrowed from my supervisor

[00:54:29] <OmarianVolcae> Why is regular a "pffft"?
[00:54:57] <OmarianVolcae> And to be specific, I ride duckfoot because I have to do a lot of switch riding for the park.

[00:55:45] <Frosty> And it's pffft because I ride goofy.
[00:55:48] <OmarianVolcae> Both of my bindings are angled 10 degrees out
[00:56:03] <OmarianVolcae> Normally you'd only have the forward binding angled.
[00:56:17] <Frosty> Huh.
[00:56:21] <OmarianVolcae> I ride with both angled. That way I have full turning control when riding switch.

[00:57:21] <OmarianVolcae> I didn't know if I'd be ready for the black runs out here.
[00:57:30] <OmarianVolcae> But I've been bombing down them with my buddy.
[00:57:43] <OmarianVolcae> Hit a 42 degree inclination yesterday.
[00:58:06] <OmarianVolcae> Oddly enough, only a black diamond, not a double.
[01:00:38] <OmarianVolcae> You took your bindings off, Frosty?
[01:01:36] <Frosty> I was given a board for free, so I decided to repaint the top.

[16:33:15] <samonuh> I think it's lazy writing. 
[16:33:30] <samonuh> Unless they integrate the character into the plot well
