[13:33:23] * Electron sets his phasers
[13:39:02] <MirSar> t-4 hrs until beer
[13:39:56] <Electron> 1.5 for me
[13:40:07] <TheFlutterGuy> same for me
[13:40:22] <Electron> why beer though?
[13:40:28] <TheFlutterGuy> beer good
[13:41:40] <TheFlutterGuy> bahahaha. these bugs i'm finding. bahaha
[13:41:41] <MirSar> lol @ vit TheFlutterGuy
[13:41:46] <MirSar> vid*
[13:41:59] <TheFlutterGuy> the program on my phone crashes, because i have no contacts with a phone number...
[13:42:19] <TheFlutterGuy> The program can do stuff with contacts, with phonenumbers. But it can do a lot without too
[13:42:27] <TheFlutterGuy> like. "when i'm at work, disable bluetooth".
[13:42:31] <MirSar> Why would you have contackt with no phone number.. on your phone..?
[13:42:36] <TheFlutterGuy> that will fail, as long as i have no contacts with a phonenumber
[13:42:39] <TheFlutterGuy> MirSar: email
[13:43:01] <MirSar> just create a single contackt with a bogus number then
[13:43:17] * TheFlutterGuy tilts his head
[13:43:25] <TheFlutterGuy> yeah, i did. to try and replicate the bug
[13:43:29] <TheFlutterGuy> but, that's not acceptable.
[13:43:47] <MirSar> ohh, wat?
[13:44:06] <MirSar> if you recreate the bugg, it's not acceptable?
[13:44:25] <MirSar> I might be to "frieday mood"'ed to follow this logic..
[13:44:25] <TheFlutterGuy> no, i mean. i found the bug, relpicated it, solved it with a workaround(creating bogus contact)
[13:44:33] <TheFlutterGuy> but the bug should be solved
[13:44:48] <MirSar> ohh right alright!
[13:45:02] <TheFlutterGuy> the entire point is finding the bugs. ;)
[13:45:35] <MirSar> heh, I'd love that jobb, I love braking stuff and finding out why ^^
[13:46:40] <TheFlutterGuy> indeed :3
[13:47:54] <Electron> the bug should have saved
[13:48:06] <Electron> to show it to the coder
[13:48:12] <Electron> or something

[15:22:27] <Lunia> maybe it does to ponies
[15:22:33] <Lunia> how do you know MirSar
[15:22:41] <MirSar> didn't think bout that *redneck voice*
[15:22:43] <TheFlutterGuy> MirSar: i can't see why not.
[15:22:55] <TheFlutterGuy> i mean yeah, it doesn't usually manifest like that in humans. but it could
[15:23:26] <Lunia> I had some symptoms but I gor rid of them

[16:33:09] <TheFlutterGuy> i poked your butt. 
[16:33:15] <TheFlutterGuy> You have a nice butt.
[16:37:56] <TheFlutterGuy> So, you and your friend going to watch rainbow rocks, as a drinking game?
[16:38:35] <MirSar> Drink every time RD says "Awesome" :P
[16:38:44] <TheFlutterGuy> haha
[16:38:52] <TheFlutterGuy> ok. we need a few rules
[16:38:58] <TheFlutterGuy> #1 - everytime you feel sad for sunset
[16:39:06] <TheFlutterGuy> #2 - everytime RD says awesome
[16:39:11] <MirSar> Drink every time FS "eep"'s
[16:39:18] <TheFlutterGuy> This is gonna be bad
[16:39:29] <MirSar> :D
[16:39:50] <TheFlutterGuy> #5 - Everytime twilight is useless
[16:39:51] <MirSar> Every time Pinkie does something unatural :P
[16:40:06] <TheFlutterGuy> really. i think my #5 seals the deal.
[16:40:13] <TheFlutterGuy> will have to  drink constantly throughout the movie.
[16:40:36] <MirSar> I don't remember her beeing /that/ useless, she does save the day afterall
[16:40:43] * TheFlutterGuy tilts his head
[16:40:47] <TheFlutterGuy> that's not how i remember it.
[16:41:00] <TheFlutterGuy> i remember it as sunset shimmer saving the day "it doesn't matter what you sing, just htat you sing".
[16:41:07] <MirSar> We probbobly have difftrent oppinion on the word useless :P
[16:41:08] *** Ashleep is now known as Ashfire
[16:41:10] <TheFlutterGuy> and they still fail. because they NEED sunset shimmer to sing as well
[16:41:19] <TheFlutterGuy> which twilight doesn't figure out
[16:41:27] <TheFlutterGuy> the mic just gets dropped, and rolls over to sunset shimmer.
[16:41:33] <TheFlutterGuy> who then sings, and saves the day.
[16:41:55] <MirSar> Well because Sunset never was a part of the main 5/the herd/elements of harmony. It was always just the 5 of them
[16:42:20] <TheFlutterGuy> i'm just saying. that was two arguments for why sunset saved the day. 
[16:42:25] <TheFlutterGuy> can you give me one for twilight? ;)
[16:42:38] <MirSar> It came as a suprise to me when she suddenetly was an element, cause there was only supposed to be 5, ever
[16:42:51] <Electron> he doesn't know I watch ponies
[16:42:54] <TheFlutterGuy> Hmmm. she maded the portal, from equestria to the real world
[16:42:59] <TheFlutterGuy> yeah, i guess she does do one thing.
[16:43:10] <TheFlutterGuy> and the day couldn't have been saved without her doing that thing.
[16:43:25] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: Bah, i know what EqG #3 is going to be about.
[16:43:27] <MirSar> She reads Shimmer's weird ass hand writing :P (also the only one who can read?)
[16:43:36] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: if you don't.. tread carefully.
[16:45:01] <Electron> Twi really is useless
[16:45:13] <Electron> and I like that, she belongs to pony world
[16:45:29] <Electron> not that second-sort fanfic like movie
[16:46:28] <Electron> seriously, I saw fics with "ponies in human world" are way better than this EqG thing
