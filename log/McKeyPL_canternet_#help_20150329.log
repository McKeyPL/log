[06:11:37] <Flashbang> Hello
[06:12:09] <Dusk> Hi
[06:12:59] <Flashbang> I'm having trouble getting my computer to connect to the servers
[06:13:09] <Dusk> Alright
[06:13:21] <Dusk> What connection settings?
[06:13:26] <Dusk> and what client
[06:13:49] <Dusk> (I'm just looking for the server:port for connection settings)
[06:14:06] <Flashbang> I'm using mIRC, connecting to port 6667
[06:14:15] <Dusk> What's the error
[06:14:33] <Flashbang> Unable to resolve server
[06:15:01] <Dusk> and are you connecting to irc.canternet.org or are you specifying a server?
[06:15:06] <Flashbang> I also can't connect to Canternet.org through Firefox or Chrome
[06:15:32] <Flashbang> I'm connecting to irc.canternet.org
[06:15:45] <Dusk> try specifying a server like cadance.canternet.org
[06:16:53] <Flashbang> Unable to resolve server
[06:17:38] <Dusk> maybe try another port in the range? 6669?
[06:18:24] <Flashbang> Still unable to resolve server
[06:19:09] <Dusk> are you on mIRC ver 7.34 or above?
[06:19:34] <Flashbang> 7.38
[06:20:04] <Flashbang> But as I said, even my web browsers won't connect to the canternet.org website
[06:20:10] <Dusk> alright then why don't you try the ssl port
[06:20:18] <Dusk> I use +6697
[06:20:30] <Dusk> the '+' is required for mIRC
[06:21:17] <Flashbang> Just change the port to +6697?
[06:21:21] <Dusk> Mhm
[06:21:35] <Dusk> Yea, the fact that it can't reach the site means that something else is up. but I'm doing what I can to troubleshoot it if it happens to /not/ be your network being wierd.
[06:21:45] <Flashbang> Unable to resolve server
[06:21:52] <Dusk> Alright then it's on your end somewhere.
[06:22:19] <wolfyshy> open an administrator command prompt and try "ipconfig /flushdns"
[06:22:23] <Dusk> ^
[06:22:30] <Dusk> I was fixing to suggest that
[06:22:40] <Flashbang> I've done that
[06:23:06] <Dusk> then there's really nothing short of telling you to tether your pc through your phone that we can do.
[06:23:16] <Flashbang> thatOk
[06:23:20] <Dusk> Sorry man
[06:23:29] <wolfyshy> well, maybe the dns server is down
[06:23:38] <wolfyshy> could try something like 8.8.8.8 which is google's DNS
[06:23:39] <Flashbang> Thanks for the help
[06:24:05] <Flashbang> Try it where?
[06:24:26] <Xena> Flashbang: try shutdown /r in the command prompt
[06:24:34] <Xena> that fixes 99% of problems with DNS
[06:24:44] <Flashbang> The ssl just connected
[06:24:48] <Dusk> oh?
[06:25:28] <Flashbang> Yeah, while I was looking at my phone it kept retrying and connected
[06:25:34] <Dusk> ah
[06:25:37] <Dusk> Well there you go
[06:26:05] <Dusk> I'm gonna go back to messing with atheme
[06:26:22] <Flashbang> Thank you again
[06:26:40] <Dusk> of course ^.^ though I think it was wolfyshy's suggestion that fixed it.
[06:27:03] <wolfyshy> glad to help ^v^
