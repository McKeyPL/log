[00:02:30] <Melon_Phone> he's in the ambulance 
[00:04:25] <Melon_Phone> it's driving without sirens so he must be ok
[00:04:44] <Vulpixbrew> non life threatening
[00:04:53] <Vulpixbrew> or not critical
[00:05:03] <Nikashi> er
[00:05:04] <Nikashi> no
[00:05:06] <Nikashi> it means he's dead
[00:05:08] <Nikashi> :(
[00:05:34] <Nikashi> oh
[00:05:36] <Nikashi> they put on a neckbrace
[00:05:37] <Nikashi> ignore me
[00:05:48] <Nikashi> my uncle died of a heart attack in his hear
[00:05:49] <Nikashi> car*
[00:05:52] <Nikashi> in a parking lot
[00:05:59] <Nikashi> and since he was already dead, they didn't out a siren on
[00:06:27] <Melon_Phone> oh
[00:06:33] <Melon_Phone> well shit
[00:06:47] <Nikashi> but
[00:07:04] <Nikashi> if they put on a halo brace
[00:07:07] <Nikashi> and a backboard
[00:07:08] <Melon_Phone> I didn't see them put on abyrhing 
[00:07:12] <Nikashi> non-critical sounds more likely
[00:07:15] <Melon_Phone> just strap him into the Orange stretcher and on wheels 
[00:07:19] <Nikashi> Hrm.
[00:07:20] <Melon_Phone> onto*
[00:07:25] <Nikashi> yeah he might be dead :/
[00:07:32] <Nikashi> if there's no hurry to get him anywhere
[00:07:37] <expatriate> yeah, from your description that's my guess

[00:08:48] <Melon_Phone> it's probably gonna be the morning news

[00:09:23] <Melon_Phone> 2 car crash

[08:08:12] <Araiya> I also have to defend my home territory: While we have a mostly grid-like structure, Pinellas County is even more grid-like. :)
[08:08:36] <thaostra> Araiya, I actually tried "hiking" in a few of your parks. It was less a hike and more a walk on a treadmill at zero incline
[08:08:44] <Matt> Hell yes! Araiya Gets it!
[08:08:53] <Araiya> But at the same time, it does wonders for helping tourists get around.

[09:08:53] <Katiepony> Game of thrones is usually a pretty good example for that shit.
