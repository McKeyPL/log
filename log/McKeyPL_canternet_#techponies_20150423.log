[00:09:47] <DataByteBrony> there is a span at the start of some of these matches, which ends before the end of the block
[00:10:05] <DataByteBrony> fine, yes.. but the pattern matcher keeps looking past the </p>
[00:10:51] <DataByteBrony> are you much good with regex, johnsey?
[00:11:12] <AppleDash> Can I provide you a suggestion, DataByteBrony
[00:11:17] <DataByteBrony> ok?
[00:11:19] <AppleDash> Use an HTML parser, not regex.
[00:11:22] <AppleDash> Right tool for the job.
[00:11:35] <DataByteBrony> heh.. maybe
[00:11:46] <AppleDash> What language are you working in?
[00:11:46] <DataByteBrony> i was just trying to fix the bad syntax
[00:11:49] <DataByteBrony> java
[00:11:58] <AppleDash> I've heard JSoup is good
[00:12:47] <AppleDash> I think most parsers will let you parse something, modify how you like, and then output a new valid document
[00:14:06] <DataByteBrony> real quick, though.. as a temp fix until i need something nicer.. is there any way to modify (.*?) to not include </p> ??
[00:14:28] <AppleDash> I don't really know
[00:14:31] <DataByteBrony> not the first time i've wanted to do something like this, why i'm asking..

[08:13:35] <LegionRed> I remember when you could do it by just spending a day or two on the server to collect the needed amount of items. 
[08:13:41] <Twilightlicious> I need to find a USB Wi-Fi dongle with a decent Windows 8 driver, that is likely to get a Windows 10 driver as well
[08:13:47] <Twilightlicious> Any recommendations?
[08:13:53] <JustAberrant> hammer!
[08:13:53] <LegionRed> Then you could just drop them all at once, and the whole thing would go down.

[08:51:24] <Fillyfeathers> PC probme
[08:51:28] <Fillyfeathers> .. problem
[08:52:16] <Fillyfeathers> I bought another two sticks of RAM identical to the pair I already have installed in my PC. Inserting them into the free DIMM slots causes the PC to repeatedly power cycle until I turn it off at the wall. No beeping, it doesn't even POST. Just power on for two seconds, power off for two seconds, repeat.
[08:52:44] <Fillyfeathers> Removing them fixes the issue though.
[08:54:14] <Lapsus> what if you put in just the new ram?
[08:54:28] <Fillyfeathers> And take out the old, you mean?
[08:54:38] <Phase4> yeah
[08:54:43] <Fillyfeathers> haven't tried that yet
[08:54:56] <Baron_Von_Clop> pop out the old, put the new in
[08:55:06] <Phase4> AppleDash, the server been updated yet?
[08:55:23] <AppleDash> Phase4: Not yet
[08:55:42] <Phase4> would it take long to update or should i just start with 1.3.9
[08:55:50] <AppleDash> I can update it if you want
[08:56:08] <Phase4> that'd be cool, thanks
[08:56:53] <AppleDash> Give me a minute to make a backup first
[08:57:34] <Phase4> they've turned off harvestcraft salt, which is nice, particularly useless ore
[08:57:54] <Lapsus> Fillyfeathers: Give just the new ram a shot with none of the old ram and if it still doesn't work the new ram is probably dead
[08:57:55] <Lapsus> lol
[08:58:13] <Lapsus> Phase4: but how can I make delighted meals without salt D:
[08:58:21] <Fillyfeathers> Lapsus: that'd be unlikely because i had the same issue earlier but then i brought them back as DOA and got a new pair and it's still happening
[08:58:28] <Phase4> can get it from 'fresh water' (bucket of water in crafting table yeilds 4, bucket returned), then crafting that with a pot (pot returned)
[08:58:31] <Fillyfeathers> my boyfriend said i need to clean the fuck out of the DIMM slot though so
[08:59:04] <Lapsus> Phase4: greg's harvestcraft? lolol
[08:59:05] <Phase4> Fillyfeathers, unlikely or not, by checking you'll know
[08:59:09] <Phase4> Lapsus, XD
[08:59:28] <Phase4> Lapsus, it works with just a bucket of water, but the fresh water means you don't have to pick up as many water sources
[08:59:43] <Lapsus> Fillyfeathers: make sure to try the new ram in the slots that the old ram was in, it could possibly be a dead slot I guess
[08:59:44] <Phase4> too bad extra cells isn't installed, fluid crafting chamber would skip the bucket
[08:59:49] <Lapsus> I've had those before and they suck
[08:59:50] <AppleDash> Phase4: Updated, server is starting
[08:59:55] <Phase4> awesome, thanks
[09:00:04] <Fillyfeathers> yeah
[09:00:05] <AppleDash> Apparently it just crashed
[09:00:09] <Fillyfeathers> I'll try a few things thanks
[09:01:31] <Phase4> Lapsus, harvestcraft is a little greg-ish but it's more 'i'm using the cutting board' than 'COLLECT ELEVENTY BILLION SILICON'
[09:01:38] <Phase4> or whatever it is you do in gregtech
[09:01:48] <AppleDash> lol
[09:01:53] <Phase4> it was enabled once on one pack i played
[09:02:10] <Phase4> looked up the recipe for solar panels, disabled it real fast
[09:02:19] <Lapsus> yeah to be honest I love the complexity it adds to food but only if you want it to be complex
[09:02:31] <Lapsus> you can still eat bread and porkchops forever if you want
[09:02:36] <Phase4> yeah, i kinda like it
[09:02:57] <Phase4> salt ore is probably my main complaint and only because of quarries
[09:03:30] <Phase4> Lapsus, btw, you can do the same with a milk bucket
[09:03:43] <Phase4> alone in a crafting table yeilds 4 fresh milk, which is ore-dictionaried to milk bucket
[09:03:46] <Fillyfeathers> wait are we talking about minecraft
[09:03:49] <Lapsus> but if you're me you can make bread and toast and hamburgers and cheeseburgers and deluxe cheeseburgers and fries and smoothies and suddenly you have a delighted mean that fills the entire hunger bar to full from starving to death
[09:03:51] <Phase4> yeah
[09:03:54] <Fillyfeathers> my god
[09:04:01] <Lapsus> meal*
[09:04:06] <Phase4> minecraft is srs bsns
[09:04:11] <Fillyfeathers> the last time I played it, the hell thing was still new
[09:04:15] <Fillyfeathers> what the heckie
[09:04:21] <Fillyfeathers> the nether?
[09:04:35] <Lapsus> I would be playing at the moment but gta5
[09:04:51] <Fillyfeathers> i like making games more than playing them ._.
[09:04:59] <Phase4> Fillyfeathers, it's a modpack though, vanilla minecraft hasn't had any real major change since... ever
[09:05:03] <Fillyfeathers> oh
[09:05:32] <AppleDash> Phase4: OK it's starting now
[09:06:19] <Phase4> they did add the hopper though, depending on how you play that was quite a change
[09:06:32] <Phase4> AppleDash, k, i'll tell you if anything breaks
[09:06:38] <AppleDash> OK
[09:07:05] <locodashie11> heh, I've been playing a new custom modpack for the last week or so
[09:07:18] <locodashie11> I knew almost nothing past minecraft 1.5.7 mods
[09:07:28] <Phase4> ok, ftb infinity 1.4.1 causes java to SIGBUS
[09:07:37] <Phase4> might be since i've got 8 installed
[09:07:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive been playing ftb infinity i think it is
[09:07:55] <Phase4> though it seems to be using 7...
[09:11:16] <Phase4> but not the second time, random sigbus?
[09:12:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive found my server muxh better and muxh more responsive since i have the process restarting every night
