[07:30:11] <JustAberrant> I've definitely put things on backwards and realized it in time before
[07:32:00] <cyborg_ar> oh i've done it myself several times
[07:32:09] <cyborg_ar> when puting together valves at work
[07:32:37] <JustAberrant> I've definitely done it with things like server rails :>

[07:34:15] <cyborg_ar> unscrewing the flanges and then replacing them at the wrong angle
[07:34:23] <cyborg_ar> and realizing that as you put the last screw in
[07:34:32] <JustAberrant> hehe
[07:35:20] <JustAberrant> buddy of mine put his kitchen tap in backwards.. tis hilarious
[07:35:43] <Moonlightning> Wat?
[07:35:48] <JustAberrant> the spout dealie turns all the way around.. so he didn't notice
[07:35:52] <Moonlightning> Pics or it's not physically possible
[07:36:05] <JustAberrant> I'll take pics the next time I'm there
[07:36:29] <JustAberrant> it's one with the single lever for controlling the water/temp
[07:37:06] <JustAberrant> so it's backwards too.. so pushing it down turns the water on
[07:37:10] <JustAberrant> and hot/cold are reversed :>
[07:37:27] <cyborg_ar> oh!
[07:37:40] <cyborg_ar> so he has to turn it around backwards to go to the other side?
[07:38:08] <Moonlightning> There's a chicken joke in there somewhere, but I can't 6_9

[07:38:54] <JustAberrant> funny thing is, I looked on the product page for Canadian tire for another issue he was having, and someone did the _exact_ same thing and didn't realize it
[07:39:10] <JustAberrant> hang on, now I have to find this
[07:39:28] <Moonlightning> That thing. >XD
[07:41:41] <JustAberrant> cyborg_ar: and no
[07:41:45] <JustAberrant> cyborg_ar: that's the brilliant thing
[07:42:09] <JustAberrant> cyborg_ar: the handle screws on afterwards, so he basically put that on backwards as well
[07:42:16] <cyborg_ar> so when the lever is in the other side the valve action is just reversed?
[07:42:22] <cyborg_ar> damn
[07:42:24] <cyborg_ar> hahah
[07:42:58] <cyborg_ar> well at the old house i'm at they ran the hot and cold water pipes backwards
[07:43:04] <cyborg_ar> only in the kitchen
[07:43:17] <cyborg_ar> so opening the valve in the right gives you hot water
[07:43:46] <cyborg_ar> (of course they didnt bother swapping the valves, they are labeled backwards)
[07:44:16] <Moonlightning> That doesn't sound too good for the blumping O.o

[07:44:37] <cyborg_ar> huh?
[07:44:56] <cyborg_ar> the pipes are just backwards
[07:45:29] * Moonlightning picks up a straight length of pipe and turns it around curiously, examining it from different angles and wondering how you could get it backwards.
[07:45:41] <cyborg_ar> lol
[07:45:54] <cyborg_ar> well the termination endpoints are backwards

[21:50:06] * Moonlightning wonders how PyPy allocates memory.
[21:50:49] * Moonlightning …wonders, more generally, how something could allocate memory without using the C libraries.
[21:51:30] <Moonlightning> Twilightlicious: ewwwwww, DNS injection
[21:51:40] <Moonlightning> poisoning *?
[21:53:55] <Twilightlicious> Hm?
[21:54:12] <Twilightlicious> what are you talking about?
[22:00:05] <Moonlightning> Your combo box hijacking DNS requests for systemcontrolcenter.com and returning records pointing to itself
[22:02:11] <Twilightlicious> oh, yeah
[22:02:16] <Twilightlicious> it's not a combo box :P

[22:33:11] <Phase4> Moonlightning, mmap()?
[22:33:27] <Phase4> or brk() if you like the 80s

[22:43:08] <mniip> [22:50:55] * Moonlightning …wonders, more generally, how something could allocate memory without using the C libraries.
[22:43:13] <mniip> there's like 3 system calls
[22:43:30] <mniip> brk and sbrk, which control the heap, which is what malloc and friends most commonly use
[22:45:21] <mniip> and mmap, which maps something to a sequence of pages, including mapping nothing
[22:45:45] <mniip> mmap is less efficient for small allocations, and malloc and friends will sometimes use it for large allocations

[22:47:38] <mniip> I don't think there's any other way
[22:48:09] <mniip> well obviously you could use a filedescriptor pointing to something not backed up by a disk
[22:48:24] <mniip> but at that point you would want to just use mmap instead
