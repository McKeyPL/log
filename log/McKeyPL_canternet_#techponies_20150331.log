[01:33:41] <cyborg_ar> hm didnt know the US had such a strong culture on keeping salaries secret
[01:35:26] <Colgate> it is dumb :(
[01:38:28] <coppercore> ^
[01:38:51] <coppercore> like i've heard that places will fire you if you accidentally disclose your pay 
[01:40:41] <cyborg_ar> i guess that's possible in all those at will states
[01:41:28] <cyborg_ar> in places without unilateral work contract termination such a clause would be fairly unenforceable
[01:45:43] <Kinsley> I can see it from the management/HR kinda perspective of "Hey, we pay so-and-so X per pay period. But someone else, in a similar position, gets paid Y. Don't want them making a fuss over why."
[01:45:54] <init3> Yep.
[01:46:17] <init3> Like you were saying too. Lots of places never give anyone a reason for letting people go.
[01:46:28] <init3> Specifically so they cannot contest it.
[01:46:47] <init3> I still have no idea why I was let go from my first job after two years.
[01:47:14] <cyborg_ar> because you smell like toes
[01:47:22] <init3> I really hate that shit. At least give someone a reason.
[01:47:27] <init3> Probably lol.
[01:48:07] <init3> Actually I think the biggest reason was I replaced a union-job as a contractor and all of the teachers were kind of putting me under a microscope. 
[01:48:22] <cyborg_ar> whops
[01:48:24] <init3> I mean, it was just a simple PC tech job. 
[01:48:30] <init3> Yeah
[01:48:43] <cyborg_ar> yeah you dont replace an union position for long
[01:49:29] <init3> Like they threw a bitch fit because I wasn't going to blow out every single computer in the district (some 400-600) with an air compressor because I had decided it was more important to fix all the broken network drops. 
[01:50:07] <init3> Oh and the switches with non-fuctional fans that the union guy had literally duct-taped a 12" fan to.
[01:50:13] <cyborg_ar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U18EuNN2D0
[01:50:14] <PinkiePieBot> [ Duke Nukem Line - Blow It Out Your Ass - 7438 views - 0:00:04 long - 25 likes - 100.0% ]
[01:50:17] <init3> There were THREE like that.
[01:50:22] <init3> lol
[01:51:21] <init3> It ended up going to the superintendent, then to the superintend of the county-wide district (aka ISD) that I worked for directly as a contractor, then yeah...
[01:51:26] <cyborg_ar> so far both my jobs i've been with the union, because it's the usual in my country
[01:51:45] <cyborg_ar> though the first one kinda doesnt count because i was technically one of the owners
[01:51:51] <cyborg_ar> it was a worker's co-op
[01:52:08] <init3> I had to blow it out my ass and leave ~30 network drops dead for the start of school. Then the teachers threw a bitch fit because the network drops didn't work.
[01:52:22] <init3> That hadn't worked in years because the union guy didn't fix them.
[01:52:30] <Colgate> blowing out 500 computers with compressed air would take a while
[01:52:39] <cyborg_ar> the second one i'm having a love-hate relationship with the union
[01:53:13] <cyborg_ar> i have the strong position that they owe me 2 days of strike per month
[01:53:15] <init3> Yeah. I don't mind unions but they really shouldn't try to ruin someone's career just because they replaced someone that was let go by someone ELSE.
[01:53:31] <cyborg_ar> that's how much i pay them
[01:53:35] <Phase4> i don't tend to hear good things about unions
[01:53:52] <cyborg_ar> they have their good and bad things
[01:53:56] <init3> Yep
[01:54:12] <init3> The thing that really pisses me off though.
[01:54:16] <cyborg_ar> they tend to work best with less skilled/easier to replace workers
[01:54:36] <cyborg_ar> they do help stop the churn
[01:54:54] <init3> Was the union leader was a old ass woman and the old tech guy was a moron. They had set up their private union email account on the DISTRICT email server.
[01:55:09] <cyborg_ar> lol
[01:55:14] <init3> And of course the AUP says all accounts are subject to monitoring. 
[01:55:28] <cyborg_ar> what could possibly go wrong
[01:55:52] <init3> So when the douchebag of a superintendent asked to get access I really had no choice.
[01:56:09] <cyborg_ar> whoops
[01:56:14] <init3> But. I strongly hinted to them perhaps a gmail account would be better for that.
[01:56:19] <cyborg_ar> there you go then
[01:56:33] <init3> Because they were in the middle of a really bad contract fight.
[01:56:45] <cyborg_ar> not only you stole their money, but you gave away their email
[01:56:55] <cyborg_ar> dohohoh
[01:56:58] <init3> Haha
[01:57:00] <init3> Totes.
[01:57:17] <init3> Who the hell does that.
[01:57:19] <init3> ?
[01:57:26] <init3> I mean the old ass woman I get.
[01:57:38] <cyborg_ar> in my current union it's really ridiculous how much they make out of union dues
[01:57:43] <init3> The old IT guy should have fucking known. 
[01:57:43] <Colgate> cyborg_ar: wait what? I think they work better with skilled lbor and are useless with unskileld labor
[01:58:08] <Colgate> and apparently I can't type labor or unskilled
[01:58:22] <cyborg_ar> hahaa
[01:58:47] <init3> Is typing a labor that takes too much skill for you Colgate? Huehuehue.
[01:59:30] <cyborg_ar> unions tend to improve the working conditions of the least skilled positions
[01:59:37] <cyborg_ar> mandating minimum pay and conditions
[01:59:45] <cyborg_ar> and stopping churn
[01:59:46] <Colgate> but unskilled labor jobs... they just fire the union and hire non-union people
[01:59:58] <cyborg_ar> that's only if the union is weak
[02:00:10] <Colgate> can't do that with skilled labor since there aren't enough people to do that with
[02:00:15] <cyborg_ar> a real union would destroy the company if that happened
[02:00:36] <cyborg_ar> specially if unions are connected together
[02:00:45] <Colgate> unions get destroyed before they can get that sort of traction
[02:00:51] <init3> Depends.
[02:00:51] <cyborg_ar> a mass firing of union workers here would cause a country-wide general strike
[02:01:06] <cyborg_ar> like the one that's gonna happen tomorrow
[02:01:13] <cyborg_ar> nobody's going to work tomorrow
[02:01:26] <cyborg_ar> there's only minimal health and security services
[02:01:30] <init3> The UAW pretty much strangled the big three into financial ruin. Not the only reason certainly but a huge part. 
[02:01:46] <init3> In all fairness, we have OSHA standards and whatnot now.
[02:02:02] <init3> Nobody is working without safety equipment or mandated 15 hour workdays. 
[02:02:08] <cyborg_ar> yes
[02:02:25] <cyborg_ar> now for more skilled positions unions tend to be counter productive
[02:03:04] <cyborg_ar> stopping churn in positions that require people to learn and develop their skills tends to force unsuitable people to stay employed in positions where they shouldnt be
[02:04:36] <cyborg_ar> my first job was a worker's co-op governed by an union
[02:04:55] <cyborg_ar> the highest skilled positions tended to suffer lots
[02:05:33] <cyborg_ar> it was a tile factory, basically there are two class of people, the people who operate the machines, and the people who maintain them
[02:06:18] <cyborg_ar> due to the nature of the factory, the maintenance side of the factory required workers that were much more skilled than the operating side
[02:06:39] <cyborg_ar> in ideal conditions you dont even need many people operating the machines
[02:06:44] <cyborg_ar> they run themselves
[02:07:44] <cyborg_ar> since the payscale was mandated by the union, the good maintenance workers were paid way under market, and resigned, me included
[02:08:03] <cyborg_ar> hehe
[02:08:27] <cyborg_ar> tomorrow i'm gonna go there to help revive a machine, for shits and giggles
[02:08:47] <cyborg_ar> since i'm gonna get bored otherwise due to the strike

[17:01:31] <Quindo> Does anyone know how to manually install java on ubuntu?  I am following a guide but it does not seem to work.  :/
[17:01:46] <tiwake> apt not good enough?
[17:01:59] <Quindo> it only has openjava
[17:02:22] <Quindo> and it says openjava does not work with building android 4.3
[17:03:02] <tiwake> debian has closed source java, so it should have it somewhere
[17:04:16] <tiwake> cant comment on building android, but I've used the open source java when "it" said that it wouldent work, and it did work just fine
[17:04:24] <Quindo> I have jdk-6u45-linux-x64.bin, but these install instructions do not seem to work...
[17:04:44] <Quindo> I migh try that then if the build is failing due to java not working.
[17:07:26] <tiwake> as a side note, you might have some interesting errors :)
[17:08:08] <Quindo> repo sync getting terminated by peer :/
[17:12:03] <tiwake> Quindo: also, it looks like there is a PPA for it

[17:12:52] <Quindo> ty!  <3
[17:13:50] <Quindo> I have not messed with lunix sense I was a teen and dropping it on a old laptop to DL anime on...
[17:13:51] <tiwake> oh wait
[17:14:13] <tiwake> its not the actual packaged java
[17:14:43] <tiwake> though it is the installer for the java thing.. and maybe some scripts to get it installed correctly
[17:15:02] <Quindo> I will look into it.  still waiting for repos to sync.
[17:24:28] <tiwake> Quindo: linux is fun to develop on :)
[17:26:19] <tiwake> libraries are easy to obtain, install, and then when ready to ship, package your software up with the correct dependencies and not have a blob of huge binary
[17:27:15] <cyborg_ar> tiwake: if only it was that easy :)
[17:28:02] <tiwake> cyborg_ar: thats the goal anyway :P
[17:28:23] <Quindo> But it is not fun to develop it just to be able to develop in a different language on a different board...
[17:28:32] * Quindo flips table
[17:28:34] <tiwake> as far as I can tell, linux is closer to it than OSX or windows
