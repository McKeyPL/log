[11:09:22] <cloppyhoofs> Yup!
[11:09:27] <cloppyhoofs> I sh ouldn't be, but I am :3
[11:09:30] <Speedy> oooh two :D
[11:09:56] <Katiepony> I shouldn't be either o:
[11:10:02] <Katiepony> Since I only got 4 hours of sleep :c
[11:10:37] <Speedy> the time change has made be a little bit of a shitty sleeper too
[11:10:43] <Speedy> that, and netflix
[11:12:02] <cloppyhoofs> Ooh, do y'all wanna help me decide what i do in the morning? c:
[11:12:49] <Speedy> sure :D
[11:13:35] <cloppyhoofs> For breakfast should I have:
[11:13:42] <cloppyhoofs> -Nutella crepe with milk coffee
[11:13:46] <cloppyhoofs> -Tamales
[11:13:52] <cloppyhoofs> -Tacos (kind of a far walk)
[11:14:00] <cloppyhoofs> -Instant Ramen (Don't have to leave my apartment)
[11:14:44] <Speedy> hm
[11:14:50] <Katiepony> Nutella crepe with milk :3
[11:14:53] <Katiepony> No coffee.
[11:14:54] <Speedy> instant ramen for laziness, but taste like sadness
[11:15:03] <Speedy> I would go tamales they're so good
[11:15:31] <cloppyhoofs> Why no coffee? Coffee is great and has caffeine c:
[11:15:50] <cloppyhoofs> And provides a balance of flavor by giving bitterness to counteract the sweet
[11:15:58] *** iamalion is now known as iam[a]lion
[11:16:43] <Katiepony> Ew, bitterness o:
[11:16:55] <Katiepony> Sweet doesn't need to be counteracted.
[11:17:16] <Katiepony> Also
[11:17:19] <Katiepony> What's a tamale? o:
[11:17:29] <cloppyhoofs> Katiepony has never had a mocha?
[11:17:33] <cloppyhoofs> They're great though :c
[11:17:38] <cloppyhoofs> Also, tamale is mexican food
[11:17:51] <cloppyhoofs> Meat filling wrapped in corn dough and steamed in a corn husk
[11:17:51] <Katiepony> My housemate is female tamale o:
[11:17:56] <cloppyhoofs> xDDDDDDD
[11:18:08] <cloppyhoofs> That's great xD
[11:18:25] <Katiepony> husks don't sound appetising to me o:
[11:18:40] <cloppyhoofs> You peel off the husks before you eat it :3
[11:20:04] <cloppyhoofs> But yeah :o
[11:20:09] <cloppyhoofs> Crepes are tasty and sweet c:
[11:20:14] <cloppyhoofs> Tacos are tasty and flavorful
[11:20:21] <cloppyhoofs> Tamales are tasty and filling
[11:20:32] <Katiepony> And Huskies are cute and fluffy :3
[11:20:33] <cloppyhoofs> And ramen is tasty and lets me stay naked
[11:20:39] <cloppyhoofs> I wouldn't eat a husky D:
[11:21:18] <Katiepony> Well, whatever you choose
[11:21:22] <Katiepony> Have nutella with it.
[11:21:28] <cloppyhoofs> I don't actually own any D:
[11:24:33] <Katiepony> Correct that mistake by purchasing some :3
