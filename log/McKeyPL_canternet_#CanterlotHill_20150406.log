[03:22:12] <Snapai> Not for harps, harps you tune yourself
[03:22:14] <Eywind>  stop being so old vulpor
[03:22:36] <Snapai> Thing about harps - they're under ALL the strings' tension. So once you've tuned them through once...the frame has been compressed and the strings you tuned first are out of tune again
[03:22:37] <Vulpor> Believe me man being old sucks
[03:22:44] <Snapai> At least, if the harp wasn't near-tune when you started

[05:18:58] <Angel_Bunny> Not when you don't.
[05:19:12] <EqualPie> huh?
[05:19:14] <Angel_Bunny> Pretty much everything with that should be either you talking about it or people talking with you about it.
[05:19:21] <Angel_Bunny> from the last 5 months of you talking about it :P

[05:23:39] <EqualPie> I wish i was normal..
[05:24:08] <DJMidli> this ost is epic
[05:24:11] <EqualPie> i know i am normal but i mean normal like the kind of person to not have aspegers syndrome.
[05:24:13] <Angel_Bunny> I could give you the obligatory "there is no normal" speech if you want EqualPie
[05:24:31] <EqualPie> Nah its ok Angel_Bunny :D
[05:25:08] <EqualPie> on Season 5 episode 1 where pinkie pie didnt like the muffins i wonder if Derpy would have turned it down..
[05:25:33] <Trildar> She would burn the whole village for the heresy. :p
[05:25:37] <Angel_Bunny> Odds are she's a muffin snob
[05:25:53] <Vulpor> Umm
[05:26:07] <Vulpor> can we talk of the new episodes?

[05:26:23] <Angel_Bunny> You can talk up through the episodes that aired yesterday
[05:26:30] <Angel_Bunny> Pretty much the spoiler ban is until 4PM EST of the day the episode aired

[05:27:43] <Angel_Bunny> It kinda is
[05:27:49] <Vulpor> I do too because of how deep the subject was
[05:27:54] <Angel_Bunny> Cool mop
[05:28:13] <Angel_Bunny> I thought it was a bit over the top
[05:28:25] <Angel_Bunny> And didn't really give me a reason to care about pretty much everyone but a couple of the characters
[05:28:26] <Vulpor> Wait..................we have Mysties here?
[05:28:27] <EqualPie> I think sunlight glimmer is going to return in another episode.

[05:28:59] <Vulpor> I have a site for you
[05:28:59] <Angel_Bunny> possible for recurring
[05:29:05] <Angel_Bunny> Yeah doubt that'll happen
[05:29:17] <Angel_Bunny> Again, the issue with a mare like that is, as soon as Twilight gets back, she's going to write a letter to Celestia about it
[05:29:33] <thereallynewmop12100_> VuplLink?

[23:18:22] <Araxnus> Since it is a 2000
[23:18:30] <AppleDash> It works, but I mean it's not the best and I max it out a lot .-.
