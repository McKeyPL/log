[01:42:17] <Araxnus>  /)
[01:42:52] <Araxnus> I have been told. A SSD for gaming can have a 5fps gain.
[01:43:09] <RandomNinja> SSD for OS, everyday use programs, and the few games that actually benefit greatly from it. Like say Skyrim
[01:43:18] <Araxnus> When I can get a 2TB SSD for $300 call me ;)
[01:43:24] <RandomNinja> that's false under normal circumstances

[01:45:30] <One-Trick> i used to dump minecraft into its own tempfs, which was amazing unless you crashed or lost power. poof!
[01:45:43] <techniponi> meanwhile over with the "next gen" consoles http://i.imgur.com/wbcEzv1.png
[01:46:00] <RandomNinja> lel
[01:46:07] <Araxnus> But yeah. What I did was put two WD Black's in Raid0. Just so I could have 4TB and have them be a bit faster.
[01:46:28] <techniponi> my PC's from like 2011 and it can handle 1080p on games like that no problem
[01:46:34] <RandomNinja> "next-gen"
[01:46:40] <Araxnus> techniponi: Omg xD sad world.
[01:46:41] <techniponi> usually around ~45fps on high-max settings
[01:46:53] <techniponi> kinda wish I got 60 but at least I can play everything
[01:47:04] <RandomNinja> high fps is wonderful
[01:47:33] <RandomNinja> and then console peasants say we only care about graphics
[01:47:43] <Araxnus> Wanna buy a Xbox One. I want to sell mine. lol. Bought it for Halo MCC. But that game is bro9ke so meh.
[01:47:56] <RandomNinja> lel consoles :P
[01:47:57] <techniponi> currently the only new console I see worth getting is the WiiU
[01:48:10] <techniponi> for the moment it's the only one with a high amount of good exclusives
[01:48:13] <RandomNinja> yeah because Wii U isn't trying to be an inferior PC
[01:48:45] <techniponi> until PS4 and xbone get a high number of decent exclusives I'll stick with my PC
[01:48:58] <techniponi> even wiiU hasn't had anything that's really /exploded/ yet
[01:49:03] <RandomNinja> until PS4 and Xbone get acceptable framerates* :P
[01:49:11] <techniponi> 2014 was the year of "all hype and no payoff"
[01:49:32] <techniponi> so many games hyped like they were frigging jesus embodied in the form of a video game
[01:49:36] <techniponi> so many botched releases
[01:49:44] <RandomNinja> and in the end they all sucked
[01:49:49] <RandomNinja> and /r/pcmasterrace laughed
[01:49:54] <techniponi> destiny wasn't that great, AC Unity flopped bad, watchdogs was broke as crap
[01:49:54] <Araxnus> Like Order 1886 that turned out to be boring.
[01:50:01] <techniponi> wolfenstein was amazing though
[01:50:08] <RandomNinja> I mean you kinda saw that coming miles away
[01:50:19] <RandomNinja> yeah Wolfenstein is GOTY tier
[01:50:30] <Araxnus> Destiny makes me sad. Bungie...
[01:50:46] <RandomNinja> also Shadow of Mordor on the topic of suprisingly amazing games
[01:50:57] <Araxnus> Watchdogs was over hyped but decent.
[01:51:23] <techniponi> 2014's best games weren't very hyped and didn't get that much attention (mostly)
[01:51:27] <Araxnus> Wolfenstein: New Order is God Tier!
[01:51:37] <RandomNinja> Wolfenstein, Shadow of Mordor, what else?
[01:51:41] <techniponi> but even then, at the end of the year I can't think of any new IP that really exploded
[01:51:52] <RandomNinja> Transistor?
[01:51:59] <Araxnus> Shadow of Mordor's PC port was the best thing I have seen in very long.
[01:52:04] <techniponi> remember the holy trio of PS2? (jak and daxter/ratchet and clank/sly cooper)
[01:52:07] <RandomNinja> yeah it was really solid
[01:52:12] <techniponi> nothing's been nearly as popular as that in a while
[01:52:21] <techniponi> and by popular I mean beyond simply hype
[01:52:26] <Araxnus> Dragon Age: Inquisition. Amazing!
[01:52:36] <RandomNinja> wasn't that this year? :P
[01:52:49] <techniponi> GTA5 was 2013 so that doesn't count
[01:52:49] <Araxnus> Was Nov 2014.
[01:52:52] <RandomNinja> oh
[01:52:57] <Araxnus> Um DA.
[01:52:59] <RandomNinja> haven't gotten around to that yet
[01:53:07] <RandomNinja> I probably should
[01:53:09] <techniponi> though GTA5 is so ridiculously awesome and has enough content to keep me going
[01:53:19] <RandomNinja> this year is Witcher 3
[01:53:21] <RandomNinja> get the hype
[01:53:29] <RandomNinja> and possibly Fallout announcement
[01:54:04] <Araxnus> Well you could say GTA V on PC needs to come faster. Also it better run smooth as glass, All the delays and such.

[01:54:19] <Araxnus> Witcher 3. Omg yess!
[01:54:24] <techniponi> I own GTA5 on both PS3 and 360 and I've preordered it on PC
[01:54:26] <Hamtramck> glass doesn't really run at all
[01:54:28] <techniponi> it's that good
[01:54:33] <RandomNinja> Bethesda going to E3 for the first time ever. There's no way it can't be huge
[01:54:55] <Hamtramck> GTAV's vonstant cynicism really started wearing on me after awhile.
[01:54:55] <techniponi> I love that game so much I was willing to drop over $100 on the same game three times over
[01:54:56] * RandomNinja applies slavic insults to Araxnus 
[01:55:04] <Hamtramck> * constant
[01:55:09] <Araxnus> lol.
[01:55:14] <Hamtramck> I liked the gameplay, I just wish the story didn't exist
[01:55:16] <RandomNinja> but ya Witcher 3
[01:55:22] <techniponi> I had it on PS3 first and got it on 360 because my friends were pretty much split halfway between th consoles and I wanted to play with everyone
[01:55:26] <One-Trick> needs more mirrors edge
[01:55:27] <RandomNinja> I might have to get a bigger graphics card for that
[01:55:28] <techniponi> and then PC because it's PC
[01:55:52] <RandomNinja> more Mirror's Edge would be sweet, as long as they keep it about the running and not fighting
[01:56:08] <Araxnus> I could not get into GTA on 360. The new first person mode I think will change that for PC.
[01:56:16] <RandomNinja> the framerate tho
[01:56:19] <RandomNinja> ew
[01:56:28] <Araxnus> One-Trick: They are making a new one ;)

[01:59:09] <Hamtramck> GTAV was like, 2013 america just kind of poking at whatever, only it wasn't really timely enough at that thanks to lengthy dev cycles.
[01:59:19] <techniponi> I agree with GTA5's lack of theme, but its gameplay has a lot of depth to it
[01:59:26] <techniponi> at least in sheer amount of content
[01:59:34] <techniponi> some of those minigames feel like they could be an entire game on their own
[01:59:35] <Hamtramck> So I'm torn because on one hand the driving's great, the cop AI actually does stuff properly now, the random events and ped AI were awesome compared to GTAIV
[02:00:12] <Hamtramck> It's like all the side stuff was great, but then the main story missions were sort of... doing nothing for me.
[02:00:34] <techniponi> I mostly just play online anyway
[02:00:42] <Hamtramck> I want single player GTA Online, honestly.
[02:00:51] <techniponi> can't you do exactly that though?
[02:01:00] <techniponi> start a private world or whatever and just don't invite anyone
[02:01:15] <Hamtramck> Not without XBox Live Gold :TTTT
[02:01:36] <techniponi> xbox is the pinnacle of microsoft's money extortion
[02:01:38] <Hamtramck> Also you'd still need a consistent connection for that and my 360's weird about when it actually connects.
[02:02:00] <techniponi> everything xbox-related is designed to extort money out of people
[02:02:07] <techniponi> the pony avatar things are like FIVE DOLLARS now
[02:02:17] <RandomNinja> just wait for PC version, laugh at Rockstar's attempts to get money from you
[02:02:30] <Hamtramck> Also I think in general an offline local multiplayer wouldn't have been a bad idea.
[02:02:45] <techniponi> splitscreen might have taxed the consoles too much
[02:02:54] <techniponi> 360/ps3 are like 8 or 9 year old hardware now
[02:03:02] <RandomNinja> considering they can't even render the game once properly
[02:03:03] <techniponi> and ps4/xbone are laughable because they're not actually that great
[02:03:14] <techniponi> >720/900p for bf hardline
[02:03:25] <RandomNinja> yeah ps3/360 were great at the time, just laughably outdated now
[02:03:37] <Araxnus> Paying for Xbox Live. Meh.
[02:03:41] <RandomNinja> well yeah
[02:03:45] <Hamtramck> I keep forgetting PS3/360 started when I was in highschool.
[02:03:52] <Hamtramck> Also fwiw I mostly got a 360 for the imports anyway
[02:04:14] <techniponi> why do all these edm promotion networks keep following me on twitter
[02:04:17] <Hamtramck> there weren't a /ton/ of imports I wanted but enough that it kind of tipped the balance for me.

[08:35:47] <Muffin_Spectacles> Ali: Lucky - I spent 5 hours working on my latest one. Formatting is an enigma that didn't give me as crisp an image as the others, and I think my DVD-drive is dying - the image I got from my own DVd has wavy borders...and, Premier crashed as I tried to resize.

[08:37:21] <Muffin_Spectacles> Ali: I think that's just Chrome. I was able to get on EqD from Firefox.
[08:37:46] * Ali wonders how Muffin_Spectacles knew she was even on Chrome :P
[08:38:23] <Muffin_Spectacles> Ali: Because I tried accessing on Chrome, and got the same. So I went to Firefox...and it's sounding eerily like at work how something works on Firefox, but Chrome doesn't...maybe this is the universe telling me to get sleep for work.

[23:49:32] <pinkpearlapple> hrm. chocolate is traditional. i guess i can try jelly beans or taffy or something
[23:49:40] <Eywind> You can do peeps or skittles or things like that
[23:49:59] <Eywind> Also I'd consider opening up blind bags and putting them in easter eggs
[23:50:09] <Eywind> candy and little toys
[23:50:10] <RandomNinja> picnic cooler :P
[23:50:10] <pinkpearlapple> that's a good idea!
[23:50:13] <RandomNinja> suddenly chocolate
[23:50:21] <Eywind> just make sure not to mix up the two when eating lol

[23:50:50] <Eywind> Candy is probably the best for easter
[23:50:53] <Eywind> cuz she's pink and stuff
[23:50:58] <Eywind> and her nickname is candy
[23:50:59] <pinkpearlapple> her hair looks like an easter egg
[23:51:07] <pinkpearlapple> exploded
[23:51:12] <pinkpearlapple> but i like cadence alot
[23:51:17] <RandomNinja> yeah it might not last through shipping that long
[23:51:24] <Eywind> she made me a pony in one of my dreams
[23:51:30] <Eywind> so that immediately increased her on my list
