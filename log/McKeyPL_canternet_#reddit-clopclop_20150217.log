[00:00:53] <FineLine> [ How To Make Harry Potter Butter Beer (nonalcoholic) | Trusper ]
[00:01:29] <Cantaloupe> I should have some if I go to London next summer
[00:01:46] <Cantaloupe> I wanna visit WB studios 
[00:02:26] <cloppyhooves> Butterbeer is good :3
[00:02:29] <Katiepony> Just so you know, butter beer is just as ficitonal in London as it is everywhere else o:
[00:02:42] <cloppyhooves> They serve it two different kinds of ways at Universal Studios
[00:02:47] <cloppyhooves> One as a soda, one a slushie
[00:02:49] <expatriate> which is not at all, since people have made recipes for it
[00:03:19] <Katiepony> Not quite what butter beer was intended to be, considering the differences in climate.
[00:03:46] <Cantaloupe> Katiepony, I know, my friend went to the Harry Potter thing in London and said he had a thing they called butter beer but was some sort of vanilla pudding thing 
[00:04:05] <Katiepony> There's a harry potter thing in London? I thought that was in the states.
[00:04:14] <Frosty> I'm fond of Sarsparilla, myself.
[00:04:23] <Cantaloupe> maybe outside of London but it's in Britain alright
[00:04:31] <Cantaloupe> gimme a sex
[00:04:42] <Katiepony> Well, if you want it that badly, I guess o:
[00:04:49] <Katiepony> Infront of everyone else?
[00:05:04] <Cantaloupe> yep
[00:05:06] <cloppyhooves> Extreme spoilers: The butterbeer at Universal Studios tastes like 0,0butterscotch soda
[00:05:22] * Cantaloupe spreads her legs to reveal a link
[00:05:24] <Frosty> Eww.

[00:06:53] <Cantaloupe> I think that's it anyway
[00:07:08] <Katiepony> Probably :3
[00:07:34] <cloppyhooves> I thought it was tasty c:
[00:07:36] * Cantaloupe grooms Katiepony's tail and ties a red bow on it
[00:08:08] <Katiepony> o:
[00:08:10] <Katiepony> :D
[00:08:44] <Cantaloupe> :D 
[00:10:19] <Cantaloupe> I wanna get a wand too there
[00:10:37] <Cantaloupe> my friend got one and it looks sweet 
[00:11:00] <Katiepony> I hear hitachi make the best ones.
[00:11:23] * Vulpixbrew wants both kinds of wants
[00:11:24] <Cantaloupe> yeah probably
[00:11:27] <Vulpixbrew> wands*
[00:11:42] <Cantaloupe> I could get both and perform all kinds of magic :3 
[00:12:33] <Katiepony> Erecto Protrudus
[00:13:13] <Cantaloupe> :D 
[00:13:56] * Vulpixbrew for some odd reason has a pillow over his lap
[00:14:24] <Katiepony> Katie has a pillow under her butt :3
[00:14:34] <Cantaloupe> levicorpus! 
[00:14:47] * Cantaloupe hangs Vulpixbrew in the air by his hind legs
[00:14:56] <Vulpixbrew> ack
[00:15:15] <Katiepony> o:
[00:16:09] <Cantaloupe> >:3 
[00:16:42] * Vulpixbrew wiggles in the air trying to get down
[00:17:07] <Vulpixbrew> also this appearntly was someone's valetines day present http://i.imgur.com/Jqi9vtp.jpg

[05:17:15] <iamalion> ...well that was an adventure....
[05:17:15] <iamalion> one of our dogs started just SHRIEKING as loud as possible. never heard it that loud before. I run upstairs, my mom is holding his back end by one of their bed pillows
[05:17:49] <princesssluttershy> My cat is playing with a half dead mouse
[05:17:55] <iamalion> turns out, he had been humping it, and one of the loose treads got wrapped around his dick. So I had to hold him as he bit at me and tried to rip my hand off, while SCREAMING in pain, as my mom got scissors and cut the thread off. 
[05:18:12] <iamalion> Unfortunately its still wrapped around his dick when it retracted, so we migght have a vet visit tomorrow
[05:18:18] <iamalion> holy shit
[05:18:21] <OmarianVolcae> I guess he really liked the pillow.
[05:18:40] <iamalion> he always humps it

[05:19:08] <OmarianVolcae> I'd imagine it's akin to having your schlong stuck in a zipper.

[06:30:25] <Squirrelly> I think I just remembered an event from my childhood that might have something to do with certain ones of my fetishes today
[06:31:18] <Squirrelly> I was playing with my neighbor's (female) dog, who was a black lab, or something. Nobody else was around, and I accidentally tripped
[06:31:41] <Squirrelly> She started humping me from behind, and I couldn't get up for a good 30 seconds or so, which felt like FOREVER, and freaked me out
[06:31:48] <Squirrelly> But I think some part of me liked it...
