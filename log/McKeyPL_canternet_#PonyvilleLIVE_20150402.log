[10:15:47] <Electron> safe mode?
[10:15:53] <ArchPegasusMichael> yeh
[10:18:18] <ArchPegasusMichael> "awaryjny" means "used in case of malfunction" (and sometimes even "unreliable/tending to malfunction")
[10:19:00] <ArchPegasusMichael> while "safe" is "bezpieczny"
[10:20:13] <ArchPegasusMichael> "recovery" in computer terms is "odzyskiwanie"
