[00:10:44] <Seoson> SRV resource records are not widely used. TS, Minecraft and a few other things. However as far as I know BIND allows multiple CNAME and A record for one domain as rotates them
[00:11:04] <Colgate> well yeah, srv records require client side support
[00:11:19] <Colgate> bind might allow multiple cname records, but that's against spec

[00:42:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> no its really not
[00:42:34] <Seoson> canternet.org uses a COMODO cert
[00:42:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> dnssec is still lacking in alot of places
[00:42:36] <Colgate> where is this comodo cert? 
[00:42:42] <Colgate> oh, I didn't pay for that
[00:42:43] <Colgate> :P
[00:42:53] <ShivalPonyWolf> and also alot of the domain registrars out there dont even know how to support it
[00:42:55] <Moonlightning> Since he didn't pay for it, he actually is working against Comodo
[00:43:08] <Colgate> that was Shutter's thing, /shrug
[00:43:11] <Moonlightning> He used a marginal amount of resources, and didn't pay for them.
[00:43:20] <Moonlightning> So Comodo loses /that/ much money.

[00:45:11] <Colgate> startcom charges for revocations :(
[00:45:26] <Moonlightning> Well…can't there at least be a thing that resolves a hostname locally and inserts the IP
[00:45:33] <Moonlightning> irc.canternet.org.      IN      A       $(RESOLVE chrysalis.canternet.org.)
[00:45:35] <Colgate> there's also wosign, if you don't mind your CA being chinese, and don't care about android support
[00:45:44] <Colgate> :P
[00:46:39] <Colgate> not that the CA being chinese actually means anything
[00:47:23] <Seoson> Which they do for free if you chose a trail cert. Yeah but if I loose my private key (not going to happen) I have no problem with that since man in the middle attacks are unlikely. I do need a cert to ensure encrypted communication and avoid (dumb)warnings
[00:47:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> the chinese gov only signs big companies fake certs anyway
[00:47:26] <ShivalPonyWolf> like MS and google
[00:47:52] <Seoson> Since CA can sign anything it doesn't matter where you leave your money
[00:48:09] <Seoson> any CA*
[00:48:47] <Colgate> Seoson: you say it isn't going to happen, but then I point you to heartbleed
[00:49:23] <Colgate> private key leaks happen, for any numerous amounts of reasons
[00:49:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> or weaknesses is keys such as the export keys
[00:50:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> ciphers
[00:50:42] <Seoson> Yeah, but that would (in case of heartbleed) require a lot of requests to a site that hosts primarly my own private stuff
[00:51:08] <Colgate> and?
[00:51:39] <Colgate> that was just an example, there will be more vulns in the future, 100% guaranteed
[00:51:54] <Colgate> some that require even less work than heartbleed
[00:52:16] <Seoson> Which doesn't make any sense in my case since apart from company things I have on the server (which are encrypted) there is nothing of any value
[00:54:24] <Colgate> so... you really don't care if I had your private keys?
[00:54:36] <Colgate> that isn't important?
[00:55:38] <Seoson> Not really. In case of a public site: Yes I would but since this isn't the case and a man in the middle attack against me is unlikely I don't fear that.
[00:56:01] <Seoson> Revoking a key won't help either way on startcom or not
[00:56:10] <Colgate> then I guess any discussion on this is pointless
[00:56:29] <Colgate> because if you don't care about your private keys being stolen, there's no point to this at all
[00:57:02] <Seoson> Don't get me wrong: If someone would get my keys I would exchange them right away
[00:58:13] <Seoson> Since my server uses perfect forward security and in case of a leak new keys the only remaining attack vector would be a man in the middle attack which is again unlikely
[00:58:58] <Seoson> And cannot be stopped by revoking the certificate unless your hosting a very very popular site that's included on local cert blacklists
[01:00:41] <Seoson> If someone manages to get access to my server (or DNS manger account) even without my keys to be compromised they could achieve the same thing by ordering a new cert.

[18:15:05] <Seoson> *Important* Critical security flaw in proftpd. Check your version number and make sure you are above or have 1.3.4e / 1.3.5. If not kill the deamon. There are currently no updates for a few distros and the exploit is out and in active use.
[18:18:10] <Colgate> what is proftpd?
[18:18:23] <Seoson> A very common FTP server
[18:18:29] <Colgate> ah
[18:18:45] <Seoson> I use it on my debian server.
[18:21:05] <Seoson> Exploit code can be found here (It's in public, so it doesn't matter) https://github.com/nootropics/propane. "proftpd --version" to check your version.
