[05:10:05] <DJMidli> 2
[05:10:06] <Flashy> first time playing it?
[05:10:14] <Faith> niiice, 2's probably the best one
[05:10:32] <Flashy> that ending of the 3rd one
[05:11:09] <Faith> eh, I kinda wished there was more than 2 choices
[05:11:17] <Flashy> well there was 3
[05:11:23] <Faith> was there?
[05:11:31] <Flashy> i belive so yeah
[05:11:38] <Faith> What else was there besides choosing to save or destroy?
[05:11:57] <Flashy> become one with repaers
[05:12:08] <Faith> I think that was save
[05:12:18] <Flashy> nothing you did in 1, 2, or 3 had a effect on the end
[05:12:26] <Flashy> it was just so arbitrary
[05:13:18] <Faith> I hate when people bring that up. What, do they NOT want a choice? Would you rather he automatically pick one best suited for his character?

[05:14:36] <Faith> Nothing from earlier really had anything to do with the end, so I don't see how it would have changed anything
[05:15:06] <Flashy> its more the writing that did that
[05:15:27] <Flashy> its kinda like they kinda gave up on the writhing just to end the game
[05:16:07] <Faith> I think the ending was excellent at the end. Shephard makes the decision wheather to end the reapers once and for all at the cost of all machinery, or try to rewrite the reapers, knowing full well he could fail and kill everyone.
[05:16:09] <Flashy> chooseiung the red or bluse ending just seems meh
[05:16:33] <Faith> Honestly, it's one of the best ways to end in my opinion
[05:16:58] <Faith> the inner-struggle. Do you take the safe route, or the risky one?
[05:17:37] <Flashy> Best ending to anything was Bioshock Infinnte
[05:17:49] <Faith> People who just see it as "Red or Blue" need to look deeper into it. Into Shephard's point of view.

[22:21:29] <RandomNinja> nuuu
[22:21:34] <ButtonMasher_Draco> All these "rare carts" are highly sought after so it's something collectors are willing to pay a lot of money for to have in their collection

[22:22:00] <DrelvanianGuard> FF13.. I give it -10/10 for being after FF9
[22:22:17] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Meta and you can find people just wanting to get rid of things at low prices because they don't care to look up the information, but those that do sell at a high price
[22:22:17] <DrelvanianGuard> I give FF8-9 9/10 and FF7 10/10

[22:23:18] <wobniaR> It's uncooked too
[22:23:24] <RandomNinja> nuu my belly
[22:23:28] <RandomNinja> imma get fat
[22:23:42] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Also in terms of gamer people pay a crapton of money for VIRTUAL items
[22:23:43] <MetaSigma> but that still doesn't mean it's not possible like it was being made sound like
[22:23:56] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Like blue anime hair in the old Runescape going for over $1600
[22:24:10] <MetaSigma> See I'm only speaking of actual Cart/CD
[22:24:11] <DrelvanianGuard> WHUT
[22:24:12] <wobniaR> Are you kidding me
[22:24:27] <ButtonMasher_Draco> or the amount of money certain weapons went for when Diablo 3's auction house was up still
[22:24:58] <DrelvanianGuard> i dont believe that.. who would actually pay money for Runescape..
[22:25:04] <MetaSigma> I'm not speaking of items WITHIN games like MMOs and the like. I'm only speaking of the actual games THEMSELVES. Maybe that's where we're having a difference of vision :)
[22:25:06] <wobniaR> Diehard fans
[22:25:15] <wobniaR> With lots of dispoable income
[22:25:21] <wobniaR> disposable*
[22:25:24] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Collectors are collectors whether physical or virtual nowadays
[22:25:30] <wobniaR> That's why p2w and cash shops exist
[22:25:33] <Cloud_Zephyr> whats occuring on the radio right now?
[22:25:34] <ButtonMasher_Draco> but
[22:25:45] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Physical collectors still shell out the most money I've ever seen
[22:26:16] <DrelvanianGuard> but if someone is rich, why would they play an MMO... they most likely have something better to do.. like the job that got them the $1600 they are spending on their characters hair
[22:26:44] <wobniaR> Little time, lots of money

[22:29:27] <MetaSigma> I've heard many tales of the latter which is where I"m coming from :)
[22:29:36] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Still a good observation of market demand especially when bidding wars happen, like with the NWC gold cart
[22:29:43] <Cloud_Zephyr> just a bit confused. according to the schedule m3reel should be live
[22:30:07] <MetaSigma> Yes it's become much easier to do the research on it, but you still find a lot of times someone doesn't know
[22:30:20] <MetaSigma> and they just...drop it for pennies on the dollar
[22:30:26] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Meta I've seen people try to call a Superscope rare and sell for $10,000 doesn't make the observation that collectors spend the most amount of money versus regular gamers or people for that matter on things.
[22:30:55] <ButtonMasher_Draco> observation any less true*

[22:32:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> RandomNinja, so far into windows 10 i has acquired cpu hogs
[22:32:52] <MetaSigma> So you've shown me an ebay item. Like I said I might get luck (Though unlikely) and walk down the street and find it a pawn shop for pennies on the dollar

[22:33:19] <ButtonMasher_Draco> I suggest you start frequenting this site: http://www.racketboy.com/guide/the-rarest-and-most-valuable-video-games
[22:33:33] <ButtonMasher_Draco> People post how much they buy things for, gives market range price
[22:33:34] <MetaSigma> I've been there :P, what's your point?
[22:34:07] <ButtonMasher_Draco> The only other collector markets that bring more money to the table are the classic auto and the comic book markets.
[22:34:13] <MetaSigma> The only point I'm trying to make is I don't think collectors are all people with a ton of income. They're just the ones you hear about
[22:34:24] <Cloud_Zephyr> who stole the scissors?
[22:35:01] <MetaSigma> and yes gaming collectors have gone up a TON
[22:35:24] <ButtonMasher_Draco> Collector's spend a lot of money whether they make enough to cover it or not is one thing. They tend to make more than 50k per year and the ones you hear about tend to make over 90k
[22:35:51] <ButtonMasher_Draco> The AVGN is a "collector" but is given a lot of games or buys them online. and he spends a LOT of money.
[22:36:00] <Cloud_Zephyr> RandomNinja, Cloud_Zephyr logic: apply beta operating system as primary os
[22:36:04] <MetaSigma> True, very very true
