[03:25:51] <MikeM> At least Meghan hasn't started yet.
[03:25:56] <Eywind> yeahhhh
[03:27:30] <Eywind> I should probably mute her already
[03:28:07] <wobniaR> The spoilers for season 5 have been really tame compared to 4
[03:28:15] <Eywind> Yeah that's good
[03:28:20] <Eywind> Still doesn't mean I want to hear them lol
[03:28:34] <wobniaR> But people are getting desperate and anxious for the release date
[03:28:38] <Eywind> Yep
[03:28:59] <Eywind> I wish I was like a little kid and was content with watching rainbow rocks like 40 times in a row
[03:29:15] <StrykerVylon> Eywind: Spoiler - There will be ponies doing things

[03:30:10] <Eywind> congrats
[03:30:46] <wobniaR> Yeah I suggested my red black alicorn OC should be included in the show to the staff and they're like "Ok you're in"
[03:30:52] <Eywind> oh wow
[03:31:00] <Eywind> did you send them your fanfic to make into the episode for your backstory?
[03:31:11] <wobniaR> It was so tragic they cried
[03:31:15] <Eywind> XD
[03:32:05] <Eywind> it's really cool that they're okay with your OC being the son of Scootaloo and Snails from the future where everypony but him and a couple others were killed by android ponies though
[03:32:54] <wobniaR> Flash is there too but he only has 1 hoof and back leg
[03:33:02] <Eywind> Well of course
