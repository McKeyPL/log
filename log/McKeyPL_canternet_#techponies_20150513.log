[07:27:36] * sleumas2k points at every browser but Firefox
[07:28:02] <sleumas2k> except IE
[07:28:13] <sleumas2k> because IE is 2xshit
[07:32:57] <Gigabit> He ripped the GPU right off? O.o
[07:33:43] <Googie> Later versions of IE are actually surprisingly good.
[07:34:40] <sleumas2k> Edge is set be be not bad
[07:34:46] <sleumas2k> (Edge = Spartan)
[07:36:43] <Googie> Actually, architecturally, IE these days (Not even Spartan) is ahead of Firefox.
[07:36:58] <Googie> It's actually quite surprising really.
[07:37:51] <Googie> (Proper multiprocess support/tab isolation)
[07:42:10] <AppleDash> Lapsus: lol
[07:42:29] <sleumas2k> what rendering engine does it use?
[07:44:32] <Googie> Trident.
[07:45:30] <Googie> Even Edge is just a fork of Trident, but with a lot of backwards compatibility removed
[07:46:06] <Googie> (Good time to rebrand and remove a lot of the older junk like ActiveX. IE brand is toxic)
[07:46:58] <sleumas2k> I remember ActiveX.....
[07:47:14] <sleumas2k> just one thought, all these old IE6 required sites etc.?
[07:47:24] <sleumas2k> is there going to be an emulation mode?
[07:47:38] <sleumas2k> where it tells the site you're IE at heart, even if you aren't
[07:48:06] <Googie> They're shipping IE separately, based off a more traditional Trident branch
[07:48:20] <tiwake> I've always wanted to make a website that uses activeX to block internet explorer browsers
[07:48:33] <Googie> There's easier ways to do it :P
[07:48:40] <tiwake> never got around to it
[07:48:51] <Googie> Seriously though, IE gets far more flak than it deserves these days
[07:49:20] <tiwake> enh, yeah... it mostly renders CSS correctly these days
[07:49:35] <JustAberrant> I dunno, might be the way it's set up, but on my windows machine at work, IE is slower by a huge margin
[07:50:21] <Googie> A design inherently better than Firefox for example... I find that pretty funny really
[07:50:24] <JustAberrant> the windows box is older so probably plays a part of it, plus we have approximately all the useless enterprise anti-everything[tm] bullshit, so firefox might be faster just be virtue of probably not being supported by all that crap

[07:50:55] <Googie> That's probably it :V Also depends on if they actually bothered to install a recent version of IE
[07:51:26] <Googie> I know plenty of places still using IE8
[07:51:43] <JustAberrant> couldn't guess, I'd say at least 8
[07:51:55] <JustAberrant> I only use it for SAP
[07:52:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> fucking SAP
[07:52:23] <JustAberrant> (which if you're not familiar, is basically something that shouldn't exist)
[07:52:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> it should burn in fire
[07:52:46] <JustAberrant> someone must love it for some reason, but it seems to be universally hated by everyone
[07:52:50] <Googie> 8 Is default on Windows 7, (bare in mind that 11 is the latest version)
[07:53:26] <Googie> I'm not saying I love IE, but it's become fashionable to treat modern IE like it was still IE6 :P
[07:53:34] <Googie> Credit where credit is due and all that.

[07:53:55] <JustAberrant> I take an opposite line
[07:54:42] <JustAberrant> Microsoft can't just push out a few decent bits and make some encouraging polish and expect the world to forget that during the 90s there moto was basically "evil and lovin it"
[07:54:59] <Googie> Oh indeed, and that's why I'm never going back to IE
[07:55:33] <JustAberrant> I don't think I'll ever be able to assume something by microsoft isn't an elaborate trap
[07:55:43] <Googie> Also the point where web standards basically stopped because of IE6.
[07:55:45] <JustAberrant> it's in their blood
[07:56:10] <tiwake> ...all the workaround hacks
[07:56:13] <JustAberrant> letting microsoft establish any kind of foothold anywhere again seems like a really bad idea[tm]
[07:56:24] <JustAberrant> and on that note, bed
[07:56:29] <tiwake> had to make a completely different website just for IE
[07:56:36] <sleumas2k> *bed[tm]
[07:56:36] <tiwake> used to :P
[07:57:57] <Googie> It's just, eh, I oppose IE on those grounds, not on technical grounds.
[07:58:39] <Googie> I also stick to Firefox, despite admitting that, honestly, Chrome is better :P
[07:58:52] <Gigabit> Its Googies fault :p

[07:59:26] <sleumas2k> tiwake: Opera has tab stacks

[07:59:44] <sleumas2k> that thing......
[07:59:57] <sleumas2k> I am using TP3 now, and it's not that bad
[08:00:00] <Googie> I was an Opera user way back when.
[08:00:12] <Googie> Vivaldi is probably more what I meant when I said Opera.
[08:00:23] <sleumas2k> Opera got worse over time
[08:00:29] <Googie> Aye.
[08:01:01] <sleumas2k> I must say, I haven't found any breaking glitches in VIvaldi yet
[08:01:09] <sleumas2k> only new tabs always opening at the end
[08:01:13] <sleumas2k> and stuff like that

[16:09:08] <Moonlightning> So I caved and turned Time Machine back on
[16:09:29] <Moonlightning> > Backing Up: 17.84 GB of 42.88 GB
[16:10:21] <Moonlightning> That seems like rather a lot.
[16:11:06] <Moonlightning> I figure most of what changed should be IRC transcripts, and miscellaneous little things

[16:17:05] <Moonlightning> That seems very unlikely
[16:28:48] <sleumas2000> well, my laptop contains 793,370 files/folders
[16:31:23] <Moonlightning> Oh o.o
[16:31:36] <Moonlightning> Well, that's part of it…there was a 4.6-gig temporary directory sitting outside its normal place >.>
[16:32:49] <sleumas2000> that might help
[16:32:57] <sleumas2000> what I said didn't count my temp directory
[16:33:00] <sleumas2000> because I just emptied it
[16:33:10] <sleumas2000> as in, yesterday
[16:33:18] <sleumas2000> so it isn't ful of crud like it usuall is
[16:40:08] <Moonlightning> Tempdirs aren't backed up here
[16:40:16] <Moonlightning> Wow, this file format is insane
[16:40:39] <Moonlightning> There's a dict with the key 'Events'
[16:40:46] <Moonlightning> Inside that, is an array of dicts
[16:41:16] <Moonlightning> Each of those dicts has a 'Name', a 'Flags', and (if it represents a directory), a 'Children' item
[16:41:24] <Moonlightning> The latter being an array of dicts…
[16:41:29] <Moonlightning> O(n) lookups, yay!

[20:33:19] <DataByteBrony> windows is funny, sometimes
[20:33:33] <DataByteBrony> i unplug a flash drive, and plug it into my linux laptop
[20:34:08] <DataByteBrony> the contents pop up and i'm browsing them before windows notices and plays the disconnect notification sound
[20:35:08] <sleumas2000> Windows is slow
[20:35:26] <sleumas2000> when I unlug my midi controller it doesn't play the sound unless I plg it back in

[23:41:41] <Fallfeathers> Drill me about Cisco  stuff. Interview is today. :v
[23:42:51] <Colgate> why do cisco small business switches suck so much?
[23:47:31] <Fallfeathers> Colgate: because they require a fucking rocket scientist to configure
[23:47:52] <Colgate> also, why don't they have a cli? :/
[23:47:56] <Colgate> :P
[23:50:04] <Fallfeathers> Colgate: because they want rocket scientists to configure their switches
[23:55:37] <Fallfeathers> Colgate: cisco has remarkably managed to create half a generation of overspecialised technicians.. and then gave them jobs :v
[23:56:07] <Colgate> it is a good system :P
