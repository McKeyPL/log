[09:45:26] <Iron_wofle> Any of you guys know if running poe through a splitter is viable? 
[09:47:17] <Iron_wofle> We're having some challenges with getting wireless access points set up at a site with a very limited number of network outlets 
[09:53:40] <Iron_wofle> We'd like to minimize the amount of mess because there's a lot of children at the site, so the fewer boxes the better. 
[09:53:58] <Iron_wofle> Haven't been able to get it working so far 
[09:56:04] * AppleDash gives Iron_wofle a switch
[09:56:39] <Iron_wofle> Switches are expensive and would create more clutter at the site 
[09:56:44] <Iron_wofle> Which we want to avoid 
[09:56:55] <AppleDash> I dunno
[09:57:02] <Iron_wofle> Plus, getting switches for this would be massive overkill 
[09:57:30] <Iron_wofle> We're considering putting poe injectors after the splitters, but again, clutter 
[09:57:58] <Iron_wofle> This would have been easy if they didn't go with a single cable to each part of the building when the wiring was upgraded
