[01:57:57] <masonalcat> btw EM-C we launch the show directly to youtube instead of trying to live stream it. my bandwidth can't handle broadcasting the live stream. so what when I release it we can all watch it together
[01:58:10] <EM-C> Okay.
[01:58:12] <masonalcat> and we are weekly again
[01:58:35] <EM-C> What's happened today is that we've mad a couple men over here installing ramps at the front and back door.
[01:58:58] <EM-C> I've been locked up in here all day.  And now that they're finished the front ramp is too steep.
[01:59:19] <EM-C> I can manage to walk up it but it's dangerous for me to try to walk down it.
[01:59:58] <EM-C> They're supposed to install a thingum to old on to in the morning, but they wouldn't have if I hadn't complained.
[02:00:29] <EM-C> I'm just sort of disgusted.  I'm afraid we may wish now we'd never had it done.
[02:00:51] <EM-C> The ramp in the back is fine, but I can't stand up long enough to walk around the house.  I need to be able to go in and out the front door.
[02:00:57] <masonalcat> fun

[04:11:34] <StrykerVylon> PvZ is only on Origin and all of those codes are on one code themselves. I have no idea if the code can be used by more than one Origin account though. If it was on Steam id send you it because I dont plan on playing it. Mostly got the bundle for Mass Effect, Dead Space, and Dragon Age.

[14:05:05] <LightSpeed> what in equestria is a radio?
[14:05:22] <ThunderBolt> Galax GeForce GTX 980 V2 4GB to be exact
[14:05:32] <RandomNinja> one of those newfangled technologies
[14:05:41] <ThunderBolt> Yus
[14:05:41] <LightSpeed> ohhh
[14:05:50] <ThunderBolt> the newest GPU by Nvidia

[14:05:59] <ThunderBolt> i could not wait for a Ti

[14:09:03] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Preorder bonuses at least.
[14:09:04] <ThunderBolt> how?
[14:09:23] <RandomNinja> they "ran out" of digital versions
[14:09:35] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Well, I placed the order in 2013. Didn't get the key on release. Tried to contact support for 3 days till I got one who could explain the situation.
[14:09:51] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Aparently my order had become invalid because of system changes, which I wasn't informed.
[14:09:56] <RandomNinja> boo
[14:09:57] <ThunderBolt> so all my old parts will go back in their Static-Free bags and original packaging and collect dust untill i replace my case PSu and Boom! 2nd PC
[14:10:09] <RandomNinja> yus!
[14:10:17] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So now they'll let me purchase it for the same price, but without the preorder bonus.
[14:10:30] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So instead they'll give me a 10% cupon for any other purchase.
[14:10:30] <RandomNinja> ThunderBolt get a mITX case and make a portable secondary PC
[14:10:44] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Because I would totally buy from them again >.>
