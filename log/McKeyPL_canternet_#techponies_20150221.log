[01:49:50] <JustAberrant> on principle I'm against this shit to a point where I think it's time for the law to come in
[01:49:58] <JustAberrant> in practice, I have no problem with it
[01:50:16] <JustAberrant> it subsidizes the cost of the hardware

[01:57:00] <JustAberrant> pretty much anything can be worked around in software

[04:34:51] <cyborg_ar> it was from a digital output that is rarely used
[04:35:20] <cyborg_ar> the one that burned was from the main power supply so it was more important to keep the proper protection
