[03:28:17] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yeap
[03:28:38] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I remember watching the Ocean Group dub.
[03:28:52] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Then Funimation got the rights.
[03:28:55] <Hoofy> really?
[03:29:01] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> And it moved to Cartoon Network.
[03:29:17] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Hoofy: Yes.

[03:31:16] <Hoofy> yup
[03:32:02] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Also Saban had a hand in Dragon Ball Z as well.
[03:32:58] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Not that unlikely since Super Sentai and Dragon Ball are owned by Toei.
[03:33:29] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> And Kamen Rider is a Toei show as well.

[04:07:47] <MikeM> Oh hey, Sombra, I saw this and thought of you. http://derpy.me/UGrzg
[04:08:46] <Sombra> Um... why?
[04:09:40] <MikeM> You mentioned you went shooting. I thought the vaguely pony color would be funny. They have others, too.
[04:10:07] <Sombra> Well that's awkward MikeM, usually Pink and frilly guns are marketed towards women.  Which I find to be sexist personally.
[04:10:30] <MikeM> Yes. There's a rainbow P238 I really like.
[04:10:39] <Sombra> Are you a girl?
[04:10:55] <MikeM> lol. Nope
[04:11:00] <Sombra> Oh.
[04:11:18] <Sombra> Well, I guess man you can, get what you want.  I dunno I'm not really into sigs for pocket guns, they seem overpriced to me.
[04:12:25] <MikeM> They are a bit more than S&W or Ruger.

[04:15:00] <Sombra> I'm sure either a 43 or a shield or a p238 is going to be more accurate than most shooters.

[04:18:00] <MikeM> So, new Terminator movie. I'm not buying the story.
[04:18:09] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: You're not the only one.
[04:18:27] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: It looks like it's basically saying that John Connor can go 'buck' himself.
[04:18:35] <RandomNinja> at least we got Mad Max
[04:18:42] <RandomNinja> speaking of 80's franchises
[04:18:50] <MikeM> And the writers can do whatever they want, retcon everything.
[04:19:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Though it feels like they're doing nothing to make me want to see T5.
[04:19:36] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Plus so far, everything I've seen of Kyle Reese makes him look like 'a whiny girly-mahn.'
[04:20:05] <MikeM> Yeah. I probably won't even see it as a rent.
[04:20:56] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: So far, everything they've said is that the future is just dependent on Sarah Connor and the Terminator...everyone else seems expendable.
[04:21:56] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: I'd even bet money that the Asian T-1000 is just going tohave no dialogue.
[04:22:17] <MikeM> He'll probably get one clever line.
[04:22:41] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: Yes, I'm tearing into this film with a fervor unseen since te prequels.

[04:23:07] <MikeM> It just feels like, "Yo dawg, we heard you like time travelers, so we put a time traveler in your time traveler, and a bunch of time traveler loops on that."
[04:24:22] <Muffin_Spectacles> MikeM: I always wanted to do a comic where John goes psycho when finding the time machine, and then just starts sending dozens of T-800's back in time to different time periods.
