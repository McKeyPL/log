[01:08:15] <cyborg_ar> yay assembly coding still pays
[01:08:23] <cyborg_ar> got a 57% performance increase in a crc16 function in hand coded assembly vs C
[01:08:34] <Webster> Wow.
[01:08:47] <Webster> I'm surprised.
[01:09:07] <cyborg_ar> well not on x86, but an 8 bit microcontroler :)
[01:09:22] <Webster> Alright, less surprised.
[01:09:42] <cyborg_ar> C was being stupid and dropping vital data that were left in the flags by the processor
[01:09:47] <cyborg_ar> then recalculated them
[01:13:18] <cyborg_ar> yeah on x86 most performance issues have to do with memory instead of raw cpu cycles
[01:13:21] <cyborg_ar> nowadays
[01:14:26] <cyborg_ar> stuff like branch prediction and caches makes it harder to predict how code is gonna perform
[01:15:10] <cyborg_ar> but on a simple non-pipelined risc architecture you can tell what's gonna peform best at a glance :)
[01:16:51] <JustAberrant> ricer :(
[01:18:09] <cyborg_ar> heheh

[18:35:26] <Twilightlicious> Hey guys i have a question! :3
[18:35:52] <Twilightlicious> You know those like, Logitec Mice and Keyboards that say the battery lasts 1 year based on "average use"?
[18:36:15] <Twilightlicious> How long do they actually last, like hour wise, or for someone who spends 6~ hours a day on average using one
[18:37:29] <DataByteBrony> i quit using wireless.. sorry :P
[18:37:47] <locodash11[server]> I have a logitec mouse rated at that much, and used at least 6 hours a day almost every day since getting it, it lasted about 15 months
[18:38:28] <Twilightlicious> I see.
[18:38:31] <DataByteBrony> have a logitech m505 at work, lithium batteries, i got it used (about a year old), and use it occasionally, still have never needed a battery change
[18:38:39] <locodash11[server]> never had a wireless keyboard though
[18:39:06] <Twilightlicious> DataByteBrony, i got it for my Tablet, but im starting to think it's actually nicer than the wired set i'm currently using on my Desktop, so im thinking about just using it on my Desktop
[18:40:10] <DataByteBrony> i have a wireless bluetooth kbd i use w/ my phone.. no idea on runtime
[18:40:32] <DataByteBrony> a few months, with steady useage
