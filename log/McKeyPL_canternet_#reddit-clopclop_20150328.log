[00:01:15] <ponder> I bought a g-spot stimulator a few days ago, and have been looking forward to trying it, but shortly after I bought it my sister got sick and hasn't left the house.... I don't really want to use it with the danger of her walking in on me, or hearing or whatever...
[00:01:42] <samonuh> What's a g-spot stimulator?
[00:02:46] <ponder> http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31UEM9X08PL._SY355_.jpg it looks like this. You put it up your butt, and it supposedly stimulates your prostate in a nice way.
[00:02:57] <samonuh> NEat
[00:03:15] <ponder> A good beginner toy, from what I've read. Gonna see if I can experience that prostate orgasm everyone's talking about

[19:36:35] <thaostra> I'm a little annoyed that Redfox1hq uploaded that Pinkie Pie comic by 3mangos, because I spent last night preparing it for posting earlier today. By the time I get to posting it, they already got to it a few minutes before I did

[19:38:36] <thaostra> I mean I would've posted it, except I had prepared different versions of it and wanted it all neatly formatted. I had a PDF version, mobile version, an album, and had the source with the text copied in quotes
[19:38:49] <thaostra> Not to mention optimizing it all takes tme
