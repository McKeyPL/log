[03:13:07] <expatriate> just had a great game of DayZ
[03:13:17] <RNGsus> Mod or standalone and what happened
[03:13:22] <expatriate> standalone
[03:13:44] <expatriate> my two friends and I were dicking around in Berezino
[03:14:21] <expatriate> we got really sloppy because we were there for like 20min without seeing anyone
[03:14:25] <iamalion> i pictured you sword fighting with dildos
[03:14:27] <expatriate> then we started to search the hospital
[03:14:40] <expatriate> and I got to the roof and saw someone running up the road
[03:14:46] <expatriate> so I yell that a survivor is coming
[03:15:07] <expatriate> and apparently my friend thought I meant a fresh spawn, so he ran out to kill him
[03:15:18] <expatriate> but it wasn't a fresh spawn, it was a really geared up dude
[03:15:25] <RNGsus> Ouch
[03:15:27] <expatriate> and apparently the last of three people
[03:15:38] <expatriate> the other two were RIGHT at the door so my friends both got mowed down
[03:15:43] <randomquestion> expartriate do you have a local server or do you play on one of the larger servers?
[03:16:14] <expatriate> public server, Honky Kong Country
[03:16:24] <expatriate> so I ran down to the second floor to watch the stairs
[03:16:28] <expatriate> I wasn't sure if they had seen me or not
[03:16:34] <randomquestion> How do you find your friends on there? If you don't mind me asking.
[03:17:08] <expatriate> so I just wait, shitting myself
[03:17:16] <expatriate> finally a dude came up, I took a shot and missed, he ran back down
[03:17:27] <expatriate> so I knew these guys were going to come up at me
[03:17:39] <expatriate> so I run all the way to the roof and take the ladders back to the ground
[03:17:47] <expatriate> and come back in the front door to shoot them in the back
[03:17:55] <expatriate> would have been awesome- but then a zombie comes in
[03:18:05] <expatriate> I don't want to give away my position so I switch to my axe
[03:18:17] <expatriate> and RIGHT THEN one of the guys comes down
[03:18:28] <expatriate> so I have a zombie fucking my butt and a dude with a gun trying to hit me
[03:18:31] <expatriate> I go for the guy
[03:18:37] <expatriate> and murder the FUCK out of him with my axe
[03:18:41] <expatriate> then take care of the zombie
[03:18:44] <expatriate> then run the fuck away
[03:18:53] <expatriate> find a corner to bandage and reload
[03:19:11] <expatriate> wait about a minute so that the other guy thinks I'm gone
[03:19:23] <expatriate> run back in, bam bam killed him
[03:19:36] <expatriate> and then a third one turns the corner, who I at the time didn't know about
[03:19:40] <expatriate> and he wastes me
[03:19:44] <expatriate> but 
[03:19:44] *** RubyPinch|DCed is now known as RubyPinch
[03:19:49] <expatriate> I was so proud of that maneuver
[03:20:04] <expatriate> killed two fully geared guys, one with an axe
[03:20:19] <expatriate> so that's the story
[03:20:38] <expatriate> not that interesting if you don't play dayZ, or if you play a lot more than me so you have lots of those
[03:21:32] <expatriate> finding friends is just a matter of figuring out where you are, then picking a meeting point
[03:21:51] <expatriate> I tend to scavenge the area I'm at just till I get some food and water and then sprint all the way there
[03:22:08] <expatriate> if you try to loot on the way you're more likely to get killed before you ever see them
[03:23:16] <randomquestion> Ok I see, any thoughts on H1Z1? I wanted to try that game because it seemed like a free version of DayZ, but I'd need to get someone to play with me beforehand. XD
[03:24:18] <expatriate> haven't played it but I've heard exclusively negative things

[06:25:12] <Futashy> did you break in?
[06:25:17] <Frosty> This is bad because it's labeled with my dorm and room number. If someone finds it, they could steal all my shit.

[06:25:45] <Frosty> It's govn't property. I can't.

[06:41:45] <Futashy> sorry haters :(
[06:42:23] <Frosty> Whi is hating on Evolve?
[06:43:18] <plushie_pegasus> G1 was cutting edge animation in the 80's
[06:43:52] <plushie_pegasus> That was before CG when everything was done by hand
[06:45:42] <plushie_pegasus> Sure G4 is better, but at the time G1 was good
[06:45:52] <Nikashi> ehh it was OKAY
[06:45:54] <Nikashi> the movies were good
[06:46:01] <Nikashi> the TV series... was up and down
[06:46:14] <Nikashi> because TV series to hawk playsets sometimes
[06:46:37] <Iceflurries> hi Nikashi 
[06:46:42] <Nikashi> hii
[06:46:43] <Nikashi> :)
[06:46:45] <Futashy> Nikashi !
[06:46:46] <plushie_pegasus> That is what Hasbro is doing with G4
[06:46:47] * Iceflurries pokes Futashy 
[06:46:48] * Futashy waves
[06:46:51] <Nikashi> Er no
[06:46:56] <Nikashi> If you watched G1 v G4
[06:46:58] <Nikashi> it's night and day
[06:46:59] * Futashy pokes Iceflurries back, before giving a good tickle
[06:47:04] <Nikashi> G1 would NAME PLAYSETS specifically
[06:47:20] <Nikashi> I think they called out the playsets a few times in the first seasons
[06:47:26] <Nikashi> but have largely stopped that
[06:47:49] <Nikashi> Like I think they called it the Carousel Boutique once
[06:47:52] <Nikashi> as an example
[06:47:53] <Futashy> "hi applejack, i just love this new *rainbow forest playset* that we are exploring!"
[06:47:54] * Futashy giggles
[06:48:05] <Nikashi> Yeah, that's pretty much what G1 was like for SOME episodes
[06:48:15] <plushie_pegasus> But it's no secret Hasbro is making a shitload of money on MLP toys 
[06:48:19] <Nikashi> others were just stories, but light on character development (i.e. NONE)
[06:48:21] <Nikashi> oh of course
[06:48:28] <Nikashi> but that's because of the fact the show stays engaging now too
[06:48:32] <Futashy> it would have been funny if it was a clearly edited in voice
[06:48:42] <Nikashi> but Hasbro is openly catering to bronies now
[06:48:49] <Nikashi> rather than reluctantly
[06:49:07] <Nikashi> so the money is rolling in
[06:49:15] <Nikashi> TBH they're probably cannibalizing transformers a bit
[06:49:41] <Nikashi> All I can say is, I trust the show will be good in S5
[06:49:47] <Nikashi> I know enough people frigging working on it!
[06:49:59] <Nikashi> Vancouver should be like
[06:50:00] <Nikashi> Brony Mecca
[06:50:18] <plushie_pegasus> Any idea when S5 will be aired?
[06:50:29] <Nikashi> er yes, this spring
[06:50:33] <plushie_pegasus> They said spring
[06:50:49] <plushie_pegasus> We need a date, damit
[06:51:10] <Nikashi> haha, I could tell you that the episodes are basically all done lol
[06:51:40] <Nikashi> And that Mando and Sibsy make a d'awwww couple
[06:52:44] <Katiepony> I have wondered, is the whole season usually finished by the time the first episode airs?

[08:35:39] <Katiepony> No matter how much I try to massage it, prostate stimulators have never done anything for me.

[08:35:52] <Iceflurries> well there's a reason for that Katiepony ;)
[08:35:56] <Quinn> you might be doing something wrong

[08:37:20] <Quinn> that's all I have for toys
[08:37:44] <Quinn> well, I have two BD Mary's, but those aren't for butt play
[08:37:54] <Katiepony> Not with that attitude.
[08:38:17] <RNGsus> Ive seen videos of people taking those in the butt and someone else fucking the bd toy

[08:41:28] <Katiepony> In seriousness, I've never actually enjoyed anal stuff that much. I do it very rarely, but it just ends up hurting after a while. It can be really intense at first, though.
[08:41:57] <Futashy> i should go get some ice cream cake
[08:41:59] <Futashy> om nom nom
[08:42:00] <Quinn> if it goes on for too long it can hurt
[08:42:17] <Quinn> I've always managed to make them cum pretty fast though, so not too much of an issue
[08:42:20] <Katiepony> Husbandhorse bought himself a prostate massager, but he whined it was too big for him, so I ended up trying it for fun
[08:42:44] <Quinn> wait are you bio female or male
[08:43:02] <Katiepony> Female =P
[08:43:08] <Iceflurries> ahh okays
[08:43:12] <Quinn> that'd be why
[08:43:12] <RNGsus> Gee i wonder why it didnt work
[08:43:18] <Katiepony> I do too o:
[08:43:48] <Quinn> it's because you don't have a prostate
[08:43:49] <Quinn> so
[08:43:52] <Iceflurries> Katiepony:  :P lol
[08:43:55] <Katiepony> x3
[08:43:55] <Quinn> you can't really massage it
[08:44:00] <RNGsus> The clitoris is your prostate
[08:44:00] <Iceflurries> Katiepony: that's what I've been thinking about getting xD

[08:45:37] <RNGsus> I dunno if it would be worth it though
[08:45:38] <Quinn> might get one
[08:47:13] <Quinn> no idea how that would feel
[08:47:18] <Katiepony> I figure, if you're guys are buying stuff to put up your butt, you should probably invest in the prostate stuff, right? Rather than just a vibe o:
[08:47:24] <Quinn> I've used a vibrator on a girl but that's the extent of my expereince
[08:48:02] <Quinn> well you can reach/stimulate it without a specific prostate stimulator
[08:48:14] <Quinn> it doesnt always have to massage it directly
[08:48:25] <Katiepony> Surely one that's purposely built to do that would do the job better? o:
[08:48:35] <Quinn> no clue
[08:48:57] <Quinn> but I have no problem orgasming by only using a dildo

[20:59:32] <Frosty> Nah. The woamn I love is 21.
[20:59:56] <Melon_Phone> mhm
[21:00:26] <Evelina> He likes his women like me likes his music, heavy and metal
[21:00:55] <Frosty> It funny because she is covered in metal. But she is actually skinny.
[21:00:59] <Frosty> And athletic.
[21:01:24] <Melon_Phone> race dogs don't count
[21:01:54] <Frosty> Well, if it was a race dog, I'd be a necrophile because she'd be dead.
[21:03:30] <Melon_Phone> ¬øpor que?
[21:03:57] <Frosty> a 21 year old dog? Pah.
[21:04:00] <Frosty> The sad part is she doesn't exist.
[21:05:10] <Melon_Phone> in dog years you mug
[21:05:46] <Frosty> So she'd be three in people years, keeping my pedo status.
[21:06:05] <Melon_Phone> there you go
[21:06:50] <Frosty> However, I never "enthusiastically confess" my love for anyone or anything, so, you loose.
[21:06:56] <Melon_Phone> so it was you that I met
[21:07:03] <Melon_Phone> I call bs
[21:07:33] <Frosty> Oh?
[21:08:07] <Melon_Phone> yea
[21:08:18] <Melon_Phone> although it might've been someone else
[21:08:26] <Melon_Phone> prolly a relative o it's

[21:13:14] <Frosty> No, but you said "...to some creepy guy". 
[21:14:50] <Melon_Phone> I call everything dudes and guys 
[21:15:17] <Melon_Phone> besides they never stated anything beside their love for children
[21:17:15] <Frosty> Whatever. You mad I'm right.
[21:17:36] <Melon_Phone> I'm pretty mad
[21:17:47] <Melon_Phone> I'm so salty I'm turning into an anchovy

[21:18:40] <Melon_Phone> I'm so salty I just became the Archbishop of Banterbury 
[21:18:44] <Frosty> NAh, I'm too poor.
[21:18:49] <weisey> Frosty: that's biologically impossible
[21:19:08] <weisey> One side of your family had to shit out a boy somewhere in there each generation

[21:19:33] <Frosty> weisey: All the fathers ran out on thier wives after some time and we don't talk to them so we don't consider them part of the family.
[21:19:53] <weisey> Charming
[21:20:07] <Frosty> Not really.

[21:28:28] <Frosty> So, there is this guy in my shop. He just got here like, two weeks ago. A few others from the shop and I hung out a few times. But we just got another new guy Saturday, and he's already way cooler than the first new dude, and I think he knows that. He also keeps asking me if I want to go to town, even though there is nothing to do, espically on a Sunday or Monday. And like, I don't really like the first dude to begin with.
[21:29:25] <Melon_Phone> just spread your buttcheeks for him already

[22:39:39] <RubyPinch> you can have mixes tho
[22:39:49] <Speedy> I think normal lawn>that, but clovers I think are more...smaaart to do? I just dont like the look.
[22:40:21] <RubyPinch> clovers feel better iirc, I think I've seen it once
[22:40:59] <RNGsus> Jesus fucking christ the B 57 is SO SHIT
[22:41:20] <Katiepony> We used to have a clover field on my school grounds when I was little.
[22:41:29] <Katiepony> We'd all sit in it and try to find 4 leaf clovers o:
[22:41:55] <Katiepony> Now that I think about it, it's probably a really good way to keep children quiet.

[22:43:33] <Flame> about 1/5 is completely dirt now
[22:43:43] <Speedy> clovers apparently absorb dog piss like it's nothing
[22:44:05] <Katiepony> Oh, well the best kind of lawn is one you don't let a dog destroy :3
[22:44:08] <Flame> RubyPinch: would you recommend it? :o probably not from your recent post o.o

[22:44:28] <Katiepony> I'm kidding x3
[22:44:43] <Katiepony> They're pretty and soft :3
[22:45:18] <RubyPinch> so you can't really reverse it as easily, but it will solve that problem ya have
[22:47:14] <Speedy> will it spread past its intended area? Or..try to spread past it's intended area?
