[06:33:57] <Squirrelly> Oh my god....
[06:34:14] <weisey> all yall talkin about lube, have obviously never seen just how little lube is needed in a vagina for everything but fisting
[06:34:17] <Squirrelly> That video gives me this insane need to be tied up and mounted......
[06:34:24] <Squirrelly> lol weisey I know

[18:56:56] <Vulpixbrew> Luck*
[18:59:26] <OmarianVolcae> Bew!
[18:59:42] <OmarianVolcae> I had to have an HIV test done. I don't like blood tests.
[18:59:57] <OmarianVolcae> The medics like to make uncomfortable jokes.
[19:00:56] <Squirrelly> Ew
[19:01:10] <OmarianVolcae> Hmm?
[19:01:22] <OmarianVolcae> What's ew?
[19:01:41] <SleepyPon> blood tests, probably
[19:01:48] <Squirrelly> I can't do blood donations. Not because I have any problem with them, but because I always seem to be sick when they happen at my school
[19:01:56] <Squirrelly> Also ew to HIV
[19:02:02] <OmarianVolcae> Eh.
[19:02:06] <OmarianVolcae> It's routine in the Army.
[19:02:15] <Squirrelly> Oh okay
[19:02:19] <OmarianVolcae> Not because they suspect you to have HIV.
[19:02:19] * Vulpixbrew still isn't legally allowed to do blood donations
[19:02:35] <cloppyhooves> I've never donated blood first because I was an athlete and second 'cause I'm probably disallowed at this point
[19:02:39] <Squirrelly> Gay stuff?
[19:03:12] <OmarianVolcae> Hrm, what's being an athlete have to do with donating blood?
[19:03:37] <Squirrelly> ^
[19:03:58] <Squirrelly> Heh
[19:04:46] <Squirrelly> There were a few times where I couldn't donate because I had technically touched somebody else's blood in the last few months, because I did some rough stuff with my gf
[19:05:07] <OmarianVolcae> Zouch
[19:05:13] <SleepyPon> (hot hehe)
[19:05:25] <Squirrelly> Entirely consensual, but she liked me to use my fingers and toys roughly and it sometimes made her bleed a little
[19:05:39] <Squirrelly> Or it was right after her period
[19:05:47] <cloppyhooves> I just meant that they had blood donation trucks at my high school campus
[19:05:57] <cloppyhooves> But I was an athlete, and they'd always appear the day of/before a meet
[19:06:04] <cloppyhooves> So it would be...unwise to give blood at that point
[19:06:08] <Squirrelly> Oh and you missed the times because sports
[19:06:15] <Squirrelly> Yeah
[19:06:18] <OmarianVolcae> I stopped donating because the organization that comes here lied to me.
[19:06:21] <cloppyhooves> (Someone actually did give blood before a cross-country meet)
[19:06:33] <Vulpixbrew> yes Squirrelly gay stuff for me at least
[19:06:33] <cloppyhooves> (It didn't end well (but the guy was okay))
[19:07:01] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah, I guess if it were same day.
[19:07:04] <Squirrelly> That sucks
[19:07:06] <OmarianVolcae> Usually I'm fine after a day.
[19:07:22] <Squirrelly> Turns out they don't care as much about girls touching girls
[19:08:15] <OmarianVolcae> The donation organization that comes here claimed that 100% of their donations went overseas to deployed soldiers.
[19:08:34] <OmarianVolcae> I got an email a little bit later saying that my donation had been used at some free clinic in a shitty part of NYC.
[19:09:17] <Squirrelly> Wtf
[19:09:20] <Squirrelly> That's bs
[19:09:31] <OmarianVolcae> I don't donate with them anymore.
[19:09:57] <Squirrelly> Omar, can we possibly see a pic of you if you're comfortable with it?
[19:10:04] <OmarianVolcae> I've posted pics before.
