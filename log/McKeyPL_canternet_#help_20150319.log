[00:04:38] <PinkYoshi> .....makes sense
[00:05:09] <Unixkitty> You're new to IRC or something? It's just a network of chat rooms with people in them.
[00:05:35] <RedHelper> They need help of how to register there nick
[00:05:36] <PinkYoshi> oh
[00:05:47] <Colgate> Twili: register
[00:05:47] <Twili> I read in a book once that said register is /msg nickserv register password email
[00:06:00] <RedHelper> Thanks Colgate 
[00:06:55] <Unixkitty> Hm... I'm fairly certain I'd seen "hoofy" being registered at one point, but email unconfirmed
[00:07:00] <Unixkitty> It seems to have expired now
[00:07:11] <PinkYoshi> yeah:/
[00:07:33] <Unixkitty> And I also think I was trying to help you validate through that email

[16:44:04] <Toothpaste> Alright, I'd best notify this person... They've tried using one of my nicknames multiple times, and I really would like to let them know that. They don't seem to be aware of how Nickserv works. (jumping to conclusions is magic~)
[16:44:39] <Toothpaste> I would like to know how I could message a person when all I have is their hostmask
[16:45:45] <Colgate> you can't
[16:46:19] *** Toothpaste is now known as Invert_Shade
[16:46:23] <Colgate> /who hostmask, and if you get a nick, then you can, but otherwise they don't share a channel with you
[16:46:45] <Invert_Shade> Okay
[16:47:19] <Invert_Shade> Dangit

[19:54:48] <Chocolate_Chip> Hay Colgate. I think I found an error with the server code
[19:54:59] <Chocolate_Chip> The /kickban banned someone wrong.
[19:55:15] <Colgate> /kickban isn't a server command, that's in your client
[19:55:24] <Chocolate_Chip> Oh.
[19:55:29] <Chocolate_Chip> Then it's his client
[19:55:33] <Colgate> yes
[19:55:51] <Colgate> /kickban is actually 2 commands, a /mode and a /kick
[20:01:54] <Unixkitty> Yeah... I encountered something like this some time ago with my recent at the time client, had to set the hostmask option in the config file instead of what it was, username and part host? Like *!Name@*.domain to *!*@fullmask
[20:02:22] <Unixkitty> Hadn't noticed until my first ban either
[20:03:22] <Chocolate_Chip> Well, it did *!*user*!*@*!*vhost
[20:04:06] <Chocolate_Chip> I think his client broke the entire channel
[20:04:27] <Colgate> probably not :P
[20:04:53] <Chocolate_Chip> Well, he can't change any of the flags despite being owner, and he can't unmute the channel
[20:04:57] <Chocolate_Chip> or cange mlock

[20:07:00] <Unixkitty> Sounds fun
[20:07:14] <Chocolate_Chip> I can't post to it. It says that I can't because I
[20:07:19] <Chocolate_Chip> 'm not voiced
[20:07:28] <Chocolate_Chip> which to me means it's muted
[20:07:42] <Colgate> it isn't muted
[20:08:16] <Chocolate_Chip> then why can't I talk?
