[00:30:44] <Zachary_DuBois> o-o
[00:31:36] <mooo> I had an idea for a troll clue since I like things like that. Give people the channel name as a clue, but when they try to join it they find out it was +k and now they need to find the key to get in
[00:33:26] <MinceR> but now it won't surprise anyone
[00:33:42] <mooo> lol
[00:33:46] <mooo> they'll forget :P
[00:34:10] <mooo> base64 encode the clue so they think they are smart and already got the answer or something
[00:44:44] <Cassini> i thought most people stopped doing the puzzles
[00:45:01] <mooo> yes, there will be more puzzles eventually
[00:45:01] <larina> yea probably
[00:45:04] <larina> some of us are still doing it
[00:45:14] <larina> I am going to try and complete it
[00:45:22] <mooo> I have absolutely no clue what to do at level 8 though
[00:45:52] <mooo> so i probably won't try very hard
[00:46:06] <mooo> tried a bit of two different ciphers
[00:47:27] <larina> you can do it mooo 
[00:47:30] <larina> just mooo hard
