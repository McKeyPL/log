[04:00:07] *** Acentric is now known as Acentricity
[04:00:28] <Muffin_Spectacles> ..or maybe that's just regarding American talent shows...but it's often never really looked upon, since anyone whose Asian seems to get kicked within 2-3 of the first runoffs.
[04:00:57] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> I'm not sure
[04:01:33] <Muffin_Spectacles> Kawaii_FPS_Princess: It just feels that way to me...but then again, noone ever seems to make as much a racket out of the lack of Asian-representation out there. They seem to be one of the fewest persons to ever really make a racket.
