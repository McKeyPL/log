[12:31:46] <TheFlutterGuy> <Electron> hm? how so? <- soo, to get a drivers license you haev to follow the rules, the law
[12:31:54] <TheFlutterGuy> so you have a sign that says "speed limit is 50km/h"
[12:32:02] <TheFlutterGuy> soo, when doing your test, if you drive 48km/h, you will fail
[12:32:06] <TheFlutterGuy> you SHOUDL drive 52km/h
[12:32:15] <TheFlutterGuy> which is.. like, totally not logical at all. it's the stupidest thing ever.
[12:32:18] <TheFlutterGuy> but that's how the world is.
[12:32:35] <TheFlutterGuy> Sooo, gave the kid some new rules, that he was told was of higher priority than the normal driving rules
[12:32:43] <TheFlutterGuy> one of them being. "add 10% on top of the speed limit, and target that".
[12:32:56] <TheFlutterGuy> And then, he passed, by following the unwritten law. instead of the written one.

[20:39:14] <TheFlutterGuy> that would be awesome
[20:40:15] <Lunia> in this episode we will focus on CMC and Twilight. Other characters will not be given any episodes or air time

[20:47:30] <Lunia> Letters to Celestia by Twilight were cool
[20:47:38] <TheFlutterGuy> the big bang theory is a shell of its former self by now
[20:47:42] <Lunia> then when all the ponies were spamming her it was fine
[20:47:45] <TheFlutterGuy> same for last season of how i met your mother.
[20:47:47] <Lunia> what they have now?
[20:47:58] <TheFlutterGuy> yeah, i'm kinda annoyed by that one too.
[20:47:59] <Lunia> a giant fucking coke villa in the middle of ponyville
[20:48:28] <Lunia> like
[20:48:33] <Lunia> ponyville is a small village
[20:48:40] <Lunia> 100 ponies at max
[20:48:47] <Lunia> why do we need a giant villa
[20:48:51] <Lunia> what is it?
[20:48:55] <Lunia> Cuban island?
[20:49:04] <Lunia> are they all gonna warship their el presidente?
[20:49:23] <Lunia> El presidente Twilight SPRKL
[20:50:08] <TheFlutterGuy> xD
[20:50:15] * Electron got pinged
[20:50:22] <Lunia> and She turning into a goose 
[20:50:25] <Lunia> Im not sure about that
[20:50:25] * Electron likes all 4 seasons
[20:50:27] <Pencil_Sketch> El Presidente is always right
[20:50:29] <Lunia> I watched this episode
[20:50:32] <Lunia> and when she exploded
[20:50:36] <Lunia> I was like
[20:50:37] <Lunia> YAY
[20:50:39] <Lunia> SHe is dead
[20:50:44] <Lunia> so she wont turn into alicorn 
[20:50:46] <Lunia> :D
[20:50:46] <TheFlutterGuy> haha.
[20:50:53] <TheFlutterGuy> i liked it.
[20:51:05] <TheFlutterGuy> i don't agree with the move. but it was pulled out much better than i had hoped it would be.
[20:51:11] <Lunia> So I exploded, then I died, and now I am a god~
[20:51:16] <TheFlutterGuy> indeed
[20:51:18] <TheFlutterGuy> twilight sparkle is magic
[20:51:24] <TheFlutterGuy> she can do whatever the plot requires
[20:51:28] <TheFlutterGuy> she is one giant deus ex mechina
[20:51:31] <Lunia> Im sure its fine for you
[20:51:35] <Lunia> you joined after this
[20:51:44] <Lunia> but older bronies didnt know that
[20:51:46] <TheFlutterGuy> i watched the show from the beginning
[20:51:54] <Lunia> since?
[20:52:01] <TheFlutterGuy> ehm..
[20:52:15] <TheFlutterGuy> i watched the pilot episode on youtube. ±1 month of 4chan starting.
[20:52:32] <TheFlutterGuy> then i watched it on and off. not really paying attention to it that much, i liked it.
[20:52:32] <Lunia> and you were watching it since then?
[20:52:45] <TheFlutterGuy> Nah, waited a year or so, before i watched all of season 1
[20:52:51] <Lunia> you told me you joined brony fandom half a year ago
[20:52:58] <TheFlutterGuy> but s3 i watched within like.. 1-2 months of it airing
[20:53:06] <Lunia> you liar
[20:53:06] <TheFlutterGuy> Oh, i did.
[20:53:12] <TheFlutterGuy> i wasn't part of hte community
[20:53:18] <TheFlutterGuy> read no blogs, no news.
[20:53:29] <TheFlutterGuy> i liekd the series. but i wasn't a bronyh.
[20:53:30] * Lunia burns the witch
[20:53:41] <TheFlutterGuy> a brony is something different
[20:53:44] <Lunia> I joined the fandom the same day I started watching
[20:53:48] <Lunia> I was converted
[20:53:51] <Lunia> there was no other way
[20:53:54] <TheFlutterGuy> hell, i didn't even call myself a brony in this chatroom, for the first month or two i was in here.
[20:53:58] <TheFlutterGuy> hehe
[20:54:06] <TheFlutterGuy> for me it was just like. *Eh*, ponies, i like it.
[20:54:08] <Lunia> you are a brony
[20:54:12] <Lunia> you like it or not
[20:54:15] <TheFlutterGuy> i am now
[20:54:18] <Lunia> its too late for you
[20:54:23] <TheFlutterGuy> hm?
[20:54:30] <Lunia> licfer have you on his reservation list
[20:54:38] <Lunia> your soul will burn in ethernal flames
[20:54:38] <Electron> you have been assimilated
[20:54:42] <TheFlutterGuy> :3
[20:54:48] <TheFlutterGuy> well, the alternative is heaven.
[20:54:52] <TheFlutterGuy> and that like torment.
[20:55:14] <TheFlutterGuy> there is this sentence, that you can say. if you say it, you can NOT be forgiven. and per definition, can NOT go to heaven.
[20:55:21] <Lunia> and when the 8th trumpet sounds, all the bronies will enter the halls of lucifer and they will burn in forever lasting flames of gore
[20:55:28] <TheFlutterGuy> hitler didn't say it, so technically, he could have asked for forgivenes in his last breath, and go to heaven.
[20:55:30] <Lunia> its written in a bible
[20:55:36] <TheFlutterGuy> i've said it, so i can't. no matter what i do, from now on in. xD
[20:55:55] <Lunia> oh what is it?
[20:56:02] <TheFlutterGuy> you just have to deny the holy spirit.
[20:56:09] <TheFlutterGuy> but there is a specific quote.
[20:56:10] * TheFlutterGuy tries to find
