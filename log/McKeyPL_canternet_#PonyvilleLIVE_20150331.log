[13:43:07] <Electron> have you changed your time zone or something?
[13:43:15] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: DST
[13:43:27] <Electron> I remember I got 4 hours difference with ya
[13:43:46] <Electron> but you said about 13:37 and I got 16:43
[13:44:30] <Electron> all your neverending shortenings, TheFlutterGuy :|
[13:44:43] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: Daylight Savings Time
[13:44:49] <TheFlutterGuy> you got a problem with my TLA?
[13:44:55] <TheFlutterGuy> Atleast i'm not doing ETLA's
[13:45:28] <Electron> ↑ this
[13:46:04] <Electron> so now you became closer to me?
[13:46:10] <ArchPegasusMichael> [13:37] <Electron> kinda open forum for anonymous people
[13:46:34] <Electron> or my country retards again and do not anything about the time
[13:47:07] <ArchPegasusMichael> 1 hour difference between Poland and Moscow right now
[13:47:42] <Electron> this not tells me anything
[13:47:51] <Electron> I live not in Poland nor in Moscow
[13:49:14] * Electron eats a hamburger
[13:52:08] * ArchPegasusMichael вспомнил стих-пирожок из Абсурдопедии
[13:52:39] <Electron> how's your health, Michael?
[13:53:03] <ArchPegasusMichael> Pretty good
[13:53:28] <Electron> not affected by spring illness?
[13:54:02] <ArchPegasusMichael> Maybe a bit of anemia
[13:54:37] <Electron> umm...
[13:55:33] <Electron> low number of red bodies?
[13:56:00] <Electron> like a lack of oxygen for organs?
[13:56:34] <ArchPegasusMichael> RBC on the lowest norm
[13:56:57] <ArchPegasusMichael> and hemoglobins below the norm
[13:58:07] <Electron> how do you feel having such condition?
[14:00:51] <ArchPegasusMichael> Before I started taking iron a about a week ago, there was no day without weakness and some kind of blood's smell/taste in my nose and sinuses
[14:00:51] * Electron spills blood over MirSar's tail
[14:02:32] <Electron> blood smell in the nose
[14:02:51] <ArchPegasusMichael> Kinda.
[14:03:07] <Electron> probably blood rollability is not working properly
[14:04:16] <Electron> how iron is look like? pills?
[14:04:42] <ArchPegasusMichael> Pills, yeah
[14:05:21] <Electron> they say apples contain much iron
[14:05:31] <Electron> right?
[14:06:04] <ArchPegasusMichael> I bet meat does more ;d
[14:06:37] <Electron> beef, pork and chicken?
[14:07:32] <ArchPegasusMichael> Chicken - not much, I think
[14:08:49] <Electron> that's a problem if you need to eat meat but you are a vegetarian
[14:09:23] <TheFlutterGuy> vegetarians don't eat chicken
[14:09:49] <TheFlutterGuy> if you eat chicken or fish you aren't a vwgetsrisn. i don't know what you are. but you sre eating meat.
[14:10:03] <TheFlutterGuy> bah. phone keyboard for the suck.
[14:10:10] <ArchPegasusMichael> Swype?
[14:11:41] <TheFlutterGuy> no.
[14:12:12] * ArchPegasusMichael bought Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 (the wifi-only one) and uses Google keyboard
[14:12:35] <Electron> hehe, congratulations
[14:12:53] * TheFlutterGuy has no google on his phone, at all.
[14:13:07] <TheFlutterGuy> AOSP keyboard.
[14:15:40] <ArchPegasusMichael> Maybe I'll install CyanogenMod this year, right now there's a testing build available for this Tab
[14:17:47] <Electron> I remember you needed a new version of linux to distribute CPU load on video card or something
[14:17:54] <TheFlutterGuy> heh. yeah. i got pissed at cyanogenmod a year or so ago.
[14:18:21] <TheFlutterGuy> AOKP now. not as stable as i want it though.
[14:18:25] <ArchPegasusMichael> The stock OS with TouchWiz is pretty intuitive and has a basic multi-window function, but also isn't fast enough and has a couple of flaws
[14:18:50] <TheFlutterGuy> multiwindow is nice.

[14:26:03] <TheFlutterGuy> has everything you've told me been a lie? ;-;
[14:26:17] * TheFlutterGuy hugs Electron tightly, sobbikg into his mane.
[14:26:47] * Electron pets TheFlutterGuy: "there there"
[14:26:55] * TheFlutterGuy smiles weakly
[14:27:09] * TheFlutterGuy boobs Electrons flsnk 5 times
