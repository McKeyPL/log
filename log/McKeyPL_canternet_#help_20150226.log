[18:09:18] <cool110> I'm having problems with SSL handshake failures
[18:09:54] <Colgate> what does it say?
[18:10:08] <cool110> error:140940E5:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:ssl handshake failure
[18:10:57] <Colgate> you do not trust our CA, cacert, you will have to tell it to ignore cert errors or add cacert as a trusted CA
[18:12:39] <cool110> I do have cacert trusted since I use it for my own servers and those work
[18:14:03] <Colgate> wherever your client is looking for the cert, it isn't finding it
[18:16:00] <cool110> Hmm, when I don't send my client cert it does connect
[18:17:54] <Colgate> oh derp, I should read the right error code, that is a client cert issue
