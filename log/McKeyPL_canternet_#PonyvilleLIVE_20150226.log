[20:02:26] <MirSar> Not really, just restored some documents for a user who managed to delete stuff by "accident"
[20:03:06] <Lunia> I once deleted user private data
[20:03:11] <Lunia> she asked me to do this
[20:03:17] <Lunia> then she got very angry
[20:03:28] <TheFlutterGuy> xD
[20:03:30] <Lunia> and started talking to everyone that I deleted her files
[20:03:32] <Lunia> I said
[20:03:39] <Lunia> "AS you told me to"
[20:03:45] <Lunia> and then I left the room not giving the fuck

[20:51:30] <Lunia> is ddos'iing someone illegal ? >.>
[20:51:36] <TheFlutterGuy> yes
[20:51:40] <Lunia> aww
[20:51:55] <Lunia> I would really like to ddos one site :3
[20:51:58] <TheFlutterGuy> Depending on your target, it is doubtfull anyone would care.
[20:52:24] <Lunia> its an online tool that every techincian in my former job requires
[20:52:31] <Lunia> they need it
[20:52:53] <Xena> MirSar: it's not worth prison
[20:53:17] <Lunia> yes
[20:53:34] <TheFlutterGuy> bank... woudl care
[20:53:40] <Lunia> from the other site if you are going to prison you could as well kill some people xd
[20:53:42] <MirSar> Depending on how the script works, I'll never be detected
[20:53:46] <Lunia> in your country its not big of a deal
[20:53:52] <Lunia> TheFlutterGuy:  not bank
[20:53:55] <Lunia> IT company
[20:54:02] <MirSar> haha, Lunia, too true
[20:54:40] <Lunia> it could be a timer script that copies itself via main update server
[20:54:49] <Lunia> and it goes off randomly on diffrent machines
[20:55:06] <MirSar> Maybe I should just plant a bomb that doesn't blow unless I haven't resett the timer every 7 days :P
[20:55:23] <Lunia> not a good idea
[20:55:35] <TheFlutterGuy> sounds like a good idea
[20:55:40] <MirSar> Depends on how hidden I place it
[20:55:41] <Lunia> you would be easy to track down
[20:56:18] <Lunia> it would have to be a big bomb that creates lot of heat because you would like a 7day delay mechanism to incinirate  
[20:57:00] <MirSar> I actually had the perfect plan to plant a destructive script and make sure all my tracks are hidden. 
[20:57:22] <Lunia> MirSar:  make this script eject and retract DVD rooms
[20:57:27] <Lunia> endless loop
[20:57:34] <Lunia> :D
[20:57:58] <Lunia> or make their floppy drives sing the song
[20:58:16] <Lunia> people would be able to work but they would easly go nuts
[20:58:38] <Lunia> or a virus that turns off the heating and safe switch
[20:58:43] <Lunia> I mean cooling
[20:58:45] <MirSar> 1. "borrow" a machine that's unlocked (60% never locks their computer)
[20:58:45] <MirSar> 2. use their account to create a new user with admin permissions
[20:58:45] <MirSar> 3. Create a VM, sign on using the user, spread the script with a timer (1+ month + random variable)
[20:58:55] <Lunia> so machines overheat untill they catch fire
[20:59:19] <TheFlutterGuy> the printerdriver in linux has a flag. that says "printer has caught fire"
[20:59:28] <Lunia> lol
[20:59:38] <Lunia> "insert cat"
