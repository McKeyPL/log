[00:41:06] <RazorSharpFang> The only explanation that makes sense is that 0x43 isn't a valid hardware scan code.
[00:42:01] <Phase4> RazorSharpFang, are you checking for errors?
[00:42:21] <RazorSharpFang> You mean exceptions? No.

[22:54:41] <Moonlightning> That doesn't happen for me. :(
[22:55:18] <Kinsley> DataByte: it's an option in the local settings. I assume you're logged into Fimfiction?
[22:55:32] <DataByte> no, actually
[22:57:35] <Kinsley> Hmm. It's still in local settings, so you shouldn't need to be logged in.

[23:00:16] <Kinsley> That link *will* work
[23:00:43] <Kinsley> And yeah, it's a setting. Flip the switch on "Show interactive pony" and it'll go away as long as you save the setting.
