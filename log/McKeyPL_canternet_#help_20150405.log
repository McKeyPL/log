[18:57:50] <Ashley`> i have a question, can i get a vhost with my domain name (i can prove ownership)? i have reasons not to set revdns to it (only one ipv4 and ipv6, and i have some users, i don't want everyone to be @ashley.re, and i don't want to use @ashley.re on every irc network)
[18:58:06] <Shutter> Yes, you can. https://canternet.org/support#vhostpolicy
[18:59:24] <Ashley`> ooh okay

[20:22:26] <Eivel> hey, what's the command for passing channel owner to someone else?
[20:22:50] <Colgate> /chanserv flags #channel +F* otherperson
[20:23:18] <Colgate> that will give them owner, then you can do /chanserv flags -* yourname, to remove all of your flags
[20:23:42] <Colgate> /chanserv flags #channel -* yourname,
[20:24:23] <Eivel> What do I have to do, to stay hop? Give myself hop, then pass the owner and remove everything except the hop?
[20:25:06] <Colgate> /chanserv access #channel set yourname hop
[20:25:39] <Xena> it would be best to have the new founder give you halfop
[20:26:01] <Eivel> okay, thanks
[20:26:06] <Xena> otherwise you would need to look at the templates in chanserv and take away the comparison between your flagset and the halfop flagset
[20:27:56] <Colgate> /shrug, the way with access works as well
[20:35:34] <Xena> when you -*, it nukes access
[20:35:40] <Xena> access is a cheap shim around flags
[20:37:58] <Colgate> and I said to use /chanserv access instead when they said they wanted to keep hop
