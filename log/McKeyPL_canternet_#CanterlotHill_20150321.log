[00:04:35] <NightmareMoon> It was a series of stories of Pre-S2 Luna dealing with modern day stuff. Like Luna vs the Toaster.
[00:04:40] <NightmareMoon> Er, Microwave
[00:04:43] <Trixie_Lulamoon> lol.
[00:04:48] <Trixie_Lulamoon> cute
[00:04:54] <NightmareMoon> Hell, even I alluded to it at times in my stories.
[00:05:11] <NightmareMoon> We still have the author's blurb on the radio.
[00:05:19] <NightmareMoon> I can't remember his name, though...
[00:05:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> i hope the neighbours liek trance
[00:05:41] <NightmareMoon> God, I just want to sit down and cry. So many old memories.

[00:07:06] <TheAndyMac[NLR]> And that was just in the time between S2 and S3

[00:08:04] <Trixie_Lulamoon> "<@NightmareMoon> The fandom's nothing like it used to be back then." Um yeah. Nor is it music wise.
[00:08:06] <johnsey> !t spoiler

[00:08:26] <wobniaR> What's so different other than size?
[00:08:28] <Eywind> Pls Trixie_Lulamoon music is fine
[00:08:40] <Cloud_Zephyr> So i need dem cool lights, a new tweeter and some other stuffs

[00:08:57] *** WallFlower is now known as Nelly
[00:09:02] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Eh. Need more house and club tracks
[00:09:13] <Eywind> NightmareMoon yes, the 'newness' is definitely gone
[00:09:16] <wobniaR> You guys sure it's not nostalgia?
[00:09:18] <Eywind> and people have dispersed
[00:09:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> my audiophile gear is no longer audiophile :3
[00:09:23] <Eywind> but yeah a lot of it is nostalgia
[00:09:29] <TheAndyMac[NLR]> Maybe it's just thinking back to when the whole concept was new, and things were different to what I'd known before, but...

[00:10:15] <Eywind> wobniaR pls
[00:10:18] <Trixie_Lulamoon> The almost 1 year of no new pony kind of hurt things a lot. Cons also are the new cool thing :3
[00:10:27] <wobniaR> Also mainstream fandoms are sports, religion & politics
[00:10:39] <Cloud_Zephyr> Trixie_Lulamoon oh yus I found some old anjunabeats promo vinyls on ebay :3
[00:10:45] <Trixie_Lulamoon> sweet
[00:10:56] <Eywind> I think the increased content is the issue
[00:11:00] <TheAndyMac[NLR]> I don't know, this fandom just seems that much.../more/ so. Or seemed more so, at least
[00:11:13] <Eywind> well not 'issue', but 'reason'

[00:12:15] <Trixie_Lulamoon> For MLP Gen 5?
[00:12:19] <LocDogX86X> this fandom still needs more metal and reggae, more so on the Reggae

[00:17:34] <Cloud_Zephyr> The problem I noticed with brony music is that a lot of producers use the fandom to learn how to make music. Thus it isn't top tier. And once they are pros they leave the fandom (or stop making brony music)

[03:41:28] <wobniaR> Derpy is a bad role model and so are we
[03:41:30] <ryaxnb> side note: dinky and derpy being related is like the most tenuous fanon in existence
[03:41:48] <ryaxnb> "they look kinda similar, aside from different races and cutie marks!"
[03:41:52] <wobniaR> Too bad that fanon was broken, although they're all still background ponies
[03:41:53] <ryaxnb> "clearly related"
[03:42:01] <ryaxnb> it was never "broken"
[03:42:03] <Lunatic> mr and mrs cake make a unicorn and pegasus.
[03:42:21] <Lunatic> Where is your Faust now?
[03:42:30] <ryaxnb> it's true that derpy didn't sit with dinky at the sisterhooves social, but she could have more than one sister, or it could be another type of relationship
[03:42:35] <ryaxnb> mother, for instance.
[03:42:41] <ryaxnb> there's no other direct proof either way
[03:42:59] <wobniaR> Other than Dinky hanging out with another mare & stallion together in the background
[03:43:08] <ryaxnb> how often does that happen?
[03:43:17] <wobniaR> Once in all 4 seasons
[03:43:23] <ryaxnb> i just think the fanon will hang on to it forever
[03:43:36] <ryaxnb> no reason not to since the show will never focus on derpy enough to outright disprove it
[03:43:38] <Lunatic> fanon is fanon for a reason
[03:43:46] <ryaxnb> even though there's no way it's considered canon now
[03:44:19] *** Joins: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-u71ip5.internode.on.net)
[03:44:32] <ryaxnb> it's like octavia and vinyl being friends -- the show is unlikely to ever cover that scenario, and it's non-canon, and nothing suggests it whatsoever, but it could happen.
[03:44:43] <ryaxnb> so fanon will remain.

[21:45:40] <Lunatic> One-Trick, my brother recently did that and said it became one of his favorite games
[21:46:24] <Lunatic> M3reel, I am top 11% of xbox one players. What does that say about my competition...
[21:47:33] <One-Trick> i like the game, its just a bit clunky for my brain to handle when i gotta quick swap
[21:47:37] <DJmidli> Jesus. I found the original halo trailer in this hard drive.
[21:47:39] <One-Trick> especially when i have the camera
[21:47:43] <Lunatic> DJmidli, u wot

[21:49:05] <Lunatic> It's on the list of games I do want to play but I never have.
[21:49:25] <Lunatic> Same with all the half life games and a few others that people would hate me for
[21:49:46] <StrykerVylon> ?
[21:50:00] <One-Trick> i loved the half-life games a loooot
[21:50:12] <One-Trick> except the damn boats
[21:50:30] <Lunatic> I've heard they are amazing, but I know there is like 4 chapters and even more so now, I don't have the time to invest in it
