[15:20:28] <Pony_52955> hi 
[15:20:28] <Twili> there anyone here?...I think *Trots off to find a book*
[15:22:08] <Pony_52955> hi 
[15:23:04] <Pony_52955> brb
[15:28:45] <Pony_52955> any one here
[15:32:41] <Caerdwyn> Pony_52955: what is your issue?
[15:33:13] <Pony_52955> Closing Link: Glamor[113.203.252.178] (User has been permanently banned from ChatNet (Listed in ABUSEAT))
[15:33:48] <Pony_52955> just join mirc and this is i recieved
[15:33:49] <Caerdwyn> That sounds like that IP address was put in a DNS blacklist
[15:34:33] <Pony_52955> i dont know how to solve it 
[15:34:57] <Caerdwyn> You would have to file an appeal with that blacklist and see if they will remove it, or change your IP address.
[15:35:23] <Caerdwyn> Unfortunately, this channel is only for issues pertaining to this network, so we won't really be of much help :(
[15:35:23] <Pony_52955> i dont know how to to chnage ip 
[15:36:25] <Pony_52955> i just install mirc and band :(
[15:37:23] <Pony_52955> where i can get help regarding that ?
[15:38:57] <Caerdwyn> P Address 113.203.252.178 is listed in the CBL. It appears to be infected with a spam sending trojan, proxy or some other form of botnet.
[15:38:59] <Caerdwyn> It was last detected at 2015-05-03 16:00 GMT (+/- 30 minutes), approximately 1 days, 21 hours ago.
[15:39:01] <Caerdwyn> This IP is infected (or NATting for a computer that is infected) with the Conficker botnet.
[15:39:25] <Caerdwyn> It seems you have more of a problem then just your IP being blacklisted... I would run a virus scan on your computer.
[15:41:17] <Caerdwyn> Pony_52955: http://cbl.abuseat.org/removea.cgi?ip=113.203.252.178&timestamp=1430833195&hash=9a1622501e00437c3837c3a44e7ead85 <-- use this link to remove your IP from their blacklist, wait a few minutes, and try to reconnect again. If your computer actually IS infected though, they will just re-add you and KEEP you there.
[15:41:21] <Pony_52955> i have security essential and its updated i didnt received any massage regarding any virus from that 
[15:48:20] <Pony_52955> thanx for help Caerdwyn  
[15:48:27] <Pony_52955> thanx alot tc u All
[15:48:33] <Pony_52955> bbye
