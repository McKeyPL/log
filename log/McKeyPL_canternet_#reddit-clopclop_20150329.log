[11:39:19] <BaronBacon> thats great to hear :
[11:39:19] <Katphone> Should be asleep but I'm too queer for that
[11:39:21] <BaronBacon> :}
[11:39:39] <BaronBacon> i should be tired but im not
[11:39:56] <BaronBacon> i've had 5 hours sleep in the past 48 hours :/
[11:40:14] <Katphone> Huh, that's the opposite of me, I'm getting too much sleep
[11:40:36] <BaronBacon> how is that bad?
[11:42:19] <Katphone> Well, taking in to account that I believe it's a side effect of depression or some other possible mental illness and I have class in the mornings isn't too fun
[11:42:40] <BaronBacon> oh yeah i didnt think of that :/
[11:43:06] <Katphone> But I can't get in to the university's counseling services for another 2-3 weeks to see if there's something wrong or if I'm just being a lazy shithead

[11:43:56] <BaronBacon> i've been through all that, and i want to help others not go through it

[22:43:01] <Melon_Phone> one thing I hate about these new games is the loading
[22:43:29] <Melon_Phone> I spent the day downloading the game but now I hafta wait hours for the whole game to load before I can play 
[22:43:52] <Squirrelly> At least we don't have loading screens anymore, for the most part
[22:43:59] <weisey> jesus
[22:44:13] <Melon_Phone> yeah that's a pro 
[22:44:14] <thaostra> What's this about new games taking longer to load?
[22:44:21] <weisey> steam needs a "Activate Multiple keys" feature
[22:44:37] <Melon_Phone> I'm not talking about loading screens between levels and such 
[22:44:46] <Squirrelly> I know
[22:44:51] <Squirrelly> But I'm saying that that's a plu
[22:44:53] <Squirrelly> *plus
[22:45:01] <RubyPinch> I can't believe they got rid of the oauth key redeeming
[22:45:13] <weisey> yeah
[22:45:16] <weisey> that sucked
[22:45:24] <weisey> but not many people used it anyway
[22:45:36] <weisey> it was really only humblebumble that used it
[22:45:36] <Melon_Phone> it's a massive plus and I guess it's kinda one big loading screen once and never again
[22:45:57] <weisey> though i guess humblebumble is pretty dang big
[22:45:58] <Melon_Phone> I could play the first episode of hardline but then it kicked me out

[22:46:23] <thaostra> Melon_Phone, Are you referring to when you first start the game and the overworld is loading?
[22:46:28] <RubyPinch> I'd say humble probably deals with like, 50%+ of the keys used at any given time
[22:46:53] <Melon_Phone> it's the main menu loading screen 
[22:46:58] <Melon_Phone> I haven't started anything
[22:47:08] <RubyPinch> Melon_Phone: bloodborne?
[22:47:14] <Melon_Phone> hardline
[22:47:25] <thaostra> Would it be related to disk I/O speeds?
[22:47:29] <Melon_Phone> no
[22:47:40] *** Joins: ponder (Mibbit@Pony-nmm5lv.dynamic.simnet.is)
[22:47:41] <Melon_Phone> it's just downloading or installing the game
[22:48:04] <Melon_Phone> just shows a percentage under a Loading
[22:48:17] <Melon_Phone> gta did this too
[22:48:41] <Melon_Phone> one big load for like 3 hours and now it's less than 3 minutes 
[22:49:05] <ponder> I'D give you a big load in less than 3 minutes!
[22:49:06] <RubyPinch> ahh, crap/cache generation stuffs
[22:49:24] <Melon_Phone> RubyPinch did bloodborne do it too?
[22:49:40] <RubyPinch> nah, just been hearing some horrible things about BB's loading times
[22:49:55] <Melon_Phone> yeah there's a patch incoming to fix that
[22:50:03] <Frosty> I'm playing Blood Byorne right now, lol.
[22:50:19] <Melon_Phone> according to either r/bloodborne or r/ps4
[22:50:29] <Frosty> Yhere is a sinlge loading screen that takes a good bit of time, but you have to go through it all the time.
[22:51:00] <Melon_Phone> yeah I think the patch addresses that 
[22:51:12] <Melon_Phone> this is just a one time thing 
[22:51:21] <Melon_Phone> then it's super quick to load up 
[22:51:30] <Frosty> Hopefully. Although, it could've been eased significantly with a simple design chioce.
[22:51:54] <Melon_Phone> how do? 
[22:51:59] <Melon_Phone> so*
[22:52:28] <Melon_Phone> also, new 3ds xl is huge
[22:52:46] <Melon_Phone> and riddick pricy in iceland
[22:53:18] <Frosty> When you visit a lamp, you have to go to the Hunter's Dream to buy shit, level up, and reset both your checkpoint and the overworld. If they made you able to just reset the world and checkpoint at them, it's be way better.
[22:53:20] <ponder> I want one, tho
[22:53:22] <Melon_Phone> $350 or 47k isk 
[22:53:34] <ponder> I don't want an XL, tho
[22:53:34] <Melon_Phone> vs $200 in US 
[22:53:38] <ponder> Just a normal New 3DS
[22:53:38] <Melon_Phone> ^
[22:53:48] <Frosty> Buy it in the US and ship it over seas?
[22:53:50] <Melon_Phone> 40k isk
[22:54:03] <Melon_Phone> then I'd have to make a deal with the devil
[22:54:07] <Melon_Phone> aka Amazon 
[22:54:22] <Melon_Phone> last time I checked they don't ship here
[22:54:28] <Frosty> Why is that the devil?
[22:54:32] <Frosty> Oh
[22:54:54] <Melon_Phone> I know a guy who lives in the U.S. though 
[22:55:05] <Frosty> Me? :D
[22:55:13] <Melon_Phone> I could buy it, ship it to him and get him to ship it to me via post
[22:55:23] <Melon_Phone> yeah you! 
[22:55:46] <Melon_Phone> can't you spare a $200 for your crusty old uncle melon? 
[22:55:47] <Frosty> I could do that for you, WCS.
[22:56:24] <Melon_Phone> as swag as that sound I'll find a way 
[22:56:42] <RubyPinch> Melon_Phone: I've found that, while amazon doesn't ship electronics outside of US, some of the stores that sell through amazon sell internationally
[22:56:53] <Melon_Phone> whether it includes my mouth or my asshole
[22:57:11] <Melon_Phone> do you think Nintendo ships internationally? 
[22:57:23] <Melon_Phone> I don't wanna buy a used one
[22:57:26] <RubyPinch> ninty wouldn't
[22:57:26] <ponder> The 3ds is region locked.

[22:57:43] <ponder> Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
[22:57:55] <Melon_Phone> prick
[22:58:08] <ponder> Yes. Because I made them region locked.
[22:58:15] <Melon_Phone> would the euro version work here? 
[22:58:22] <ponder> yes
[22:58:28] <ponder> we're in the PAL region
[22:58:30] <Melon_Phone> it's got bigger tits and blonde hair though 
[22:58:44] <Melon_Phone> which ain't a bad thing
