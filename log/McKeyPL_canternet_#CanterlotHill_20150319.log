[12:38:56] <RandomNinja> no
[12:39:08] <Mike_Coltfield> Yes.
[12:39:53] <BerryPunch> That processor costs more than the amount I paid on building my computer...which was over $2,000, but keep in mind I rolled the price of two monitors, OS, gaming headset and mouse into that price
[12:39:55] <BerryPunch> oh and keyboard
[12:40:02] <BerryPunch> costs that people usually don't include in a price
[12:40:12] <RandomNinja> so like $1500?
[12:40:26] <BerryPunch> computer was probably about $1,600
[12:41:11] <BerryPunch> I went from an HP with an Athlon 3700+ to this thing back at the end of 2012
[12:41:16] <BerryPunch> needless to say, I was pretty happy
[12:41:45] <RandomNinja> yeah
[12:42:12] <BerryPunch> THat's not a fair comparison...I had an i3 laptop I sweet talked my parents into buying me to finish out college when that desktop wasn't able to run required software for my web design class
[12:42:20] <RandomNinja> I went Pentium 4/7800gtx -> i5 2500k/GTX460
[12:42:45] <BerryPunch> I went a bit more excessive... i7-2600k/GTX580
[12:43:16] <RandomNinja> yay
[12:43:21] <BerryPunch> I had been saving up for a while cause i was like...I don't wanna hold back much since my whole life I've been using computers way behind the curve
[12:43:37] <BerryPunch> even back in the StarCraft/Quake days, our home computer was a Pentium 120mhz
[12:43:44] <BerryPunch> when the gaming standard was 133mhz
[12:43:52] <RandomNinja> sounds horrible
[12:44:22] <BerryPunch> Yes, it was
[12:44:54] <BerryPunch> The AMD 3700+ wasn't really all that far behind the curve, but it was made by HP and limited by a bad PSU and a graphics card that was a bit behind, which had a fan die on it
[12:45:02] <BerryPunch> and PCI-Slot fans only helped a little
[12:45:19] <RandomNinja> yeah prebuilts are the worst
[12:45:28] <BerryPunch> yep :/
[12:46:11] <BerryPunch> and while I know I could've saved money on quite a few components in my current computer, the fact I'm still able to keep current 3 years later without swapping any components is making me happy
[12:46:47] <BerryPunch> hm. My computer's older than 3 years I thought. Maybe it was end of 2011 I built her
[12:47:21] <RandomNinja> I built mine for The Witcher 2 back at release
[12:47:27] <BerryPunch> nice
[12:47:45] <RandomNinja> totally worth it, that game was so good
[12:47:54] <BerryPunch> I still need to play it
[12:47:56] <RandomNinja> also surprisingly hard
[12:48:16] <BerryPunch> I just don't have much time to game anymore :/
[12:48:20] <RandomNinja> :/
[12:48:36] <RandomNinja> difficulty curve is weird
[12:49:07] <BerryPunch> I played the heck out of Mega Man Zero. I'm used to weird difficulty curves

[12:49:39] <RandomNinja> also hardest mode kills you from accidentally stepping through a fireplace once :V
[12:49:46] <BerryPunch> XD
[12:49:47] <BerryPunch> wow
[12:49:51] <RandomNinja> also, permadeath
[12:49:57] <RandomNinja> the game is about 40 hours
[12:49:59] <BerryPunch> I'm pretty sure if I stepped through a fireplace, I wouldn't be dead
[12:50:06] <BerryPunch> I may be in a hospital depending on the fire
[12:50:08] <BerryPunch> but not dead
[12:50:20] <RandomNinja> I mean, your clothes catch on fire and stuff, but yeah
[12:51:09] <RandomNinja> but yeah I love the fact that you can get killed in a cutscene 30 hours into the game on permadeath :P
[12:51:30] <BerryPunch> wow
[12:52:02] <BerryPunch> uggghh....I get Monster Hunter 4 soon
[12:52:10] <RandomNinja> yay, no free time
[12:52:14] <BerryPunch> And it looks like it may arrive tomorrow O_o
[12:52:17] <BerryPunch> I'll be gone D:
[12:52:25] * RandomNinja flails
[12:52:31] <BerryPunch> This shipped it 2-Day
[12:52:45] <BerryPunch> I had selected standard. Guess this guy on eBay was having a good evening
[12:53:25] <RandomNinja> he was drunk and accidentally sent it priority
[12:53:37] <BerryPunch> XD
[12:54:51] <RandomNinja> also go play Bioshock :P
[12:54:58] <BerryPunch> I"m excited. A friend of mine didn't know there was a collector's edition, so she just has the base game. The CE was sold out on GameStop's site when I was looking for a copy, and it was a no go. Amazon prices way too high. So she is under the impression this isn't happening. :3
[12:55:09] <BerryPunch> I played Bioshock Infinite. Does that count?
[12:55:11] <BerryPunch> That was a lot of fun
[12:55:17] <RandomNinja> the original is even better
[12:55:18] <BerryPunch> Gameplay got a bit...meh
[12:55:23] <BerryPunch> but I loved the world
[12:55:37] <RandomNinja> bioshock has never been a good FPS
[12:56:03] <RandomNinja> it's an average fps with amazing worldbuilding and story
[12:56:04] <BerryPunch> Yeah, I ntoiced back when I tried playing the first and hit boxes were all weird and such
[12:56:18] <BerryPunch> In hindsight, I shouldn't have bought it on a console
[12:56:25] <RandomNinja> well there's your problem
[12:56:25] <BerryPunch> I found it completely unplayable
[12:56:41] <BerryPunch> This was back when I had the AMD computer
[12:57:00] <BerryPunch> I tried running Bioshock on the bare minimum. I got a black screen that would sometimes flicker to what looked like water
[12:57:05] <BerryPunch> and I could hear dialogue
[12:57:13] <RandomNinja> but yeah if you liked how Infinite handled story and stuff you'll love the orignal as well
[12:57:19] <RandomNinja> also, Burial at Sea <3
[12:57:20] <BerryPunch> I think this was just a demo or freind's copy cause I didn't own it on the computer...
[12:57:45] <RandomNinja> playing games you don't own? Who would do such a thing?
[12:57:46] <RandomNinja> <.<
[12:58:01] <BerryPunch> I'm pretty sure it was a demo
[12:58:11] <BerryPunch> Cause you know...those once upon a time were an actual thing
[12:58:17] <RandomNinja> yeah
[12:58:40] <RandomNinja> back in my day and whatnot
[12:59:31] <RandomNinja> then they realized that people wouldn't buy their mediocre games if they got to try them first
[13:00:01] <RandomNinja> bleh, I hate hype marketing
[13:00:16] <BerryPunch> yeah...
[13:00:44] <BerryPunch> I feel like the F2P model also isn't nearly as good today. I'm not sure if that's nostalgia or what
[13:00:55] <BerryPunch> but man...Counter-Strike absorbed so much of my time back in the day
[13:01:03] <RandomNinja> was CS free?
[13:01:09] <BerryPunch> yep
[13:01:14] <BerryPunch> though it may have required Half-Life
[13:01:17] <RandomNinja> 1.5?
[13:01:21] <BerryPunch> yeah
[13:01:26] <BerryPunch> but all mods were free back then
[13:01:35] <BerryPunch> CS, Day of Defeat, Natural Selection, hmm....what else had I played....
[13:01:35] <RandomNinja> yeah that was a bit before my time, I started at 1.6
[13:01:45] <ThunderBolt> https://vine.co/v/Oxjdz1IU1Lr
[13:01:51] <Flurshy> right so
[13:02:09] <RandomNinja> ThunderBolt, looks like the beginning of an infomercial
[13:02:13] <Flurshy> the tech news circuit right now has a rumor that the Lg G4 will have a 5.6" screen
[13:02:28] <Flurshy> meanwhile there is another rumor saying the G4 Note will have a 5.8" screen
[13:02:29] <ThunderBolt> RandomNinja, then it turns deadly
[13:02:33] <BerryPunch> I'm pretty sure Tribes was free to play
[13:02:45] <Flurshy> they can't both be right xP

[13:04:03] <BerryPunch> I'm sad about the new UT
[13:04:15] <BerryPunch> It's so glitchy. I know it's a beta, but I'm used to alpha builds being more stable these days
[13:04:23] <RandomNinja> filming these things must be hilarious http://i.imgur.com/c9Ups.gif
[13:04:31] <BerryPunch> I still have not been able to successfully connect to a server and play the game
[13:04:39] <BerryPunch> the only times I get in, the game lags so much and won't do anythin
[13:04:41] <RandomNinja> boo
[13:04:46] <Rylius> Huh? UT seemed fine last week for me 
[13:04:49] <BerryPunch> I can do their single player tutorials all day though
[13:04:52] <BerryPunch> I haven't tried in a week
[13:05:09] <Rylius> UI was a little glitchy though 
[13:05:16] <RandomNinja> hopefully that's just because they haven't really gotten started with the multiplayer functionality yet

[20:52:29] <Derpyhut> on purpose
[20:52:51] <Derpyhut> what kind of obscure interests?
[20:52:58] <RandomNinja> it's mostly that when you like entirely different things, you don't really connect

[21:02:06] <ThunderBolt> but i cant :(
[21:02:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> I liked Imagine Dragons before they were cool
[21:02:14] <EM-C> I'm a 57 year old who has no friends and is weak as b... as that word.
[21:02:16] <Derpyhut> that would be so cool
[21:02:19] <Eywind> ThunderBolt just make sure to take their hazmat suit
[21:02:21] <Eywind> buttah
[21:02:25] <RandomNinja> Derpyhut, step one: talk to people IRL. Step two: start lifting
[21:02:40] * thereallynewmop12100_ is still not weak 
[21:02:42] <Eywind> EM-C to be fair a lot of us have made poor physical decisions
[21:02:43] <Derpyhut> no lifting for me
[21:02:50] * ThunderBolt is gonna steal ther dragon
[21:02:52] <ThunderBolt> :D
[21:02:52] <EM-C> I have no people in real life to talk to.  Plus I have severe social phobias.
[21:03:00] <RandomNinja> thereallynewmop12100_, oh yeah how much do you deadlift? :P
[21:03:03] <Cloud_Zephyr> im an awkward 16 year old who has friends but could have more
[21:03:05] <Eywind> (you've just had more time to make them)
[21:03:12] <EM-C> I'm just that one point in time where everything bad happened at once.
[21:03:14] <ThunderBolt> what like speakaphobia EM-C?
[21:03:20] <Eywind> bro if you don't have massive gains ur weak
[21:03:26] <ThunderBolt> speakaphobia - fear of speaking
[21:03:26] <RandomNinja> also a skrub ^
[21:03:30] <EM-C> No, I hide behind the mask of a clown and hate myself for it.
[21:03:35] <Derpyhut> i have a small group of brony friends that i eat lunch with
[21:03:44] <thereallynewmop12100_> So. is the requests for the songcast is open? 
[21:03:50] <EM-C> And I've always talked and talked and talked to keep the other person from saying something that would hurt me.
[21:03:58] <Eywind> thereallynewmop12100_ it'll probably be an hour later
[21:03:58] <EM-C> I have agoraphobia.
[21:04:07] <Eywind> cuz the euro people suck and don't want to embrace the best time zone (EST)
[21:04:21] <Derpyhut> this is depressing can we change the subject

[21:04:31] <EM-C> And a lot of people have wanted to hurt me in my life, for reasons I have never understood.
[21:04:43] <ThunderBolt> Smoke + Mirrors is my fave album of all time
[21:04:46] <Eywind> thereallynewmop12100_ okay idk
[21:04:57] <Derpyhut> i get hurt cuz im little and weak
[21:05:24] <Derpyhut> yep

[21:06:03] <Eywind> you didn't work out well and you continued to have a poor diet
[21:06:07] <Eywind> those are definitely decisions
[21:06:13] <EM-C> I didn't decide to be this way.  I wish people could understand.
[21:06:23] <Eywind> which, if it's anything like my issues, is due to poor self-control
[21:06:25] <ThunderBolt> RandomNinja, I Bet my life on you!

[21:06:54] <RandomNinja> oh lel
[21:07:00] <EM-C> Eywind: according to the book my sister gave us, Aspies have peculiar eating habits.  That would make it part and parcel of our different brain wiring.
[21:07:03] <Eywind> you can think whatever you want, but if you're just saying that everything bad that's happened to you wasn't your fault it means you can't do anything about it
[21:07:10] <Eywind> Aspergers is a reason, not an excuse.
[21:07:23] <Eywind> It explains something, but certainly isn't what caused all of the issues in your life
[21:07:34] <EM-C> It explains a great deal of them.
[21:08:16] <Eywind> and that's why nothing will get better :)

[21:10:00] <EM-C> Well, my counselor has started badgering me about my weight now.  And she wants my mother to come along next week so the two of them can gang up on me.
[21:10:09] <Eywind> that's probably a good thing

[21:10:19] <Eywind> you're still young enough that you can take steps to get to a more tolerable physical state
