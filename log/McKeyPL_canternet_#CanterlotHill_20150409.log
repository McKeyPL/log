[07:30:29] <Jokerboxer> Yo.
[07:30:51] <Glowing_Whooves> whatcha up to?
[07:31:35] <Jokerboxer> Watching a Youtube. I got back from watching a movie and shopping. What are you up to?
[07:33:02] <Glowing_Whooves> Nice! What movie? I just finished inking my first ever scene complete with backgrounds and the whatnots
[07:33:31] <Jokerboxer> Big Hero 6. I love art. is this a commission?
[07:34:29] <Glowing_Whooves> Nah, I do take commissions, but this was for fun :3
[07:34:43] <Jokerboxer> What is it about?
[07:35:53] <Glowing_Whooves> it's a Fallout: Equestria piece, featuring Littlepip looking into a memory orb ontop of a cliff above the clouds. It's a scene that really stuck in my head, so I wanted to do my best to bring it to life ^-^

[07:36:52] <Glowing_Whooves> I'm still very amateurish, I only started drawing back in November
[07:37:38] <Jokerboxer> How many layers are you going to use? Wait, this is traditional. Well, fancy that. Good on ya, mate.
[07:39:08] <Glowing_Whooves> Thanks! Nothing quite like the feels of Pencil on paper!
[07:40:03] * Jokerboxer nods.
[07:40:35] <Chaotic_Harmony> Oh nice Glowing
[07:40:46] <Chaotic_Harmony> I tried traditional but I can't get the hang of it
[07:40:53] <Chaotic_Harmony> I like being able to delete bad lines :P
[07:41:10] <Jokerboxer> You should try using circles. Ponies are mostly circles so they are actually easy to draw. 3 circles: Flank, chest, and head.
[07:41:23] <Chaotic_Harmony> Jokerboxer:  I also SUCK at using guides

[07:45:16] <Glowing_Whooves> Thanks Joker, I just made sure to use the lightest pencil I own (a 2H) and used an expensive eraser
[07:45:55] <Jokerboxer> Good on ya for being prepaired.
[07:46:24] <Glowing_Whooves> ^-^;
[07:46:51] <Glowing_Whooves> My celestia drawing is probably still my favourite as it was my first ever completed drawing
[07:47:04] <Glowing_Whooves> even if the erasing job isn't as good :P

[22:29:37] <EM-C> Why do they keep calling it the 79th Masters?  Isn't it the 81st?
[22:29:43] <Galst> ?
[22:29:51] <Galst> Explain good sir.
[22:30:25] <EM-C> The Masters began in 1934, though it didn't get the name "The Masters" until 1939.  But they've always numbered it from 1934.
[22:30:28] * thereallynewmop12100_ hacks Cloud_Zephyr's DJ Show with a trippy music video 
[22:30:33] <Cloud_Zephyr> nuuu
[22:30:33] <EM-C> That means it should be the 81st, right?
[22:30:42] <EM-C> Since it skipped 1943.
[22:30:53] <Araxnus> Ouch
[22:31:09] <Galst> nice xD
[22:31:19] <Galst> I might just have to use that one ;)

[22:34:00] <Galst> I know what you mean Inu
[22:34:09] <Inucroft[NLR]> yup
[22:34:15] <Inucroft[NLR]> shame my fic isn;t the one i'm ref to XD
[22:34:23] <Galst> Or when you learn that a Manga you are reading has been written over the course of 11 years.
[22:34:33] <WindBreaker> It's a little odd that MLP names can look a lot like general online pseudonyms if you look at them the right way.
[22:34:52] <Inucroft[NLR]> Galst aye, mind some i've been following has bene writien for over 20yrs and still going
[22:34:54] <WindBreaker> @Galst Remember Berserk?
[22:35:04] <Inucroft[NLR]> still going~
[22:35:08] <WindBreaker> It went through a long period of few updated.
[22:35:10] <Inucroft[NLR]> the manga is still going!
[22:35:22] <WindBreaker> nearly a decade on a damned boat.
[22:35:27] <Galst> No sorry Wind.
[22:35:28] <WindBreaker> Namek's got nothing on that.
[22:35:35] <Galst> Might have to check it out sometime.
[22:36:16] <WindBreaker>  It's good. The first volume or two isn't the best drawn (though it's still better than what attack on titan started with), but it grows to have some of the best art in mangas today.
[22:36:16] <Galst> soooo.. NLR or SE? *Kappa Face*
[22:36:39] <WindBreaker> Everyone has realistic unique characterful faces and armour. Even the nameless background characters!
