[00:55:54] <Starthunder> Encryption requires the relevant key or cryptanalysis to reverse. Encoding only requires knowledge of the protocol to reverse.

[06:14:55] <Starthunder> That made me think of systemd

[06:15:13] <Fillyfeathers> I must be the only sysadmin alive who actually appreciates windows
[06:15:21] <Phase4> AppleDash, via group policy you can 'disable' it, but it's still there, still shows the icon in explorer
[06:15:31] <AppleDash> I don't care about an icon
[06:15:34] <Phase4> i do
[06:15:48] <AppleDash> Write your own file explorer than and replace explorer.exe with t
[06:15:49] <AppleDash> it*

[06:16:00] <Phase4> people have done that, that's pretty much what 'classic shell' is
[06:16:15] <Phase4> but microsoft is on the path to fixing that particular problem
[06:16:17] <Fillyfeathers> put tape over your monitor where the icon is

[06:16:38] <Phase4> Fillyfeathers, i can appreciate what windows does, and why it's successful, that doesn't make me hate it any less

[06:26:07] <JustAberrant> I gotta imagine the old microsoft that left a trail of corpses and burning bodies behind them
[06:26:12] <Phase4> though i'll reserve further comments until 10 is done, they've been acting strange recently

[06:27:21] <Fillyfeathers> "nothing is real, everything is code, the decimal system should start from zero"
[06:27:22] <JustAberrant> but seriously, microsoft of past was all about not winning through better products, but winning through momentum, lockout, and just generally throwing their weight around
[06:27:40] <Phase4> they purchased the majority of their 'innovations'
[06:27:50] <Colgate> what's wrong with icq? :O

[06:28:34] <JustAberrant> any time they do anything that appears to be good, like open sourcing .NET .. I immediately assume it's a trap

[06:30:07] <JustAberrant> they just bought it, and added brilliant microsoft innovations.. like you know.. the chaos bar
[06:30:35] <Phase4> Fillyfeathers, clearly we should count in multiples of pi
[06:30:59] <JustAberrant> I'm reasonably sure they spent a great deal of time figuring out what features people tended to use in based on what they were doing and created appropriate and sane groups so that all those shortcuts would be on the same.. ribbon page dealie..

[06:33:47] <JustAberrant> see that's where they get you
[06:34:00] <JustAberrant> you don't even realize it, but you go down that road and start installing bits of microsoft to supported
[06:34:15] <JustAberrant> cause of course you need a domain, and active directory.. and god knows what else.. to use it sanely
[06:34:30] * Phase4 needs a domain set up at work soon

[06:34:59] <Starthunder> …doesn't OS X use AD, too?
[06:35:07] <Phase4> most things can be AD clients
[06:35:16] <JustAberrant> stop being pragmatic!
[06:35:26] <Phase4> ^ is where stallman and i differ :P
[06:35:33] <JustAberrant> hehe
[06:35:47] <JustAberrant> kidding aside, I consider myself reasonably pragmatic
[06:36:06] <JustAberrant> end of the day, I do tend to go with what works most of the time, with a few exceptions
[06:36:40] <JustAberrant> I prefer open source, but I'll pay for something proprietary if it does the job better
[06:37:04] <JustAberrant> biggest exception to my pragmatism is probably apple
[06:37:26] <JustAberrant> I pretty much refuse to involve myself at all with apple.. I don't even consider technical merit
[06:37:31] <JustAberrant> I just don't like `em
[06:37:39] <Phase4> i'd be more willing to pay for software if the majority of it wasn't utterly trivial dressed up with mountians of marketing
[06:37:56] <JustAberrant> hehe, yes
[06:37:58] <Phase4> for example, running a normal windows program as a service
[06:38:20] <Starthunder> isn't software as a service like those horrible DRMed things?
[06:38:30] <Phase4> as a windows service
[06:38:34] <Starthunder> Oh.

[06:38:53] <JustAberrant> completely random: I.. actually don't mind the whole hptoshop subscription thing
[06:38:56] <JustAberrant> * photoshop
[06:39:43] <Phase4> there was a great example of exactly that as a mountian of code, can't seem to find it
[06:40:01] <Phase4> would send emails and store your shopping list, stupidly complicated
[06:40:13] <Phase4> ended up writing my own https://github.com/ariscop/srvany
[06:40:14] <PinkiePieBot> [ ariscop/srvany · GitHub ]
[06:41:17] <JustAberrant> but yeah: photoshop, visio, IDA, and a handful of other tools are actually worth the money
[06:41:29] <Phase4> IDA works nicely under wine
[06:41:55] <Phase4> is a linux version but it's actually a little better in wine
[06:42:05] <JustAberrant> hehe
[06:42:39] <JustAberrant> same goes with libraries
[06:43:22] <JustAberrant> stuff like vega prime (3D modeling/simulated environment thing) is obscenely expensive.. but it works
[06:43:52] <JustAberrant> but then theres stuff like solid db, which is stupidly overpriced and performs _worse_ than open source alternatives
[06:44:50] <Starthunder> >.>
[06:44:59] <Phase4> JustAberrant, i can kinda buy that argument, but blender exists, and maybe its interface isn't the best (only complaint i've heard about it) but it is still a fully featured domain-specific product
[06:45:17] <JustAberrant> vega prime is more of an engine
[06:45:29] <Phase4> i think we could sustain most code as open source
[06:45:52] <JustAberrant> and it has a lot of off the stuff shelf stuff that you just plug in and it works
[06:45:52] <Phase4> considering what is sustained now, with a tiny fraction of the total money in software
[06:46:31] <JustAberrant> so you spend like 300k or so on a license.. but you would have spent way more building it in house yourself and probably end up with a shittier product
[06:48:48] *** Starburn is now known as CardboardBox
[06:49:32] <Phase4> JustAberrant, solidDB sounds like an expensive sqlite
[06:49:37] <Starthunder> shellstuff sells stuff by the shellshelf.
[06:49:44] <JustAberrant> it is, only it's less reliable
[06:49:53] <JustAberrant> and a much bigger pain to deal with
[06:50:07] * Phase4 isn't quite sure why you would use anything other than sqlite
[06:50:31] <JustAberrant> because solid db comes from ibm
[06:50:45] <JustAberrant> and ibm are absolute masters in the art of the buzzword

[06:54:10] <JustAberrant> mysql is _full_ of gotchas
[06:54:20] <Phase4> yeah, datetime was the thing that made me switch
[06:54:38] <Phase4> no one seems to get date time right, at all, anywhere
[06:54:38] <Starthunder> Really? Is that accurate?
[06:54:53] <JustAberrant> postgres is really damn solid
[06:54:59] <Phase4> it is
[06:55:00] <JustAberrant> has enough bells and whistles
[06:55:08] <JustAberrant> and is reasonably simple to use
[06:55:14] <Phase4> plethora of types, very clever query planner
[06:55:19] <JustAberrant> not mysql simple.. but way simpler than oracle
[06:55:24] <Phase4> native json support
[06:55:38] <Phase4> and xml, which everything except mysql seems to have
[06:56:04] <JustAberrant> for a fairly long time, mysql couldn't even do transactions well
[06:56:20] <Phase4> Starthunder, first thing to know if you want to use postgress, what mysql calls a database, the sql standard and postgres call a schema
[06:56:24] <JustAberrant> there were a number of edge cases you had to deal with where it could outright fail
[06:56:47] <Phase4> different databases in postgres are isolated
[06:56:56] <JustAberrant> mysql does get credit for making databases warm and fuzzy and really simple 
[06:57:00] <Phase4> and the server is a 'cluster', that can host many databases
[06:57:07] *** Quits: LightningCrash (lightning@property.of.moonlightning) (Quit: The Nightmares will collide. And become a dream. <3)
[06:57:42] <JustAberrant> mysql has a really simple authentication system (compared to postgres which is flexible but a bit confusing initially).. and yeah, uses really simple terminology and fewer levels of seperation
[06:57:50] <JustAberrant> you've got databases and they have tables.. all you need to know
[06:58:10] <JustAberrant> you've got users and they've got privileges on those databases.. etc
[06:58:13] <Phase4> Starthunder, also *everything* in postgres is transactional, including schema changes (you can revert a DROP TABLE), and there's no replication gotchas
[06:58:15] <Starthunder> I hardly know anything abotu databases
[06:58:24] <Starthunder> Ooh? That sounds kinda nice o.o
[06:58:42] <Phase4> it is very nice
[06:58:51] <JustAberrant> mysql also has weird stuff.. like dunno if it's still the case.. but the check constraint wasn't actually implemented
[06:59:01] <JustAberrant> like.. it was in the spec, and you could apply one
[06:59:05] <JustAberrant> but it wouldn't actually do anything
[06:59:31] <Phase4> check constraint is parsed, not implemented, you *could* use triggers to implement it but the default settings can lead to inconsistency accross a replication set if you do that
[06:59:42] <Phase4> postgres though works nicely
[07:00:03] <Starthunder> huh.
[07:00:11] <Phase4> the one thing you can't do in postgres that mysql can is an upsert
[07:00:18] <JustAberrant> but yeah, mysql is loaded with that kind of bullshit
[07:00:51] <Starthunder> upsert?
[07:00:59] <JustAberrant> update or insert
[07:01:06] <JustAberrant> admittedly very useful, but non-standard :(
[07:01:15] <Starthunder> Awh
[07:01:22] * JustAberrant tries to avoid using blatantly non-standard stuff like that :(
[07:01:39] <Phase4> isn't it standard?
[07:01:59] <JustAberrant> I didn't think so
[07:02:03] <Phase4> either way it is something postgres plans to implement eventually, very useful for statistics, but doesn't yet implement
[07:02:08] <JustAberrant> I.. actually you know I don't know how the sql standard is maintained
[07:02:20] <Phase4> with fire and brimstone
[07:02:21] <JustAberrant> like, I always assume there was some group like OMG managing it
[07:02:30] <JustAberrant> but I've never heard of the "sql committee" putting out anything
[07:02:56] <JustAberrant> is there even an actual standard?

[07:03:02] <PinkiePieBot> [ MySQL Bugs: #68656: ORDER BY ignored in some situations for UPDATE query ]
[07:03:10] <Phase4> JustAberrant, there is some kind of standard, somewhere
[07:03:24] <JustAberrant> sign of a good standard: you can't actually find it
[07:03:28] <Phase4> also yeah, in mysql you can ORDER BY and LIMIT an UPDATE
[07:03:41] <JustAberrant> hehehe
[07:03:49] <Phase4> which leads to data inconsistency
[07:03:59] <Phase4> mysql considers this a non-trivial bug
[07:04:05] <Phase4> non-critical'
[07:04:34] <Starthunder> …wait, what?
[07:05:06] <JustAberrant> basically mysql is ok for wobsites and small stuff.. but yeah.. I wouldn't trust it for anything sizable
[07:05:27] <Phase4> Starthunder, linked the bug before, there's a blog post on kickstarter about it, they hit the bug apparently
[07:05:35] <JustAberrant> especially when postgres is just (actually more) as free.. and like a billion times better
[07:05:44] <Phase4> inconsistency in a replication set is a big no-no
[07:06:12] <JustAberrant> if you're doing something complicated like a cluster, the ease of use of mysql shouldn't be a concern over the only slightly harder to use postgres
[07:06:14] <Phase4> JustAberrant, and implements foreign keys
[07:06:20] <JustAberrant> so why not just use postgres and not have to deal with all the bs
[07:06:59] <Phase4> MyISAM doesn't do foreign keys, which seems like something you kinda expect in a Relation database

[07:09:04] <JustAberrant> yeah, though if you're just modifying your schema n a production system .. probably bad anyway
[07:09:27] <Phase4> you need to change schema sometimes
[07:10:18] <JustAberrant> I suppose, and I guess sometimes you can't just take it down for maintenance
[07:10:40] * JustAberrant never worked in that kind of environment to be honest
[07:10:55] <Phase4> even if you do take it down, transactional schema changes means you can just ROLLBACK if there's a problem

[07:15:03] <Twilightlicious> i dunno, it sounds like the image is never modified
[07:15:28] <Twilightlicious> plus due to the image being compressed, that would be difficult/impossible
[07:16:03] <Phase4> Starthunder, they can be, postgres has a method of undoing transactions but it requires a bit of infrastructure, it's not something you can do in SQL
[07:16:33] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, i think you can 'layer' WIM files, not to clear on how it works

[07:37:20] <Phase4> though with WIM instead of squashfs
[07:37:29] <mniip> that's what I was referring to
[07:38:01] <Phase4> not really re-inventing though, it's building their own wheel after everyones had their own for years
[07:39:14] <firestream> anyone want to reinstall and re raid my server xD it kind of died a bad death
[07:39:21] <mniip> I seriously wonder why does microsoft keep coming up with proprietary standards and formats
[07:39:56] <Starthunder> Because they have their little vicious cycle and… :/
[07:40:15] <Phase4> mniip, WIM sorta makes sense, i'm not aware of any other archive that can store windows acl's
[07:40:30] <mniip> windows whatnow
[07:40:40] <Phase4> filesystem permissions
[07:40:40] *** Parts: MistVeil (AndChat3408@Pony-apm.8f9.211.189.IP) ("Leaving")
[07:41:24] <mniip> something like selinux?
[07:41:30] <firestream> I hate windows its on my gaming system but for eveything eles i use  Luinux then mac
[07:41:46] <Phase4> mniip, selinux is mandatory access control, != filesystem permissions
[07:43:31] <Phase4> i can't explain windows acl behaviour because it's not documented, there's a partial implementation in wine-staging, it's still being reverse-engineered
[07:46:00] <Twilightlicious> I don't think they're allowed to profit from using open source software, but i could be wrong.
[07:46:05] <Twilightlicious> So there's your reason why :P
[07:46:34] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, you're allowed to profit as much as you please, most licences are concerned primarily with keeping the code open
[07:46:42] <Starthunder> Aha.
[07:46:50] <Starthunder> They want to keep it closedsource
[07:47:00] <Phase4> though wanting to keep it closed is part of it
[07:47:17] <Twilightlicious> Actually Microsoft said they're thinking of opening a lot of their source. But, this could have just been said to win some people over.
[07:48:38] <Phase4> they have been opening a bunch of code, most of it .net that mono already had implemented ages ago
[07:51:32] <Phase4> mniip, i did read a thing once about why, and the argument consisted entirely of "we don't know if we're gonna get sued for using it"
[07:51:35] <Twilightlicious> “If you open source something but it comes with a build system that takes rocket scientists and three months to set up, what’s the point?”
[07:51:50] <firestream> well fuck steam right now
[07:51:50] <Phase4> they called it 'code pedigree' in the document
[07:51:59] <firestream> letting modders chage for mods
[07:52:02] <Phase4> the paid mods thing?
[07:52:13] <firestream> eeyup
[07:52:34] <firestream> a freind of mine had his mod stolen off anther website and someone uploaded it to steam and made money from it
[07:52:41] * Phase4 expects to be hearing about that for a while
[07:52:42] <firestream> and steam won't do crap unless said friend gets a layer
[07:52:59] <firestream> lawers * spelling ... i can't spell * ugh
[07:54:35] <Phase4> firestream, he could just put it up himself for free
[07:55:06] <Phase4> not that it excuses anyone elses actions, but it's an option
[07:55:40] <firestream> he does have it free on nexxus not steam :S

[07:55:48] <mniip> I have windows 2000 source over here
[07:55:51] <Twilightlicious> A Microsoft statement :P
[07:56:09] * Phase4 is actually quite sick of windows source leaks
[07:56:21] <Phase4> every time you google for some obscure piece of windows api, leaks everywhere
[07:56:24] <firestream> last time i loved windows was ME'
[07:56:33] <mniip> Phase4, sick of th leaks or of the code that you find inside
[07:56:33] <Twilightlicious> Haha, you loved windows
[07:56:39] <firestream> i was a kid then
[07:56:40] * Twilightlicious laughs like Nelson on The Simpsons
[07:56:41] <firestream> xD
[07:56:56] <firestream> when did me come out 1999? 
[07:56:59] <Phase4> mniip, well i'm usually doing it to fix something in wine
[07:57:18] <Twilightlicious> How am i supposed to know when you came out >3> (I JOKE <3)
[07:57:26] <firestream> i was like 10 lol
[07:57:37] <firestream> had dialup so linux was a pita to download
[07:57:56] <Twilightlicious> There was DSL (The Linux distro, not the internet connection)
[07:58:00] <Twilightlicious> it was only like 30MB
[07:58:06] <firestream> i had dialup then 
[07:58:09] <Twilightlicious> so it only took like an hour
[07:58:17] <Twilightlicious> i did too lol
[07:58:17] <firestream> when i had to get on late atnight 
[07:58:27] <mniip> lol
[07:58:28] <firestream> thing is it was a stolen dialup pass/id
[07:58:30] <Twilightlicious> I had dial up until like 2005
[07:58:31] <firestream> of a dead guy xD
[07:58:35] <Phase4> it is kinda hard to distribute binaries over dialup
[07:58:35] <mniip> opened a random file in 2000 source
[07:58:37] <mniip>     szC[0]='C'; szC[1]='r'; szC[2]='e'; szC[3]='d'; szC[4]='i';
[07:58:37] <mniip>     szC[5]='t'; szC[6]='s'; szC[7]=0;
[07:59:02] <Phase4> mniip, oi, stahp
[07:59:16] <firestream> now i use Linux  for daily > hackentosh for video/pic/music  > win for gaming
[08:00:01] <Twilightlicious> Windows for all the things > Android for all of the (mobile) things
[08:00:04] <mniip>         FUNCTION:       UnescapeAmpersands
[08:00:04] <mniip>         PURPOSE:    Opposite of EscapeAmpersands.  (Isn't Windows fun?)
[08:00:16] <mniip> that was literally in a comment
[08:00:50] <Phase4> mniip, two favorite bits of windows behaviour: CreateFile, and the cmd parser
[08:00:59] <firestream> its like there never will be a windows x.9 because of old code
[08:01:09] <Phase4> wine has fairly complete implementations of those
[08:01:22] <mniip> Phase4, I know about cmd, but what's with CreateFile
[08:02:06] <firestream> i think its time for me to try to make a crack for xsplit v2 :S as there is none
[08:02:57] <Phase4> mniip, it maps to NtCreateFile, NtOpenFile, NtCreatePipe, NtOpenPipe, (several other primitives here), and several 'special' names that produce handles that aren't actually handles
[08:03:28] <Phase4> mniip, also HANDLE on windows can be things that aren't handles
[08:03:42] <mniip> so like sys_read then
[08:04:10] <mniip> (there are so many options to what code path would sys_read take)
[08:04:13] <Phase4> mniip, not really, sys_read is generic
[08:04:35] <Phase4> iirc descriptors have an associated struct fdops
[08:04:46] <Phase4> it's one consistent interface
[08:05:00] <Phase4> CreateFile ties together a plethora of incompatible, inconsistent interfaces
[08:05:10] <Phase4> as does ReadFile and WriteFile
[08:05:38] <mniip> I don't think descriptors have anything themselves
[08:05:44] <Phase4> and the returned HANDLE is not a generic thing that you can pass to, say, WaitForMultipleObjects
[08:05:51] <mniip> but they do store a pointer to the host filesysem
[08:06:00] <mniip> which does have a struct defining all the methods
[08:06:01] <Phase4> sometimes it is, but not everything can
[08:06:13] <Phase4> mniip, yeah, fdops, which may or may not opperate on a file
[08:06:33] <mniip> I have very little knowledge of the windows api
[08:06:38] <mniip> what is even a HANDLE
[08:07:10] <Phase4> it's the 'windows equivalent of a file descriptor' though the semantics are subtly different in important ways
[08:07:21] <Phase4> that is, if you've actually been given a kernel handle
[08:07:31] <Phase4> many windows handles exist only in userspace
[08:07:32] *** Quits: Skids (ejd@Pony-aaa.lna.79.74.IP) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[08:08:51] <mniip> Phase4, what is it typedef'd to
[08:08:58] <Phase4> mniip, pointer
[08:09:05] <mniip> some struct pointer?
[08:09:15] <Phase4> or some pointer-sized value, i forget the exact typedef
[08:10:09] <Phase4> it is a 64bit value on 64bit windows, but wont exceed a 32bit value in size
[08:10:15] <mniip> hmm
[08:10:17] <mniip> reading SE
[08:10:28] <Phase4> also the lower two bits are usable as flags, the kernel ignores them
[08:10:42] <Phase4> and some of the upper bits are used as flags by kernel32.dll for the fake-handles
[08:11:06] <AppleDash> lol
[08:11:28] * Phase4 knows too much
[08:11:51] <mniip> Phase4, so pretty much it is a box
[08:12:27] <Phase4> asside from the lower two bits, it is just a token, unlike linux you have no control of the handle table
[08:12:30] <firestream> i know my way arund windows but not a ton about how it works
[08:12:31] <Phase4> values may as well be random
[08:12:32] <mniip> unique identifier, that identifies something in the... windows
[08:12:50] <Phase4> mniip, they're process specific, not unique, similar to file descriptors
[08:12:59] <mniip> hmm
[08:14:26] <Phase4> ah, here it is http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1538
[08:14:28] <PinkiePieBot> [ Linux/include/linux/fs.h - Linux Cross Reference - Free Electrons ]
[08:14:34] <Phase4> that's the struct i was talking about
[08:16:27] <Phase4> mniip, and the various system calls mostly expose operations in this struct. windows does not make it generic, different object types have their own calls
[08:16:59] <Phase4> semantics vary wildly between different types of object, which is likely why there's no equivalent of epoll or kqueue on windows
[08:17:15] <Phase4> (completion ports don't count, they're very limited compared to poll)
[08:17:20] <Phase4> (windows also lacks poll)
[08:17:32] <mniip> I know
[08:17:41] <mniip> file descriptors
[08:17:47] <mniip> minus dip*
[08:17:56] <mniip> and everything via ioctl
[08:18:02] <mniip> er dup*
[08:19:08] <Phase4> ioctl are device nodes only afaik
[08:19:24] <firestream> i forget what afaik means
[08:19:30] <Phase4> as far as i know
[08:19:47] <firestream> <--- im to tired to member all  the terms lol 
[08:19:57] <firestream> was up all day re doing my site
[08:20:41] <Phase4> mniip, there is fnctl, which operates on the descriptor itself, and that's the big difference. windows handles are more or less a pointer, the reference a kernel object. file descriptors are a thing with their own state
[08:20:52] <Phase4> they reference'
[08:21:01] <Phase4> unless they're fake handles obviously

[21:36:59] <AppleDash> My current solution is running a second browser entirely proxied through the US proxy
[21:55:47] <JustAberrant> :>
[21:59:11] * AppleDash forces JustAberrant to use a proxy located in Montenegro for all of his Internet activities
[21:59:34] <JustAberrant> :(
[21:59:40] <AppleDash> :)
[22:00:07] * JustAberrant has just drunk an entire bottle of wine :(
[22:00:11] <JustAberrant> this.. is not good
