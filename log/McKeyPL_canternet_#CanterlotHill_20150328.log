[00:28:43] <Moon_Solace> The really sucky one
[00:29:04] <Moon_Solace> Holy fudgenuggets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgEg8kXmifo
[00:29:04] <wobniaR> It's not sucky, it's just World of warcraft as final fantasy
[00:29:09] <RandomNinja> pls that applies to all FF for the last decade
[00:29:23] <wobniaR> That's the original FF14, that one sucked
[00:29:28] <Cloud_Zephyr> fbs

[00:29:43] <Moon_Solace> No....but when the game shut down....it was glorious
[00:30:04] <Eywind> Hey now
[00:30:09] <Eywind> I liked all three parts of FF13
[00:30:13] <RandomNinja> madness
[00:30:13] <Eywind> And I like Type 0
[00:30:16] <Moon_Solace> FF14
[00:30:19] <Eywind> 14 the original
[00:30:23] <Eywind> quality gameplay there :P
[00:30:29] <Moon_Solace> lol
[00:30:39] <Eywind> My friends play reborn
[00:30:40] <RandomNinja> yeah FF13 is truly great :P
[00:30:47] <Eywind> but most of them got them for free cuz of having 14
[00:30:54] <Moon_Solace> I just saw Fiery Joker's rant about it
[00:31:04] <Araxnus> I never played a FF game before. Are they fun?
[00:31:06] <Moon_Solace> And I saw the cutscene
[00:31:11] <RandomNinja> Araxnus play 6
[00:31:20] <wobniaR> 6 is outdated
[00:31:57] <wobniaR> Araxnus, all mmo's 10 and below are classic turn-based RPG's
[00:32:02] <Eywind> if you want to play a final fantasy, play Final Fantasy Legends kappa

[00:32:48] <wobniaR> They're all rather interesting if you can get past the outdated graphics and like turn-based RPG's
[00:32:49] <Eywind> unless you wanna go retro
[00:32:52] <RandomNinja> also 12 was weird

[00:33:25] <Eywind> I played a lot of 9 and a lot of 10
[00:33:30] <RandomNinja> I couldn't get past the weird battle system that tried to mix real time and turn based
[00:33:30] <Eywind> The 15 demo was pretty cool
[00:33:32] <Eywind> wish the AI was horrible
[00:33:33] <Eywind> wasn't*

[00:46:58] <Araxnus> Cloud_Zephyr: Oh well the site has been super slow for me too.
[00:47:05] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[00:47:33] <Sketchy_Sounds> !t how is poni formed

[00:47:57] <DinkyBot> People can have Berryshine. MLP Wikia is grossly inaccurate in listing that as a criticism of the 1980s

[06:24:25] <Eywind> so yeah..
[06:24:33] <Eywind> Anyways, thanks everyone for participating in the last Friday libs for a while.
[06:24:45] <Octavia_Melody> Actually, we lost a show because of other reasons.
[06:24:46] <MikeM> Thanks for hosting
[06:24:47] <Eywind> We might bring it back for a special event or something, though :)
[06:24:47] <Toothpaste> lul
[06:24:48] <LadyAubernon> it was a blast
[06:24:52] <Eywind> Well Octavia_Melody I meant CACX
[06:24:53] <Toothpaste> I totally missed it
[06:24:53] <Eywind> CAC*
[06:25:00] <Eywind> Not the other one that got lost lol
[06:25:03] <Kelazi5> Yeah, it was fun
[06:25:06] <Octavia_Melody> I don't recall us ever having CAC.
[06:25:59] <Kelazi5> It's better to have one good night of mad libs than two mediocre ones
[06:26:01] <Eywind> Well that would technically be true, but you could have had them if you wanted them and if thijngs were more how they were interested.
[06:26:04] <Octavia_Melody> IIRC, CAC never signed on with us when CLH got started. They chose to go their own way after EFN died.
[06:26:09] *** Quits: wobniaR (wobniaR@Monoshy.Hydra.Fighter.64) (Quit: Apples)
[06:26:21] <Octavia_Melody> A few shows did, in fact.
[06:26:22] <Eywind> They were taking a wait-and-see approach about everything -- I had a couple little chats with flutterguy about it
[06:26:45] <Octavia_Melody> You also have to understand, Eywind. We had three weeks to do what EFN did in at least a year. Three weeks.
[06:26:45] <Eywind> But it's all good
[06:26:58] <Eywind> They're doing their own things, we have Lyonize and TripDiam at that time.
[06:27:04] <Octavia_Melody> Draft just took everything, dumped it in our laps, and pretty much said "Your problem now."
[06:27:04] <Eywind> So it worked out better for everyone probably
[06:27:18] <Eywind> Hey, I know it was a hard situation
[06:27:29] *** Joins: Dustrunner (Spaghetti@Tips.Fedora)
[06:27:45] <Octavia_Melody> So, no, we didn't lose CAC. We never had them.
[06:27:46] <Eywind> I'm just saying there's areas for improvement
[06:28:00] <Eywind> Which is understandable given that the network is 3 months active and 4 months old, effectively.
[06:28:16] <Kelazi5> true
[06:29:23] <Eywind> And seriously, I think things are a lot better than they could be
[06:29:51] <Eywind> aside from site issues it's pretty solid, radio works, livestream works.
[06:31:18] <Eywind> and there's always progress going on that we can't see, so it's alright too.

[06:32:13] <Eywind> Lol
[06:32:26] <MikeM> I hope you downloaded them
[06:32:37] <Octavia_Melody> IIRC, what we have right now is a temporary streamer until we have our other ready.

[06:33:14] <MikeM> I like the other video stream. Very efficient.
[06:33:30] <Octavia_Melody> One of the big issues is money. EFN has Eight Track to dump a billion dollars into the site.
[06:33:36] <Octavia_Melody> had*
[06:34:05] *** Quits: Cloudrunner (Sentoki@Sentoki.publicBNC.canternet.org) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[06:34:05] <Eywind> I thought running expenses were significantly lower on the site than everfree
[06:34:24] <Kelazi5> true, gotta make do with what you've got
[06:35:04] <Octavia_Melody> That's because w're trying to not run a few million dollar items.
[06:35:16] <Eywind> That would be a lot of money
[06:35:40] <Octavia_Melody> Exaggeration, of course.
[06:35:45] <One-Trick> what 8track had was a lot of overkill, also
[06:35:45] <Octavia_Melody> But people get the idea.
[06:35:49] <Octavia_Melody> Indeed
[06:36:03] <One-Trick> moreso than anyone ever really needs
[06:36:04] <Eywind> Yeah, doing the same thing/better for lower price is always good
[06:36:12] *** Joins: Cloudrunner (Sentoki@Sentoki.publicBNC.canternet.org)
[06:36:33] <Eywind> I just hope that the network will still be worth investing time and effort into when you're able to get to that point
[06:36:45] <Octavia_Melody> The big things we had to do when we started was this: We had to have a working, good looking site ready for our release. We could have everything working perfectly and a million things waiting for everybody, but without a good site, nobody's going to want to see them.
[06:37:30] <Eywind> Oh, I'm with you there -- better to have something that works jan 1 than something that's perfect and ready to roll out sept 1

[19:42:59] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Question is. Would your body be able to handle time travel. I mean, your mind may not age with the time travel, but I assume your body would.

[19:49:29] <kickassking> id explod from fanboying
[19:49:52] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> Lycan[LDB]live: One of these days you have to teach me how to make bold text
[19:49:52] <Vaceslav> Season 4 was a great season for music
[19:50:18] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> *shot*
[19:50:20] <Lycan[LDB]live> Mod priviledge... :P
[19:50:28] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> Vaceslav: It was best season X3
[19:50:43] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> of course, it was m yfirst season I watched WITH the fandom instead of catching up
[19:50:52] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> so it was, as I said, kinda my Season 1
[19:50:54] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> X3
[19:50:58] <Vaceslav> for me it's a tie between it ans s1
[19:51:21] <wobniaR> Ctrl + b
[19:51:33] <Vaceslav> And i actually kinda think that hiatus 4 was a really great hiatus for fan music
[19:51:40] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Wow, someone actually tried to patent a time travel watch.
[19:51:44] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Interesting.
[19:51:47] <RandomNinja> lel
[19:51:58] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> That was back in 1968
[19:51:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> RandomNinja, success. i shall git my glasses fixed for half price
[19:52:06] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> Vaceslav: I agree, but so were all the other hiatuses ;D
[19:52:07] <kickassking> real time travel carnt happen tho sadly
[19:52:14] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> But it can.
[19:52:23] <LetsEatHay> s1 was cool because almost every episode introduced some new aspect of the world
[19:52:34] <wobniaR> git clone classes
[19:52:35] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Maybe not in the sci-fi sense. But maybe even that would be possible eventually.
[19:52:37] <wobniaR> glasses*
[19:52:41] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> But time travel IS possible.
[19:52:44] <kickassking> nope
[19:52:50] <kickassking> can you link things here?
[19:52:54] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> LetsEatHay: True~ Much of S4 focused on exploring new aspects of the characters.
[19:53:05] <kickassking> yep
[19:53:08] <LetsEatHay> yeah
[19:53:08] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> Like how their elements of harmony can be used negitively, or be challanged
[19:53:14] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> or Scoots not being able to fly
[19:53:18] <kickassking> think of it this way
[19:53:20] <kickassking> season 4
[19:53:31] <kickassking> all the mane 6 learned how to be in there element
[19:53:35] <kickassking> without the elements
[19:53:39] <kickassking> except twi
[19:53:43] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> lol
[19:53:45] <kickassking> discord learned more than her
[19:53:46] <Vaceslav> season 4 gave us Celestia vs Luna, hard to compete with that
[19:53:49] <FritzyBeat[LDB]Live> XD
[19:54:04] <kickassking> so i think season 5 will be VERY twilight and friends learning how to cope with neew powers and seats in the castle
