[01:06:19] <Colgate> doesn't surprise me
[01:07:17] <Phase4> awesome, even fewer reasons to want an xbone
[01:07:44] <urioxis> I don't follow
[01:08:27] <Kinsley> Xbox One has a processor/GPU combo about equivalent to an AMD A4-series APU.
[01:08:33] <Colgate> seems like it would be a reason to get one if anything
[01:08:39] <Colgate> I can't see this being a negative
[01:08:47] <Kinsley> But it entirely depends on the implementation, yes.
[01:09:41] <urioxis> I'm with Colgate. I'd assume it's a licensing thing rather than changing how the games are made

[01:11:30] <Kinsley> Sony publishes games, too.
[01:11:36] <Kinsley> Valve publishes games.
[01:11:36] <Twilightlicious> I know Sony does.
[01:11:42] <Kinsley> Nintendo.
[01:11:47] <Twilightlicious> But other than like, Age of Empires
[01:11:51] <Kinsley> 2K. EA. Ubisoft.
[01:11:53] <Twilightlicious> i can't think of any Microsoft publishes
[01:11:58] <Kinsley> Halo
[01:12:01] <Kinsley> Gears of War
[01:12:04] <Kinsley> Forza
[01:12:05] <Twilightlicious> They own Halo
[01:12:09] <Twilightlicious> they own Forza
[01:12:12] <Kinsley> They also publish them.
[01:12:17] <Twilightlicious> they develop them
[01:12:19] <Twilightlicious> doesn't count :P
[01:12:20] <Kinsley> Sunset Overdrive
[01:12:37] <Twilightlicious> Sunset Overdrive counts, i think
[01:12:38] <Twilightlicious> but thats one lol
[01:12:54] <Kinsley> Dead Rising 1 and 3
[01:13:05] <Twilightlicious> Who's the dev behind DR? =o

[01:13:58] <Twilightlicious> but anyways
[01:14:06] <Twilightlicious> with Steam controlling the PC Gaming world
[01:14:14] <Twilightlicious> who would actually use the Xbox Live SDK
[01:14:49] <Kinsley> Any cross-platform publisher targeting both Xbone and PC

[01:16:30] <urioxis> :P
[01:16:31] <Kinsley> I think as long as it doesn't try to replace or supplant devs using SteamWorks.
[01:17:20] <Phase4> wouldn't surprise me if the required gfwl2 compatibility
[01:17:29] <Twilightlicious> im 90% sure it would also need to be Windows 10
[01:17:44] <Twilightlicious> because they worded it in a way that sounds like it will only work with Windows 10
[01:17:48] <urioxis> yeah but that's a free upgrade from 7/8
[01:17:52] <Kinsley> And given Microsoft's close(ish) partnership with EA, I can't imagine Microsoft giving them an ultimatum to stop using Origin in favor of that new SDK for games EA wants to publish cross-platform.
[01:17:57] <Twilightlicious> doesn't mean it won't scare devs away
[01:18:12] *** Joins: Alcoholicorn (Alcoholicor@Pony-55oq0s.pool.hargray.net)
[01:18:42] <Twilightlicious> lol they won't give them an ultimatum
[01:19:03] <Twilightlicious> it'll be more along the lines of them getting letters in the mail "Pleeeeaaaaase?"
[01:19:27] <urioxis> They may merge the two platforms... :S
[01:19:47] <Twilightlicious> Nah, microsoft stands alone
[01:19:50] <Kinsley> I doubt it. EA's pretty invested in Origin.
[01:20:01] <Twilightlicious> unless merge = Microsoft kills origin
[01:20:05] <Twilightlicious> then there will be no merge
[01:20:09] <Kinsley> They won't give it up without something major riding on it.
[01:20:25] <Twilightlicious> now there might be seperate versions
[01:20:30] <Twilightlicious> like we saw with G4W
[01:20:34] <Kinsley> Microsoft won't risk losing EA on Xbone because that would drive so much market share to Sony.
[01:20:38] <Twilightlicious> Certain games having a G4W Edition
[01:20:42] <Twilightlicious> that uses the Xbox Live SDK
[01:21:36] <Kinsley> I think Microsoft learned their lesson there.

[01:23:43] <Twilightlicious> They made the claim at GDC that DX12 provides a 20% performance boost.
[01:24:10] <Twilightlicious> though i didn't hear how they measured that percentage, or against what

[01:29:52] <Twilightlicious> Im expecting only the "Windows Store"
[01:30:45] <Twilightlicious> when the Xbox One was first announced they said it would have the Windows 8 store, running an Xbox and Windows kernel hybrid.
[01:30:53] <Twilightlicious> Thats literally what they said lol
[01:31:00] <Twilightlicious> But since then they've gone quiet about it

[01:53:13] <Webster> Hi.
[01:54:30] <DestinyDraw> I have a bunch of images I want to upload to a website, and I'm debating whether to save them as PNGs or JPGs. The PNGs look nicer but they're also 10x times the filesize of the JPGs and that's kind of bad
[01:55:00] <DestinyDraw> I was wondering if anyone in here knew of some form of PNG compression technology something-or-other
[01:55:53] <Webster> Depends on the content of the images.
[01:55:55] <Webster> You can try pngcrush.
[01:56:15] <Webster> But if they're photos or close to it in terms of detail, you might be better off using 95% quality JPGs.
[01:56:23] <Webster> What are you saving the JPGs in?

[01:59:13] <Kinsley> Well, I see WHY the PNGs are bigger.
[01:59:19] <Kinsley> Those are grainy images.
[01:59:31] <Kinsley> PNG doesn't like grainy.
[01:59:45] <Kinsley> Or anything with lots of fine detail.
[01:59:59] <DestinyDraw> I see
[02:00:26] <Webster> Yeah, lots of gradients. JPG can have different quality depending on how you save it.
[02:00:39] <Webster> If he's only saving them at 75% quality, of course they're going to look bad.
[02:03:50] <DestinyDraw> I think PNGCrush made the filesize larger xD
[02:06:26] <Webster> For those I'd just suggest JPG.

[04:02:20] <cyborg_ar> i wish i had a 4 channel oscilloscope
[04:02:41] <cyborg_ar> trying to crack this spi bus and i already got both channels and the external trigger busy
[04:03:00] * Phase4 wishes portable scopes were cheaper
[04:03:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> isnt that what something liek a bus pirate is for
[04:04:23] <cyborg_ar> well im tracking down issues with the bus
[04:04:29] * Phase4 wishes those were cheaper also
[04:04:32] <cyborg_ar> when things go wrong it's much better to have a scope
[04:04:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase4: they are only like 40$
[04:05:00] <cyborg_ar> you can see stuff like runt pulses and bus collisions

[04:05:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah
[04:05:30] <cyborg_ar> i'm already using a microcontroller to do pattern triggering
[04:05:35] <Phase4> oh yeah, bus pirate, i have one of those. what's the logic analyzer one?
[04:05:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> oh i am not sure
[04:06:13] <cyborg_ar> a logic analyzer is a more general purpose thing
[04:06:40] <cyborg_ar> it basically samples the states of digital inputs like a scope would do with analog
[04:07:00] <cyborg_ar> so you can get a picture of how the signals are changing over time
[04:07:23] <cyborg_ar> decent logic analyzers will let you do fancy things like protocol decoding and pattern triggering
[04:09:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> why oh why does office install require a reboot

[19:23:37] <AppleDash> In C#, if I've got a List of objects of my own class, I add object foo to the list, then I change a field in foo, will list.remove(foo) still work?
[19:24:33] *** Quits: Nick (nobody@Pony-rgmjhl.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:25:06] *** Joins: SpikeDragon (Spike@sorting.those.books)
[19:32:40] <DataByte> except for a few special cases (and i don't remember the conditions offhand), when you add an object to a list, you're adding a reference to the list
[19:33:05] <DataByte> you may want to test that, though - i haven't messed with it in some time
[19:33:18] <AppleDash> Alright
[19:34:22] <Stik> that is not the case in java, not sure about c#
[19:34:30] <Stik> but definitely worth checking i think :)
[19:35:09] <AppleDash> Seems to be working
[19:35:49] *** Quits: SpikeDragon (Spike@sorting.those.books) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[19:37:16] <Stik> so looks like c# is very similar to the java impl, it checks the Equals(x) method if it has one
[19:37:44] *** Joins: SpikeDragon (Spike@sorting.those.books)
[19:37:45] <Stik> so i suppose it depends how the field you change affects that
[19:38:09] <Stik> suspect the default impl just compares references so it will function like you expect

[19:57:02] <AppleDash> One more question
[19:57:27] <AppleDash> Is there a modifier in C# that makes it so that every operation using a variable is executed as if lock (theVar) { } were wrapped around it?

[20:08:32] <DataByte> like synchronized?
[20:10:06] <AppleDash> Like synchronized, but for variables (Can you use synchronized on variables? I've only used it on methods)
[20:10:53] <DataByte> pretty sure you can use it as a block
[20:14:57] <AppleDash> Yes
[20:15:02] <AppleDash> You can
[20:15:25] <AppleDash> And in C# I'm using lock { } as a block, but I just want all accesses to a certain variable to be acting like there was lock { } around it by default

[23:34:19] <Kinsley> I understand not having images because that would blow up the file size.
[23:34:29] <DataByte> oh, read the date wrong, then
[23:34:45] <Kinsley> But some stories are really tied to their cover images.
[23:34:57] <DataByte> mostly it's the epub that makes the index cache so large
