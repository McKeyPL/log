[04:16:51] <cloppyhooves> I have a cooking question for those with some expertise :o
[04:17:00] <samonuh> Sure
[04:19:25] <cloppyhooves> I have to stir-fry veggies and meat before adding water to boil (and covering)
[04:19:34] <cloppyhooves> The pot I have can prolly hold everything
[04:19:40] <cloppyhooves> But doesn't have much space at the bottom
[04:19:45] <cloppyhooves> I also have a pan that has a lot of space
[04:19:47] <cloppyhooves> But can't be covered
[04:19:49] <Quinn> cloppyhooves!
[04:19:59] <cloppyhooves> Should I cook in the pot, when things will kinda be stacked on top of each other?
[04:20:04] <samonuh> Why are you adding water to stir fry?
[04:20:12] <cloppyhooves> Or can I cook it in the pan, and just transfer things to the pot?
[04:20:13] <weisey> for curry
[04:20:16] <cloppyhooves> Hi Quinn!
[04:20:26] <weisey> fry the veggies and meat, then boil in the curry
[04:20:33] <samonuh> No experience with that. I cook it differently
[04:20:38] <weisey> cloppyhooves, thats what i would do
[04:20:42] <weisey> fry it in the pan
[04:20:46] <weisey> then do the rest in the pot
[04:20:54] <cloppyhooves> Okay c:
