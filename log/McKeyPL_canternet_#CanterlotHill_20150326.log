[10:00:11] <JockeTF> KilgoreTrout speaks the truth!
[10:01:37] <KilgoreTrout> No matter how trustworthy one considers himself, if he is under 25, he will be possibly loitering at a mall, taking drugs and vandalizing public property.
[10:02:30] <KilgoreTrout> Sadly many choices are fueled by stereotypes.
[10:03:44] <KilgoreTrout> I, for example listen to dated power ballads, drink expensive and foul wine with ridiculously boring people and I am also afraid of fun, because it will ruin my sleep schedule, which is between 7 pm and 4 am.
[10:03:59] <KilgoreTrout> Because I am over 30.
[10:07:39] <KilgoreTrout> Also, as a parent, I love all kids, think that every single place should be kid-friendly and want to ban everything not g-rated.

[20:47:35] <Cloud_Zephyr> not really. i uninstalled it due to the amount of bugs
[20:47:41] <Cloud_Zephyr> which they have probably fixed nowq
[20:48:06] <Unixkitty> Transparency though? And so far the only bug I seem to experience is sudden freezes of programs, or like slow opening
