[01:16:07] <Eywind> regardless chat was not the same without you I'm sure
[01:16:32] <stevestreza> I have a server in The Cloud™ that I run most of my life through, including my connections to IRC servers
[01:16:46] <Eywind> Ah okay
[01:17:11] <Eywind> I'm not used to servers meaning something for individual users, even a power user such as yourself
[01:17:45] <wobniaR> How do I write P = L[c(1 + c)n]/[(1 + c)n - 1] in a way that java will understand?
[01:18:03] <wobniaR> I hate this class
[01:18:06] <stevestreza> think of it as a computer hooked up to a super fast internet connection and without a monitor
[01:18:18] <Eywind> Yea that makes sense
[01:18:26] <stevestreza> that's really all it means
[01:18:34] <stevestreza> wobniaR: what do those things mean
[01:18:40] <Eywind> If there's monitor how do you see what's going on?  :P j/k
[01:18:43] <Eywind> no monitor*
[01:18:55] <stevestreza> you connect to it remotely through a text-based system
[01:19:04] <wobniaR> Variables for price, interest and loan time length
[01:19:21] <Eywind> Yeah I get the concept now haha
[01:19:29] <Eywind> wobniaR just define three variables and set the calculation and print P? idk
[01:19:44] <Eywind> stevestreza knows more obv
[01:19:59] <wobniaR> It's not like java will accept it like a calculator would with brackets and parenthesis
[01:20:15] <Eywind> tell Java to deal with it then
[01:20:25] <stevestreza> make variables for P, L, c, and n. Then: P = L * (c * (1 + c) * n) / ((1 + c) * n - 1);
[01:21:01] <Eywind> Ah the issue you were having is just the nesting?  I suggest what professional coder man says

[01:23:21] <wobniaR> Oh n is an exponent
[01:24:00] <RandomNinja> you can't just do a variant of a^b?
[01:24:09] <wobniaR> Let me try
[01:24:15] <Eywind> it's pow
[01:24:35] <RandomNinja> otherwise loop multiplication it n times
[01:24:49] <RandomNinja> ignore the "it"
[01:24:51] <Eywind> math.pow(a,b) = a^b apparently

[04:24:21] <Night_Lightning> you mean brony case? =3

[04:25:40] <TurquoiseSplash> Prince is mah waifu
[04:25:46] <Night_Lightning> tim's into metal and Maor Metal!!!
[04:25:49] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Hannah, Montana
[04:25:50] <Ardail> I could see that TurquoiseSplash 
[04:25:51] <SteelChords> xD

[04:25:57] <kingqueso> Yus
[04:25:57] <Snuggle_Trumpet> Easy for you to say
[04:25:57] <Starlight[EoH]> I actually like a lot of orchestral and folky things, too
[04:25:58] <StandingLeaf> Ardail Prince Whateverver "Eh whatever"
[04:26:01] <Starlight[EoH]> and jazz
[04:26:08] <Starlight[EoH]> and trance
[04:26:13] <Ardail> I mean just... whatever man
[04:26:13] <TurquoiseSplash> can't wait til me and Prince release our Blink 182 mashup x3
[04:26:15] <Jon-The_Bronynerd> Name a city from the State of Montana as Hannah, Montana! :P
[04:26:21] <KibbieTheGreat> ISMBOF is a pretty cool dude too, haven't talked to him in ages tho
[04:26:21] <Spritefire> also i LOOOOVE this song
[04:26:30] <Ardail> yup this song
[04:26:33] <kingqueso> Does it actually stand for "I set my bread on fire"?
[04:26:35] <Flutterknight> I wonder if there's pony music in a J-Pop style...
[04:26:47] <Starlight[EoH]> J-pop and K-pop are my guilty pleasures
[04:26:54] <Talguy21> This song is meh to me, and I usually like Prince's songs
[04:26:55] <Starlight[EoH]> which is not Disney pop
[04:27:00] <Starborne> J/K pop are awesome.
[04:27:02] <StandingLeaf> Oh nice, with animation!
[04:27:05] <ForestRain[EoH]> If you're looking for JPop, look at Baschfire.
[04:27:18] <Flutterknight> I don't even feel guilty about them. I <3 J-Pop and K-Pop. ^_^
[04:27:22] <BubbaStudios> Hm, I actually kinda' like Irish folk songs.
[04:27:22] <KibbieTheGreat> Actually ISMBOF told me ages ago the letter "B" in his name stood for "brother", but he said it probably sounded to mean for this fandom :P
[04:27:23] <ForestRain[EoH]> ^
[04:27:28] <Starlight[EoH]> I really like SCANDAL...I think there's more than one band called that, but the j-pop/rock girl band
[04:27:32] <TurquoiseSplash> I like JRock
[04:27:37] <Ardail> everyone is listening to the music, but I'm over here enjoying that art
[04:27:44] <Ardail> great crying derpy splash art
[04:27:44] <TurquoiseSplash> only a few JPop songs do I actually listen to
[04:27:51] <Moon_Solace> I've always enjoyed Dreamchan's art, it's so awesome ^-^
[04:27:54] <Snowblitz[EoH]> This is why we should never drink before the show! lol
[04:27:58] <kingqueso> I have loved both songs so far. These are some of my favorite from the entire fandom.
[04:28:09] <SteelChords> speak for yourself Snowblitz[EoH] xP
[04:28:10] <Flutterknight> I've followed Baschfire for a long time. Never noticed anything JPop-y, but I had a big gap of keeping up with stuff due to depression a while back.
[04:28:10] <Spritefire> I play this song all the time on Frets on Fire and its soooo good

[04:28:29] <StandingLeaf> Ardail I like the art too
[04:28:31] <Shining_Star> so there was no cutie art crusaders
[04:28:35] <Starlight[EoH]> Flutterknight, listen to Basch's latest album. It's super weeaboo and all done with vocaloid
[04:28:38] <Talguy21> I know it's unfair to compare it to his newer stuff, but I can't help it, he's gotten so much better!
[04:28:46] <Ardail> Good art and visuals for a song can REALLY help set your tone for the whole song
[04:28:51] <Snowblitz[EoH]> SteelChord: You're right, it was Pixie Sticks! 
[04:28:56] <Flutterknight> Nice. Though if it costs money that may not be an option for me. =/
[04:29:03] <Moon_Solace> Talguy21: he sure has, although a lot of his classic stuff is awesome too
[04:29:06] <Starlight[EoH]> It should be on bandcamp available to stream for free
[04:29:07] <Ardail> or help your listeners hear it in the way you want them to
[04:29:16] <TurquoiseSplash> Between Fairytales and Happy Endings will always be mah fav Prince song
[04:29:19] <Talguy21> Depends on the track imo
[04:29:19] <KibbieTheGreat> PrinceWhateverer is a god tier lyricist, he writes his songs wayyy better than most other people I've seen in the pony music scene.
[04:29:22] <Spritefire> i would love to hear this song performed live
[04:29:26] <Starlight[EoH]> here you go Flutterknight, http://captainbaschfire.bandcamp.com/album/night-lights
[04:29:36] <Talguy21> This one's kinda meh for me, sorry Prince
[04:29:52] <Flutterknight> Thanks. I'll have to give it a listen later. ^_^
[04:29:57] <kingqueso> I feel like some of his newer stuff is too heavy for me. This is a lighter song and I love it.

[04:30:27] <Ardail> oh hey that derpy picture!
[04:30:27] <SyxString[EoH]> Prince is one of my absolute favorite artists in the community
[04:30:36] <TurquoiseSplash> Not Letting Go is mah fav
[04:30:40] <BubbaStudios> Oh, the feels! Too close to home!
[04:30:42] <Ardail> I used that as a reference for a few pics I made
[04:30:43] <Talguy21> I'm kinda the inverse, kingqueso, because this is softer than his usual style
[04:30:45] <KibbieTheGreat> That's why I like this dude, he can write these heavy metal sections but still do lighter laid back songs like this
[04:30:52] <Talguy21> And it's offputting
[04:30:59] <Moon_Solace> SyxString[EoH]: he actually introduced me to Derpy when I was still a total Brony noob
[04:30:59] <Flutterknight> I love singing along to PrinceWhateverer's stuff. ^_^
[04:31:15] <Ardail> Tim is just full of hate
[04:31:16] <Spritefire> WHOA! Good Charlotte...havent heard that name in forever
[04:31:18] <kingqueso> I like the softer feel. Songs like Destabaize are nearly too heavy for me, but I still enjoy it.

[04:32:03] <Talguy21> Destabilize is too heavy for me too, but most of his stuff falls in my super finicky sweet-spot

[04:50:44] <kingqueso> I think this is one of the few Mandopony songs I don't have in my pony music playlist. But I think I should change that.
[04:50:48] <Spritefire> Get yourself a maliwan and set some things on fire!

[04:53:19] <kingqueso> Tbh, my favorite song by mando isn't even a pony song. It's his Animal Crossing Song.

[04:53:42] <Ardail> ^
[04:53:49] <Ardail> I like that song

[05:16:35] <kingqueso> I would drink to it, but I'm only 20 :/
[05:16:49] <Flightless> Well, I'll take another for you, queso
[05:16:51] <Spritefire> raise a hoof if this song hit A LOT closer to home than you were expecting
[05:16:52] <Flutterknight> I'd drink to it, but I have no booze.
[05:17:04] <Spritefire> (\
[05:17:04] <ForestRain[EoH]> Cyril told me this is the most emotional he's heard me in a song.
[05:17:05] <Flutterknight> *raises all the hooves*
[05:17:07] <Teku_Jer> -raises my hoof-
[05:17:09] <ForestRain[EoH]> Heh
[05:17:16] <SilverLugia[NLR]> I'm holding my mini Derpy plushie to this song
[05:17:20] <Flightless> He's not wrong at all
[05:17:26] <StandingLeaf> ForestRain[EoH] This is a a very good version. More calm in some way. More serene and emotional at the same time.
[05:17:30] <Spritefire> i have a decent sized derpy here
[05:17:36] <Flutterknight> I really think this song means a lot to most of the LGBTQ bronies, and many more beyond.
[05:17:39] <Teku_Jer> this song is defently going to be my theme song :3
[05:17:40] <Snowblitz[EoH]> I'm holding my Iphone lighter app! :P
[05:18:03] <kingqueso> As I said earlier, as an autistic person, this song has a lot of meaning to me. I was bullied a lot throughout life, and this song has a great message to deal with that.
[05:18:03] * SteelChords is desperately trying not to break down right now...
[05:18:10] <Night_Lightning> I still wanna cover this sometime, assuming I have permission to do so of course
[05:18:11] <kingqueso> That harmony tho
[05:18:11] <Spritefire> Having been bullied all my life and finally growing to accept who i am, this song hit me pretty darn hard
[05:18:17] <Flightless> Oh, Forest. I learned how hard it is to play this on a uke and sing.
[05:18:23] <Flutterknight> Yeah, I was bullied my whole life too.
[05:18:46] <StandingLeaf> Spritefire That's what I was a bout to say too!
[05:18:52] <kingqueso> I was always the fat autistic kid with a lazy eye, so I was an easy target :/
[05:18:54] <Spritefire> I joined the brony fandom...became comfortable with who i am..accepted that im different, but that im unique and thats a good thing
[05:18:54] <Teku_Jer> as with me and I'm still kinda bullied to this day :'(
[05:19:00] <Starborne4AWHILE> It's beautiful even if you weren't bullied
[05:19:02] <SilverLugia[NLR]> ForestRain[EoH]: Words can't describe this song and the emotions that it conveys. It really hits me as well because I was always looked down upon and harassed in school because I was different
[05:19:16] <StandingLeaf> ^
[05:19:19] <DinkyBot> !mlfw aaaaaaaaabre
[05:19:21] <DerpyBot> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/436

[05:19:35] <StandingLeaf> <3<3<3
[05:19:36] <SilverLugia[NLR]> Spritefire: I hear you on that one
[05:19:39] <Flutterknight> I was the super feminine "guy" growing up, so I was always bullied. No one that knows me was surprised when I came out as a trans woman.
[05:19:43] <SilverLugia[NLR]> This fandom means a lot to me
[05:19:44] <Sonny_Starbrite> Beautiful song.
[05:19:45] <Teku_Jer> -sits there and starts to cry-
[05:19:48] <Moon_Solace> Bye everypony!

[17:35:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> you can get it back though. i dont think anyone really cares about away nick on this server
[17:35:41] <Trildar> Wipergone2: It's the Canterlot Hill channel. http://canterlothill.com
[17:35:42] <Cloud_Zephyr> Wipergone2 we are about the brony radio canterlothill.com
[17:36:23] <Wipergone2> what happened to the old radio
[17:37:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> the owners didn't want to run it anymore so handed it down to those who did under the new name
[17:37:52] <Wipergone2> why not keep the old site
[17:38:05] <Trildar> Cloud_Zephyr: You'd have to get the module from somewhere else or compile it yourself I'm guessing?
[17:38:22] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup thats easy
[17:38:23] <Trildar> Cause EFN is the property of Poison Joke Productions.
[17:39:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> I don't see it being that annoying. most people dont have an irc bouncer so you have to see leave and join messages constantly
[17:39:21] <Cloud_Zephyr> which isn't that dfferent from nick changes
[17:40:24] <Snap_Shot> Yeah i know that feel...
[17:40:36] <Wipergone2> irc bouncer?
[17:40:53] <Snap_Shot> It keeps you logged in even if you have your irc client closed.
[17:41:02] <Cloud_Zephyr> its probably a different case on other irc servers
[17:41:17] <Wipergone2> how do one get it
[17:41:49] <Trildar> Canternet has a public bouncer, else you can host your own.
[17:41:55] <Cloud_Zephyr> ^
[17:42:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> Warning: Running your own is pretty confusing

[17:42:23] <Snap_Shot> i don't use the canternet one since i never turn my computer off
[17:42:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> Well at least the setup us. After that its fine
[17:42:50] <Wipergone2> snap why do you not turn it off
[17:42:54] <Cloud_Zephyr> I host my own cus custom settings :3
[17:43:42] <Wipergone2> i mean your pc
[17:44:35] <Snap_Shot> Because I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with an idea for an photoshoot and would want to work on it right away.
[17:45:12] <Trildar> cuz sleep is for the weak anyway. :P
[17:45:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> wows. it only costs about a maximum of  £8.79 to keep my raspberry pi running for a year
