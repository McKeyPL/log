[04:42:19] <Flurshy> think the last one I watched was november
[04:45:48] <Eywind> So I had a dream last night that I alluded to on twitter
[04:46:50] <Eywind> I was a dragon man, anthropomorphic dragon or something.  Apparently, as a male dragon I was a slave of the female dragons, because that's how hierarchy was in the dream.
[04:47:29] <Eywind> So humans came to kill the dragons and take the area for their own, and it was two female dragons and me and another slave vs them... they killed the other male and apparently captured me and brainwashed me into like being a dragon killer, and I wrecked the two females that I was subserviant to
[04:47:59] <Eywind> then I led a fire emblem-esque troupe to kill lots of dragons and other people that I apparently though I should IDK
[04:48:15] <Eywind> So I was getting assassins sent after me, and I killed one of them by throwing a gun at them and their head came off.  That was pretty cool

[06:05:33] <Kelazi5> true
[06:05:43] <One-Trick> i dunno what that means
[06:05:58] <Eywind> Like we'd do a fanfic for every 50 and it'd be a "milestone"
[06:06:03] <One-Trick> ah
[06:06:06] <Eywind> 250, 300, etc. but like that's not a big deal if it happens all the time
[06:06:36] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well that's why you gotta make milestones exponenetial rather than linear.
[06:06:51] <One-Trick> or at least geometric
[06:06:52] <Sketchy_Sounds> So like, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, etc.

[06:08:13] <Eywind> I've been pushing to scale back anyways

[06:09:51] <One-Trick> i guess thats somewhat true
[06:10:31] <Kelazi5> Well it isn't as fun if it's a slog for people and it would make each one a bit more special.

[14:03:43] <Araxnus> Exclusives are pointless and do not sell consoles imo. They just upset gamers.
[14:04:00] <Seoson> That's O.K. I guess. But gaming is for me PC for the most part
[14:04:01] <RandomNinja> Also, there's actually games for them nowadays

[14:12:27] <Araxnus> yeah.
[14:12:34] <Seoson> Bu the line up of the Wii U is still very small, isn't it?
[14:12:50] <wobniaR> Wii u is mostly nintendo franchises with a few 3rd parties
[14:13:05] <Araxnus> So, wobniaR dare you to lock Borderlands to 30fps and play for a bit. Your eyes will bug out so bad. Mine do :3
[14:13:08] <wobniaR> But it's hard to go wrong with their games
[14:13:21] <Araxnus> Mhmm
[14:13:22] <wobniaR> I play pre-sequel with the smoothed 22-62 option
[14:13:39] <wobniaR> I can't go too crazy with the graphic options or my fps drops sub 20
[14:13:51] <wobniaR> 750 ti only goes so far
[14:14:20] <Araxnus> You should be running at max on a 750 Ti. That is super wired.
[14:14:28] <Seoson> Unlimited frames + G-Sync = capped at 144 FPS- stable a few frames lower without any stuttering
[14:15:08] <wobniaR> Yeah not with all the particle effects and lighting
[14:15:28] <wobniaR> That stuff will make my fps tank during a large shoot out
[14:15:40] <Araxnus> wobniaR: Will need to test it one day. Always thought Borderlands took nothing to run really. I mean runs on my Laptop with a HD 4000.
[14:15:53] <wobniaR> It runs just fine

[14:17:51] <Googie> Recently I've been playing a few things using my Oculus Rift DK2, performance requirements in VR are much higher than normal.
[14:18:15] <Seoson> Oh I wish I had one
[14:18:20] <RandomNinja> Yeah almost twice isn't it?
[14:18:22] <Googie> It'll be interesting to see how people's computers hold up when the consumer version comes out.
[14:18:49] <Googie> Something like that, also at 1080p, and you need to sustain a minimum frame rate of 75FPS
[14:18:51] <RandomNinja> Already game at 1440p, shouldn't be a huge problem :3
[14:19:02] <Googie> That's the killer
[14:19:18] <RandomNinja> Why 75?
[14:19:27] <Googie> Below that you start to get horrible judder
[14:19:29] <Araxnus> The way I run games it would not. Games melt my 780 Ti Classified. But I run everything on max with full AA.
[14:19:39] <RandomNinja> Ah k
[14:19:41] <Seoson> Even more interesting: What is Sony going to do with Project Morpheus? The PS4 cannot handle that thing under any circumstances.
[14:19:44] <Googie> You turn your head, and you can feel it responding poorly.
[14:19:54] <Googie> Yeah, that's an interesting question
[14:20:09] <Araxnus> Need Titan X :3 
[14:20:09] <RandomNinja> Protip Araxnus: max AA is meaningless overkill :P
[14:20:12] <Googie> Although there's nothing saying that they can't just reduce the graphics quality of games for VR.
[14:20:14] <DinkyBot> !hat
[14:20:14] <DerpyBot> May I take your hat, muffin?
[14:20:14] <DerpyBot> May I take your hat?
[14:20:14] <DinkyBot> I'm wearin' a muffin hat, momma!
[14:20:29] <RandomNinja> 2x is enough, maybe 4x if lower resolution
[14:20:32] <wobniaR> Most important things to me are texture quality & view distance
[14:20:53] * RandomNinja applies 8k textures to wobniaR
[14:20:55] <Googie> It's funny, but although you'd expect that you'd want really really high quality settings in VR, they actually don't matter as much as you think.
[14:21:17] <RandomNinja> Yeah resolution is king
[14:21:29] <RandomNinja> Everything else is just eye candy
[14:22:03] <RandomNinja> Also framerate ofc
[14:22:09] <Araxnus> RandomNinja: Not Max Settings without Max AA ;) But you are right. It is more of a "I can do it so why not"
[14:22:15] <Googie> I'd actually go so far to say Frame Rate > Resolution in this case.
[14:22:31] <Googie> A lack of the former will make you nauseous :/
[14:23:00] <RandomNinja> Then again if you can't do both you should probably upgrade your graphics card before getting VR :P
[14:23:02] <Araxnus> I go to YouTube see. "Crysis 3. Titan X. Max Settings" They have AA off xD
[14:23:16] <RandomNinja> Also 720p :P
[14:23:41] <Googie> I'm waiting for AMD to release their new cards, want to wait for the market to stabilize, as my GTX670 is no longer enough.
[14:23:51] <RandomNinja> Also C3 Psycho looks amazing
[14:24:18] <Googie> Having issues keeping the frame rate at/above 75 in Elite Dangerous and Alien Isolation.
[14:24:39] <RandomNinja> 670 not enough? Noooo
[14:24:52] <RandomNinja> Overclock it!
[14:25:01] <Googie> It'd be fine outside of VR.

[14:26:15] <RandomNinja> Yeah I'm gonna need a new beast for Witcher 3(git hype)

[14:27:02] <Araxnus> Yup. That is the good thing with AMD. Only thing. lol. As their cards are hot and loud.
[14:27:28] <RandomNinja> For some reason I doubt my 670 will like Witcher at 2560x1440 o3o

[14:28:34] <Googie> Intel on the other hand... they haven't had any major performance improvements in years. It's all been power consumption.
