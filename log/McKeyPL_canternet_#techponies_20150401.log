[00:41:57] <Colgate> what happens on windows if you name a ".txt" and then tell windows to hide file extensions of known file types?
[00:42:03] <Colgate> name a file*
[00:42:58] <Colgate> windows itself won't let you, but you could probably do it from linux and then mount the drive on windows
[00:43:07] <Webster> You can do that from the command line, actually.
[00:43:08] <Kinsley> Hmmm.
[00:43:12] <Webster> As far as I know it won't hide it.
[00:43:13] <Phase4> ^ Webster
[00:43:24] <Phase4> yeah, it doesn't hide dot files
[00:43:31] <Colgate> ah
[00:43:38] <Colgate> that's disappointing
[00:44:09] <Colgate> how do you even create a file from windows command line, echo and touch are failing me >:(

[00:45:57] <Colgate> oh, it still displays it, but doesn't have a name
[00:46:23] <wolfyshy> copy con .txt
[00:46:26] <wolfyshy> :D
[00:46:57] <wolfyshy> and the horrible truth: if you have a legitimate printer port, you can make your screen a teletype with MODE redirection from CON to LPT1
[00:46:57] <Phase4> oh neat, didn't think it hide files like that
[00:47:01] <Phase4> hid filenames'
[00:47:30] <mniip> wolfyshy, you still can't name a file "con"
[00:48:06] <Colgate> I know there's a bunch of reserved names you can't use due to legacy stuff
[00:48:12] <mniip> oh man, now I wonder what happens if I mount an ntfs in linux
[00:48:17] <mniip> and create a file named con
[00:49:01] <Phase4> mniip, it can't be touched from win32
[00:49:14] <mniip> [01:47:42] <mniip> oh man, now I wonder what happens if I mount an ntfs in linux

[00:49:26] <mniip> >if I mount an ntfs in linux
[00:49:48] <Phase4> you can delete them from the ntdll functions, but those names are special cased in kernel32.dll

[07:29:12] <AppleDash> How are furries geeky in any way
[07:34:34] <Coco_Pommel> i think you are confusing geeks with nerds
[07:36:48] <Coco_Pommel> it might be nitpicking, but a geek is generaly just a person who goes beyond being a fan
[07:37:53] <Kinsley> Furries aren't nerds either.
[07:38:45] <Shnuggles> it's just a consistent joke really
[07:38:50] <cyborg_ar> furries are furries
[07:38:59] <Shnuggles> that furries are everywhere, just not liked everywhere
[07:39:01] <Shnuggles> which is stupid
[07:39:15] <Shnuggles> It has gotten better
[07:39:40] <Shnuggles> but, people are still dicks to people that identify as furries
[07:39:44] <Coco_Pommel> furries, like trekies, are geeks, but not nessesarly nerds
[07:40:02] <cyborg_ar> yes
[07:40:40] <cyborg_ar> they use the word geek there as "obsessive" on the thing they're into
[07:40:52] <Coco_Pommel> furries are just the new trekies, and in another 15 years we wont see much drama around them
[07:41:08] <Coco_Pommel> something else will take its place
[07:41:23] <cyborg_ar> i think it will take a while
[07:42:01] <cyborg_ar> the thing with furries being ostracized on the internet is really as old as the internet itself
[07:42:12] <cyborg_ar> goes some 30 years back
[07:42:16] <Coco_Pommel> look how fast nerdy culture got integrated, if you went to comiccon 20 years ago you would have been laughed out of the room

[07:44:40] <Starthunder> herp derp
[07:45:04] <Starthunder> …what?
[07:46:00] <Coco_Pommel> prior to spiderman 1 in 2001, superheros wernt really taken that seriously as a genre
[07:48:39] <Starthunder> How does this relate to furries, though?
[07:49:15] <Coco_Pommel> the point, is it only takes 1 transformitive work to sway public opinion
[07:49:23] <cyborg_ar> not really
[07:49:34] <Starthunder> …and we just haven't had such a work for furries yet?
[07:49:51] <Coco_Pommel> can you think of one, i certanly cant
[07:50:22] <cyborg_ar> how? there are some really awesome productions with anthropomorphic characters
[07:50:51] <cyborg_ar> there's this one with the ponies, though it's technically not "anthro" under some definitions :)
[07:51:14] <Coco_Pommel> i supose yes, that would be the closest i can think of :P
[07:51:21] <Coco_Pommel> and maybe howard the duck :P
[07:51:21] <cyborg_ar> it's really funny though
[07:51:52] <cyborg_ar> that it's some kind of proof to the infinite supply of hate on the internet
[07:52:24] <Coco_Pommel> but say idk, 2kinds is made into a movie and its actually good, i think you would see public opinion change overnight
[07:52:37] <cyborg_ar> the rise of otakus and then bronies hasnt been enough to distract the trolls enough to leave the furries alone
[07:52:47] <Coco_Pommel> and by overnight i mean about 5-10 years
[07:53:08] <cyborg_ar> hate just multiplies to cover the demand
[07:53:10] <cyborg_ar> haha
[07:53:23] <Coco_Pommel> yea, but theres so many of us now i think we outnumber the haters for once
[07:54:00] <cyborg_ar> they dont need to be numerous to be effective

[07:54:09] <Coco_Pommel> it dosent hurt though
[07:54:46] <Coco_Pommel> a hating minority under presure will tend to cave due to social stigma
[07:56:19] <Coco_Pommel> the biggest problem bronies and furries have is they tend to get lumped in with all the lgbt hate, i think as we see that start to fade, so too will the hate fade for them.
[07:56:22] <cyborg_ar> there arent many social consequences on hating furries, and that wont change in a while
[07:56:46] <cyborg_ar> in some parts of the world it's still ok to hate black people, even after all they fought

[07:59:41] <cyborg_ar> now count all the generations that need to die off before furry hate subsides :)
[08:00:30] <Coco_Pommel> hmm, furry hate is likly tied to religous conservitism, so 60ish years in US?
[08:00:59] <Shnuggles> furries aren't tied to that..
[08:01:05] <Shnuggles> furries are tied to sexuality...
[08:01:12] <Shnuggles> deviant sexuals
[08:01:12] <cyborg_ar> i think most 13 year old trolls will keep trolling when they're 73
[08:01:26] <Coco_Pommel> i disagree, a lot of that stems from disgust bread from that religous conservitism
[08:01:38] <Shnuggles> a lot of what?
[08:01:44] <Coco_Pommel> the hate
[08:01:51] <cyborg_ar> well a good chunk of sexual based hate comes from religious norms
[08:02:07] <cyborg_ar> that puts furries, homosexuals and transexuals in the same bag

[08:09:20] <cyborg_ar> nobody has the right to not be offended, but targetted name calling can quickly get into harassment territory
[08:09:30] <Coco_Pommel> the name calling stems a lot from human psycology, its about making the thing you fear or hate less human, thus easier to ignore or remove, in small amounts it leads to party politcs, in large amounts to warfare
[08:09:45] <cyborg_ar> but taking offense on something that demostrably wasnt targetted to you?
[08:09:48] <cyborg_ar> that's just silly
[08:09:55] <AppleDash> Well, yes
[08:10:01] <cyborg_ar> it's like purposedly jumping in front of a gun as it's being fired
[08:10:13] <AppleDash> But even things targeted at me
[08:10:42] <AppleDash> You can call me whatever you want, I do not care, because it would be dumb to let myself be affected by something like that
[08:10:49] <Coco_Pommel> not really, i can still be outraged for someone saying burn the gays even though im not
[08:10:53] <cyborg_ar> that's a nice thing to say
[08:11:14] <cyborg_ar> but if i intentionally attack you psychologically i am doing you harm
[08:11:16] <cyborg_ar> willfully
[08:11:23] <AppleDash> You're not doing me harm
[08:11:28] <AppleDash> You're attempting to, but not succeeding
[08:11:42] <AppleDash> And in the process making you look like a fool
[08:11:51] <cyborg_ar> that depends on society
[08:12:03] <cyborg_ar> if all my friends hate you i'll just look normal
[08:12:14] <cyborg_ar> and your psyche is not infallible
[08:12:25] <cyborg_ar> so i'm not against people protesting they're getting bullied
[08:12:56] <cyborg_ar> what i am agaisnt is people seeking to get bullied in exchange of attention
[08:13:00] <AppleDash> The point is to learn how to identify when someone is trying to offend you or what have you, and learn how to ignore that
[08:13:20] <cyborg_ar> because most reasonable people in a society commiserate with perceived victims
[08:14:03] <cyborg_ar> people who get high on getting that victim attention are just as bad as the bullies they use for their purposes
[08:14:26] <cyborg_ar> and adds insult to injury for real victims
[08:14:48] <cyborg_ar> that doesnt only happen with things like slander and discrimination
[08:15:06] <cyborg_ar> it's an issue with heinous crimes like rape and child abuse
[08:15:14] <AppleDash> I realize thias
[08:15:15] <AppleDash> this*
[08:15:32] <cyborg_ar> it's a really tough problem to crack
[08:15:58] <cyborg_ar> because it requires a society that can support real victims while severely punishing fake victim behavior
[08:15:59] <Shnuggles> that moment when i've heard that people have fetishes of being raped
[08:16:11] <cyborg_ar> that's another thing entirely
[08:16:33] <AppleDash> Everything is a fetish if you look around enough
[08:16:45] <Shnuggles> yea...
[08:17:00] <cyborg_ar> what i'm describing is people who put themselves in a victim situation on purpose to receive the attention real victims deserve
[08:17:06] <cyborg_ar> it's a form of self harm
[08:17:10] <Kinsley> I feel like we might be stepping a little too far from the channel, folks.
[08:17:18] <cyborg_ar> ok
[08:17:22] <cyborg_ar> ponies
[08:17:22] <Shnuggles> that is true
[08:17:23] <Shnuggles> but...
[08:17:24] <cyborg_ar> :)
[08:17:31] <Shnuggles> it is a tech thing actually..
[08:17:34] * AppleDash shrugs
[08:17:42] <cyborg_ar> not really
[08:17:43] <AppleDash> It's not like we're interrupting anyone else's discussion
[08:17:48] <Shnuggles> ethics! what a wonderful thing to learn... when.. it comes to technology..
[08:17:49] <AppleDash> Or being disruptive in some way
[08:18:01] <cyborg_ar> i take offense on that
[08:18:08] <cyborg_ar> i will call my lawyer

[08:18:22] <tiwake> lol
[08:18:41] <Shnuggles> seriously, it is a technological thing to discuss to be honest..
[08:18:50] <Kinsley> IANAL but I'm pretty sure that case would have no merit.
[08:19:13] <cyborg_ar> not with lawyers we can afford
[08:19:15] <AppleDash> We know you anal, Kinsley
[08:19:20] <cyborg_ar> HAHHAHA
[08:19:25] <Shnuggles> what AppleDash...
[08:19:30] <Kinsley> That's definitely too far. :|
[08:19:31] <Shnuggles> oh...
[08:19:34] <Shnuggles> it's uhh
[08:19:42] <cyborg_ar> yep
[08:19:45] <AppleDash> This channel is unrated
[08:19:46] <cyborg_ar> funny but far
[08:19:46] <Shnuggles> keep it classy?
[08:19:54] <Shnuggles> is this channel unrated?
[08:19:58] <AppleDash> Yes,
[08:20:03] <Shnuggles> why is there an after dark version then?
[08:20:09] <AppleDash> Because I made it as a joke.
[08:20:09] <Kinsley> It's supposed to be SFW.
[08:20:16] <Kinsley> Appledash.

[08:21:19] <Kinsley> But back to what I said. Cursing's OK, but it's supposed to be SFW>
[08:21:41] <Coco_Pommel> i think all of the above was
[08:21:41] <AppleDash> Apologies for going off of the fact that in the past I've been told by the founder that this channel is unrated and that the only thing similar I've ever been told "no" to in the past is RP.
[08:21:57] <Coco_Pommel> its no worse than what you would find on an evning newscast
[08:22:18] <Shnuggles> meh
[08:22:26] <cyborg_ar> well you can interpret it as "anal retentive"
[08:22:28] <Shnuggles> i was about to say, just because it's on the news doesn't mean it's SFW
[08:22:33] <Shnuggles> but it's played there so lol..
[08:22:47] <Kinsley> Coco_Pommel: I'm referring specifically to AppleDash's comment towards me. That definitely crossed a line for the channel.
[08:23:04] <AppleDash> See my previous message

[08:29:51] <AppleDash> And I'm going to ask him! What's the issue?
[08:29:51] <Kinsley> Geez, don't interrogate the poor guy.

[23:34:07] <JustAberrant> hehe, sigh
[23:34:20] <JustAberrant> I.. pretty much just ignore most of the internet today :(
[23:39:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> i get a good laugh out of what happens
[23:40:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> google having packman is good
[23:40:22] <JustAberrant> I dunno, maybe I've gotten too bitter
[23:40:30] <JustAberrant> I used to find some of it funny, now it all just feels lame
[23:40:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> though i did really like the Australian edition of war for the overworld
[23:40:43] <JustAberrant> like, actual plausible stuff is funny.. 
[23:41:03] <JustAberrant> stuff that basically amounts to "hurr dur, microsoft announces it'll be using linux kernel in windows 10" is just.. meh
[23:41:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: what about dos for windows phone?
[23:41:25] <JustAberrant> yeah, see, that's just lame
[23:41:51] <JustAberrant> like, I think it was last year or the year before, the svn using git as a backend was actually good because of how well they sold it
[23:42:28] <JustAberrant> but just publishing an article enthusiastically talking about how you're going to do something ridiculously implausible does even get a chuckle from me
[23:43:22] <JustAberrant> the svn git thing was amazing because they didn't just come out and say it.. they actually pushed it through their normal process and had a huge (and very authentic looking) shitstorm involving senior people that spilled out into twitter and elsewhere
