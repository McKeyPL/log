[05:38:14] <ZigSphere> Hello!
[05:38:25] <Kinsley> How's Houston's AT&T service? Can you get the 1Gbps package?
[05:38:26] <CheckMateRifle> So what's going on at the moment?
[05:38:34] <CheckMateRifle> Depends actually 
[05:39:09] <Kinsley> On what/
[05:39:13] <Kinsley> ?*
[05:40:40] <CheckMateRifle> Depends on whether you can stand going disconnected for a bit
[05:41:00] <Kinsley> Equipment upgrades?

[05:47:00] <CheckMateRifle> Does cyborg_ar do the moonwalk?
[05:47:11] <cyborg_ar> no
[05:47:31] <cyborg_ar> i'm not quite sure how one can dance backwards
[05:48:13] <CheckMateRifle> No one can but the special ones. So its either Deadpool or Michael Jackson.
[05:48:38] <cyborg_ar> the flirts seem to be dancing forwards in the video
[05:48:47] <cyborg_ar> but it could be that the dancing is time-symmetrical

[09:20:36] <Kinsley> So in Python, is there a way to have a list of strings and compare another string, but have both ignore case? E.g. if "end" in ["EnD", "begin"]:
[09:29:56] *** Q0 is now known as Q0|Away
[09:38:14] <Kinsley> Aha! There is. List comprehension!
[09:38:55] <Kinsley> My example would be like if "end".lower() in [word.lower() for word in ['EnD', 'begin
[09:39:08] <Kinsley> ']]:
[09:39:13] <Kinsley> Boo enter key
[09:39:29] *** Quits: MistVeil (aqua@Pony-prm9c8.static.axtel.net) (Quit: Saliendo)
[09:39:48] <TuxRug[tablet]> That's what I do in js. Just convert both strings to all lower or all upper before comparing.
[09:41:13] <Kinsley> Some days I wish Jordan Kinsley wasn't associated with writing pony porn. This is some neat shit I wouldn't mind sharing with the outside world.
[09:41:25] <Brolf_pog> coding?
[09:41:36] <Kinsley> Yeah, the source for Pinkie.
[09:42:38] <Brolf_pog> to be fair
[09:42:46] <Brolf_pog> i didn't know that of you until you told me
[09:42:48] <Brolf_pog> so you know..
[09:42:55] <Brolf_pog> you are what you show yourself to be
[09:45:24] <JustAberrant> hehe, yeah, there is kinda a downside to keeping various bits of your life segregated :(
[09:46:26] <JustAberrant> I actually worry about the fact that if I ever have to change jobs, my real name is associated with basically nothing
[09:47:56] <JustAberrant> anything remotely interesting that I've done, is under names associated with at best ponies stuff :>
[09:49:48] <Brolf_pog> meh
[09:49:52] <Brolf_pog> that ain't really a problem
[09:49:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> that why i keep a work alias seperate from my furry/pony aliases
[09:50:41] <JustAberrant> I feel like I should create an identity that I can share in common between work and various other communities, but it's damn near impossible to prevent groups from mixing
[09:50:53] <JustAberrant> especially as just about everything is trying to do exactly that
[09:51:17] <JustAberrant> all the big players are specifically trying to break down the idea of having "internet handles" and get people to just use their actual identities
[09:51:25] <JustAberrant> because it makes advertising way easier
[09:51:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> i keep 4 seperate aliases
[09:51:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> its not that hard
[09:52:09] <ShivalPonyWolf> none of them are my real name either
[09:52:12] <JustAberrant> sure, but are any of them known to work + some other group that you don't want to mix with work?
[09:52:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> i try and keep that offline
[09:52:18] <JustAberrant> because that's the real problem
[09:52:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> i dont list where i work publicly
[09:52:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> on any of them
[09:52:46] <JustAberrant> not the point
[09:52:57] <JustAberrant> say you make "really cool thing x"
[09:53:14] <JustAberrant> and you want to share it with friends in "really scary community a"
[09:53:21] <JustAberrant> but also want to share it with "guys from work"
[09:53:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive never had that issue
[09:53:33] <ShivalPonyWolf> my work and personal projects are seperate
[09:54:13] <JustAberrant> fair enough, but this entire thing started with the complaint about not being able to share personal projects with people outside these communities (i.e. work)
[09:54:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> replicate the project under a work safe alias
[09:54:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> most people wont bother searching out if it exists somewhere else
[09:55:19] <JustAberrant> that seems disingenuous 
[09:55:37] <JustAberrant> plus I'm also talking things like contributions to other projects
[09:55:54] <JustAberrant> it all gets very complicated :(
[09:56:09] <Brolf_pog> to be fair
[09:56:14] <Brolf_pog> i don't see the issue with it
[09:56:30] <Brolf_pog> if i shall put it bluntly
[09:56:54] <Brolf_pog> there isn't a reason your life both online and off should coincide, unless you are shameful of something
[09:56:55] <JustAberrant> if your not someone who keeps (or has to keep) a different image for work, yeah, it's fine
[09:57:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> Brolf_pog: its self protection
[09:57:09] <Brolf_pog> there isn't a reason your life both online and off shouldn't coincide, unless you are shameful of something
[09:57:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> you might accept multiple sides of your life
[09:57:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> but your company might not
[09:57:21] <Brolf_pog> if your company does not
[09:57:25] <Brolf_pog> why are you working for them?
[09:57:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> remember in places its still legal to sack soemone who is gay
[09:57:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> becuase you need money to survive
[09:57:42] <Brolf_pog> is that really the reason?
[09:57:43] <JustAberrant> Brolf_pog: because pragmatism ;p
[09:58:11] <Brolf_pog> except...
[09:58:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> you dont want your online personality to be a hinderance to your RL prospects 
[09:58:26] <JustAberrant> in the perfect world, sure, everyone would be able to walk around with their finely honed sense of identity.. 
[09:58:27] <Brolf_pog> every single industry i have seen personally within programing related work fields
[09:58:36] <Brolf_pog> people not only do not care about these things
[09:58:42] <Brolf_pog> but they actually prefer it
[09:59:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> got to remember there are people out there who will disagree with the communities you are in and hunt down where you work and try and get you sacked
[09:59:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> and its happend ALOT
[10:00:00] <Brolf_pog> yes?
[10:00:08] <Brolf_pog> but what point are you going to make hiding such things anyhow?
[10:00:30] <JustAberrant> not everyone is interested in making a point
[10:01:17] <Brolf_pog> hmm
[10:01:24] <Brolf_pog> not in my personal experience... but..
[10:02:27] <JustAberrant> either way, I like being able to say and do things without having to consider how it will come back to bite my career in the ass
[10:02:47] <JustAberrant> and I like being able to say those things without them being associated with the company I work for
[10:03:46] <JustAberrant> admittedly not an issue for everyone, but if you have any kind of public association with your company, you do end up having to watch what you say
[10:04:04] <Brolf_pog> well yes...
[10:04:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: yeah thats why alot of companies have social media policies now
[10:04:15] <Brolf_pog> i understand not wanting your actions being associated with your company
[10:04:18] <JustAberrant> if some customer plugs my name into google and gets weird ponies stuff, it could have a negative impact
[10:04:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: my companies takes about an hour to go though
[10:04:53] <ShivalPonyWolf> and you have to do the 'training' every year
[10:04:57] <JustAberrant> hehe
[10:05:22] *** Quits: Toler (rattle@Pony-f1emhe.ph.cox.net) (Quit: )
[10:06:17] <JustAberrant> anyway, it's a case of wanting to make and eat the cake
[10:06:32] <JustAberrant> you can either say fuck it, and live one identity
[10:06:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: one of my aliases is not directly linked to furry or RL but has elements of both it doesnt exist on forums or ahve any art. it couldnt really even be called furry but it has some furry followers and work followers its a place i can put thigns for both
[10:06:38] <JustAberrant> and deal with the various problems that comes from that
[10:06:50] <JustAberrant> or live multiple ones, and deal with the various problems that comes from that
[10:07:33] <JustAberrant> both have an upside and a downside.. I think I prefer keeping everything split up, but as said, I do find it annoying when I do something I think is cool and am limited in who I can talk to it about
[10:07:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive never really had a problem with mine and keepthign things close enough
[10:07:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> its more about taking info out of things then makeing up info
[10:08:13] <Brolf_pog> well for me
[10:08:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> it also helps that this is how ive worked since i 1st got online like 20 years ago
[10:08:23] <Brolf_pog> i've always lived my life open
[10:08:32] <Brolf_pog> life*
[10:08:46] <Brolf_pog> i find it usually works out better to do that over the long run
[10:09:19] <JustAberrant> I like being able to rant about how much something sucks.. and not have someone find it and use it against me (or more specifically, the company I work for)
[10:09:35] <JustAberrant> I feel like while living open would seem more free, it would actually feel way more restrictive
[10:09:44] <JustAberrant> in my case at least
[10:09:52] <Brolf_pog> hmm..
[10:10:12] <Brolf_pog> i suppose, in my line of thinking, i don't worry or prepare for people to be jerks
[10:10:59] <Brolf_pog> so i don't worry about what i say. I do have one comment though, if i am representing something, it does restrict what i do
[10:11:27] <Brolf_pog> for instance, my current relationship i am pursuing.
[10:11:38] <JustAberrant> if your name is on something big enough, you are pretty much always representing it :(
[10:11:58] <Brolf_pog> If there would be little issues on it on his side, i wouldn't mind announcing it.
[10:12:11] <Brolf_pog> heh
[10:12:12] <Brolf_pog> well..
[10:12:23] <Brolf_pog> living as a christian, kind of the story of my life JustAberrant 
[10:13:57] <JustAberrant> heh, well thats all very poetic, but I'm talking a bit more in a direct sense
[10:14:33] <JustAberrant> i.e. your a project manager or technical lead on something big program
[10:14:37] <Brolf_pog> well if your name is literally on something big, so everyone knows about it (or a high percentage)
[10:14:53] <JustAberrant> it doesn't have to be huge
[10:15:08] <Brolf_pog> 2% is a high percent
[10:15:12] <Brolf_pog> actually..
[10:15:12] <JustAberrant> every company has competitors, and every project has people who are it's public face
[10:15:15] <Brolf_pog> 1% is high
[10:16:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> hmm is there a 1080p youtube of the latest episode yet?
[10:16:19] <JustAberrant> and things don't have to be that big of a scale for competitors to be poking around at that public face
[10:16:49] <Finwe> ShivalPonyWolf:  The best I found yesterday was 720p.
[10:17:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> Finwe: yeah thats all i found to
[10:17:12] <Finwe> That was about 12 hours ago.
[10:17:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> the like to the 1080 has been apparently proccessing all day
[10:17:14] <Kinsley> I saw a Dailymotion vid at 1080p
[10:17:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> link
[10:17:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: yeah i was considering just downloading that
[10:17:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> youtube streams are far easier to download though
[10:18:14] <Kinsley> I'd torrent at that point.
[10:18:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> couldnt find a torrent yet either
[10:18:25] <Kinsley> The Dailymotion link is 1.9 GB...
[10:18:33] * JustAberrant uses youtube-dl .. it's got plugins for quite a bit of stuff
[10:18:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah thats not too bad
[10:18:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> could be better
[10:18:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> youtube has far better compression 
[10:18:53] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: me to
[10:18:53] <JustAberrant> I'm actually continually amazed when I plug in some random site and there's a specific plugin for it
[10:19:01] <JustAberrant> like zero punctuation :>
[10:19:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> i just like youtubes compression to quality ratio
[10:19:48] <Kinsley> I'm not a fan.
[10:19:56] <ShivalPonyWolf> i watched the livestream last night but id light to watch it in 1080p now on big screen
[10:19:59] <Kinsley> But I keep watching gameplay vids of games I own, so....
[10:20:13] <JustAberrant> :>
[10:20:18] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: not enough time to play so watch other people play instead?
[10:20:43] <Kinsley> Part of the deal with moving back with my parents is that I can't set up my tower until I find work again. :(
[10:20:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> ouch
[10:21:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> can sorta understand the reasoning. atleast they arnt cutting you off the ent and expecting you to still jobhunt
[10:22:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> i soo woudl never live with my parents again after leaving
[10:22:46] <Kinsley> SPW: not an option, really.
[10:22:52] <Kinsley> It was that or go homeless.
[10:23:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah i did homeless
[10:23:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> lucky it was only about 2 weeks
[10:23:49] <JustAberrant> cruel, but I guess that's one way to motivate a person :(
[10:24:10] <ShivalPonyWolf> here has alot better though due to assistance programs and options
[10:24:13] <JustAberrant> still kinda shitty, job hunting is a hurry up and wait game imo
[10:24:15] <Kinsley> That wasn't on the table.
[10:24:17] <JustAberrant> you can't make people call you
[10:24:30] <JustAberrant> and there are only so many places in a local area :(
[10:24:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: yeah
[10:24:51] <Kinsley> Like, it's not like my folks were saying "Join us minus the tower or go homeless"
[10:24:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> i love people who think that its just a matter of calling upa nd you have a job
[10:25:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: yeah atleast you had the option
[10:25:33] <ShivalPonyWolf> its better then not
[10:25:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> good luck jobhunting
[10:25:52] <Kinsley> Fucking hell, though, moving this time was probably the single most demanding thing I've done.
[10:26:10] <ShivalPonyWolf> can see that
[10:26:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> idependance back to under parents roof again
[10:27:43] <Kinsley> Within the span of 36 hours, my dad and I packed up my apartment, cleaned it from top to bottom, loaded all my shit into my car, his truck, and a Uhaul trailer, and then drove more 550 miles to get home, then slept for a bit, then unloaded my shit from the trailer and started to sort it.
[10:27:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> wow
[10:28:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats kinda impressive
[10:28:17] <JustAberrant> damn ;p
[10:29:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> sounds like your dad isnt too bad helping like that
[10:29:59] <Kinsley> All things considered, it's pretty awesome to be home.
[10:30:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> being fed?
[10:30:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:30:29] <Kinsley> Heh.
[10:30:53] <Kinsley> I didn't go hungry back in the apartment, but there's been a noticeable bump in quality, you know?
[10:30:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> no rent/bills well reduced
[10:31:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah
[10:31:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> quality and having soemone cook for you is great
[10:31:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> im just glad i can cook well
[10:31:31] <Kinsley> Less canned soup and more chicken marsala
[10:31:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:31:40] <JustAberrant> I seriously think I wouldn't mind living with at home again.. when I moved out it was more of a logistical thing.. we got along great (and still do)
[10:31:42] <Kinsley> Ha! Cook /for/ me!
[10:32:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> mmmm instant noodles 
[10:32:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: ive always wwondered what it would have been like to actualyl have the option to choose to move out of home
[10:32:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> or move back
[10:32:59] <Kinsley> I mean, the only real reason why I moved out in the first place was because they were preparing to move here last year, but my job was continuing.
[10:33:08] <JustAberrant> we never did the family meal thing (everyone just kinda ate whenever), and my mom's cooking is actually kinda terrible except for a handful of things.. 
[10:33:10] <Kinsley> Lost the job, so moved. Just a year later.
[10:33:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> ahhh
[10:33:26] <JustAberrant> ShivalPonyWolf: yeah, I'm the first to admit I've had a pretty cushy life compared to others
[10:33:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: my parents were strict on the family meal thing
[10:33:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> i hated it
[10:34:12] <Kinsley> We loosened up on the family meal thing as my younger sister and I got on into our teenage years.
[10:34:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> i never got to chose to leave it was forced. it certainly sucekd at the start
[10:34:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> bills suck lol
[10:34:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> funny thing is
[10:35:06] <Kinsley> There was the family meal that got made regardless (unless there were leftovers or something) but you didn't /have/ to eat it. You just had to make your own dinner.
[10:35:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> im far more successful then if anything different had happend
[10:35:29] <JustAberrant> . good home growing up, no real problems with school, took a bit to get a job out of school, and I was unemployed for about 3 months (but had enough savings + ei that it wasn't really a hardship.. just nerve wracking), and now I'm buying a house *shrugs*
[10:35:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> nice
[10:35:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> im having the trouble building up enough savings for the homeloan deposit
[10:36:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: thats not a bad situation there
[10:37:16] <Kinsley> Well, I had to do the prep for the family meal regardless of whether or not I was eating it, so...
[10:37:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> ahhh
[10:37:30] <ShivalPonyWolf> still not terrible
[10:37:32] * JustAberrant has actually been in a position to do it for like 3 years, but I've been paranoid due to various politics .. now that those issues are largely gone, I'm pulling the trigger
[10:37:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: good luck
[10:37:47] <JustAberrant> yeah
[10:38:02] <Kinsley> Combined with my... lack of pickyness when it comes to eating, more often than not I went with what I contributed to.
[10:38:15] <JustAberrant> anyway, that got off topic :S
[10:38:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:38:22] <ShivalPonyWolf> but a good topic anyway
[10:38:32] <JustAberrant> we didn't do family meals more or less because of our pickiness :D
[10:38:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> i should get dinner
[10:38:38] <JustAberrant> and because my mom can't cook anyway
[10:38:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:38:46] *** Joins: Phase4 (Phase4@Pony-i7fe8t.internode.on.net)
[10:38:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> my mum couldnt cook
[10:38:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> she just thoguht she could
[10:38:59] <Kinsley> My mum stopped cooking when she went back to finish her degree(s).
[10:39:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> it wasent great
[10:39:21] * JustAberrant thinks it's important that families have _something_ they do together
[10:39:27] <JustAberrant> we used to watch tv/movies a lot
[10:39:33] <ShivalPonyWolf> its been i think 7 years nwo since ive visted vamily
[10:39:43] <Kinsley> She's still good, but just does it for special occasions. Like Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, or a few times a year when she does one of her lasagnas.
[10:40:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive spoken occasioanly over the phone and mum visited 2 or 3 times
[10:40:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> but i avoid contact as much as possible
[10:40:22] <ShivalPonyWolf> its just easier that way
[10:40:24] <JustAberrant> :(
[10:40:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> no arguments no fights
[10:40:33] <ShivalPonyWolf> and the less i have to talk to my sister the better
[10:41:20] *** Quits: Phase5 (Phase4@Pony-k187tq.internode.on.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[10:41:44] <Kinsley> Heard that with the sister thing.
[10:41:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> my sister uninvited me from her wedding becuase she thought i would steal focus from her from the extended family who hadent seen me in afew years
[10:42:17] <JustAberrant> yikes
[10:42:19] <Kinsley> My younger sister has had this giant fucking stick up her ass for, oh, 18 years? She's 20
[10:42:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: lol my sister still ahs that stick but i think its more a telephone pole
[10:43:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> when i was forced to leave she became the perfect little favourite
[10:43:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> so got everything she wanted
[10:44:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> i found it really funny but it was just more justification that it wasent worth having her invovled in my life at all
[10:45:00] <JustAberrant> :(
[10:45:05] <Kinsley> We kinda got the same things growing up, but there were some times when things went differently. Like, I got to see the Stanley Cup with my dad and older brother. She went to Washington D.C. a few times.
[10:45:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> i have a much younger brother as well
[10:45:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> 10 years differnce
[10:45:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> he got picked on at school becuase he kept telling his friends he had a big brother
[10:45:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> but id already left by then
[10:46:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> so they thoought he was making me up
[10:46:12] <Kinsley> There's 9 years between me and my older sister, 8 years for the older brother, and I'm a little over 2 years older than my younger sister.
[10:46:42] * JustAberrant 2 younger sisters.. we get along reasonably well.. though one of them is a source of perpetual drama for completely unknown reasons
[10:46:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: interesting span of time
[10:47:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> my little brother was an accident
[10:48:05] <JustAberrant> shes like pretty much always going through some crazy breakup or problem at work or car thing or apartment thing or whatever.. it's like she jumps from catastrophe to catastrophe
[10:48:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol drama from siblings
[10:48:18] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:48:32] <JustAberrant> like it's not really her fault.. it just seems like somehow when things go wrong, they just do so in the most directly dramatic way
[10:49:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> so shes a reality tv show
[10:49:29] <Kinsley> ShivalPonyWolf: older bro and sis are from Dad's previous marriage.
[10:49:31] <JustAberrant> her gut reaction to pretty much any situation is to do the exact thing that will immediately make it worse
[10:49:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: ahhhh
[10:49:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah that makes sence now
[10:50:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: and she still hasent learnt that lesson?
[10:50:18] <JustAberrant> you'd have to know her ;p
[10:50:23] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:50:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> she sounds amusing to just sit back and watch
[10:50:39] <Kinsley> Funny story, though: I'm leaning towards there being a genetic component to being LGBT: 3/4 of Dad's kids are. Only brother is straight.
[10:50:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:52:10] <ShivalPonyWolf> well atleast he didnt react badly right?
[10:52:16] <JustAberrant> she's the kind of person that gets a flat tire, then angerly kicks the car and somehow manages to knock out the headlight
[10:52:35] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: lol
[10:53:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: reations liek thas is why my housemate goes though a keyboard every 2-3 months
[10:53:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> looses at a game and destorys it
[10:53:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> he has some issues
[10:53:31] <JustAberrant> hah
[10:54:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: it is one thing i have alwasy wondered, how differnt would my life have been if my parents wern't assholes over the whole gay thing
[10:55:04] <JustAberrant> random story, my sister is bi.. she came out and it was no big deal, but no one ever told me.. everyone just somehow assumed I knew
[10:55:20] <JustAberrant> and I'm totally oblivious to all things.. 
[10:55:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:56:20] <JustAberrant> so yeah.. she was dating this girl for like 2 years that I just assumed was a good friend of hers
[10:56:25] <Kinsley> My parents were always OK with any of us being gay. I think I was like 12 when they talked about it? It sat in the back of my mind for a while.
[10:56:25] <JustAberrant> and everyone just assumed I knew
[10:56:31] <JustAberrant> and it just like never came up
[10:56:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> Kinsley: lucky
[10:58:26] <JustAberrant> mine would be too :)
[10:58:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> JustAberrant: you didnt ask your sisters GF out did you?
[10:59:08] <ShivalPonyWolf> mine were decidandly not ok with it
[10:59:10] <Kinsley> Do it, filly
[10:59:19] <JustAberrant> nah, I couldn't stand her.. but I totally might have.. and that woulda been so fucking awkward..
[10:59:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[10:59:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> it would have been ffunny though
[10:59:55] <JustAberrant> but yeah, it was the biggest "oh.. that explains.. holy shit" type moments ever
[11:00:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[11:00:26] <JustAberrant> it does say a lot for our family that my reaction to finding out my sister was bi was amusement..
[11:00:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah
[11:01:11] <JustAberrant> I suspect if I ever admitted to being a brony (I'm straight, so it's the best skeleton I've got..) .. I'd be mocked mercilessly though
[11:03:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> i think thats what happens to most who tell their family
[11:04:34] <JustAberrant> we grew up watching way too many sitcoms and we kinda adopted that mindset
[11:05:25] <JustAberrant> we're like a weird combination of rosanne and home improvement :D
[11:05:30] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[11:08:14] * JustAberrant once again admits he's got a pretty cushy life :(
[11:08:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> we all have to deal with the cards we get dealt
[11:09:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> it would have still been your fault if you screwed what you were given up

[11:11:20] * JustAberrant looks casually at PrincessCelestia 
[11:11:46] <JustAberrant> it's like 6am.. I should probably be in bed :(
[11:11:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[11:11:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> its 7pm here
[11:12:17] <PrincessCelestia> It's 2 AM. I need to be awake in 3 hours.
[11:12:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol times to get to bed
[11:12:37] <JustAberrant> awake at 5am is criminal :(
[11:12:52] <JustAberrant> I'd rather stay up till 5am then get up at 5am :(
[11:12:57] <PrincessCelestia> It's that or go without transportation 'til Wednesday

[11:13:06] <JustAberrant> fair `nuff
[11:13:20] <JustAberrant> go get some sleep ;p
[11:13:29] <JustAberrant> and hope things work out :)
[11:14:05] <Finwe> Unless it's because your flight leaves that early.
[11:14:43] <JustAberrant> if it's a flight I'd stay up and sleep on the plane
[11:14:45] <Finwe> Or if you're in the army and under order to wake up at that time.
[11:14:51] <JustAberrant> seriously, passed out is the best way to fly
[11:15:23] <PrincessCelestia> My last couple of plane trips have been too short to sleep on.
[11:15:44] <Compu> i never been on a plane
[11:15:58] <PrincessCelestia> I've been on a few.
[11:16:08] <PrincessCelestia> Mostly turbo prop, oddly enough.
[11:16:14] <JustAberrant> Compu: it's seriously nothing to rush out and try ;p
[11:16:19] <JustAberrant> like.. taking off is cool
[11:16:21] <PrincessCelestia> (short flights)
[11:16:31] <JustAberrant> literally every other aspect is boring and tedious and shitty
[11:16:40] <Compu> JustAberrant: i cant try it, its way too expensive
[11:16:55] <JustAberrant> you have to get to the airport and some weird hour and like 2 hours early because airlines are dicks
[11:17:08] <JustAberrant> and then it's always delayed because airlines are also incompetent
[11:17:24] <PrincessCelestia> Yeah, last time I went through security I had biscuit mix in my suitcase. Guess who got additional screening?
[11:17:44] <JustAberrant> then you spend some time dealing with the least cheerful people on the planet
[11:17:52] <JustAberrant> and yeah, that
[11:17:59] <JustAberrant> then you sit, and wait
[11:18:22] <JustAberrant> then you get on the plane, and spend some more time waiting
[11:18:51] <JustAberrant> then you taxi and take off, which as said, is actually kinda cool
[11:19:03] <JustAberrant> and then wait..
[11:19:15] <JustAberrant> and it pretty much just gets shittier from there ;p
[11:19:25] <PrincessCelestia> I will say that Alaska is pretty cool because they serve free beer and wine on some of their flights.
[11:19:33] <JustAberrant> for a mode of transport that's really fast, it feels like you waste most of your day
[11:20:29] <JustAberrant> Compu: interestingly, I don't think I've ever actually paid for my own flight
[11:21:07] <JustAberrant> just about every time I've flown as an adult has been for work
[11:21:29] <PrincessCelestia> I paid for one flight.
[11:21:46] <PrincessCelestia> Everything else was flying to or with family for a vacation
[11:21:54] <JustAberrant> except the one time shortly after I finished school where I was gonna drive and my grandparents paid for a flight so I wouldn't have to drive through a potential blizzard
[11:21:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> when i was on a trip tot he US
[11:22:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> i got flagged becuase i appeared too excited
[11:22:28] <ShivalPonyWolf> so got extra screaning
[11:22:42] <JustAberrant> hehe
[11:22:51] <JustAberrant> "dudes happy at the airport, he's up to something..."
[11:23:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> i also apparently looked strange
[11:23:18] <ShivalPonyWolf> i had been up for 18 hours about to get on a 15 hour flight
[11:23:18] <PrincessCelestia> I need to reign in the number of electronic devices I travel with.
[11:23:37] <ShivalPonyWolf> atleast it was buisness class
[11:23:42] <PrincessCelestia> Probably didn't help the biscuit mix situation when I've got a laptop and a billion charging cables...
[11:23:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> so i could sleep
[11:24:34] <JustAberrant> hehe
[11:24:38] <Compu> PrincessCelestia: i never been on vacation
[11:24:57] * JustAberrant has never traveled for vacation
[11:25:00] <JustAberrant> I hate traveling
[11:25:28] <PrincessCelestia> The two MAJOR places I've been, I didn't pay for. Manhattan and Honolulu.
[11:25:37] <JustAberrant> like.. the worlds and oyster and all that, but I'd rather just watch TV and drink :>
[11:26:11] *** PrincessCelestia is now known as Kinsley
[11:26:47] <JustAberrant> and also hotels
[11:27:12] <JustAberrant> last time I traveled, I'm pretty sure they actually washed the sheets in a mixture of chlorine and starch
[11:27:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive been afew places in AU and the only oversease trip has been US going to vegas though LAX
[11:29:46] <JustAberrant> I would like to some day go to a convention that I would enjoy
[11:30:03] <JustAberrant> and not like, a convention on data centric infrastructure..
[11:30:24] <JustAberrant> (which one doesn't exactly come home with amazing stories from)

[11:30:51] <JustAberrant> :)
[11:31:57] <JustAberrant> I honestly don't think I'd enjoy a brony convention
[11:32:17] <JustAberrant> not just cause I keep it secret
[11:32:56] <JustAberrant> I guess a lot of the big draws don't appeal to me

[22:12:31] <cyborg_ar> planes have spoiled me
[22:12:43] <cyborg_ar> traveling by land seems so slow now
[22:14:53] <JustAberrant> hehe
[22:15:10] <JustAberrant> honestly if I can drive it in a day, I'd rather that than fly there ;p
[22:15:17] <JustAberrant> unless I have to take a ferry
[22:15:26] <JustAberrant> cause ferries are the only thing worse than planes
[22:16:15] <JustAberrant> on a ferry, time actually ceases to exist, only boredom and a deep hatred of human kind
[22:19:02] <cyborg_ar> lol
[22:19:07] <cyborg_ar> planes are ok

[22:22:29] <cyborg_ar> :( i feel i'm gonna get disappointed when i move to north america

[22:23:56] <JustAberrant> cyborg_ar: yes, yes you are ;p
[22:24:10] <JustAberrant> they don't even serve meals on a lot of flights any more here
[22:24:57] <cyborg_ar> that meal was in a 5 hour long flight from bogota, colombia to santiago de chile
[22:26:16] <cyborg_ar> had a similar one in a 3 hour flight from buenos aires to lima, peru
[22:27:02] <cyborg_ar> the other short legs were coffee or OJ with a little but tasty ham and cheese sandwich
