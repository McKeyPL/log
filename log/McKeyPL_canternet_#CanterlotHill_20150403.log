[04:22:15] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> thereallynewmop12100_: Although not all are the same.
[04:22:40] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> thereallynewmop12100_: Tokusatsu has people dressed in costumes.
[04:22:58] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> thereallynewmop12100_: But you probably already knew that.
[04:24:16] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> thereallynewmop12100_: In any case, yes Kamen Rider Drive is cool.
[04:24:33] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> thereallynewmop12100_: The theme song alone is good.
[04:24:58] <Sketchy_Sounds> TokusatsuKuuga-RX, you know you don't have to use his name every time you want to get his attention, right?
[04:25:22] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Sketchy_Sounds: Sorry I did not know.
[04:25:38] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> ...
[04:25:43] <Eywind> Sketchy_Sounds: Please teach me life
[04:25:44] * TokusatsuKuuga-RX foot popped
[04:25:47] <Sketchy_Sounds> Jst conduct conversation like you would in real life. XD
[04:25:55] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay
[04:25:57] <Eywind> Sketchy_Sounds: I always start every sentence with the person I'm addressing
[04:26:14] <Sketchy_Sounds> No you don't :p
[04:26:27] <Eywind> Sketchy_Sounds you don't know me!
[04:26:39] <Eywind> Ok I'm done
[04:26:49] <Sketchy_Sounds> Was just gonna say, I have logs :p
[04:26:57] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t Life 
[04:26:57] <Eywind> I meant IRL
[04:26:58] <DinkyBot> Which meant Half Life 3 tastes like disappointment
[04:27:00] <Eywind> that'd be super awkward
[04:27:18] <Sketchy_Sounds> You'd end up sounding like some kind of automaton.
[04:27:26] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Back to what I was saying, I do not want anyone to embaress me at BABScon.
[04:27:40] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I have a reputation to uphold.
[04:27:50] <MikeM> Oh! Let's play worst case scenario.
[04:27:57] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh no.
[04:28:39] <thereallynewmop12100_> MikeM pls 
[04:28:39] <MikeM> Are you meeting people there?
[04:28:40] <Eywind> wait why would that happen?
[04:29:01] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: Not really.
[04:29:09] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: But still.
[04:29:16] <Eywind> you're doing it again
[04:29:44] *** Joins: Octavius_Scratch (uolyqlkwhzr@Pony-skl2cf.nh.comcast.net)
[04:30:05] <MikeM> So what's the embarrassment that might happen?
[04:30:50] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Someone could say what I do on channel for one.
[04:30:57] <Eywind> who cares
[04:31:01] <Eywind> "hey you're that dude that um talks sometimes?"
[04:31:03] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: Fine.
[04:31:05] <MikeM> Talk about ponies?
[04:31:17] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: Oh yeah that.
[04:31:21] <Eywind> Odds are if you go somewhere you do things you're afraid that people are going to talk about
[04:31:27] <Eywind> they probs aren't gonna talk about it too
[04:31:35] <Eywind> But aren't you going to a pony con? :/
[04:31:40] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay good to know Eywind.
[04:31:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yes I am.
[04:31:49] * thereallynewmop12100_ is watching #TheSlap (S1 Finale) 
[04:31:58] <Eywind> so who cares if people talk about you being in a pony channel
[04:32:04] <MikeM> You're going to be surrounded by other people who like ponies, and are roughly your age.
[04:32:10] <Sketchy_Sounds> So basically you've nothing to worry about. Just go and have fun :p
[04:32:13] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> That is true.
[04:32:38] <Eywind> If there's someone you feel like would wanna hang out
[04:32:46] <Eywind> check twitter or something and see if someone is there
[04:32:51] <Sketchy_Sounds> 'sides even if something did happen that you found embarrassing, within a few days who's gonna care? No-one's gonna remember it.
[04:32:56] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay I will.
[04:33:18] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Also true a few days help with things.
[04:33:21] <Eywind> ^^^
[04:33:28] <Eywind> senpai sketchy is always right
[04:33:31] <Sketchy_Sounds> I remember far more the fun things I've experienced at the cons I've been to than any of the negatives.
[04:33:44] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Nice
[04:34:00] <Sketchy_Sounds> Like at GalaCon last year when PixelKitties couldn't hold all this beer.
[04:34:16] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> And plus I might find me a lady friend ^///^ d
[04:34:21] <Eywind> XD
[04:34:22] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t Mare Friend
[04:34:23] <DinkyBot> M3reel : Iron Mare?
[04:34:23] <Eywind> Umm
[04:34:27] <Eywind> TokusatsuKuuga-RX I wouldn't go in with that as an expectation
[04:34:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh...
[04:34:52] <Eywind> I mean it's not impossible
[04:35:01] <Eywind> but like I wouldn't go in and start m'ladying and courting random people
[04:35:08] <Sketchy_Sounds> It's not impossible, but it's unlikely. Just go have fun and make some friends :)
[04:35:21] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: Darn I was going to do that.
[04:35:23] <Eywind> Yeah and if you're solo you can easily find solo or small groups to hang out with 
[04:35:24] <Eywind> Lol
[04:35:28] <Eywind> I hope that was sarcasm :P
[04:35:31] <Pony_2072> H hello
[04:35:35] <Eywind> Hi Pony_2072
[04:35:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: No it was not serious.
[04:35:51] <Eywind> I mean you obviously want to treat women with respect
[04:36:02] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: Of course I do that.
[04:36:16] <Eywind> but putting them on a pedistal, especially somewhere they went to go hang out with people they know and chill out doing something you like seeing, is probably not a good idea
[04:36:26] <Sketchy_Sounds> He said he wasn't seriouis, dude. XD
[04:36:29] <Eywind> Bleh I'm too tired to say words
[04:36:31] <Eywind> Oh got it
[04:36:32] <Eywind> :P
[04:36:45] <Eywind> Sorry my sleeping pills are kicking in lol
[04:36:57] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I meant I was serious.
[04:37:06] <Eywind> Oh

[04:37:11] <DerpyBot> Twilight told me this video is about 3 Day Party Weekend [Feat. Octavia & Vinyl Scratch]
[04:37:13] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: Yeap...
[04:37:22] <MikeM> And don't forget the helpful tips in there.
[04:37:26] <Eywind> XD
[04:37:29] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> But yes treat girls with respect.
[04:37:34] <Eywind> Well you wanna go in with an attitude to have fun
[04:37:39] <Eywind> meet some new people at some panels or in the hallways or something
[04:37:47] <Eywind> if something more comes then so be it, but don't force it
[04:37:49] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> True.
[04:37:51] <Sketchy_Sounds> Treat women as fellow humans rather than mystical beings that must be wooed.
[04:37:53] <Eywind> and don't just stalk girls that look single
[04:37:56] <Eywind> cuz that's bad
[04:38:09] <Eywind> "hey female human you seem to be alone"
[04:38:13] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh no I never do such a thing Eywind.
[04:38:32] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> So beneath me.
[04:38:37] <Eywind> Pls

[04:39:09] * DerpyBot catches DinkyBot and puts her on her back
[04:39:14] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> In any case it will be fun.
[04:39:32] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh...
[04:39:38] * TokusatsuKuuga-RX looks at his nose.
[04:39:42] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh no.

[04:40:57] <Eywind> umm
[04:41:01] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Yes/
[04:41:04] <Eywind> nice to know
[04:41:08] <Sketchy_Sounds> Oh no, a spot on your nose when you're gonna be among loads of other geeks, you'll look so out of place. :p
[04:41:27] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Okay fine.
[04:41:40] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> But still I like to kepp my skin nice and clean.
[04:41:45] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> *keep
[04:41:49] <MikeM> Cosplay it.
[04:42:08] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: How do you cosplay a pimple.
[04:42:25] <Pony_2072> How is everyone
[04:42:27] <Coco_Pommel> cover it with a little makeup
[04:42:35] <MikeM> Well, I was thinking more like a generic nerd, but the pimple could be done.
[04:42:36] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh make up.
[04:42:40] <Eywind> or like
[04:42:47] <Eywind> at least make sure you don't pop it by pinching it and stuff
[04:42:50] <Eywind> if you want it to heal faster
[04:43:09] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: Okay
[04:43:18] <Eywind> also
[04:43:28] <Eywind> make sure you go early-ish to the con

[04:48:28] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Sorry made up my mind.
[04:48:28] <Sketchy_Sounds> You'll stand out like a sore thumb and you'll feel super self-conscious about it.
[04:48:37] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> No I will not.
[04:48:44] <Sketchy_Sounds> Remember how you didn't wanna be embarrassed? That would be the embarrassing thing.
[04:48:47] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> I not that scared.
[04:49:24] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Besides it is my costume.
[04:49:46] <Eywind> you are cosplaying as?

[04:51:28] <MikeM> What does the arm band represent?
[04:51:42] <Eywind> I could make a REALLY bad reference right now
[04:51:46] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: I have not made it yet.
[04:52:08] <MikeM> What _will_ the arm band represent?
[04:53:52] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: Just the characters 特撮
[04:54:07] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> So yeah that
[04:56:02] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> MikeM: Nothing too special.

[04:56:32] <Eywind> Just understand that people won't get it
[04:56:37] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Also my fingerless gloves if I can find them.
[04:56:58] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: No worries I wil tell them.
[04:57:03] <Eywind> and that it probably will alienate you
[04:57:15] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Eywind: As I said not worried.
[04:57:19] <Eywind> Yes you are
[04:57:32] <Eywind> you were just afraid you would get embarrassed at the con
[04:57:33] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Again not about my clothes.
[04:57:38] <Eywind> But about the social interaction?
[04:57:43] <Eywind> Three responses you'll get from that cosplay
[04:57:47] <Eywind> "Oh okay..." and they'll leave
[04:57:54] <Sketchy_Sounds> Eywind, better to just let him learn the hard way at this rate.
[04:57:57] <Eywind> Yeah that's true
[04:58:04] <Eywind> Why are you cosplaying a japanese student at a brony convention?
[04:58:19] <vi[NLR]> hi DinkyBot. i'm fine, thx! just a little busy :)

[14:40:40] <WildSoft> Well, I have my favourites, but I don't either want to abuse the system. Was just criticising the harsh settings for when you feel like hearing more than 1 song an hour (when gaming for example) 
[14:41:48] <Araxnus> Ah I see. Okay.

[14:43:05] <Cloud_Zephyr> it looks like we are going to have another coalition :(
[14:43:07] <WildSoft> a code similar to what RandomNinja said would be much better in my opinion =) Or you got X-amount of song requests in a day perhaps  
[14:43:34] <WildSoft> and then the requests got randomly inserted between the "normal" program
[14:46:04] <Araxnus> It is setup like that. Just a song per hour was setup so no one person could fill the queue. But it was setup years ago when The Radio had over 300 lsteners.
[14:47:08] <WildSoft> I understand and like I said I understand the need to regulate it so it doesn't get abused. But as it is now ... :) Think about it =)
