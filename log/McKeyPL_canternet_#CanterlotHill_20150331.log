[21:21:20] <LightSpeed> well RazorDash keep in mind that we came up with the term 4 corners of the world which would mean that it was created because of the persons perception of how the world is shaped
[21:21:48] <thereallynewmop12100_> LightSpeed:  Which corner is Canada & The UK? 
[21:22:22] <LightSpeed> idk RazorDash brought up the term 4 corners
[21:23:02] <LightSpeed> i was just contradicting what he said by stating it is a term that humans created because they believe the earth ir round
[21:23:15] <RazorDash> canada is the northwest and the UK is the north east
