[03:53:58] <RedHelper> So I installed Debian 7 on my laptop. And I need help installing a Flash Player on my Firefox
[03:53:59] <PinkiePieBot> [ The Perry Bible Fellowship ]
[03:55:38] <RedHelper> Is there anyway to installing the Flash Player? Or do I have to go back to Windows?
[03:55:39] <Colgate> apt-get install flashplayer or gnash
[03:55:53] <Phase4> adobes is called flashplugin-nonfree
[03:56:05] <Colgate> "flashplugin-nonfree"
[03:56:31] <Colgate> had to look it up :P
[03:56:39] <RedHelper> E: Package 'flashplugin-nonfree' has no installation candidate
[03:56:41] <Phase4> in contrib apparently
[03:57:03] <tiwake> you don't really want flash installed tbh, adobe stopped pushing updates, and even in the most up to date windows flash player, there are about 500 serious security issues with it
[03:57:05] <Phase4> RedHelper, in sources.list, where it says main change it to main contrib non-free
[03:57:31] <Phase4> tiwake, no one wants to install flash, much like no one wants to install java or windows
[03:57:36] <tiwake> half of those security issues are multi-year issues
[03:58:27] <tiwake> Phase4: but flash is way worse
[03:58:40] <Phase4> they're all about on par
[03:58:50] <tiwake> more so than PHP, windows, java...

[22:32:21] <Starthunder> Is it possible to make a cpio archive with filenames outside of the current directory?
[22:32:24] *** McKey is now known as [A]McKey
[22:32:45] <Starthunder> So that when it's extracted, stuff outside of the cwd might get clobbered?
