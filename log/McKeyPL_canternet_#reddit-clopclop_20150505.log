[01:14:59] <ponder> I was thinking I'd just spend some time in the store and look up reviews on the ones they have.
[01:15:23] <Squirrelly> Why not order online?
[01:16:29] <ponder> I don't really want to chance my dad or sister being there when it comes . They'd ask questions and such. I'm too shy.
[01:17:23] <Squirrelly> It generally comes in a nondescript cardboard box
[01:17:33] <Squirrelly> Just tell them it's for one of your hobbies
[01:17:36] <iamalion> order to a friends house
[01:17:48] <Squirrelly> I just got a vibrator and stuff, and I told my parents it was for magic the gathering lol

[01:42:31] <ponder> when buying masturbators, does one have to think about the maximum width of the toy, or are they mostly built as a one-size-fits-all?
[01:46:39] <cloppyhooves> The ones I've seen have been stretchy
[01:48:08] <Flame> Squirrelly: :/ the two stores I've been to were very...well...awkward. One had dancers (but was a bit shady and...the checker was odd) who were friendly, but that's cuz $$$ for dance behind glass window; the second had females in there but weren't friendly and very "business"=like
[01:48:13] <Flame> :/
[01:48:15] <Flame> bbiab
[01:49:27] <Flame> bak
[01:49:54] <ponder> The store I went to was pretty nice but rather... sparse. They had one register, all the walls were red, and all the wares were up against the walls. They didn't have anything on the floors so it seemed rather empty
[01:54:22] <Flame> ahh
[01:54:30] <Flame> at least friendly...
[01:54:51] <Flame> I...am reserved, and really appreciate someone (either informally or formally) "reaching out" in a sense...
[01:54:54] <ponder> Yeah, he seemed nice. I was too shy to say anything to him, though.

[06:21:12] <Iceflurries> I don't believe I'd want that...right now I know what I want: closeness...but what if I want more after that? I don't know what will fulfill me :(

[07:47:48] <iam[a]lion> are you reading it or /reading/ it
[07:48:02] <iam[a]lion> because i can skim around a 10 page tech paper in minutes if i need to

[08:49:18] <cloppyhooves> What pronouns should we use for you? c:
[08:50:07] <SnowGold> hmm I dunno... whatever works for me haha
[08:50:57] <SnowGold> I think maybe girl more, but I dunno since I'm also kind of a guy and I don't even look girly cause I haven't done horomones...
[08:51:33] <SnowGold> Grrr pronouns always confuse me. I'm not particularly uncomfortable one way or the other but then I don't know which I prefer either.
