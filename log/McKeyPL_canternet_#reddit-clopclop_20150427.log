[17:53:21] <Vulpixbrew> well that was a fun couple of phone calls
[17:56:53] <Vulpixbrew> howmany of you all ahve heard of vector marketing
[18:00:15] <cloppyhooves> Are they the one that preys on high schoolers?
[18:00:40] <Squirrelly> Wait
[18:00:46] <Squirrelly> Puddles, I thought you were a girl?
[18:00:54] <Squirrelly> oh she's gone
[18:00:56] <cloppyhooves> There are two different people who use the name "Puddles"
[18:01:05] <cloppyhooves> The woman has been here longer
[18:01:12] <cloppyhooves> The guy only got here like a few months ago
[18:01:18] <Squirrelly> Ah
[18:01:19] <cloppyhooves> We were so confused
[18:01:25] <Squirrelly> That is....rather confusing
[18:01:26] <cloppyhooves> 'cause we were like "Wait you're not Puddles"
[18:01:36] <Squirrelly> Especially because I know why Puddles is called Puddles
[18:01:43] <cloppyhooves> I gues with the z is the guy?
[18:01:45] <cloppyhooves> Who knows :o
[18:01:49] <Squirrelly> I guess
[18:02:11] <Squirrelly> Oh yeah and FUCK Vector Marketing
[18:02:22] <Squirrelly> I almost got sucked in, before I did some research
[18:04:45] <Vulpixbrew> Long story short went to a temp agency hoping to get work
[18:04:54] <Vulpixbrew> they gave my name to vector marketing
[18:05:50] <Squirrelly> ew
[18:05:56] <Squirrelly> Fuck those guys
[18:06:07] <Squirrelly> Yeah I had a friend in college who gave my name to those guys
[18:06:41] <Squirrelly> I did a bit of research, read all the horror stories, and promptly responded with a "Ummmmmm NOPE" when they called back again
[18:07:20] <Vulpixbrew> I went there right after high school and saw through it, 
[18:08:01] <Vulpixbrew> Told the dude so let me get this straight I have to buy m\y first set of knifes of you, your not hiring me but making me your customer ammmm no
[18:08:16] <Squirrelly> Oh I didn't even go there lol
[18:14:06] <Vulpixbrew> I called thee temp aganecy up
[18:15:09] <Vulpixbrew> asked them why they gave a colllege grad such an obvious scam, got pissed needless to say I think that temp agency is out for getting me a job
[18:16:34] <Vulpixbrew> Im a put back in for the job lion works
[18:17:11] <Vulpixbrew> ooo that and the Itilains are nothing but hackers on BF3
[18:18:46] <weisey> Aw sick Vulpixbrew 
[18:18:50] <weisey> That's terrible
[18:19:59] <Pony387> you could always do ccna or c++ or javascript or something like that
[18:20:27] <Pony387> an a+ certification will get you like 15 bucks an hour at best buy or tiger direct
[18:21:07] <Pony387> you could do network+ or compsec+
[18:21:24] <Pony387> python
[18:21:35] <Pony387> all kinds of things
[18:21:54] <Pony387> most of them you can pretty much learn within a month each if you really grind it out each day
[18:22:37] <Pony387> 12 hours of reading a day for a week or 2 then 12 hours of review for the next couple of weeks

[18:25:53] <Pony387> if it's a housing issue or something just go to community college or something and pick up some generic courses for a year while you get certifications in networking and programming then you can drop out once you have a certification or 2 and make like twice the money because you're not paying off 40k in student loans your only paying like 20k and you can sav
[18:26:05] <Pony387> e that much up in no time with the kind of job you'll have
[18:26:36] <Pony387> plus especially for ccna and ccna security there's so much job opportunity that you're never going to go hungry
[18:27:49] <Pony387> My mom works in networking and she told me that every person she's ever met that has gotten a certification has gotten a job near immediately
[18:28:33] <weisey> For a while I was the only person out of 11,000 and within 20 mile radius with any sort of technical cert 
[18:29:00] <Pony387> what are you certified in?
[18:29:59] <weisey> Basic networking and security 
[18:29:59] <weisey> Did it in highschool
[18:30:22] <Pony387> network plus and compsec plus or something else?
[18:31:17] <weisey> MTC 
[18:31:17] <weisey> Microsoft
[18:31:18] <weisey> It was worth jack shit
[18:31:25] <Vulpixbrew> ^this
[18:31:27] <Pony387> ah
[18:32:05] <weisey> But for about two days, I was the only one with a tech cert
[18:32:10] <weisey> While under 18
[18:33:05] <Pony387> I can't even find mtc on google
[18:33:18] <Vulpixbrew> my main issue atm is location, live in a beach town/ retirement community the few tech jobs there are, are already filled and being held on to
[18:33:45] <Pony387> can you drive or take a bus to other places?
[18:34:56] <y007ghg7> <Vulpixbrew> my main issue atm is location, live in a beach town/ retirement community the few tech jobs there are, are already filled and being held on to
[18:35:13] <y007ghg7> I know that feeling, except with theatrical lighting stuff
[18:35:29] <y007ghg7> hardly anywhere near me to put this knowledge to use :U
[18:36:26] <Pony387> you could go into plumbing or welding but those are harder to get certs in since they require you to have a certain numbers of hours before you get a liscence or cert
[18:36:39] <Vulpixbrew> If I could find the way or get hold of the funding I would move upto the triangle
[18:36:42] <y007ghg7> however, trying to travel to Seattle washington for everfree nw since I am a concert stage hand there
[18:36:43] <y007ghg7> heh
[18:38:07] <Pony387> my dream job would be winning the lottery getting like 100million dollars and never having to work again

[19:18:24] <Pony387> maybe experimental hip hop but I suppose that's why it's experimental. Not bad just not what I think of when I think of hip hop more like psychadelic music imo.

[19:18:47] <Pony387> or teen not kid
[19:19:15] <OmarianVolcae> I actually really like foreign hip hop. Washes out the sometimes questionable message in the lyrics and just leaves behind the music.

[19:20:47] <Pony387> yeah see I can appreciate something like that I guess I just when I think of hip hop I think of rap. Like a good bonding between music and lyric and what comes out feels like a soul

[19:22:30] <weisey> >listening to Diabarha at work
[19:22:53] <Pony387> the problem is that there are things like hungry giant where they just repeat the same sample over and over with 20 seconds of lyrics or things like I dunno at the moment where they just focus on lyrics but no beat
[19:23:11] <weisey> >coworker asks what I'm listening to
[19:23:29] <Pony387> or things like lil wayne and drake where the whole song is just a bunch of non sequitors

[20:42:00] <Squirrelly> O.O
[20:42:03] * Squirrelly blushes
[20:43:41] <Squirrelly> So like
[20:43:48] <Squirrelly> I just joined a D&D campaign
[20:43:59] <Squirrelly> I'm a catfolk wizard with a pet kitty
[20:44:08] <Squirrelly> Specializing in summoning
[20:44:16] <iamalion> see? like that, so cute
[20:44:37] <Squirrelly> Alas, I wasn't allowed to be a druid that is a cat, turns into a cat, has a cat, and summons cats that summon other cats
[20:44:46] <Cantaloupe> you should summon cats to throw at the enemy! 
[20:44:54] <Squirrelly> Cuz my DM hates druids so he banned them in all his campaigns
[20:45:03] <Cantaloupe> that sucks
[20:45:22] <Vulpixbrew> heres what you do
[20:47:21] <Vulpixbrew> get a bandlier with four pouches, a kitten in each poubnch with sleep statis both permentant on cast on the pouches (yes stay fresh kittens, like twinkies) When fighting a wizard or any class that needs to concrte on spells takes the kitten out shake it awake and throw it at the wizard 90% spell failure guarantee
[20:47:33] <Cantaloupe> you pose as a catfolk wizard but your true, but hidden identity is a Druid! 
[20:47:55] <Cantaloupe> in the end you go, " haha I fooled you all. I'm a Druid!" 
[20:47:57] <Vulpixbrew> of course it only works till the DNM ecides gaints should do the same thing except with full grown tigers
[20:48:29] <Squirrelly> Soooo here's the thing
[20:49:39] <Squirrelly> My DM WOULD let me be a druid, since I'm not actually good enough to break it, but the problem is that this world that we're playing in is one that he's used for a bunch of campaigns before, and one of the big things in the in-world history is that druids are pretty much extinct except for like one random old guy who lives alone in the mountains or something
[20:49:47] <Squirrelly> And apparently he doesn't teach people
[20:50:30] <iamalion> I was a 4 foot bard that had a very high dex  and acrobatics skills
[20:50:33] <Cantaloupe> aah
[20:50:47] * Cantaloupe has never played dnd
[20:50:49] * Cantaloupe hides
[20:51:02] <Squirrelly> lol
[20:51:03] <Squirrelly> it's fine
[20:51:08] <Squirrelly> You basically just make a person
[20:51:11] <Squirrelly> Then make stuff up
[20:51:16] <Squirrelly> then roll D20s now and then
[20:51:39] <Cantaloupe> ah. sounds simpler that way
[20:51:43] <Squirrelly> Yup
[20:51:49] <Squirrelly> It's way easier than people think
[20:52:35] <Cantaloupe> melon told me about a couple of campaigns he and his friends played and it sounded like a fun game 
[20:53:20] <Squirrelly> It really is
[20:53:30] <Squirrelly> D&D is all about the silly stories you come away with
[20:53:34] <Squirrelly> I've got my share :3
[20:53:44] <Cantaloupe> hehe 
[20:53:50] <Squirrelly> If anybody wants, I could tell them sometime
[20:55:17] <Cantaloupe> maybe later. I need to.. uhm.. take care of business 
[20:56:11] <Squirrelly> Oh???

[20:58:06] <Squirrelly> 3 times?!
[20:58:22] <Cantaloupe> sounds exhausting

[20:59:36] <Squirrelly> Cantaloupe!
[20:59:40] <Squirrelly> I'm super excited!
[20:59:57] <Squirrelly> I ordered like 8-10 toys from amazon for like $100
[21:00:04] <Cantaloupe> oh yay!!
[21:00:05] <Squirrelly> And they should be here by the weekend :3
[21:00:06] <FineLine> [](/ajyay "yay")
[21:00:18] <Squirrelly> Including a collar...
[21:00:22] <Vulpixbrew> ooo theres tourist mission
[21:00:26] <Squirrelly> I've never had one, and I can't wait...
[21:00:28] <Cantaloupe> I'm jelly 
[21:00:36] <Squirrelly> Oh!
[21:00:40] <Cantaloupe> I'm probably the most vanilla person here
[21:00:44] <Squirrelly> You should get a hitachi if you don't have one
[21:00:53] <Squirrelly> Vanilla or kinky, it's like....the best thing ever
[21:01:00] <Cantaloupe> I want toys but there are no "toy" stores near me 
[21:01:07] <Squirrelly> Amazon, girl!
[21:01:15] <Squirrelly> It's wayyyyy cheaper anyway
[21:01:23] * Cantaloupe wriggles
[21:01:27] <Cantaloupe> imma go check
[21:01:28] <Squirrelly> same quality as the store, you just gotta be careful and read reviews
[21:01:30] <Squirrelly> lol
[21:01:37] <Squirrelly> I'd find you a link if I wasn't at work
[21:01:45] <Squirrelly> Remind me later and I'll hook you up, hun
[21:02:00] <Squirrelly> Seriously though. Hitachi magic wand. $50. Best purchase of my life.
[21:02:17] * Cantaloupe notes it all down
[21:02:27] <Cantaloupe> 50 doesn't sound too bad
[21:02:35] <Squirrelly> It really isn't
[21:02:51] <Squirrelly> especially since most brick-and-mortar stores try to sell it for like $100 or more
[21:02:53] <Squirrelly> It's crazy
[21:02:59] <Cantaloupe> anyway. back to.. ahem.. business 
[21:03:04] <Squirrelly> It's so powerful you gotta plug it into the wall
[21:03:07] <Cantaloupe> afk
[21:03:10] <Cantaloupe> oh wow
[21:03:12] <Squirrelly> it comes with two settings: high and HOLY SHIT
[21:03:38] <Vulpixbrew> i need to get one
[21:03:49] <Squirrelly> I have to be careful not to use it too much or I lose a little sensitivity down there lol
[21:04:03] <Squirrelly> I use it as a treat :3
[21:04:29] <iamalion> hehe
[21:05:24] <Squirrelly> This particular shipment, though, is more about butt stuff, cuz I have pretty much nothing butt related and I was interested in trying it
[21:05:35] <Squirrelly> Also other kinky things :3
[21:06:01] <Squirrelly> That collar's kinda expensive, but it has great reviews and looks really solid and comfortable, but not enough to let me forget I'm wearing it, which is gooooood
[21:06:21] <Squirrelly> Rawr
