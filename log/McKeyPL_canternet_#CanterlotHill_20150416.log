[03:14:46] <MikeM> It's a quality question
[03:15:15] <One-Trick> its only supposed to take 3 parameters and jumble them up so make a random scenario, but then i started adding different ways to create random scenarios with weighted distribution so you dont get the same scenario twice or you can favor a certain results to make 'more like this'
[03:16:47] <MikeM> You're such a perfectionist nerd :p
[03:17:13] <Araxnus> So am I xD
[03:18:03] <One-Trick> i also made it multidimensional so you can use any amount of parameters but also add any amount of scenario types
[03:19:19] <One-Trick> funny enough, the part i have an issue with is saving the actual data. i started using the ini function for php until i realized there wasnt a builtin write_ini function and had to make it myself

[22:02:58] <yoyovinylfan> wassup pony people!!
[22:03:56] <yoyovinylfan> hey, sketchy. aren,t you gonna stream today?
[22:04:43] <Sketchy_Sounds> Nope.
[22:04:58] <yoyovinylfan> how come?
[22:05:14] <Sketchy_Sounds> By the time it was nearly time to begin, I had like maybe five requests. Not enough to make a show out of.
[22:06:12] <Sketchy_Sounds> That and it's become clear to me that CH is pretty horribly disorganised, still. I've been running my show on the site for over three months, yet I don't have a programme page - and thus no announcements on-site of when my show is airing.
[22:08:13] <yoyovinylfan> considering the time, you must have brought that up with the CH team?
[22:09:19] <Sketchy_Sounds> It's something I've reminded them of again just now.
[22:09:34] <Sketchy_Sounds> I am told it will be fixed relatively soon.
[22:09:40] <yoyovinylfan> ...
[22:09:58] <yoyovinylfan> relatively isn,t anything more than a week...
[22:10:16] <Sketchy_Sounds> Well it depends on when the guy who'll be doing it gets back from holiday :p
[22:10:59] <Sketchy_Sounds> But either way, doesn't change the fact that I've been doing my show regularly at the same time for three months and I've had no page up on the site about it. Something like that does make me feel just a tad under-appreciated.

[22:15:21] <thereallynewmop12100_> Sketchy_Sounds: Same as yoyovinylfan said. 
[22:15:42] <yoyovinylfan> you,d think that since CH took over all of EFNs shows, that they,d atleast take a little responsebility for the advertisements and announcments for said shows...
