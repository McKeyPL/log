[12:48:17] <TheFlutterGuy> which really fucking pisses me off.
[12:48:29] <Electron> um...
[12:48:39] <TheFlutterGuy> In 1910, The Second International held an International Women's conference at the house, during which Clara Zetkin launched the idea of an International Women's Day. Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg visited the centre.[
