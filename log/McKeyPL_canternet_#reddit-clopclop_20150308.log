[05:58:52] <SleepyPon> iam[a]lion: youtube?
[05:59:15] <iam[a]lion> no, linking to my youtube would expose my name, im making it into a webm and throwing it on pomf.se
[05:59:31] <SleepyPon> what is pomf.se?
[06:00:01] <iam[a]lion> http://a.pomf.se/rlpadf.webm
[06:00:05] <iam[a]lion> that was the round that started
[06:00:12] <iam[a]lion> round 7, i hadnt done much in the rounds prior
[06:00:18] <iam[a]lion> and from there on I started kicking ass
[06:00:36] <OmarianVolcae> Lel
[06:00:44] <OmarianVolcae> Cool skin
[06:00:54] <iam[a]lion> that one is good
[06:00:58] <iam[a]lion> i like my SG one so much more
[06:01:04] <iam[a]lion> i wish all my guns could be pink and purple :[
[06:01:05] <OmarianVolcae> The AUG has a lot of cool skins, but I don't buy the AUG much
[06:01:06] <SleepyPon> pew pew pew
[06:01:18] <iam[a]lion> i only use aug or SG 553
[06:01:22] <OmarianVolcae> I have a stat trak P90.
[06:01:29] <OmarianVolcae> Otherwise I'm using the AK or the M4

[06:01:53] <iam[a]lion> i drop down to a ump for my budget rounds
[06:02:09] <OmarianVolcae> I should probably get an SMG for budget.
[06:02:12] <iam[a]lion> I love the aug/sg553 because not many people use them... they take a certain skill I guess. kinda like I cant awp for shit
[06:02:17] <OmarianVolcae> The P90 is too pricey for E rounds.
[06:02:33] <SleepyPon> what is the gun from SG1? :)
[06:02:46] <iam[a]lion> i used to be a p90 whore
[06:02:58] <OmarianVolcae> You're paying for the optic with the AUG/SSG
[06:03:00] <OmarianVolcae> SG*
[06:03:15] <OmarianVolcae> It's easy enough to get range kills with M4/AK at range.
[06:03:24] <OmarianVolcae> Escpecially with the AK
[06:03:24] <iam[a]lion> yeah
[06:03:32] <iam[a]lion> but the guns are soooo sexy

[08:53:12] <OmarianVolcae> My roommate has been getting me into CS:GO
[08:53:23] <Princesssluttershy> but they get mad at team mates and stuff because they "suck" and "steal kills"
[08:53:31] <Quinn> IceFlurries: it's not an RPG, and it works fine over wine 
[08:53:32] <cloppyhooves> Thank you Quinn <3
[08:53:57] <IceFlurries> still ;-; sorry
[08:53:59] <Quinn> Princesssluttershy: they sound like they're new to the game :o nobody who's played for any length of time says silly stuff like that
[08:54:15] <Princesssluttershy> He has over 700 hours in the game
[08:54:32] <Quinn> how do you know? :o
[08:54:38] <Princesssluttershy> He told me
[08:54:44] <Quinn> oh, alright
[08:54:54] <Princesssluttershy> Not sure how true that is
[08:54:54] <Quinn> cause you can't actually see your hours in league :o
[08:55:12] <Princesssluttershy> I do know that he's played a ton of matches
[08:55:33] <Quinn> well, it seems like he just has a negative attitude then :c
[08:55:39] <Princesssluttershy> Yeah
[08:55:41] * Vulpixbrew shudders to think of what would happen if he type /played into one or two wow toons
[08:55:51] <Princesssluttershy> plus he's really hard to get along with irl
[08:55:56] <Quinn> ah
[08:56:15] <Quinn> I now have over 1,500 ranked matches and 600 normal matches
[08:56:19] <Princesssluttershy> and keeps telling me to watch anime that sucks
[08:56:19] <Quinn> or no
[08:56:28] <Quinn> 600 normal wins, so probably around 1200 normal matches
[08:56:41] <Quinn> combined around 3,000 ish matches total 
[08:56:56] <Quinn> somehow that seems like so little :x

[09:00:15] <Quinn> what the fuck OmarianVolcae 
[09:00:18] <Vulpixbrew> ouch
[09:00:19] <Princesssluttershy> OmarianVolcae, what rank are you in csgo?
[09:00:21] <OmarianVolcae> Yeah.
[09:00:23] <OmarianVolcae> Ouch.
[09:00:25] <OmarianVolcae> Unranked.
[09:00:31] <OmarianVolcae> I've only played like 25 hours
[09:00:34] <Quinn> you should have like 
[09:00:37] <Quinn> tagged that or some shit
[09:00:41] <Quinn> ergh
[09:00:53] <Princesssluttershy> Legs aren't supposed to bend like that
[09:00:54] *** Navi is now known as Dusk
[09:01:02] <OmarianVolcae> And 15 or so of those hours have been spread out over a couple years.
[09:01:08] <Princesssluttershy> OmarianVolcae, I got my first rank earlier today ^-^
[09:01:17] <Quinn> Princesssluttershy: which rank?
[09:01:19] <Princesssluttershy> I'm silver 3
[09:01:19] <OmarianVolcae> I'm starting to get the hang of the say aiming works.
[09:01:31] <OmarianVolcae> I haven't started playing comp yet.
[09:01:38] <Quinn> my first rank was silver III too!
[09:01:46] <Quinn> I got all the way up to Gold Nova Master
[09:01:49] <Quinn> and then I stopped playing
[09:01:49] <Quinn> :c
[09:01:50] <Vulpixbrew> have some aweosome to counter that https://imgur.com/a/cAUzX
[09:01:51] <FineLine> [ Imgur ]
[09:01:54] <Princesssluttershy> I didn't start ranked until I had like 75 hours on the game XD
[09:01:57] <OmarianVolcae> I want to make sure my basic skills are set up before I roll into competetive mode.
[09:02:07] <Quinn> I just jumped straight in
[09:02:15] <Quinn> you don't really learn much except from ranked
[09:02:33] <OmarianVolcae> If you're used to the way recoil management works in other games, then yeah.
[09:02:38] <OmarianVolcae> You have a lot to learn from casual.
[09:02:57] <weisey> Deathmatch
[09:02:58] <Quinn> except recoil works completely different in CS:GO
[09:03:04] <OmarianVolcae> Yes
[09:03:06] <OmarianVolcae> That's my point.
[09:03:06] <Quinn> so nothing much carries over
[09:03:10] <weisey> Death match deathmatch deathmatch
[09:03:22] <OmarianVolcae> Way to completely miss the point of what I said.
[09:03:26] <weisey> Always deathmatch 
[09:03:29] <Princesssluttershy> I don't like deathmatch
[09:03:37] <OmarianVolcae> If you're used to other FPS, then you need to relearn how to aim/manage recoil.
[09:03:47] <Princesssluttershy> I hate things that pop up on my left side like the bonnus weapon thing
[09:03:52] <Quinn> it's really not any harder than learning it from scratch though
[09:03:57] <Vulpixbrew> http://i.imgur.com/07rgFto.jpg
[09:04:02] <Princesssluttershy> I feel like I must have something wrong with my left eye
[09:04:07] <Quinn> weisey: deathmatch is good but to get outa silver you don't even have to be able to aim, you just have to learn where to stand
[09:04:29] <weisey> False
[09:04:37] <Quinn> iunno that's how I did it
[09:04:40] <Princesssluttershy> Llike if I have something even remotely flashy on my left monitor I get a headache almost instantly :/
[09:04:42] <weisey> I'm stuck in silver because I can't aim
[09:04:44] <Quinn> my aim was shit pretty much all the way through
[09:04:51] * OmarianVolcae degloves Weisey's face.
[09:05:03] <Princesssluttershy> My aim is the only thing that's decint XD
[09:05:03] <Quinn> I started doing aim practice and that made the difference between gold nova 2 and gold nova master
[09:05:04] <OmarianVolcae> There, now you should be able to see.
[09:05:18] <Quinn> but before I couldn't shoot for shit lol
[09:05:25] <weisey> I know mapstrats and plays like nobody's business
[09:05:31] <OmarianVolcae> Map comprehension and general situational awareness seems to be a big advantage.
[09:05:42] <weisey> I can't onetap though
[09:05:48] <Quinn> you dont have to be able to D:
[09:05:54] <weisey> And a surprising amount of silvers can
[09:05:56] <OmarianVolcae> Plenty of people with awesome aim get REKT by just being oblivious.
[09:06:04] <Quinn> silver 1-tapping = luck
[09:06:06] <Princesssluttershy> I don't think I deserve to be silver 3, I can barely aim, I don't know where to stand and I don't know any calls and even if I did I'm too shy to use voice comms
[09:06:24] <Quinn> hell gold nova 1-tapping = luck
[09:06:27] <Quinn> that shits hard
[09:06:53] <Princesssluttershy> I got 3 one taps today while I was clutching by accident :/
[09:06:57] <Quinn> also if you really want to cheat you can just spam dust2 and use p90 and you'll get out of silver guaranteed 
[09:06:59] <weisey> Fine, 2-tap 3-tap
[09:07:21] <Princesssluttershy> Quinn, I can't hit anything with the p90 :/
[09:07:26] <OmarianVolcae> >Cheating
[09:07:29] <Princesssluttershy> I don't kno wwhy
[09:07:42] <weisey> Princesssluttershy: aim at crotch with p90 and spray
[09:07:46] <Quinn> Princesssluttershy: don't bother with it honestly, focus on getting your aim better with rifles and pistols :3
[09:07:50] <weisey> Headshot guarantee 
[09:08:01] <Quinn> the problem with p90 once you get higher ranked 
[09:08:20] <Quinn> is that, by the time you spray enough to kill, the guy has already headshotted you with the AK/M4
[09:08:20] <Princesssluttershy> I usually aim at the head then pull down with ak and m4a1-s
[09:08:39] <Quinn> the trick is not to move whatsoever when firing
[09:08:45] <Quinn> your first few, anyway
[09:08:53] <Quinn> the AK is accurate for the first 2 shots
[09:08:53] <Princesssluttershy> My aim is literally the only thing that's half decent
[09:09:12] <Quinn> m4a1 is accurate for the first 4 I believe
[09:09:32] <weisey> M4a1 is the best bursting gun ever
[09:09:39] <Quinn> if you can aim, the AK is 
[09:09:42] <weisey> Tap tap headshot 
[09:09:48] <Princesssluttershy> I get really lucky with the famas all the time
[09:09:50] <Quinn> AK is 1 shot headshot at any range
[09:09:54] <weisey> Yeah but the AK has higher recoil
[09:10:11] <Princesssluttershy> It's recoil is easy to manage for a bit though
[09:10:12] <Quinn> but you can kill someone with it before the recoil even applies so it doesnt matter
[09:10:31] <iamalion> Princesssluttershy http://a.pomf.se/rlpadf.webm
[09:11:07] <Princesssluttershy> iamalion, your sensitivity seems really high
[09:11:25] <Quinn> also 
[09:11:26] <Quinn> that gun
[09:11:29] <Quinn> plsno
[09:11:34] <Quinn> http://i.imgur.com/D3nGgG8.gif
[09:11:45] <iamalion> i have it down really far
[09:11:53] <Princesssluttershy> I like the sg but I hate the aug
[09:12:06] <Quinn> they're both really terrible 
[09:12:08] <iamalion> i only use aug/sg
[09:12:17] <iamalion> Quinn they take some skill to use
[09:12:21] <iamalion> i suck with an ak or awp
[09:12:23] <Quinn> they cost so much and are really blehhh
[09:12:33] <Quinn> iamalion: what rank are you out of curiousity
[09:12:35] <Princesssluttershy> the sg is more acurate than the ak and is a one hit headshot
[09:12:41] <Princesssluttershy> *on the first shot
[09:12:56] <Quinn> yea but you have to scope in for that :P
[09:13:01] <Princesssluttershy> The aug just sucks
[09:13:02] <Quinn> and it costs way more
[09:13:03] <iamalion> sg, but i play with my goldnova and above friends, so im more used to higher rank play
[09:13:14] <iamalion> which suuuuucks when none of them are avail and i just do a random match
[09:13:42] <weisey> I love the description of the rekt-9 "an innacurate semiautomatic"
[09:13:44] <Quinn> what is SG :o
[09:13:51] <iamalion> oh
[09:13:52] <iamalion> s2
[09:14:05] <Quinn> yea
[09:14:14] <iamalion> se
[09:14:14] <Quinn> trust me, learn the AK, love the AK
[09:14:14] <iamalion> c
[09:14:22] <Princesssluttershy> ak is so good
[09:14:37] <Quinn> once you leave silver nobody ever uses AUG/SG, they're so terrible
[09:15:15] <iamalion> ak doesnt suit my play style
[09:15:19] <iamalion> i have my own way of playin
[09:15:40] <OmarianVolcae> This conversation was better before we decided to project elitist opions on the playstyles of our friends. 
[09:16:00] <OmarianVolcae> Wanna play CS sometime iamalion?
[09:16:10] <OmarianVolcae> I'm nowhere in the range of skill you play at.
[09:16:16] <iamalion> absolutely, what rank are you
[09:16:23] <OmarianVolcae> >.>
[09:16:31] <Princesssluttershy> lol
[09:16:36] <OmarianVolcae> I've played approximately 5 competetive matches.
[09:16:38] <Princesssluttershy> The same rank I was before today
[09:16:39] <iamalion> not that i care
[09:16:41] <Quinn> probably about the same elo 
[09:16:42] <iamalion> oh ok neat!
[09:16:46] <iamalion> yeah definitely then!
[09:16:58] <OmarianVolcae> :3
[09:17:05] <OmarianVolcae> I'm Omarian Volcae on steam.
[09:17:20] <Princesssluttershy> I think if I play more I might actually be decent at csgo
[09:17:20] <iamalion> addadd me on steam
[09:17:25] <iamalion> drew2834 or iamalion
[09:17:29] <iamalion> whichever one works today
[09:17:29] <iamalion> -_-
[09:17:35] <iamalion> also heres my stats
[09:17:36] <iamalion> https://i.imgur.com/oYcNFF2.png
[09:17:44] <Princesssluttershy> I used to be ok at tf2 then I stopped playing it
[09:17:44] <iamalion> not the best, but i dont always try really hard
[09:17:52] <OmarianVolcae> Adderd
[09:18:13] <OmarianVolcae> Occasionally I'll have good games.
[09:18:16] <iamalion> accepted
[09:18:20] <Princesssluttershy> My stats are tainted because of all the bot games I played
[09:18:27] <OmarianVolcae> And then other games my bullets go everywhere but my target.
[09:18:42] <OmarianVolcae> I think it's because I have a tendency to pace and shoot.
[09:18:50] <OmarianVolcae> Pacing isn't penalized in BF4 nearly as hard as CS
[09:18:54] <Quinn> also another bonus to learning ak/m4, if you need to you can pick one up from someone else, or a teammate will buy for you
[09:18:57] <iamalion> in just about every game i play, I play sneaky
[09:19:07] <iamalion> Quinn if i need a gun and pick one up ill use it
[09:19:09] <iamalion> i CAN use it
[09:19:11] <iamalion> i just dont like it
[09:19:29] <Princesssluttershy> I tried to learn the strafe shooting thing where you shot as you change directions, but I just can't get it down
[09:19:52] <Quinn> Princesssluttershy: they actually nerfed that quite a bit. it's a lot harder to do now with a lot less gain :c
[09:20:07] <Princesssluttershy> fuck
[09:20:12] <Princesssluttershy> that might be why 
[09:20:21] <Quinn> focus on stop-headshot
[09:20:30] <Quinn> once you nail that you can learn spray patterns
[09:21:00] <Princesssluttershy> Fuck you MCR it's 4:21 am I need to go ot bed
[09:21:14] <Princesssluttershy> I'm gonna go to bed
[09:21:16] <FineLine> Later Princesssluttershy!
[09:21:21] <Princesssluttershy> I might have to do something tomorrow
[09:21:54] <iamalion> idk i dont take it too seriously. i play to have fun really
[09:22:07] <iamalion> im not trying to be better than anyone or get all douchey 
[09:22:19] <weisey> OmarianVolcae: because you can ironsights 
[09:22:20] <iamalion> i like csgo because i like strategy and tactics
[09:22:32] <OmarianVolcae> What?
[09:22:40] <weisey> In battlefield
[09:22:53] <weisey> Ironsights vs hip shooting
[09:23:14] <OmarianVolcae> I don't think the shooting in CS:GO is meant to be shooting from the hip.
[09:23:17] <weisey> Csgo has no ironsights 
[09:23:26] <weisey> (Except for Aug/SG)
[09:23:28] <OmarianVolcae> Look at the characters though.
[09:23:38] <OmarianVolcae> They're all in a proper firing position.
[09:23:46] <OmarianVolcae> At least the CTs

[09:24:14] <Princesssluttershy> http://i.imgur.com/dWIjOOe.jpg <- my stats are there if you want to look at them
[09:24:20] <OmarianVolcae> My point is that the spray model isn't a hip firing one.
[09:24:23] *** Joins: Katniss (Mibbit@Pony-eqdtaf.mo.charter.com)
[09:24:38] <OmarianVolcae> And that's reflected by the way the characters hold their weapons.

[09:25:03] <Princesssluttershy> iamalion, most of it os against bots
[09:25:04] <weisey> If you played bf without using your ironsights the runnjng/pacing spread would be the same as ca
[09:25:04] <iamalion> Princesssluttershy how many attempts did that take you xD I must have opened csgo like 5 times before i just printsreen'd
[09:25:06] <weisey> Cs*
[09:25:07] <Quinn> one can only dream
[09:25:18] <Princesssluttershy> iamalion, once
[09:25:19] <iamalion> Princesssluttershy i played every map with bots before joining a real match
[09:25:38] <Katniss> Bathorse!
[09:25:42] <OmarianVolcae> So what's your point? CS:GO still penalizes moving while firing way harder than BF4.
[09:25:43] <Princesssluttershy> I really like dust2 btw
[09:25:52] <iamalion> god i hate dust
[09:25:57] <iamalion> i love snow, hate being hot
[09:26:01] * OmarianVolcae licks Katniss.
[09:26:04] <iamalion> dust maps remind me of being really hot and sweaty
[09:26:13] <weisey> Also, you're comparing an apple to an orange
[09:26:17] <Princesssluttershy> dust2 was the first map I ever played on in an fps
[09:26:23] <OmarianVolcae> Yes, yes I am!
[09:26:32] <OmarianVolcae> I'm highlighting a difference between to different styles of game.
[09:26:40] <Quinn> they're not even comparable games
[09:26:43] <OmarianVolcae> !!

[09:27:23] <Quinn> you're getting pretty worked up over all this csgo nonsense, 'tis but a game
[09:27:30] <weisey> The inclusion of the ironsights mechanic changes how the movement mechanics work with regard to shooting
[09:27:41] <OmarianVolcae> Yo
[09:27:52] <OmarianVolcae> I'm just trying to get Weisey to back off.
[09:28:03] <OmarianVolcae> Yo
[09:28:15] <Princesssluttershy> I'm actually going to bed now
[09:28:16] <OmarianVolcae> Yoooooo

[09:28:57] <OmarianVolcae> Veeery morning.
[09:29:49] <Quinn> if CS:GO had ironsights it'd be a more fast paced game
[09:29:51] <Quinn> I think
[09:30:02] <weisey> Yeah
[09:30:11] <weisey> You'd need to move quicker 
[09:30:21] <Quinn> you could rush
[09:30:23] <Quinn> much better
[09:30:24] <weisey> And rotate faster once
[09:31:06] <weisey> But then it would just be another call of doody
[09:31:09] <Quinn> yup
[09:31:27] <Quinn> bleck, I used to know some of those people who bought into the whole yearly CoD thing
[09:31:29] <Quinn> pretty awful

[09:42:47] <OmarianVolcae> Not worth the time it took to slug through the raid, but still cool.

[19:11:46] <iamalion> he didnt say the name i changed it to
[19:11:49] <iamalion> so it def isnt in his area
[19:11:50] <iamalion> O_o

[23:24:12] * Vulpixbrew has a great pic in his head of OmarianVolcae on Luna's guard
[23:24:40] <ponder> I'd like to be ON Luna's guards, if you know what I mean.
[23:24:53] <OmarianVolcae> Story speaking, that's what Omar is.
[23:25:08] <OmarianVolcae> A junior officer in the night guard.
[23:25:42] <ponder> My OC is a weather pony.
[23:25:47] <ponder> He makes snowflakes.
[23:25:50] <RNGsus> meteorologist?
[23:25:54] <RNGsus> oh.....
[23:26:01] <Starburn> Astronomer here :o
[23:26:07] <RNGsus> The working class meteorologist!
[23:26:27] <ponder> Haha, yeah
[23:26:34] <OmarianVolcae> RNGsus, if you weren't aware, there's no natural weather in Equestria.
[23:26:57] <RNGsus> It doesnt make sense
[23:27:09] <RNGsus> Where does the lake evaporation go?
[23:27:32] <OmarianVolcae> I supose the Pegasi handle it at some point.
[23:27:38] <OmarianVolcae> It's part of the magic of the land. 
[23:27:40] <ponder> Natural weather actually exists in Equestria, it just is under control
[23:27:47] <RNGsus> ^
[23:27:56] <ponder> There natural weather and plant growth in the Everfree forest for example
[23:28:00] <RNGsus> Listen to the weather pony, ponder knows
[23:28:22] <ponder> Pegasus ponies see to the weather, earth ponies see to plant growth.
[23:29:35] * Vulpixbrew is 70% sure there was weather at one point and tiume it's just the pegasi chang it to their needs
[23:29:41] <weisey> And one god damn alicorn does everything else
[23:29:55] <RNGsus> what about luna?
[23:30:00] <ponder> Nah, there are at least four of them now
[23:31:04] <ponder> Personally I think the alicorns' part in the raising and lowering of the sun and moon is the same as the Ancient Egyptian pharaos. Supposedly they do it, but it probably happens wether they're there or not.
[23:31:37] <ponder> So, like, if they disappeared some ponies would be like "oh no, what do we do to make the sun come up?" But then it happens either way
[23:32:21] <Vulpixbrew> also I still have the head canon that Equestira rest atop the broken remains of  earth just thousands of years in ther future

[23:35:54] <ponder> My name is jam in Icelandic, but I'm not a fruit preserve
