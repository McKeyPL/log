[18:50:05] <Trogdor> One port and no Thunderbolt is dumb, but lack of upgradability is the trade off for making it small and sealed.

[18:52:43] <RandomNinja> it's for dirty casuals who don't want control

[18:56:52] <Cloud_Zephyr> now lets concentrate on packing as much power in that small space as possible
[18:57:06] <JockeTF> If it's too big for your pocket, or too heavy to always have in your bag, then you have "function" issues.
[18:57:22] <Trogdor> Ironically, they're making iPhones thinner but also making the screen bigger, which makes it harder to pocket.
[18:57:32] <JockeTF> My issue is making things thinner just because "it looks good".

[23:19:50] <Eywind> I think it'd work as long as your friend's in the same kind of maturity and life position as his gf
[23:20:32] <One-Trick> my friend bryan was 21 and dating some 38 year old chick and she was a totally sugarmomma and was pretty attractive. i think thats called a super-winwin
[23:20:41] <Eywind> Not that it can't work out, but I feel like it'd cause a lot more stress if she's like super successful and outgoing and has everything established and he's still trying to develop his position in life, etc.
[23:20:50] <Eywind> Yeah that can happen too
[23:20:53] <RandomNinja> yeah that would be the biggest issue
[23:21:01] <RandomNinja> but that's for them to solve

[23:25:17] <TipsyBOT|EXE> I mean physically clone a horse and give it wings and a narwhale horn.
[23:25:33] <TipsyBOT|EXE> Cause that's pretty much what a unicorn horn is.
[23:25:56] <TipsyBOT|EXE> I'd suggest a Rhino but then it'll be a freak and you'd have to incinerate it.
[23:25:59] <One-Trick> narwhals, while awesome, are still not able to levitate records to turntables

[23:28:44] <RandomNinja> also wasn't the idea of unicorns derived from mentions of the auroch in the bible or something?
[23:28:49] <TipsyBOT|EXE> It amazes me..their planning on bringing back Carrier Pidgeons and they can clone sheep but not a horse with wings or a horn.
[23:29:02] <Eywind> for a horse to be able to fly the wings would have to be huge

[23:29:20] <TipsyBOT|EXE> Have you seen the wings on them?
[23:29:29] <RandomNinja> can pigeons carry coconuts though?
[23:29:32] <Eywind> I read some fic where Scootaloo was getting a wing lecture from Twilight

[23:29:48] <Rylius> Horses
[23:29:52] <Eywind> and she explained that Scoots' wings would have to reach from one side of the library to another to have the same ratio that Owloysius' wings did
