[03:41:59] <Eywind> that reminds me, I need to see if I can borrow my roommate's snowball
[03:42:02] <SineWFrequency> DiZ is literally my best rapper. I didn't know he could rap so fast when we first made this song months ago.
[03:42:05] <Eywind> WildSoft: depends on how fat you wanna be :P
[03:42:15] <Faith> Depends on how many drugs you've taken in the past 12 horus
[03:42:18] <WildSoft> Normal menu
[03:42:18] <Faith> hours even
[03:42:19] <Eywind> I'd say ~$7 usd
[03:42:33] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> I hear that USB mics are for if you want to have fun with that kind of stuff.
[03:42:42] <WildSoft> like $10 here
[03:42:44] <Eywind> yeah Kawaii_FPS_Princess b ut you can build like
[03:42:46] <Faith> I usually stay around 5 bucks us
[03:42:49] <Eywind> your own box and stuff if you wanna get actual vaing
[03:42:59] <Eywind> Faith I get two double cheese, large fry, large sweet tea
[03:43:00] <Eywind> lol
[03:43:04] <Eywind> if I eat mcdonalds
[03:43:08] <WildSoft> o0
[03:43:12] <Eywind> and just eat the fries until they get cold
[03:43:14] <WildSoft> I meant like a normal meal
[03:43:14] <Eywind> and throw them away
[03:43:19] <Faith> I just get 2 McChickens, 2 McDoubles, and a Sweeeeeeeet Tea
[03:43:21] <Eywind> WildSoft combos are like $5-6
[03:43:23] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> You mean an Audio Interface?
[03:43:27] <WildSoft> 1 burger, 1 fries, 1 normal size soda
[03:43:34] <Eywind> mcdoubles are just double cheeseburgers without seasoning

[03:43:57] <Eywind> lol
[03:44:07] <Araxnus> Food. Bacon. Yes!
[03:44:22] <WildSoft> so basically it costs us double
[03:44:32] <Rodimus_Prime> Also that was half sarcasm. I hate diet anything but i would eat the extra large pizza >.>
[03:45:02] <Faith> Order Fries, wait until they get cold, take them back to the counter, demand more, claim to be the manager's nephew, pour out all the ice in the ice machine, take 40 napkins and 2 straws, never return to that McDonalds.
[03:45:02] <WildSoft> Nono, diet is good. Then you can safely order the biggest meal and all side orders
[03:45:27] <Rodimus_Prime> Diet is actually bad for you.
[03:45:32] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> Just drink water
[03:45:34] <Eywind> so is regular soda
[03:45:37] <Eywind> water is bad for you
[03:45:37] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> That's what I do
[03:45:42] <Eywind> water has killed more people than soda
[03:45:45] <Eywind> just sayin'
[03:46:00] <Rodimus_Prime> Rather drink regular soda than diet. Also I havent been drinking soda as of late. Just tea.
[03:46:04] <Faith> Raise your hand if you drowned in Mountain Dew.
[03:46:06] <Faith> Exactly.
[03:46:07] <wobniaR> 100% of all people who drink soda will die
[03:46:09] <Kawaii_FPS_Princess> If everyone in the wold held hands and made a chain across it, a large portion of them would drown.
[03:46:12] <WildSoft> Rodimus_Prime they recently did a huge evaluation in the EU about aspartame and came to the conclusion it is not dangerous to humans when consumed in normal amounts 
[03:46:21] * Rodimus_Prime throws Faith into a pool of Mtn Dew
[03:46:33] * Faith drinks it all

[03:47:06] <WildSoft> We don't have all your american silly stuffs over here
[03:47:26] <WildSoft> Mountain Dew is rather new and is mostly sold in the "American Section" in the store
[03:47:33] <Rodimus_Prime> "not dangerous to humans when consumed in normal amounts" That's the thing. Most people I know dont drink it in normal amounts. It's all they drink all day everyday.
[03:47:36] <WildSoft> I do however love beef jerky
[03:47:37] *** Toothie|AFK is now known as Toothpaste
[03:48:23] <wobniaR> You guys have an "american section" in your stores?
[03:48:27] <WildSoft> Rodimus_Prime don't know the exact numbers, but it was safe for human consumption. That said, still not healthy
[03:48:36] <Eywind> We have some 'ethnic cuisine', but probably nothing from you :P
[03:48:36] <WildSoft> yes, in some stores =)
[03:48:40] <wobniaR> That's proof USA is #1

[03:57:50] <SineWFrequency> <@Eywind> oh really?
[03:57:52] <SineWFrequency> hmm.....
[03:57:56] <Eywind> yea it's fine though
[03:57:57] <Eywind> metal does too
[03:58:04] <Eywind> anything that's not basic EDM or rock anthems or show songs do
[03:58:14] * WildSoft politely accepts RandomNinja vetebrö på en söndagnatt
[03:58:23] <SineWFrequency> its not fine to me. now i see why a lot of people don't listen to the hardstyle i make.
[03:58:40] <RandomNinja> that's because the listeners are scrubs
[03:58:40] <Eywind> No I meant your music is fine
[03:58:47] <SineWFrequency> American music taste. meh.
[03:58:49] <RandomNinja> embrace the metal
[03:58:58] <SineWFrequency> its European music anyway.
[03:59:04] <Eywind> Well just in general more people like the average than the extremes
[03:59:13] <One-Trick> whoawhoa, stereotyping.
[03:59:13] <RandomNinja> the extremes are more fun though
[03:59:15] * Rodimus_Prime applies low quality mead to RandomNinja
[03:59:22] <RandomNinja> but less approachable
[03:59:23] <Eywind> yeah I don't disagree RandomNinja
[03:59:29] <Araxnus> Have some Evening Star soon
[03:59:37] <Eywind> And  the people that chat in here are definitely going to like it a lot more than the average non-chatting listener
[03:59:37] <SineWFrequency> of course they would be driven away. americans have trouble ajusting to music outside the country. even if its good.
[03:59:41] <RandomNinja> Rodimus_Prime pls I have quality mead in large amounts
[03:59:43] <Toothpaste> Are there mad libs tonight?
[03:59:46] <Eywind> yes Toothpaste
[03:59:46] <One-Trick> wtf
[03:59:58] <Araxnus> Whats up
[03:59:59] <Eywind> Yeah I really do think that's stereotyping a bit SineWFrequency...
[04:00:00] <Araxnus> ?
[04:00:05] <Toothpaste> Alright, I wasn't sure :P thanks Eywind
[04:00:05] <SineWFrequency> ? yes?
[04:00:11] <Eywind> It's just a human thing, not just "Americans"

[04:00:57] <RandomNinja> lies, I'm listening to american metal right now, my anecdotal evidence disproves your hypothesis!
[04:00:59] <Eywind> That doesn't mean that the extremes are any less awesome

[04:01:47] *** Joins: no_connection (no_connecti@Pony-nag9nl.tbcn.telia.com)
[04:01:52] <SineWFrequency> <@Eywind> yeah, which makes it hard for me to keep producing hardstyle music when i really don't have any people fond of it.
[04:01:53] * Araxnus facehoofs VERY hard!
[04:01:57] <SineWFrequency> but thats just the reality of it.
[04:02:01] <Rodimus_Prime> Dont mind me. Just watching Steve and Leekfish play Hatoful Boyfriend and laughing my butt off. xD
[04:02:02] <Eywind> SineWFrequency it's not 'any people' :/
[04:02:07] <Eywind> Obviously we liked it
[04:02:14] <Eywind> well "don't have any people"
[04:02:24] <Eywind> I do agree though, there's a lot smaller audience and I can imagine it's disheartening sometimes
[04:02:29] <thereallynewmop12100_> Araxnus: The Aura Twins took over the turntable
[04:02:57] <Eywind> But the faithful Mixology listeners will always love hardstyle, as well as a lot of others out there.
[04:03:03] <RandomNinja> but I'm betting the extremes have much more devoted fanbases
[04:03:14] <SineWFrequency> every now and then a couple people like you would find a taste for it because of its quality and mastering, and im grateful for that, its just tempting sometimes to stop making it because its not gonna get me anywhere. xD
[04:03:16] <Eywind> Midli wouldn't be world famous without hardstyle lol
[04:03:31] <RandomNinja> midli is world famous?

[04:04:13] <thereallynewmop12100_> SineWFrequency: What's happened to Tokyo Magika Productions?

[07:17:22] <Muffin_Spectacles> So, I'm going to pose this qustion to the room, seeing as I have some B-day money to spend: anyone know of a good dvd ripper to use for making PMV's? EqD's room gave me no info.
[07:17:58] <Faith> hm..
[07:18:18] <Kelazi5> I got iDVD it was the only one that didn't look like a virus trap, but it is about $30
[07:18:23] <Faith> You could probably just find the video on YouTube and save that on KeepVid or something. It's not Legal, but it'll work.
[07:18:47] <Eywind> umm
[07:19:01] * Eywind coughs and points to rules
[07:19:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> Faith: I've tried that on my youtube downloader, but it won't give me HD. And if I am ever to be considered by EqD, it has to be HD. Those idiots won't take anything less for pure, perfect, untainted quality!

[07:21:21] * Muffin_Spectacles has been wanting to do a pmv regarding Sunset Shimmer for a little while. And now, with some bday money from my Dad, I want to get a proper program, so I can one day, maybe join the Gods on EqD, who never accept any of the pmv's I've done.

[07:22:20] <Faith> senpai noticed you
[07:22:50] <Kelazi5> Nowadays it's hard to get noticed with PMVs without having fancy animation stuff in it as well
[07:23:18] <Muffin_Spectacles> Faith: Noone ever notices me. I always feel like I did alot of stuff that made me feel good, but it's like life: unless you're uber-popular, you're just noone.
[07:24:16] <Muffin_Spectacles> Kelazi5: I make pmv's based on when my emotional reaction seems to say, 'this is it,' and I throw myself into them, wanting to make people feel. Like my Twilight/Flash/Frozen pmv. I love that one, but every other comment is like being on the floor of a McD's, and someone just laughing like Rarity ('gum on der bum!')
[07:24:33] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> I weigh about 16 stones.

[07:25:32] <Muffin_Spectacles> I'd love to figure out how to make a pony character speak in real-time, based on mapping a human face.
[07:25:54] <Muffin_Spectacles> Kelazi5: As well as RP character. I had a Twilight RP claim that my video made 'her' regret turning down a cute guy. :P
[07:26:38] <keekle> i saw from some toy fair picture that there will soon be a flash sentry doll with disturbingly prominent abs
[07:27:01] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Yes...we now have a doll to make us males feel inferior about our physizue.
[07:27:18] <keekle> i guess thats par for the course for women, so its only fair
[07:27:26] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I joke that he just got thrown into a pool, and put the jacket on, because he doesn't want the girls to see his clingy t-shirt.
[07:27:50] <CameronAubernon> and our little mad scientist might be getting into more than she bargained for, too
[07:27:51] <keekle> it did look sort of out of place
[07:28:03] <keekle> though it does make me wonder if humanized twilight would even notice
[07:28:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> CameronAubernon: chiseled abs? No girl could say no to that.
[07:28:27] <keekle> you would think that twilight would prefer things with four legs to begin with
[07:28:29] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> They sure would not.
[07:28:30] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Of course she would. Girls claim to be all, 'I don't care what a guy looks like,'...but we...WE know the truth.

[07:28:53] * BritishImperialKuuga-RX flexes his muscles for the ladies in chat
[07:28:55] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles:  i am still in denial
[07:29:01] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Hee hee
[07:29:02] <Muffin_Spectacles> RandomNinja: Haha! I just now was thinking, Jacob vs Flash.
[07:29:23] <RandomNinja> clash of the waifu stealers?
[07:29:25] <CameronAubernon> jacob the were-timberwolf vs. flash the sparkly unipire
[07:29:26] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Though I still feel Twilight is attracted to Flash, because he's a foreign Asian guy with a hot car.
[07:29:28] <Faith> I come back and see Chiseled Abs and Kuuga over here flexing
[07:29:34] <Faith> Sir, we are in a No-Flex Zone
[07:29:42] * CameronAubernon likes girls. yes.
[07:29:57] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Good to like girls.
[07:29:58] * RandomNinja flexes Faith 
[07:30:09] <Faith> How does that even worrrrrrk
[07:30:14] <Muffin_Spectacles> It's from experience in high school: one guy I knew who was from Taiwan: he had at least 3 girls asking him to every dance. Me? I was the animation-obsessed film fanatic with acne and a half-asian/caucasian look. No girls ever asked me out. 
[07:30:14] <RandomNinja> abs > no abs
[07:30:28] <Faith> Man, I've never had abs in my life lol
[07:30:30] <RandomNinja> 'tis science and stuff
[07:30:36] <RandomNinja> go get abs :P
[07:30:40] <Faith> nahhhh
[07:30:47] <Faith> too much work
[07:30:50] <RandomNinja> bro do you even lift
[07:30:51] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: just out of curiosity, have you caught that new comedy, fresh of the boat, and if so, whats your opinion so far?
[07:30:53] <Muffin_Spectacles> Great...now I'm remembering my Sadie Hawkins dance ending up like Spike asking for another donut.
[07:31:05] <Faith> I raise the roof, does that count?
[07:31:08] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> I used to get tones of girls back in primary/elementary school.
[07:31:11] <RandomNinja> I'm not sure
[07:31:18] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Never had abs. Wasn't a sports guy. Art/Band/Theater were my specialties in high school. Math and Science were my D-level classes.
[07:31:18] <RandomNinja> what tones though?
[07:31:19] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> But then I turned 13.
[07:31:31] <Faith> Tones of hoooome~
[07:31:45] <Muffin_Spectacles> My Mom should have just kept starving me like when I was younger. I was skinny up until I was 8.
[07:31:47] <keekle> abs are overrated, is what i tell myself
[07:32:08] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> keekle: it is not good to be super fat either.
[07:32:09] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: So you sit there on the couch, massaging your torso, repeating that?
[07:32:10] <Faith> I've made it this far without abs, i think I can keep going haha
[07:32:18] <keekle> BritishImperialKuuga-RX: well this obviously true too
[07:32:28] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> keekle: Yeap

[07:32:37] <RandomNinja> I need to get back to working out tho
[07:32:57] <keekle> so why is there no expecation of abs on women?
[07:33:01] <keekle> sexism i say!
[07:33:10] <RandomNinja> pls those are great as well
[07:33:21] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> keekle: Because women have babies.
[07:33:25] <RandomNinja> I never said anything about abs > no abs being male exclusive
[07:33:37] <Faith> Girls should be able to bench press you, dangit
[07:33:38] <keekle> well true, but some seem to
[07:33:47] <Muffin_Spectacles> BritishImperialKuuga-RX: Some women don't want kids. I have a couple relatives in my family. Child-rearing isn't one of their priorities.
[07:33:48] <RandomNinja> those people are silly :P
[07:33:58] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> keekle: Those girls are more sporty.
[07:34:19] <Muffin_Spectacles> Though I did find out my one sister is attempting to start a family with her husband. Did make me flash to being called, "Uncle Mike."
[07:34:25] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Too true.
[07:34:49] <Faith> I've been Uncle Joe since I was like 2 haha
[07:35:02] <keekle> you make it seem like starting a family with someone else would have been an option too, Muffin_Spectacles
[07:35:14] <RandomNinja> I'm the oldest, so I'm expecting another 5 years at least before that
[07:35:30] <CameronAubernon> I've been Aunt Cameron since finding out I had siblings old enough to have children.
[07:35:44] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: when I was younger, I dreamed of finding someone, having kids, being in California. Having a cute little black-haired, brown-eyed child. If a girl, maybe name her after my Mom.
[07:35:55] <CameronAubernon> (dad's been married six times)
[07:35:59] <keekle> sorry i meant for your sister
[07:36:01] <Faith> Auntie Cam, can we play on top of the Space Needle?
[07:36:05] <RandomNinja> I have an aunt who's 4 years older than me :P

[07:36:43] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: Welcome to the Pinkie Zone.
[07:36:50] <Eywind> Very non PG though

[07:37:02] <keekle> i was joking that the last part f that was superflous
[07:37:11] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Well, in this day and age, it helps to be specific.
[07:37:29] * CameronAubernon wonders where the dub'd KLK can be watched; Hulu only has the sub, which she saw already
[07:37:29] <Faith> aaaaand on that note, I'm outta here

[07:37:42] <RandomNinja> CameronAubernon, yarr
[07:37:43] <CameronAubernon> oooh
[07:37:48] <Kelazi5> night faith
[07:37:54] <Faith> Goodnight all <3
[07:37:55] <keekle> CameronAubernon: possibly crunchyroll.com too
[07:38:05] <keekle> and its on netflix too, but not sure if subbed or dubbed

[07:38:08] * DerpyBot picks up Fillyfeathers and aims carefully for Faith

[07:38:11] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Though sometimes, I remember my last girlfriend, almost a decade ago. She would actually dreaming of having children with me...that definitely unsettled me.
[07:38:13] *** Faith was kicked by DerpyBot (Incoming!)
[07:38:50] <keekle> i do hear the KLK dub is actually good
[07:38:59] <RandomNinja> yeah I heard that
[07:39:05] <RandomNinja> like better than original
[07:39:12] <keekle> tahts what some like to think
[07:39:18] <keekle> but, not sure if thats possible
[07:39:22] <RandomNinja> sure it is
[07:39:30] <RandomNinja> I think Cowboy Bebop is the same
[07:39:32] <keekle> i guess if you are not japanese it could be
[07:39:32] <Muffin_Spectacles> I guess I am getting older. Every other person around me is having kids. My sisters are in the same boat, though while one I think is willing to conform, the other is going to hold onto her freedom as long as she can.
[07:39:34] *** Quits: Fallfeathers (Fallfeather@Pony-1kul4f.internode.on.net) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[07:39:39] <RandomNinja> but it's definitely far between
[07:39:50] <RandomNinja> how old are you?
[07:39:52] <Kelazi5> The Samuraii Pizza Cats dub was way better the original too
[07:39:59] <Muffin_Spectacles> Of course, once I die, my Mom's bloodline will die with me. :( Grandpa Wong, I will have failed you :(...
[07:40:20] <keekle> you are too young to give up, Muffin_Spectacles
[07:40:32] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Muffin_Spectacles: ...
[07:40:37] <keekle> heck i am older than you and i havent given up finding a second someone
[07:40:37] <Kelazi5> Yeah, all my old classmates from elementary and high school are having kids and here I am playing pokemon and ponies
[07:40:44] <RandomNinja> live hard, die young :P
[07:41:01] <RandomNinja> you already have kids tho keekle 
[07:41:02] <keekle> though i am fine with no more kids
[07:41:05] <keekle> ^
[07:41:12] <RandomNinja> not really the same 
[07:41:24] <keekle> well true, but its easier for guys as they could always find someone younger
[07:41:26] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I'm not young like I once was, and my crazy standards aren' going to help. Every other person says the same thing, '...do you have to hold to those standards?'
[07:41:27] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Not me I plan live for about 800 more years atleast. 
[07:41:46] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: , you have to ask yourself if your standards are worth keeping you lonely
[07:41:47] <RandomNinja> with science?
[07:41:55] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: maybe
[07:41:59] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: or you can go for an arranged asian marraige of sorts
[07:42:09] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: is that even possible these days?
[07:42:20] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> It is possible.
[07:42:23] <keekle> it certainly still happens a lot in asia
[07:42:25] * CameronAubernon big hugs for everyone
[07:42:28] <CameronAubernon> nini MMLers
[07:42:35] <keekle> i am sure they would love to marry their daughter with an american guy
[07:42:36] <Eywind> Night Cam!
[07:42:37] <Kelazi5> night cam
[07:42:40] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I think it's largely my old-school mentality coming to light, seeing as my Mom's parents were arranged...but then again, I'm not one who has a lot to offer.
[07:42:40] <keekle> i mean some family
[07:42:40] <CameronAubernon> !moon
[07:42:40] <DerpyBot> Grab my tail, CameronAubernon!
[07:42:43] <CameronAubernon> wooooooooooo
[07:42:44] *** CameronAubernon was kicked by DerpyBot (To the moon!)
[07:43:10] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: you are an americna in a big city with a real job... thats a lot right there for a girl from a village in china
[07:43:15] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Muffin_Spectacles: I like the idea of arranged marriages.
[07:43:18] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I will admit, there was this cute girl I met a couple years ago, but whenever I see her FB posts, the NSync song that I live by always starts playing.
[07:44:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> BritishImperialKuuga-RX: Though it does make me feel guilty, that I'm somewhat playing into the white-male fantasy of foreign girls falling for Americans. But then, I'm a mixed kid, so I've always been a little mixed-up.
[07:44:15] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: you have the benefit of being part asian.. thas a huge plus
[07:44:31] <Kelazi5> I'm more of a if I find someone worth it, great. If I don't, that's fine too.
[07:44:49] <Muffin_Spectacles> ...I seem to be drifting this room into post-V-day blues.
[07:44:51] <keekle> it sounds like an arrangedmarriage would actually be the most logical for you, Muffin_Spectacles :)
[07:44:58] <keekle> nah we are working on solutions here!
[07:45:04] <keekle> and also, its the 15th here..whew
[07:45:04] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Muffin_Spectacles: As am I.
[07:45:37] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Well, I'm usually one to side on the realms of caution. As well, after a relationship almost a decade ago, much of my world-view on romantics was shattered forever.
[07:45:55] <keekle> romance isnt everything it is cracked up to be
[07:46:06] <Eywind> Still, it means that you always have someone that cares about you there
[07:46:15] <Muffin_Spectacles> BritishImperialKuuga-RX: I can definitely relate to Flash's 'One no would have been fine' line. It's like Flash and Charlie Brown are the stories of my life.
[07:46:17] <keekle> i was married for 18 years and many of them were not happy because i assumed it must be meant to be
[07:46:20] <Eywind> So it's worth trying
[07:46:29] <Eywind> Well that's not romance keekle
[07:46:37] <keekle> well it was to begin with
[07:46:43] <keekle> otherwise we woudnt have gotten married
[07:46:47] <Eywind> Well yeah
[07:46:48] <keekle> at least i would like to think not
[07:46:49] <Eywind> but it's not ongoing
[07:46:57] <keekle> true, once you are married its all over
[07:46:59] <keekle> ahem :)
[07:47:01] <Eywind> lol
[07:47:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> On one post tonight, I mentioned how I wanted to be the Prince in Beauty and the Beast, but I've come to accept I'll just be the sidekick. People ask me why I always put so much into trying to make sure others are happy, but I don't do it for myself.
[07:47:19] <Eywind> Well you are happy when they're happy
[07:47:32] <Eywind> Everything a person does is for themselves in one way, shape, or form
[07:47:45] <Muffin_Spectacles> Sometimes, I like to imagine that this fever for 'yellow' happene due to my young age, and a dance around when I was 3 or 4.
[07:47:45] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: If not then backup plan, 160 years.
[07:47:45] <keekle> its only human for people to try to make others happy.. thats what i did for the last 10 years of my marriage, to little avail
[07:47:55] * RandomNinja hugs keekle 
[07:48:01] <Eywind> keekle, because typically making other people happy makes you happy
[07:48:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I took a personality assessment test, and foudn out I am smack dab in the middle of 'Support.' 
[07:48:20] <keekle> yeah but when trying to make people happy still doesnt make them happy you eventually have to cut your losses
[07:48:29] <keekle> or you will go crazy
[07:48:42] <Muffin_Spectacles> When I took a Big Hero 6 personality test, I wasn't surprised when I ended up getting Baymax.
[07:49:00] <Muffin_Spectacles> My coworkers know I am that way as well: I try to make life less-complicated, and want there to be a balance.
[07:49:00] <Eywind> Yeah, but those tests are limited
[07:49:46] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: But to live that long I need to change my diet.
[07:49:49] <keekle> there is a thing called trying too hard to do the right thing
[07:49:59] <keekle> it tends to backfire
[07:50:31] <Muffin_Spectacles> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEUGDh8NwQw - the theme of my wish for romantic entanglement.
[07:51:02] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: Then I would be the worlds oldest Brony.
[07:51:17] <RandomNinja> not necessarily
[07:51:17] <Kelazi5> Well, I should probably go to bed now, don't want to stay up until 4am again
[07:51:22] <RandomNinja> anyways I'm going out for a bit
[07:51:37] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> At 160 years I would be.
[07:51:41] <Eywind> Night Kelazi5
[07:51:48] <Kelazi5> !cadence
[07:51:48] * DerpyBot picks up ponyshouldponypony and aims carefully for Kelazi5
[07:51:50] * DerpyBot throws ponyshouldponypony towards Kelazi5 with all her might
[07:51:52] <keekle> later RandomNinja
[07:51:53] <Muffin_Spectacles> whenever I think of the one girl I met at PIXAr during a fundraiser, this NSync song comes back. She's not wholly Asian, but she's so cute, with a great unnnatural name, and she was so bubbly and great. Plus, she's a Back to the Future fan! I think that was when she wouldn't leave my thoughts.
[07:51:53] *** Kelazi5 was kicked by DerpyBot (Incoming!)
[07:51:54] <RandomNinja> not necessarity
[07:52:06] <RandomNinja> if you live that long, who's to say someone else doesn't as well
[07:52:06] <Muffin_Spectacles> Almost eyes...and she could draw Marty McFly, and Doc Brown!
[07:52:14] <keekle> so what happened?
[07:52:24] <keekle> did you make a move?
[07:52:28] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> RandomNinja: I forgot about that.
[07:52:57] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: No, I never do. Ive been shot down too many times in the past to ask to be her b-friend. Plus, she's 2000 miles away in California, and at least 6-8 years younger than me.
[07:53:14] <keekle> 6-8 years is nothing
[07:53:17] <Muffin_Spectacles> My entire life has been 'be friends.'
[07:53:33] <keekle> hey friends sometimes leads to more, sometimes not. but nothing leads to nothing
[07:53:37] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I know, but this is these days. I know my Mom's parents had a 10 year age difference between them.
[07:54:06] <keekle> well even these days age difference is irrelevant
[07:54:23] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> keekle: To true
[07:54:34] <keekle> well as long as she is legal of course
[07:54:40] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I guess I just cling to that moment when I saw her open sketchbook, and hear her saying how 'Back to the Future is my favorite movie,' and hearing myself express the same. Someone so cute like her...liking that great film about time-travel, romance, and crazed science fiction?
[07:54:40] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> *Too
[07:55:20] <keekle> sounds like the perfect person to find some sort of excuse to find a way to communicate with electronically about something notionally related
[07:55:31] <keekle> which then could lead to something else
[07:55:35] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: She is. But she already feels out of my league. She's a California art school graduate, who is friends with lots of people in animation. She's been invited to wrap parties, animation studios...the most I can do is write about animation, and blog, given my scant BFA in animation, and my GD job.
[07:56:26] <keekle> your biggest enemy is your own assumptions.. i should know that by now myself but its still true
[07:56:28] * Muffin_Spectacles is surprised this room hasn't yet shut him down for ranting like a lunatic.
[07:56:44] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Muffin_Spectacles: No worries mate.
[07:56:51] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I'm an overthinker. I tend to find the holes in my plans before they are implemented.
[07:56:53] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> And now I am Australian
[07:57:06] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: believe me i know.. 
[07:57:42] <keekle> i tend to think even starting to talk to a woman is not worth the effort because i would never know how to actually take it anywhere meaningful
[07:58:32] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I think that's why I can't hate human Flash like alot of people can. I've been on the receiving end of many negative rejections, and I always consider myself a nice guy. I don't connive my way to getting things.
[07:59:14] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: though I have been cautious, because I got a bit carried away obsessing over a girl in high school, to the point where her friends came to me and had to tell me calmly that I needed to 'stop.'
[07:59:21] <keekle> but just yesterday i was in a virtual world and pretended i was funny and confident, and ended up becoming good friends with two women.. nothing romantic at this point of course, and still virtual, but its proof its not impossible, maybe
[08:00:07] <keekle> (and no, this i not normal for me at all)
[08:00:40] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Well, as long as it's not hooking up and all that, anything is possible. though in my experience, what I look for in The Real World, is relatively impossible. I'm not some kid in Berkeley who has wealthy grandparents, has an Acura, and dreams of one day marrying into wealth. (I guess that's for my mental RP personality to do)
[08:01:20] <keekle> i am not sure all women want that.. they are after all almost half the population
[08:01:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: There was something a few months ago where some women were saying, 'guys, stop telling us you're nice guys. If you have to keep telling us that, then you're pathetic.'
[08:02:13] <keekle> i do agree nice guys have it harder for some reason
[08:02:36] * Twilightlicious watches the conversation from a distance
[08:02:40] <Eywind> Because being a 'nice guy' doesn't make you a desirable mate lol
[08:02:44] <ThunderBolt> oh god its horrible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7MQDULNIdU
[08:02:47] <Eywind> I mean not the only aspect
[08:02:52] <keekle> though reliability and humor are valuable traits too that shouldnt be undersold
[08:03:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: Yeah, look at all the MLP fan opinions about 'Brad.'
[08:03:13] <keekle> but he is sort of smarmy
[08:03:32] <keekle> if he was a nerdy geek i think people would be okay with it
[08:03:33] <Eywind> Yeah keekle, but like you can't hope that being a 'nice guy' covers up all your flaws
[08:03:57] <Eywind> People didn't like Flash Sentry because it was a forced romance aspect in a show that's steered very clear of romance in the past.
[08:04:22] <Eywind> It didn't help that they decided they needed to make him desirable to Sunset Shimmer too
[08:04:25] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: But I think in the grand scheme of things, they didn't shoehorn him in half as much as they could have.
[08:04:34] <keekle> very true.. reality is a lot more complicated.. like even though i talked to some of these people for hours yesterday, i realized in hindsight i really knew hardly anything
[08:04:36] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: I did have a theory of that.
[08:04:39] <Eywind> He was handled a lot better in RR lol
[08:04:50] <Eywind> everyone had the chance to hate him
[08:05:10] <Muffin_Spectacles> i don't hate him...though now he is making me feel self-conscious with his adonis-body.
[08:05:27] <keekle> i feel bad for starting this by mentioning flash abs
[08:05:30] <Muffin_Spectacles> I rather find humor in seeing people get riled up over him.
[08:05:46] <Eywind> Honestly having a good physical state is something people should strive for
[08:05:58] <Eywind> It's a great way of immediately showing people that you care about that >.>
[08:06:06] <Eywind> Obviously having ripped abs is a bit too much
[08:06:07] <keekle> bronies are geeks, on average, and it doesnt feel like flash is one, thus there is resentment
[08:06:13] <Eywind> Well yes keekle
[08:06:18] <Eywind> jock stealing your waifu is bad
[08:06:24] <keekle> abs doesnt help at all
[08:06:30] <Eywind> yea those are toys though
[08:06:31] <Muffin_Spectacles> I will admit, I had a little history lesson in September when  went home. I found my Mom had saved a number of letters my Dad had written her. I didn't tell him, but it was interesting to think how he was in his mid-20's, writing these letters and a little love-struck in his head.
[08:06:35] <keekle> now if he was stealing rainbow it would make perfect sense
[08:06:54] * Muffin_Spectacles doesn't believe in the whole Waifu mumbo-jumbo.
[08:06:56] <Eywind> at least pony flash sentry is a normal pony
[08:07:07] <Eywind> not Big Mac-esque or something
[08:07:10] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: it only matters if sufficient fans believe it
[08:07:26] <Eywind> which they do
[08:07:36] <Eywind> there's enough self-insert shipfics out there to show that people do :P
[08:07:55] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I do like Silver Quill's analysis. Flash isn't a 'bad guy,' but he needed more reasons to make us 'believe.'
[08:07:57] <keekle> twilight is probably the pony with highest percent of self insertion fics
[08:08:19] <keekle> yeah the problem is that he seems to have very little actually in common with twilight
[08:08:24] <keekle> pony fans sense that
[08:08:24] <Eywind> she's the most developed character, is pretty emotionally vulnerable, and has one of the more multi-faceted personalities
[08:08:29] <Eywind> as well as being crucial to everything
[08:08:45] <keekle> its only natural to be protective of her, even if she is not your waifu
[08:08:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> I sometimes joke, 'we just need to rip those long strands of hair out from njear her ears, so she'll stop twidding them when thinking of Flash.'
[08:08:55] <Eywind> Yep because you care about her as a character
[08:08:58] <keekle> you instinctly want her to find someone that is compatible
[08:08:58] <Eywind> hahaha
[08:09:28] <keekle> heck even that science guy would be a far better fit
[08:09:32] <Eywind> oh god
[08:09:34] <Eywind> please no
[08:09:42] <Eywind> Just ship her with Shimmer
[08:09:44] *** Quits: ChaoticRift (ChaoticRift@Pony-dqdlcl.7h3b.037j.000a.2601.IP) (Quit: Signal 9 happened)
[08:09:46] <Muffin_Spectacles> Why wouldTwilight like Bill Nye?
[08:09:48] <keekle> the environmental guy?
[08:09:54] <Eywind> Not Bill Neigh the teacher Muffin_Spectacles lol
[08:09:54] <keekle> well that kitchen scene was pretty romantic
[08:10:04] <keekle> ahem
[08:10:05] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: If I made someone laugh: mission accoplished.
[08:10:10] <keekle> until rock ruined the moment
[08:10:33] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: "who could possibly need this much whip cream?" *hinthintwinkwhinkknowwhattameanknowwhaatamean?*
[08:10:45] <keekle> exactly! that could go in so many directions
[08:10:51] <Eywind> keekle see PM :P
[08:11:02] <DinkyBot> !lullaby
[08:11:02] * DerpyBot carries DinkyBot off to a soft cloud and lies down with DinkyBot on her belly
[08:11:02] * DerpyBot hums a lullaby for DinkyBot
[08:11:50] <RandomNinja> that was refreshing
[08:11:55] <keekle> they played the pj party admirably low key
[08:11:57] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Muffin_Spectacles: I get it.
[08:12:06] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Muffin_Spectacles: (wink wink)
[08:12:06] <keekle> not a single pillow fight
[08:12:55] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> keekle: I was expecting a pillow fight though.
[08:13:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> BritishImperialKuuga-RX: I do imagine Loki unfriending Pinkie for another pointless 'status update.'
[08:13:05] <keekle> to be fair, so was I
[08:13:20] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> Muffin_Spectacles: too true.
[08:13:28] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> *Too
[08:13:46] <keekle> so is pinkie telapathically connected to her alter egos in other dimensions?
[08:13:52] <Eywind> pinkie is pinkie
[08:13:54] <Muffin_Spectacles> It is funny how the first movie, noone really loved Sunset, the second movie, she's the 'cute kitten' of the whole thing.
[08:14:03] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> keekle: Seems like it.
[08:14:07] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Onl Meghan McCarthy knows.
[08:14:18] <Eywind> Muffin_Spectacles because she's instantly more relatable
[08:14:19] <keekle> Muffin_Spectacles: to be fair, she was "redeemed"
[08:14:25] <keekle> bronies are a forgiving bunch
[08:14:40] <Eywind> Also, I pointed something out with a certain person in here
[08:14:50] <Eywind> A lot of people probably like Shimmer because other people like her
[08:14:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: I did think it'd be a great topic, if anyone had ever encountered such a thing in their lives: i.e. someone who seemed mean and bad, but redeemed themselves.
[08:15:01] <Eywind> The fact that someone sees that people can like someone else that's made mistakes but owned up to them
[08:15:11] <Eywind> means that people like that kind of character too because they think they can be liked like that
[08:15:15] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> For me not just the main 6 but also the Sirens.
[08:15:19] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: i never really hated her. In the first film, I saw her as  genius-level student, who felt entitled...but fell from grace.
[08:15:28] <BritishImperialKuuga-RX> That Adagio she be fine.
[08:15:38] <keekle> in some ways, it was quite admirable that they turned the villian of the first movie into the defacto hero of the second
[08:15:38] <Eywind> yep
[08:15:49] * DerpyBot perches on the tree next to her house, watching out for her muffin
[08:15:50] * DinkyBot comes skipping her way home and whistles up to her momma, "Hooooooome!"
[08:15:54] <Eywind> Muffin_Spectacles you should read shimmer in the winningverse
[08:15:58] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: It feels like that old adage of, 'give someone a chance to prove themselves.'
[08:16:00] <keekle> but i suspect we will never see the sirens again
[08:16:03] <Eywind> Don't even need to know the rest of the story really, just sets some backup stories
[08:16:08] <Eywind> keekle Fiendship is Magic :P
[08:16:10] <Muffin_Spectacles> Eywind: Sorry, I stick to mycredo of 'no fanfics.'
[08:16:13] <Eywind> oh ok
[08:16:20] <Eywind> If you don't like it you don't like it I guess
[08:16:20] <keekle> though i still think the mane 6 were jerks for not letting sunset play with them in the first place
[08:16:23] <keekle> they didnt even ask her
[08:16:31] <keekle> or mane 5 + 1
[08:16:37] <Eywind> mane 5
[08:16:38] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Yeah, all 'Twilight, you will help us!'
[08:16:45] <Eywind> Well it shows the whole thing
[08:16:47] <Eywind> they relied on Twilight
[08:16:54] <keekle> sunset should have been like "umm hello?!"
[08:17:14] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: but she's been knocked back down to square one, so she's trying to rediscover herself, and what to do.
[08:17:18] <Eywind> well she didn't want to overstep
[08:17:33] <keekle> well true, she was too polite to actually speak up
[08:17:37] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I equate her to being like an addict: she's discovered her problem, and now has to figure out where to go.
[08:17:38] <Eywind> Not polite
[08:17:39] <keekle> but she shouldnt have needed to
[08:17:41] <Eywind> I'd say more 'fearful'
[08:17:44] <Eywind> or at least anxious
[08:17:49] <keekle> fearful/embarassed
[08:18:12] <keekle> and every time they jabbed her it proved why
[08:18:25] *** Dusk is now known as Night
[08:18:28] <Muffin_Spectacles> That's why I want to do my next PMV about her, using Michael W Smith's 'Place in this World.' It fits her to a 'T.'
[08:18:28] <keekle> "no offense.." "yeah right!"
[08:18:50] <Muffin_Spectacles> Though I also will admit, RR made me want to meet Rebecca Shoichet.
[08:19:14] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: the 'no offense' is to SS, what the footbal is to charlie Brown.
[08:20:04] <keekle> so sunset is your waifu, Muffin_Spectacles? ;)
[08:20:12] <Muffin_Spectacles> Though part of me did find it a little awkward when Twilight met Sunset. I was thinking, 'she wrote you those entries in the journal...why don't you take her hand?"
[08:20:24] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I don't subscribe to the whole WAifu thing.
[08:20:47] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: not subscribing to it, makes te Waifu complaints all the more entertaining.
[08:20:55] <keekle> depends on how you define it.. you find your self mysteriously drawn to the sunset character?
[08:21:46] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I'm a little soft-spoken in RL, so sometimes those character are intersting. Maybe that's why fluttershy was so interesting to me.
[08:22:07] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Though I will admit: when someione needs to step forward, I have done that.
[08:22:51] <keekle> waifu is just short hand 
[08:23:15] <Muffin_Spectacles> Well, I'm going to be right back. Need some more liquid propulsion.

[08:40:58] <keekle> though i guess i didnt look how well.. um developed her character is
[08:41:37] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> keekle I still sometimes fall into that range as well.
[08:42:00] <keekle> how do you mean?

[08:42:17] <Muffin_Spectacles> I'm moreso the guy who wants to be chivalrous.

[08:42:44] * RandomNinja tips Muffin_Spectacles  :P
[08:42:49] <keekle> women dont seem to expect chivarly anymore
[08:42:50] <Muffin_Spectacles> I think that's why I really liked Fluttershy's eps.
[08:42:54] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> keekle: Can not really explain just that well you know.
[08:43:18] <keekle> gender is becoming somewhat obsolete anyway these days
[08:43:31] <Muffin_Spectacles> Though I will admit, Pinkie Pride gave me some extra courage when I applied for a position a year ago.
[08:43:33] <keekle> or, rather, its become sort of a spectrum with two peaks
[08:43:52] <Muffin_Spectacles> I was originally thinking, 'this is the 6th time I've tried for this. Why bother?' but the Pinkie Lament helped me.
[08:44:25] *** Night is now known as Dusk
[08:44:29] <Muffin_Spectacles> I did enjoy telling Libman that the episode helped me, and she smiled when I told her that this time, I got theposition.
[08:44:57] <keekle> libman and her portrayals helped me get through my divorce, so i can see that
[08:45:07] <keekle> she just has a way of making you feel positive

[08:46:11] <keekle> she is a great antidepressant and anti axniety medicine all in one
[08:46:35] <Muffin_Spectacles> Though I will admit, I get a strange little thrill out of Rarity hitting Pinkie with a newspaper and telling her to 'shut up.' I almost want to say 'Rarity...I've been bad too.'
[08:47:00] <keekle> pinkie doesnt really know when to stop sometimes
[08:47:11] <keekle> she has some inhibiition control issues
[08:47:14] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I have that proble once every few years.
[08:47:56] <keekle> you need someone to wap you with a newspaper now and then
[08:48:44] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: I think given the fact that some women on my Mom's side have smacked their guy's upside the head a few times, I came to accept that episode.
[08:49:48] <keekle> well its getting late and i need some sleep.. but.. i am sure i will see you all later
[08:50:03] <Muffin_Spectacles> I saw this great short tonight called The Dam Keeper, and I hope it'll win for animated short at the Oscars. In a way,  int reminded me a little of Applebloom being mocked because she doesn't ahve a cutie mark.
[08:50:21] <Muffin_Spectacles> keekle: Evening Keekle.  I believe you are my Iowa consort?
[08:50:35] <DJMidli> ayyyy lmao
