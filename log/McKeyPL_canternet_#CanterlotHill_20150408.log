[00:45:45] <Araxnus> RandomNinja: lol. nu on that
[00:45:52] <Eywind> Why not Epsilon difficulty?
[00:46:01] <RandomNinja> if you don't get rekt by more than 3 enemies at once, it's too easy
[00:46:08] <RandomNinja> stop being a skrublord
[00:46:20] <Hamtramck> Random they probably would if 9/11 never happened :V
[00:46:31] <RandomNinja> Araxnus play fists only then :P
[00:46:32] <Eywind> ?
[00:46:32] <Araxnus> Mmm. I forgot how good that E song was
[00:46:40] <StrykerVylon> !t fists?
[00:46:42] <DinkyBot> *shakes fists* Laaar-son!

[00:47:14] <Araxnus> I found that track on Pandora in like 07
[00:47:31] <RandomNinja> but ya do a no guns run :P
[00:47:42] <Araxnus> That is a thing?
[00:47:50] * StrykerVylon 360 noscopes RandomNinja
[00:48:16] <RandomNinja> well you can choose to never fire a gun for most of the game
[00:48:34] <RandomNinja> use fists, explosives, vehicles etc
[00:48:46] <Araxnus> Ah
[00:48:57] <StrykerVylon> Vehicles have guns mounted on them >.>
[00:49:04] <RandomNinja> ideally, you want to attach explosives to a jeep and punch it into a bunch of koreans
[00:49:15] <StrykerVylon> ...
[00:49:22] <StrykerVylon> I have no idea how to react to that RandomNinja
[00:49:22] <RandomNinja> StrykerVylon, then don't use the turret :P
[00:49:38] <RandomNinja> have you played Crysis?
[00:49:41] <EqualPie> I wish equestria was real place
[00:49:52] <StrykerVylon> Nope.
[00:50:05] <RandomNinja> the north korean army is the main enemy for most of the game
[00:50:13] <StrykerVylon> ...
[00:50:23] <EqualPie> I would so get discord to turn Me into a pony so I could hang out with pinkie pie
[00:50:32] <RandomNinja> then later aliens, but they aren't as fun to do silly things to
[00:50:36] <StrykerVylon> Are they as horrible at military in the game as they are in real life?
[00:50:47] <Araxnus> Raxy would tour with Trixie
[00:50:50] <Eywind> Yeah EqualPie cuz Discord would let you do that no strings attached
[00:50:50] <RandomNinja> not really
[00:51:02] <StrykerVylon> Than 2/10 
[00:51:06] <RandomNinja> on highest difficulty they're pretty good
[00:51:12] <EqualPie> Eywind maybe be his friend for life?
[00:51:13] <RandomNinja> like very perceptive and decent shots
[00:51:17] <RandomNinja> they're really dumb though
[00:51:18] <Eywind> uhhuh
[00:51:18] <Araxnus> Also I would think you would already be a pony there
