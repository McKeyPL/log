[14:45:00] <Unixkitty> Are you saying Minecrafting is not a "cool thing"? Oh wait you mean vanilla, don't you... Okay, perhaps you are right then.
[14:45:30] <Cloud_Zephyr> i gave u minecraft roughly a year ago after playing too much

[14:46:35] <Unixkitty> And of course it is! I personally haven't been able to truly give it up for... well, years
[14:46:55] <Unixkitty> Ever since I started poking at it in early beta...
[14:47:58] <Cloud_Zephyr> trying to sync the worlds between computers isn't working. i shall resort to manual moving files
[14:48:42] <Unixkitty> Wouldn't something like dropbox help with that?
[14:49:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> thats basically wut im trying (just with a local nas)
[14:49:45] <Unixkitty> If you're trying to have them sync across a local network, then shouldn't be too hard with a proper network share I'd say
[14:52:07] <Cloud_Zephyr> i've made a shortcut in the saves folder to the file which is stored on my network share
[14:52:13] <Cloud_Zephyr> but it ignores it
[14:52:52] <Unixkitty> I personally would try to either symlink the whole instance folder, or at least just the worlds' in question
[14:53:30] <Cloud_Zephyr> is there a difference between a symlink and a shortcut?
[14:54:03] <Unixkitty> I do believe symlinks can fool applications into going through them as if they were actual folders.

[20:16:04] <Cloud_Zephyr> ^
[20:16:17] <Araxnus> Comcast already won I feel
[20:16:24] <RandomNinja> Concast
[20:16:32] <Flurshy> comcast is a company
[20:16:38] <Flurshy> that gives them an advantage in court
[20:16:47] <Araxnus> Cox Cable and FiOs own the rest.
[20:17:18] <Flurshy> my home internet is 4G
[20:17:23] <Flurshy> I get 20GB a month Arax
[20:17:25] <Araxnus> I guess their is CenturyLink and Google Fiber. But that is not in a lot of places.
[20:17:26] <Cloud_Zephyr> the greed in america baffles me
[20:17:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> dont they have enough money?
[20:17:57] <Flurshy> not enough to get that private island they want, not yet
[20:17:59] <Trildar> Never enoygh
[20:18:08] <Cloud_Zephyr> lel
[20:18:16] <Flurshy> gotta make bigger profits so they can build private paradise
[20:18:17] <Araxnus> Flurshy: I know your pain. I used to have Clearwire 4G and get like 1Mbps. I was paying for 10
[20:18:27] <Flurshy> we get 8mbps
[20:18:37] * RandomNinja violently downloads the internet :3
[20:19:03] <Flurshy> problem is, if you paced the down speed so that you couldn't go over the limit with constant use, it would be dialup speed
[20:19:22] <Araxnus> I want FiOs. Speeds up to 500MB and Unlimited. But would need to move.
[20:20:02] <Araxnus> I mean. Mbps.
[20:20:10] <Araxnus> MB is not the same
[20:20:12] <Flurshy> well since companies aren't willing to compete with each other in non-urban zip codes
[20:20:40] <wobniaR> Yeah except fios charges $300 a month where I'm at for 500 mbsps
[20:20:41] <Trildar> 500MBps would be crazy.
[20:20:45] <Hearts_the_Yoshi> hmmm
[20:20:48] <wobniaR> mbps*(
[20:21:31] <Araxnus> wobniaR: xD I would be fine with theie 150Mbps plan. 
[20:21:52] <Araxnus> If you need more then that speed. I love to know what you are doing. lol
[20:21:56] <RandomNinja> hm I should go acquire gym membership now that it's open, for once
[20:22:07] <Araxnus> I just want unlimited data
[20:22:10] <RandomNinja> I haz :3
[20:22:13] <RandomNinja> u jelly?
[20:22:31] <Trildar> Streaming 10 livestreams up and down simultaneously? :P
[20:22:52] <Trildar> Or maybe streaming 4k
[20:22:57] <Araxnus> xD
[20:23:16] <RandomNinja> isn't 4K only like 25 mbps anyway?
[20:23:35] <Araxnus> 4K would be fine with 50 up.
[20:23:50] <Araxnus> But it would need to be a stable 50.
[20:23:54] <RandomNinja> ya
[20:23:55] <Araxnus> Again FiOs.

[20:27:07] <Araxnus> Pretty much

[20:28:21] * DinkyBot hides her head under the blankets and grumbles. "5 more minutes, momma!"
[20:28:24] <RandomNinja> does Shadowplay support stream?
[20:28:36] <RandomNinja> anyway does it really take that much performance?
[20:28:38] <Araxnus> It does. So does OBS.
[20:28:57] <RandomNinja> well there you go then, almost free streams

[20:30:55] <Araxnus> lol. Slag
[20:31:18] <Trildar> Capture is one thing. The encoding would take up quite a bit of CPU. I'm guessing the capture card has an encoder though?
[20:31:44] * Trildar applies slag to Araxnus
[20:32:10] <wobniaR> I like cryo more than slag
[20:32:20] <Araxnus> It does, yes. Then again they cost like $200 or more so
[20:32:24] <wobniaR> Slag is why UVHM is nothing but bullet sponges

[22:46:04] <Araxnus> Is it? I like 2 the best. But have not finished 1 or Warhead.
[22:46:54] <RandomNinja> I mean, you can attach a sniper scope to a shotgun, use it to shoot down a tree 50 m away so it falls on and kills a korean
[22:47:02] <RandomNinja> also, you can punch jeeps so they flip
[22:47:34] <RandomNinja> and tape C4 only a jeep and drive it into a bunch of enemies/a tank
[22:47:44] <Araxnus> That is all pretty awesome!
