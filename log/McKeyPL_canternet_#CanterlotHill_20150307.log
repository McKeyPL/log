[00:03:11] <Cloud_Zephyr> takes forever to timestamp each mix
[00:03:33] <Araxnus> Uploading is fun ;)
[00:03:39] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[00:03:44] <NightmareMoon> I blame HardBelle
[00:03:50] <Eywind> just timestamp when you actually do it
[00:03:57] <Cloud_Zephyr> i could do it the easy way and simply not timestamp. but im ocd and i want the artists to get paid :P
[00:03:59] <Eywind> then you won't have to catch back up
[00:04:01] <Araxnus> I blame TechRat
[00:04:12] <Eywind> How do the artists get paid if you timestamp your mix?
[00:04:41] <HardBelle> But NightmareMoon, the defence rests...
[00:04:41] <Cloud_Zephyr> mixcloud pays royalties. but it needs to know wut the songs are

[01:42:17] <One-Trick> i had to call that damn microsoft activation phone number and the code is like 36 characters long
[01:42:22] <One-Trick> and it wants to repeat it all to you
[01:42:28] <Moonlightning> groan
[01:42:37] <Moonlightning> just look up the damn ID
[01:42:40] <Araxnus> One-Trick: That is a pain. Lets hope I don't
[01:42:44] <Moonlightning> If I got it wrong, it won't exist
[01:43:02] <Moonlightning> It's faster to just repeat the entire damn thing than to confirm it
[01:43:19] <Moonlightning> especially since you can rattle it off superfast and the machine should still pick it up
[01:43:39] <One-Trick> some reason it cant hear what im saying so i had to enter it each section at a time on my keypad

[05:51:43] <DinkyBot> Wii sports resort is actually a teacher. It is implied that Star Swirl knew that Twilight was suppose to handle that you probably haven't heard of Sunset Shadows
[05:51:49] <wobniaR> I used tombstone's skeleton remix for a class presentation
[05:51:54] <wobniaR> One dude knew
[05:52:05] <MikeM> baited
[05:52:05] <Angel_Bunny> I showed my friend
[05:52:08] <Angel_Bunny> who played it for his gf and friends
[05:52:27] <Angel_Bunny> doubt anyone knew
[05:52:40] <StrykerVylon> Angel_Bunny has other friends and those friends are in relationships? :O
[05:52:41] <StrykerVylon> :P
[05:52:42] <wobniaR> The skeleton army grows
[05:52:58] <Angel_Bunny> he's dating my ex lol
[05:53:39] <Faith> I'm dating no such person
[05:53:49] <Muffin_Spectacles> That reminds me...anyone think that Celestia went a little nutty after her sister's banishment?
[05:53:57] <Angel_Bunny> banana nut?
[05:53:58] <wobniaR> She was very sad
[05:54:05] <Muffin_Spectacles> Consider this: her two 'students,' each shared a name that was about light at the end of the day.'
[05:54:16] <Angel_Bunny> two of her students
[05:54:25] <Muffin_Spectacles> Sunset Shimmer...and Twilight Sparkle.
[05:54:30] <Angel_Bunny> ok?
[05:54:37] <wobniaR> That was intentional
[05:54:42] <Angel_Bunny> Obviously the most powerful magic in the universe are the sun and moon
[05:54:54] <DinkyBot> !shoo
[05:54:54] * DerpyBot sways from side to side, quietly humming "shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo"
[05:54:54] <DinkyBot> What a silly song, momma!
[05:54:58] <wobniaR> Basically Sunset shimmer was what Twilight could've become
[05:55:03] <Angel_Bunny> so being affliated with those are probably gonna get you 
[05:55:06] <wobniaR> Two sides of the same person
[05:55:14] <Angel_Bunny> Twi could play guitar
[05:55:19] <Muffin_Spectacles> wobniaR: Well, both were rather un-relatable to other ponies, but Twilight was able to go forward and learn.
[05:55:29] <Angel_Bunny> Shimmer is more relatable to bronies
[05:55:32] <wobniaR> Only cause Celestia told her to
[05:55:35] <Angel_Bunny> although Twilight is pretty relatable too lol
[05:55:36] <Muffin_Spectacles> Makes one wonder...what if uniting the Elements, was like The Matrix and its different iterations?
[05:55:37] <Angel_Bunny> cuz she's a neeeeerd
[05:55:41] <Angel_Bunny> yes
[05:55:59] <Angel_Bunny> there is no pony head bust (rip 2010-2014)
[05:56:07] <wobniaR> Rest in RIP in pieces
[05:56:12] <Muffin_Spectacles> What if, there were 5 others that Sunset could have united with, and harnessed the Elements and such?...
[05:56:15] <wobniaR> sadairhorn.mp3
[05:56:28] <Angel_Bunny> Muffin_Spectacles I'd say read fanfics
[05:56:43] <Muffin_Spectacles> Angel_Bunny: Aye, there's the rub...I don't.
[05:56:44] <wobniaR> She united with the mane 6 at the end of EQG 2
[05:56:47] <Angel_Bunny> I know
[05:56:50] <Angel_Bunny> That's why I said I'd say
[05:56:56] <Angel_Bunny> So you instead wanna make up AU concepts
[05:56:58] <Angel_Bunny> and not read them lol
[05:57:08] <Muffin_Spectacles> wobniaR: Well, within the human world...though I do feel alittle sad for Sunset.
[05:57:17] <wobniaR> She got a happy ending
[05:57:23] <wobniaR> For now
[05:57:28] <Muffin_Spectacles> A girl from another world who had all sorts of powers...and she's reduced to being a normal teenager?
[05:57:45] <Angel_Bunny> but she had friends
[05:57:56] <Muffin_Spectacles> Then again, it isn't that different from rich people that give all their stuff away, and decide to become...normal.
[05:58:21] <Angel_Bunny> except magic > stuff
[05:58:22] <Muffin_Spectacles> Angel_Bunny: Yeah...though they did belittle her to her face...um, no offense.

[17:16:55] <Finnfinn> Alright, fillies and gentlecolts, since I got permission I'm going to start a Pony Fortress Narration. Some of you might remember how these work, but I'll repeat it for everypony: Dwarf Fortress is a complex game about leading a band of dwarves who are trying to establish a new outpost for their civilization.
[17:17:17] <Finnfinn> Due to DF's complexity and randomness, games can be very intense, but also extremely silly, making it ideal for what can be described as semi-improvised fanfiction. Here's how it works: If you want to participate, you will be assigned a random pony at the start of the game.
[17:17:51] <Finnfinn> In the beginning, there's seven brave ponies venturing out, but immigrants, assaults, fires etc. will cause that number to vary wildly. I will describe the ponies as they join us, give them your nickname and then narrate what happens in the fortress.
[17:18:24] <Finnfinn> It will be silly, random and you will probably just die within the first year due to anthromorphic tained alicorn sieges or something. So, please sign up as I generate the world and set up our fortress!
[17:22:13] * Changeling_Derpy pokes Finnfinn for Pone
[17:22:51] <Finnfinn> Changeling_Derpy: You will be assigned on of the seven starting ponies. I have no control over what pony you get, so forgive me if you run around as a fat unicorn.
[17:23:11] <Changeling_Derpy> I hope for you I dont :P
[17:23:46] <Finnfinn> World generation is in progress.

[21:36:24] <Mike_Coltfield> Requiem for a Dream was a trippy movie with a good sountrack.
[21:36:58] <Mike_Coltfield> But I still prefer the songs made for the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers ads more, which were a series of movements called "Requiem for a Tower."
[21:37:01] <RandomNinja> don't do heroin, kids
[21:37:13] <big_e> It sounds like this song was influenced a bit by the song. Lol
[21:37:51] <Mike_Coltfield> The one that everyone seems to call "Requiem for a Dream" is "Requiem for a Tower, Movement 4"
[21:38:11] <Mike_Coltfield> Which is one of Corner Stone Cues' more famous tracks
