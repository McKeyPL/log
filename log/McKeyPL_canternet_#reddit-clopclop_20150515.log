[00:19:14] <cloppyhooves> That was pretty good c:
[00:19:46] <cloppyhooves> The only thing I'd add is "If you're really bothered by them not wanting tea after you've already made it, just drink the tea yourself"
[00:22:55] <RubyPinch> wow lewd
[00:24:27] <cloppyhooves> But it's actually a good point D:
[00:25:39] <RubyPinch> i get the reasonin, but like, drinking my tea at that point would be pretty hard considering how much of a downer that wld be at that point
[00:26:47] <cloppyhooves> (I meant, like, if you're horny even after they revoke consent, just go masturbate)
[00:27:25] <Vulpixbrew> Ihave neever met a canine that doesnt like butt scratchens
[00:27:28] <RubyPinch> I know, but vodka > cloppin at that point
[00:28:25] <cloppyhooves> Why would it be a downer, out of curiosity? :o
[00:29:43] <RubyPinch> well the context depends of course, if it was a hookup, then it'd be like, dang. if it was a known person then it'd probs be different
[00:32:48] <cloppyhooves> Well I mean, if they revoke consent it wouldn't necessarily be anything bad done on your part :o
[00:32:59] <RubyPinch> I know
[00:32:59] <cloppyhooves> Like if someone consents and then gets a bad tummyache
[00:37:29] <cloppyhooves> Okay I'm done with ponyclicker
[00:37:38] <cloppyhooves> At this point it's just waiting and it's gonna be a long wait no matter what I try to go for

[06:06:25] <Algido> I have heard it is incredibly hacked and stuff tho and people buy tons of stuff with cash that goes against the rules or something? And main bots. I have seen some crazy stuff, I dunno what to believe is real talent or cheating D:

[06:07:44] <weisey> nah most of the pros are legit
[06:07:59] <weisey> KQLY, SF, and a few others werent, but they got Vac'd
[06:08:55] <weisey> ScreaM is just fucking insane-o
[06:09:03] <Algido> oh, damn, pros. didnt think of that. guess you cound't get away with cheating in front of a crowd.
[06:10:45] <weisey> They did though
[06:11:23] <Algido> lmao just googled cs go and vac'd and see a link saying I guy got vac'd after buying a $10,000 knife. wtf, do people really drop that kinda cash on a game with a 20+ year old engine?
[06:11:25] <Algido> my god
[06:11:26] <weisey> ScreaM was super pissed about that one because KQLY took his spot on TiTAN
[06:11:40] <RubyPinch> did he scream?
[06:11:40] <weisey> "20 year old engine"
[06:11:51] <weisey> I do not thing Source means
[06:11:57] <weisey> what you think it means
[06:12:45] <RubyPinch> it is a pretty old engine, don't think it has had any major redoing, just major updates
[06:13:05] <weisey> Source != GoldSrc
[06:13:26] <RubyPinch> it was forked from that, no?
[06:13:40] <weisey> Noooooope.
[06:13:49] <RubyPinch> "At that point we forked off the code in VSS to be both /$Goldsrc and /$Src"
[06:14:29] <weisey> Yeah
[06:14:32] <weisey> they both share code
[06:14:47] <weisey> hell they both still share code with the original Quake engine
[06:14:57] <weisey> but source was built esentially from the ground up
[06:15:03] <weisey> then rebuilt for '06
[06:15:07] <weisey> and '07
[06:15:17] <Algido> I thought it all originated from the quake engine. Updates or not, that doesn't sound very impressive. But I am a techno retard so my opinions and assertions should probably be ignored lmao
[06:15:35] <weisey> then GO
[06:15:46] <RubyPinch> actually I don't think there is any quake engine code left in there, last time an employee commented on it
[06:16:03] <weisey> must have been a recent change then
[06:16:10] <weisey> cause a couple years ago, there still was
[06:18:34] <weisey> and just because its based on an engine from 1996
[06:18:41] <weisey> doesnt mean it stuck there statically
