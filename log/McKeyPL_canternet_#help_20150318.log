[17:00:34] <Toothie|Skoolz> How do you track down a hostmask? Like, someone tried logging in using one of my nicks, and Nickserv gave me the hostmask. I want to just be able to see who it was xP
[17:01:55] <Unixkitty> Through your personal logs?
[17:02:45] <Toothie|Skoolz> 9:51:24 AM <NickServ> ((hostmask)) failed to login to Toothpaste.  There has been 1 failed login attempt since your last successful login.
[17:03:42] <Unixkitty> Could have been someone simply trying your nickname and being told they needed a password
[17:04:18] <Colgate> ^most likely
[17:04:20] <Toothie|Skoolz> Yeah, but I still wanna say hi or something xP
[17:04:33] <Toothie|Skoolz> Because I'm a silly little friendship blob
[17:04:38] <Colgate> /who hostmask
[17:04:46] <Colgate> if they don't show up, they don't share a channel with you

[17:54:22] <Colgate> probably someone who doesn't understand how nickserv works :P
[17:54:23] <Toothie|Skoolz> Yep, same hostmask
[17:54:36] <Toothie|Skoolz> That's what I was thinking
