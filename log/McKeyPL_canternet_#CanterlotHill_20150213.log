[02:36:50] <StrykerVylon> Fun Fact - Eywind cannot spell today.
[02:37:09] <Eywind> Fun fact: Making a typo does not mean I cannot spell.
[02:37:17] <wobniaR> Fun fact: Nerds
[02:37:21] <Eywind> are yummy
[02:37:40] <wobniaR> I like the purple ones the best
[02:37:42] <MikeM> I knew a guy who would snort them and then spit them out.
[02:37:43] <Eywind> agreed
[02:37:45] <Eywind> wat
[02:37:47] <Eywind> that's gross
[02:37:54] <MikeM> But fun
[02:38:01] <wobniaR> Possibly painful
[02:38:34] <Eywind> Gross, but fun!
[02:38:55] <MikeM> Painful, but fun!
[02:39:01] <Hamtramck> idk why I get a bigger tax return than my parents. Oh welp.
[02:39:13] <Eywind> Hamtramck lower income bracket, company withholds more %
[02:39:33] <Hamtramck> Probably the latter. I think I'm in the same income bracket as they are.
[02:39:42] <Hamtramck> Can you pick your withholding %?
[02:40:07] <MikeM> Mostly
[02:40:16] <Hamtramck> If so I'm thinking I might have set it as high as possible before company website became inavigable labyrinth and made it impossible to check that.

[02:41:37] <Eywind> and Hamtramck do you really make as much as they do?  That's kinda scary
[02:41:52] <Eywind> (especially with two incomes on the taxes you have a lower deduction than them)
[02:42:09] <Hamtramck> Oh, er, I meant as much as them as individuals :B

[16:55:35] <techniponi> that's the thing - there is a ton of responsibility of living in my own property (*obviously*) and I want to prepare for it, and right now is probably the best time to start

[17:49:51] <Unixkitty> keekle, one day I am going to fall for a guy who will talk like that to me. I tell you.
[17:49:55] <keekle> except, its still sitting on the shelf
[17:50:20] <RandomNinja> have you tried forcing trial versions onto your relatives?
[17:50:38] <keekle> Unixkitty: thanks, i think? :)
[17:51:02] <Trildar> Forcing family and friends to beta test is always a good idea.

[23:41:33] <Zuthal> 23:40:32 EveningBreeze[NLR]: The radio works in my firefox, Inucroft[NLR]
[23:41:34] <Eywind> oops
[23:41:39] <LocDogX86X> pop up still doesnt wanna work, but i still got stream chat
[23:41:39] <Eywind> that was supposed to go in my browser :P
[23:41:46] * NightmareMoon eats them all!~
[23:41:53] <LocDogX86X> pop up chat*
[23:41:54] * Trixie_Lulamoon calls out Twilight Sparkle for being to cute
[23:41:55] <Trixie_Lulamoon> :p
[23:41:58] <Inucroft[NLR]> poor dear, but she had it comming
[23:42:04] <Trixie_Lulamoon> !song
[23:42:05] <DinkyBot> LIVE BROADCAST! 12Tarby - What You Hoped To Find - There are 0960 listeners!
[23:42:05] <DinkyBot> Tune in to http://www.canterlothill.com/ to listen!
[23:42:11] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> Mhmm, I'm listening to it on the popup
[23:42:17] <Unixkitty> Works in Chrome here finely, but direct http stream ftw
[23:42:40] <Zuthal> But why?
[23:42:48] <Zuthal> Listening to it in media player is much better
[23:43:00] <Apple-Bloom[CMC]> MPC-HC best media player.
[23:43:11] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Tixie likes the popup
[23:43:13] <Trixie_Lulamoon> ahh
[23:43:23] *** Quits: Scamper_Fr (Scamper_Fr@Pony-bpmj8i.rev.sfr.net) (Connection closed)
[23:43:30] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> Why, Zuthal?
[23:43:46] <Zuthal> let's see, for me: I can control it via buttons on my keyboard
[23:43:50] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Tarby is Pendulum. The whole band :3
[23:43:55] <Zuthal> and I am pretty sure it uses fewer system resources
[23:44:00] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> Why would I control it from my keyboard?
[23:44:00] <Inucroft[NLR]> i likes ze popup asvell
[23:44:17] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Deep bass
[23:44:19] <Zuthal> also, adjusting the volume of just the stream and not the other stuff is much easier with my setup if I am listening in iTunes
[23:44:35] <Apple-Bloom[CMC]> Ew, iTunes.
[23:44:36] <Moon_Solace> I can hear the bass outside of my headphones XD
[23:44:43] <Trixie_Lulamoon> What Apple-Bloom[CMC] said :p
[23:44:44] <Zuthal> iTunes works
[23:44:53] <Zuthal> and it does what I need it to do, and it is reliable.
[23:44:53] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Barely :3
[23:45:03] <Eywind> I use musicbee lol
[23:45:13] <Zuthal> that is the two things I want out of software. Doing what I need it to do, and being reliable.
[23:45:15] <Cloud_Zephyr> i has mastered the art of girlfriend acquisition. making bad pickup line videos on youtube :P
[23:45:16] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Tis okay. We still love you, Zuthal <3
[23:45:17] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> I can adjust the volume of the stream fine
[23:45:31] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> Just click on the popup and move the slider down :p
[23:45:38] <Cloud_Zephyr> i agree with Zuthal 
[23:45:45] <Zuthal> EveningBreeze[NLR]: Yeah, but I can just mouseover the volume bar in the iTunes window (which is in the background) and scroll to change volume
[23:45:48] <Zuthal> no clicks required
[23:45:54] <Zuthal> not even switching window focus
[23:46:04] <Zuthal> Beat that.
[23:46:13] <One-Trick> i just touch my volume key on my keyboard
[23:46:15] <Trixie_Lulamoon> 8-bit
[23:46:19] <Cloud_Zephyr> os x master operating system
[23:46:20] * Apple-Bloom[CMC] doesn't even need to scroll on her player.
[23:46:21] *** Zuthal is now known as Star_Striker[NLR]
[23:46:24] * Apple-Bloom[CMC] pity to the max.
[23:46:27] <Star_Striker[NLR]> Yus Cloud_Zephyr.
[23:46:30] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> To be fair, I tend not to need to change volume anyway
[23:46:46] <Star_Striker[NLR]> Well, it is useful to adjust everything to be at a sensible relative volume.
[23:46:47] <Cloud_Zephyr> however apple hardware inferior hardware
[23:46:58] <Star_Striker[NLR]> But apple hardware pretty hardware
[23:47:01] <Trixie_Lulamoon> lol. Dimwited
[23:47:02] <Cloud_Zephyr> yup
[23:47:04] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> The only reason I need to is if I'm in a skype call, and that automatically dips everything else
[23:47:16] <NightmareMoon> Requests are open for the Lunar Republic Takeover! To request, ping my name with the Artist - Song name (Remix name if applicable)
[23:47:17] <Star_Striker[NLR]> yeah... but that sometimes dips it the wrong way

[23:48:09] <Lycan> NightmareMoon: foozogz - smile
[23:48:11] <Trixie_Lulamoon> NightmareMoon: We need to get on League again one day
[23:48:11] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> Dips it the wrong way?
[23:48:12] <Cloud_Zephyr> Apple-Bloom[CMC] madness
[23:48:16] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> How does it manage that?
[23:48:17] <Trixie_Lulamoon> "Smash and grab"
[23:48:23] <Star_Striker[NLR]> Like, to the wrong volume
[23:48:37] <Trixie_Lulamoon> Bass in this is Trixie's fav
[23:48:37] <Cloud_Zephyr> appul is known for its sexiness over practicality
[23:48:38] <EveningBreeze[NLR]> You mean it makes it louder?
[23:49:02] <Star_Striker[NLR]> ehhh, bad wording
[23:49:09] <Star_Striker[NLR]> I mean, like, either too quiet or not quiet enough
[23:49:47] <Apple-Bloom[CMC]> Ah can make my Windows purdy darn good lookin'.

[23:57:20] <Apple-Bloom[CMC]> So apparently ah keep losin' connection to the radio because my security thingamabob is tryin' to scan all the codecs ah have installed.
[23:57:34] <Eywind> Cloud_Zephyr probably should run malwarebytes or something
