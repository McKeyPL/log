[05:46:25] <RNGsus> uh
[05:46:29] <RNGsus> Damn thats a good question
[05:46:46] <RNGsus> Jeez i dont remember beginning clopping
[05:46:47] <Vulpixbrew> for me it was the watching
[05:46:48] <samonuh> I honestly didn't clop until maybe a year into being a part of the fandom
[05:46:56] <RNGsus> I think the show came first
[05:46:56] <Vulpixbrew> aftewr seeing the clop on e621
[05:47:31] <RNGsus> I dunno how i first saw clop, i probably looked fer it
[05:47:39] <samonuh> I just figured since I was so invested in the show it'd only make sense to incorporate it into my sexual life. 
[05:47:44] * plushie_pegasus clopped to G1 before it was called clopping :-p
[05:47:53] <RNGsus> o..
[05:48:04] <samonuh> Now I don't really love the show as much as I did in the beginning
[05:48:11] <RNGsus> There was a period when I didnt clop because i felt it was wrong

[05:48:49] <samonuh> There was a time when I stopped masturbating period when I started watching MLP
[05:48:59] <samonuh> Cause I wanted to be innocent in all parts of my life

[06:30:33] <Vionas> heya guys
[06:30:43] <samonuh> Hi Vionas
[06:30:50] <Katniss> Hey Vionas!
[06:31:11] <Vulpixbrew> heya Katniss and Vionas
[06:31:38] <Katniss> Anyways, I'm Katniss, and no, not of the Everdeen kind. I'm just the genderless, vaguely humanoid shape just outside of your vision.
[06:31:55] <samonuh> Wat
[06:32:27] <Vionas> Katniss is a person
[06:32:36] <Vulpixbrew> Im sure there was a doctor who episonde with a bad guy like that
[06:33:07] <Katniss> If you would just expand your perception of reality by just *that* much... you might see me.
[06:33:15] <Katniss> Not with your eyes though.
[06:33:24] <Vionas> with your genitals
[06:33:33] <samonuh> Like...take shrooms?
[06:33:49] <Katniss> Whatever works for you ;)

[06:35:56] <IceFlurries> Vionas: wb :D
[06:36:09] <IceFlurries> Katniss: :D wassup?
[06:36:11] <IceFlurries> been a while
[06:36:12] <plushie_pegasus> samonuh, :I used to take drugs to see halucenations, now i got to take drugs to prevent them"
[06:36:21] <samonuh> Jeez
[06:36:49] <RNGsus> I pride myself in not touching alcohol or drugs
[06:36:58] <Katniss> Not much IceFlurries 
[06:37:10] <samonuh> I don't pride myself, but I don't touch them
[06:37:20] <RNGsus> I feel like a little good boy
[06:37:21] <Katniss> I don't pride myself on that RNGsus, just because it reminds me of how much money I don't have
[06:37:26] <Quinn> I drink because I get lonely,b ut that's about it
[06:37:30] <RNGsus> even though marijuana is not bad whatsoever
[06:37:38] <samonuh> If somebody can convince me why I need to drink alcohol, I'll do it
[06:37:48] <Quinn> you don't need to masturbate either
[06:37:56] <RNGsus> i dunno
[06:38:00] <RNGsus> have you seen /r/nofap?
[06:38:01] <samonuh> Marijuana has negative effects. Just not as bad as other drugs.
[06:38:09] <samonuh> I did /r/nofap once
[06:38:09] <plushie_pegasus> Now i do RNGsus , but i did a lot of drugs when i was a colt
[06:38:17] <RubyPinch> I'll drink cause hellafun
[06:38:19] <samonuh> I got to 46 days
[06:38:22] * Vulpixbrew has enough drugs in his system he doesnt need to add any of the illicit kind
[06:38:30] <Katniss> If you see something, say nothing, and drink to forget
[06:38:47] <plushie_pegasus> Me too Vulpixbrew
[06:38:52] <samonuh> I just don't see why I should have to alter the state of my mind with external substances to enjoy life...
[06:38:55] <RubyPinch> Vulpixbrew: haha, I used to feel the same way, still kinda do
[06:38:55] <samonuh> Seems depressing
[06:39:09] <samonuh> Everyone just drinks on the weekend. Is life that bad?
[06:39:14] <RubyPinch> speaking of, that reminds me, I should take said pills
[06:39:32] <RubyPinch> samonuh: nope, its just another way of having fun on a nice day~
[06:39:36] <Vionas> im bored
[06:39:37] <plushie_pegasus> Anti psycotics and haucenegenics don't mix well
[06:39:47] <samonuh> Not my idea of fun, but okay
[06:40:00] <Katniss> samonuh, have you ever been drunk before?
[06:40:04] <samonuh> I just get pissed when people say I'm immature for not drinking
[06:40:13] <RNGsus> Its not immature
[06:40:17] <samonuh> No, and I don't intend on doing so. I enjoy being in full control.
[06:40:49] <Vulpixbrew> of course my state is finally pushing medical weed through it's senate and I will admit I shall have a card when it happens
[06:40:52] <Katniss> I gotcha. I suppose it's a "You don't truly get it until you try it" thing
[06:41:01] <samonuh> No, I get it
[06:41:04] <Katniss> But it's your choice.
[06:41:26] <plushie_pegasus> good for you samonuh i'm proud of you
[06:41:35] <samonuh> It's not like I've never been around alcohol or people drinking it
[06:41:39] <Katniss> and I won't push it on you
[06:41:50] <samonuh> I'm glad
[06:42:26] <samonuh> My sister's boyfriend claims I can't ever actually enjoy life without drugs
[06:42:30] <samonuh> Like...what?
[06:42:35] <Katniss> Fuck that noise
[06:43:18] <samonuh> I've tried to become less prude about it though
[06:44:03] <Katniss> I suppose the best way I can explain why I've drank with my friends is that alcohol just kinda makes you feel good (but of course, not that you can't feel good without it, because that's totally false), and when you're with good friends, and you all feel good, you just feel better
[06:44:12] <RubyPinch> its not fun by itself, its like a fun enhancer
[06:44:48] <samonuh> I don't know. I have no issues loosening up and doing crazy shit without alcohol
[06:44:58] <samonuh> Guess that's why I feel no reason
[06:45:15] <samonuh> I also enjoy feeling in control. I suppose I'm a control freak
[06:45:17] <Katniss> And again, that's good! If anybody tells you otherwise, tell them that they're stupid.
[06:45:34] <samonuh> It's the same reason I didn't use anesthesia when I got my wisdom teeth removed
[06:45:42] <RNGsus> and that is insane
[06:45:47] <samonuh> I'd rather be conscious and aware of what's happening
[06:45:49] <samonuh> I liked it
[06:45:52] <Vionas> remember
[06:45:53] <RNGsus> id die
[06:45:56] <Vionas> become an alcoholic
[06:46:00] <Vionas> and all your problems
[06:46:03] <Vionas> will go away
[06:46:04] <samonuh> I learned a lot about dental surgery
[06:46:04] <Vionas> then come back
[06:46:07] <Vionas> and fucking destroy you
[06:46:12] <Quinn> samonuh, nobody is making you drink
[06:46:22] <RNGsus> INVEST IN THE RUBLE SELL YOUR DOLLARS FOR EUROS
[06:46:25] <samonuh> lol
[06:46:33] <Katniss> Sounds like fun Vionas, where do I sign up?
[06:46:38] <samonuh> Quinn, pressure exists
[06:46:50] <plushie_pegasus> Horrible advice Vionas, alcohol and drugs only mask the problems
[06:46:54] <samonuh> You have no idea what I faced leading up to my 21st birthday
[06:47:04] <samonuh> My mom yelled at me for not wanting to drink with my sister
[06:47:14] <Quinn> that sounds like an issue with those people
[06:47:17] <Quinn> not an issue with drinking
[06:47:19] <samonuh> Saying it was disrespectful
[06:47:21] <Vulpixbrew> what did I just watch

[06:47:43] <thaostra> Vulpixbrew, What you just watched is one of the reasons why PC gaming is the best
[06:48:12] <samonuh> I just have extreme views. When I say them, I try not to negatively judge others
[06:48:36] <Quinn> out of curiosity, are you muslim?
[06:48:41] <samonuh> lol
[06:48:43] <Vionas> plushie
[06:48:43] <RubyPinch> not drinking is not so much an extreme view in practice, just in opinion
[06:48:45] <RNGsus> Im going to say yes as a start
[06:48:47] <samonuh> Everyone asks me that
[06:48:47] <Vionas> I was being sarcastic
[06:49:01] <samonuh> No, I'm not Muslim
[06:49:02] <plushie_pegasus> ohh ok
[06:49:13] <Quinn> just cause of your name and some of the stuff you've said
[06:49:21] <samonuh> Although I did enjoy the Middle East since I don't drink or eat pork :P
[06:49:42] <Quinn> I wouldn't enjoy the middle east due to the terrible injustices that go on there
[06:49:42] <RNGsus> I like where this is going
[06:49:46] <Quinn> personally
[06:49:46] <samonuh> I'm very sympathetic to Muslims
[06:49:47] * plushie_pegasus loves pork 
[06:49:48] <RubyPinch> its like telling someone you don't like X, and then they are like "X? are you serious? seriously, try X in <some other form>"
[06:50:03] <RNGsus> Yeah we can clearly see that samonuh 
[06:50:15] <RubyPinch> RNGsus: no need to get bitey
[06:50:23] <plushie_pegasus> MMM pork chops, ham, sausage, bacon
[06:50:24] <samonuh> Injustices happen everywhere Quinn, but I don't want to go into political discussion
[06:51:02] <Quinn> as someone who used to be muslim Im very aware
[06:51:10] <Katniss> Yes please, no politics here. I even think that's one of the rules.
[06:51:16] <samonuh> What's your ethnic background?
[06:51:19] <samonuh> Just curious
[06:51:28] <Quinn> I'm white, my """dad""" was indian
[06:51:33] <samonuh> Ah, alrighty
[06:51:33] <Quinn> but he turned out to not actually be my dad
[06:52:15] <Quinn> grew up in a super religious household
[06:52:27] <Quinn> didn't even really know how sex worked until after highschool 
[06:52:48] <samonuh> If I were forced to change my religion for some reason, Islam would probably be my next choice admittedly. 
[06:53:19] <Quinn> I'd urge you to reconsider or do more research in that scenario, it's really not what it looks like
[06:53:33] <samonuh> I study Islam :P
[06:53:44] <RNGsus> Sorry RubyPinch its just what he said to omicron was sort of rude
[06:53:48] <Quinn> okay well reading about it and living it are completely different
[06:53:57] <RNGsus> my bad, ill just stay out of this
[06:54:19] * Vulpixbrew bites his tongue and cteps away to a game
[06:54:22] <samonuh> I think we all have different experiences with things. Otherwise every Muslim would leave the religion, no?
[06:54:29] <samonuh> Clearly many people enjoy the faith
[06:54:36] <RNGsus> Please stop
[06:54:49] <RNGsus> This isnt going anywhere good
[06:54:53] <RNGsus> lets stop this right now
[06:54:53] <Quinn> it's up to you if you want to waste your own life like I was forced to ruin mine
[06:54:59] <Quinn> go ahead, I'm done with this
[06:55:00] <Vionas> Holy shit stiop
[06:55:01] <Vionas> stop
[06:55:03] <samonuh> Ilol
[06:55:08] <samonuh> I'm trying to be respectful
[06:55:09] <Katniss> Take this to PMs, please
[06:55:20] <thaostra> Please stop with the religion, or keep it to PMs
[06:55:25] <Quinn> not worth my time
[06:55:32] <samonuh> Is that another rule?
[06:55:41] <RubyPinch> p sure, yeah
[06:55:41] <Nikashi> "Listen to the ops" is a rule
[06:55:44] <Nikashi> so yes
[06:55:48] <samonuh> Cool
[06:56:06] <thaostra> "Please refrain from discussing inflammatory or illegal topics (Politics, religion, drugs, etc.)"
[06:56:14] <samonuh> But now there's this uncomfortable tension
[06:56:24] <Quinn> I don't see any
[06:56:24] <samonuh> So I may just drop out for a bit
[06:56:26] <RubyPinch> its not a matter of 1 person being respectful, its more a matter of 32 people
[06:56:28] <samonuh> Don't feel welcomed
[06:56:38] * RubyPinch pat pats samonuh 
[06:56:52] <Quinn> well you bring in a bunch of charged conversations and then get offended when it snowballs, idunno
[06:57:08] <thaostra> Anyone excited about S5? It's less than a month away now
[06:57:23] <RNGsus> Nope thaostra 
[06:57:26] <RubyPinch> I'm not excited, wahaha
[06:57:26] <RNGsus> Dont watch the show
[06:57:37] <Quinn> I've stopped watching MLP
[06:57:46] <plushie_pegasus> What's the start date thaostra?
[06:57:48] <Nikashi> We all have lol
[06:58:00] <thaostra> April 4
[06:58:08] <Quinn> I mean like I haven't even seen s4, it just lost its charm I guess :/
[06:58:09] <plushie_pegasus> yay
[06:58:11] <FineLine> [](/ajyay "yay")
[06:58:21] <Quinn> and a ton of other shit was happening at that point and I didn't have time for it
[06:58:25] <Nikashi> Quinn: You missed a lot of good episodes, imo.
[06:58:37] <Nikashi> S4 was by far the strongest
[06:58:51] <Quinn> I guess, I just lost interest
[06:58:55] <plushie_pegasus> about time, i was in major pony withdrawl
[06:59:05] <Quinn> I tried to watch it a few times and just couldn't get back into it
[06:59:26] <RubyPinch> I should have tidus laugh as my ring tone
[06:59:59] <thaostra> It's been almost a year since S4 ended
[07:00:14] <Katiepony> Too long :c
[07:00:26] <thaostra> The hiatus was made worse by the comics getting worse

[07:01:09] <thaostra> The comics were supposed to be a distraction, but they just aren't as good as the earlier issues
[07:01:46] <Katiepony> I haven't kept up to date with them in a while... I think the local comic shop has a giant pile of them set aside for me that I can't afford >.>
[07:02:15] <thaostra> You can get them on Yayponies
[07:03:11] <Katiepony> I'll probably get around to reading them online. I'd like to keep collecting them too, though :3

[07:04:37] <thaostra> Yeah, nothing like having the actual comic in your hands
[07:05:31] <Katiepony> I've enjoyed the comics even more than the show, so far.
[07:05:36] <Katiepony> Though, they can be very hit and miss.
[07:06:38] <thaostra> I've felt they've been more of a miss lately
[07:07:38] <Katiepony> I don't think I've read many since the story arc with the alternate celestia/luna/sombra thing.
[07:09:00] <Vulpixbrew> for me it'shonestly was the fandom, the sheer speed and the amout of impressive things this fandom used t do

[07:17:55] <Vulpixbrew> omg theres an adult space camp.........
[07:19:18] <thaostra> I did a Star Wars marathon in Machete order over the past day, and I can conclude that Machete is the best way to watch the saga
[07:19:29] <Katniss> Machete order?
[07:19:36] <Quinn> never done it machete
[07:19:39] <Quinn> probably should
[07:19:53] <Quinn> I bought them all on blu-ray but haven't even opened the package
[07:22:45] <thaostra> Katiepony, In Machete order you watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, and Return of the Jedi. This preserves the Vadar twist and introduces the Palpatine twist, and keeps Return as the grand finale that wraps up all of the plotlines at once
[07:22:54] <Katiepony> I didn't ask o:
[07:23:07] <thaostra> Katniss *

[07:25:08] <thaostra> Katniss, http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/
[07:25:09] <FineLine> [ Absolutely No Machete Juggling Â» The Star Wars Saga: Introducing ... ]
[07:25:31] <thaostra> It's really mindblowing just how much throught was put into making Machete order viable
[07:26:07] <Quinn> thaostra: like what?
[07:27:36] <thaostra> Read the article, they make a really compelling case
[07:30:35] <thaostra> Just watching them in episode order doesn't make any sense because it spoils one of the most shocking reveals in cinema history, and release order doesn't go much justice because we already know what happens after Revenge
[07:32:04] <Katiepony> It's just a shame that even people who haven't watched Star Wars already know about the Vader twist.
[07:32:10] * Vulpixbrew votes new hope, empire, jedi then the prequels
[07:32:11] <thaostra> So after Empire Strikes Back, treat Attack and Revenge as flashbacks showing how Vadar came to be and how Luke can also fall down the path to the dark side
[07:32:58] <Quinn> I should really do that
[07:34:10] * Vulpixbrew might just do that out of boredom
[07:34:45] <thaostra> Quinn, It's a really cool way to watch with fellow Star Wars fans, but I think it's an even better way to show new people the saga
[07:35:04] <Quinn> sadly I don't know anyone who would want to watch it again or hasn't seen it 
[07:35:07] <Quinn> so I'll do it solo
[07:36:31] <thaostra> I marathoned it with my brother earlier, and I must say it was really effective. When Vadar revealed he was Luke's father, he was so confused and uncertain that it was true, and was unsure up until the end of Revenge
[07:37:18] * Vulpixbrew would watch it again with Quinn
[07:37:33] <Quinn> that's how I remember watching it
[07:38:04] <Quinn> I was like 9 when episode 1 came out
[07:38:08] <Quinn> 8-9
[07:38:34] <Quinn> but I saw episode IV, V, and VI before I ever saw a prequel so the awe was still there for me
[07:39:37] <thaostra> I was around the same age when Phantom came out. I remember it being fun because it had pod racing and Maul, but looking back at it now I think it's better off being a prequel to the main saga

[16:26:48] <RNGsus> i got a question
[16:27:53] <samonuh> Yes?
[16:28:12] <RNGsus> sent it pm
[16:35:52] <RubyPinch> man, I wish upvotes correlated to quality
[16:36:06] <samonuh> lol
[16:36:14] <samonuh> Nothing on reddit is good
[16:36:14] <RNGsus> see /r/funny
[16:36:17] <RNGsus> see /r/pics
[16:36:21] <RubyPinch> wasn't reddit
[16:36:28] <RNGsus> see literally everything in /r/askreddit
[16:36:46] <RubyPinch> it was e621, goofballs
[16:38:12] <RNGsus> O
[16:38:16] <RNGsus> Same for reddit
[16:38:22] <RubyPinch> -_-
[16:38:34] <RNGsus> what
[16:39:15] <Frosty> I kind of miss playing WoW at times.
[16:39:27] <RubyPinch> complaining about quality on reddit defaults is very preaching-to-the-choir-ish
[16:39:45] <samonuh> Reddit nique sa mÃ¨re
[16:39:54] <weisey> Wellp
[16:40:05] <weisey> GG Fnatic on 2 majors
[16:40:12] <RubyPinch> I miss playing WoW 1-60, after that RAF ran out and I had to put in effort ;-;
[16:40:50] <Frosty> RAF?
[16:41:07] <RubyPinch> refer-a-friend, double XP bonus
[16:41:12] <Frosty> Ah.
[16:42:03] <Frosty> My problem is I got bored playing alone, but couldn't get a friend to play at the same time as me.
[16:42:28] <RubyPinch> just do what my friends do, get really good at guilting people ;-;
[16:43:01] <Frosty> It's equally as bad to play with someone that doesn't want to play.
[16:44:37] <RubyPinch> if only my friend understood that @_@
[16:47:20] <Frosty> Some people don't care.
[16:47:29] <Frosty> As long as they've got some to play with.
[16:47:55] <RubyPinch> he has people to play with, but he wants to play with me specifically
[16:48:29] <RubyPinch> which I can't exactly fault him for, we have both been playing the same game for over a year off and on, and met a total of once
[16:56:45] <thaostra> <RubyPinch> have ya got res set up to load video form? <- It loads gifv by default
[16:57:19] <thaostra> If viewing the gifv directly it looks fine, but viewing it in inline view looks broken

[17:14:55] <samonuh> I want to play Cities: Skylines but I still fear me downloading it and it not working well
[17:15:03] <RNGsus> did you buy it?
[17:15:06] <samonuh> Nah
[17:15:10] <samonuh> It's annoying though
[17:15:16] <samonuh> I used to game a lot
[17:15:20] <samonuh> Now I never do
[17:15:25] <samonuh> Not sure what happened

[17:15:29] <FineLine> [ Twitch ]
[17:15:34] <RNGsus> thats what im using as background noise
[17:15:48] <samonuh> I just get anxiety about buying games and the technology involved as far as my computer
[17:17:00] <samonuh> Like...how come my computers back in 2003 could run any game well? But suddenly it seems like games nowadays are limited to people who spend $5,000 on a computer
[17:17:26] <RNGsus> games are now out pacing comps
[17:17:31] <RNGsus> before comps out paced games?
[17:17:42] <samonuh> Seriously. It's so annoying.
[17:17:50] <RubyPinch> rosetinting + reliance on computer specs being high
[17:18:07] <samonuh> I don't have the money, time, or ability to own a decent gaming computer

[17:18:28] <RNGsus> Game devs dont want to waste the time optimizing when they can just say 'Get a better computer lol'
[17:18:34] <RubyPinch> luckily, indies help a bunch
[17:18:50] <RNGsus> Does it really though?
[17:18:50] <samonuh> I forgot that comic existed
[17:19:02] <RNGsus> One of the most optimized games right now that i know of is war thunder
[17:19:12] <RNGsus> and most indie games in unity run like complete shit
[17:19:20] <RNGsus> and the ones that dont have sub par graphics
[17:19:36] <RubyPinch> indies help by dramatically increasing selection size*
[17:20:02] <RNGsus> oh
[17:20:05] <RNGsus> hue hue hue
[17:20:14] <samonuh> How much does a decent computer that can run most games cost?
[17:20:22] <RNGsus> 1k
[17:20:27] <RNGsus> for good performence
[17:20:30] <RubyPinch> 1k is more, "all" games
[17:20:31] <RNGsus> *performance 
[17:20:41] <RNGsus> Yeah
[17:20:43] <RNGsus> most games?
[17:20:49] <RubyPinch> 700-800 for most?
[17:20:53] <RNGsus> Weeeeelll
[17:20:58] <RNGsus> it depends for the games
[17:21:00] <samonuh> >tfw no money
[17:21:11] <RubyPinch> <300 for a 3yearlate selection
[17:21:28] <RNGsus> id say dont waste money for anything below 1k
[17:21:33] <RNGsus> but you dont need much over 1k
[17:21:47] <RNGsus> if you are going to spend 800k why not just get a better graphics card and actually run games well
[17:21:57] <samonuh> I own a laptop
[17:22:15] <RNGsus> What I did is get a 750 pc then get an aftermarket graphics card for about 150, works out really well
[17:22:15] <RubyPinch> lurk auctions for office computers, some companies upgrade fairly early after a prior upgrade
[17:22:41] <RubyPinch> I've got my eye on some i7/radion/SSD setups at the moment >_>
[17:23:07] <RNGsus> I got a setup with an i 7, with a shitty card and a 1.5 tb hdd
[17:23:19] <RNGsus> works out pretty well, needs a new graphics card though
[17:23:29] <RNGsus> really want a radeom r9 290 or whatever its called
[17:23:33] <RNGsus> maybe for the summer
[17:24:05] <samonuh> Computers confuse me
[17:24:11] <RubyPinch> samonuh: there is also r/buildapc which can help a bunch
[17:24:26] <samonuh> My runs Skyrim on high quality perfectly fine, but GTAIV runs with 10FPS
[17:24:32] <RubyPinch> oh
[17:24:36] <RubyPinch> that is just gta4
[17:24:40] <Melon_Guy> also r/buildapcforme

[17:24:54] <samonuh> So...my computer doesn't suck as badly as I think?
[17:24:56] <RubyPinch> RockstarGames can't port games for shit
[17:25:07] <samonuh> I've been afraid to buy games since I bought GTAIV last year
[17:25:08] <samonuh> lol
[17:25:33] <RNGsus> download shit thunder if you want to test your rig
[17:25:43] <RNGsus> its free
[17:25:43] <samonuh> Shit thunder?
[17:25:46] <RNGsus> war thunder
[17:25:52] <samonuh> Why?
[17:25:58] <RNGsus> why what
[17:26:26] <RNGsus> its a free game so if you can run it well at certain settings you can get an idea of your rig and what it can and cant do
[17:26:55] <RubyPinch> there is also the Talos Principle demo which has a benchmarking tool built in
[17:27:14] <RubyPinch> downside is, its really well optimised
[17:27:32] <RNGsus> shit thunder is really well optimised but it can go really high graphics so it still wroks
[17:27:33] <RNGsus> *works
[17:28:23] <samonuh> Oh god, anybody ever get afraid of checking their bank account?
[17:28:34] <RubyPinch> always
[17:28:45] <samonuh> I don't want to sign in
[17:29:02] <RubyPinch> I swear people steal money from me, but I keep finding out it was myself
[17:29:53] <samonuh> I am not a frugal man
[17:31:16] <samonuh> Fairly confident I won't be buying GTAV though
[17:33:24] <RubyPinch> I won't be, until reviews come in specifically about performance
[17:34:11] <samonuh> I'll buy it when it costs $1
[17:34:31] <samonuh> Fuck it though, I'ma buy Cities: Skylines now 
[17:34:33] <RNGsus> never
[17:34:38] <RNGsus> GL
[17:34:44] <RNGsus> if it works it will be fun

[17:43:07] <RNGsus> hiiiiiii fox
[17:43:19] <samonuh> I got too involved in school work and other things
[17:45:26] <Melon_Guy> hiya Vulpixbrew
[17:47:28] <samonuh> Are the designs of the building in Cities: Skylines randomized?
[17:47:35] <RNGsus> Yis
[17:47:47] <samonuh> I have no control over them?
[17:48:01] <RNGsus> not by default nope
[17:48:17] <samonuh> Dang
[17:48:30] <RNGsus> you are the mayor, not the emporer
[17:48:49] <RNGsus> if you are getting the game to design houses you are greatly mistaken :p
[17:48:54] <samonuh> I'll just make everything illegal and taxes 100%
[17:49:05] <RNGsus> taxes only go to 40% i believe
[17:49:14] <RNGsus> and you cant change things to be illegal or not
[17:49:20] <RNGsus> only recreational drugs
[17:49:36] <samonuh> So...what's the point of this game
[17:49:36] <samonuh> ?
[17:49:46] <RNGsus> its a city builder
[17:49:48] <RNGsus> you build cities
[17:49:50] <samonuh> I know
[17:49:54] <samonuh> But I can't build the buildings?
[17:49:55] <RNGsus> the point is to make cool cities
[17:49:59] <RNGsus> nope!
[17:50:08] <RNGsus> you can say where people are allowed to move in
[17:50:08] <samonuh> So then I'm essentially a road builder
[17:50:13] <RNGsus> YES :D
[17:50:21] <RNGsus> 75% of the game is making traffic not shit
[17:50:39] <samonuh> I feel like you're downplaying this or hiding something. The game is moddable, so I must have some say in the buildings
[17:50:48] <RNGsus> you make roads, then zone along them where people are allow to build houses, commercial, industry, or offices
[17:50:54] <RNGsus> no you dont have any say
[17:51:03] <RNGsus> you can change the textures but you cant be like 'build this here'
[17:51:11] <RNGsus> have you played a city builder?
[17:51:20] <samonuh> Then why is there a deluxe version that has specific buildings involved?
[17:51:23] <RNGsus> its not literally building a city, its laying the infrastructure and seeing how it grows
[17:51:24] <samonuh> Like Grand Central
[17:51:27] <samonuh> (I didnt buy it)
[17:51:45] <samonuh> Do a million Grand Centrals just pop up at random?
[17:51:56] <RNGsus> you set up roads and zone along them so people build there, provide services like medical fire fighters police stations
[17:52:13] <RNGsus> for a lot of people the end goal is to build a city that doesnt collapse if you let it run overnight
[17:52:24] <samonuh> I do know you can make neighborhoods
[17:52:31] <RNGsus> well not really
[17:52:36] <RNGsus> you can build roads 
[17:52:42] <RNGsus> and zone along them
[17:52:47] <RNGsus> like thats literally the entire game
[17:52:53] <RNGsus> build roads zone along them provide servies
[17:52:53] <samonuh> Have you played it?

[17:53:32] <princesssluttershy> Hello ^-^ .
[17:53:34] <RNGsus> they mean that by setting roads up and zoning them
[17:53:37] <RNGsus> that is literally it
[17:53:43] <samonuh> So they lied
[17:53:46] <RNGsus> no
[17:53:51] <RNGsus> its like...
[17:53:54] <samonuh> Then I'm not wrong
[17:53:56] <RNGsus> building a garden with seeds
[17:54:06] <RNGsus> you cant plant the plants plant by plant
[17:54:11] <RNGsus> but you can sow the seeds however you want
[17:54:51] <RNGsus> you cant design the neighborhoods per se
[17:54:57] <RNGsus> like you cant say "white houses here"
[17:55:12] <RNGsus> but you can build the road network really pretty, and zone in nice places and build parks 
[17:56:04] <RNGsus> you will like it

[17:56:52] <RNGsus> ive unlocked it
[17:56:57] <RNGsus> im not new to this game
[17:57:11] <samonuh> You said it didn't exist
[17:57:18] <RNGsus> 'it'
[17:57:22] <RNGsus> i dont know what you are asking
[17:57:33] <samonuh> If you could make neighborhoods
[17:57:40] <RNGsus> that is really broad
[17:57:41] <RNGsus> what do you mean
[17:57:46] <RNGsus> building houses?
[17:57:48] <samonuh> No
[17:57:52] <RNGsus> Okay what
[17:58:14] <RNGsus> you mean separate parts of cities?
[17:58:20] <samonuh> Yes.
[17:58:27] <RNGsus> oh yes
[17:58:36] <samonuh> Misunderstanding then
[17:58:43] <RNGsus> those are districts, not neighborhoods
[17:59:00] <samonuh> Sorry, in NYC we call them neighborhoods
[17:59:10] <samonuh> and boroughs
[17:59:14] <RNGsus> you call the coal spitting shit factories?>
[17:59:22] <RNGsus> neighborhoods?
[17:59:40] <samonuh> No, but there are sections with unique names and environments
[17:59:57] <RNGsus> boroughs 
[17:59:57] <samonuh> the Upper West Side is different from Bedford-Stuyvesant
[18:00:07] <RNGsus> those are more boroughs
[18:00:10] <samonuh> No
[18:00:15] <samonuh> They're called neighbrohoods here
[18:00:16] <samonuh> lol
[18:00:36] <samonuh> The boroughs are Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island
[18:00:47] <RNGsus> yeah those are more like districts
[18:00:51] <RNGsus> those are what is in game
[18:00:55] <samonuh> Cool
[18:00:55] <RNGsus> not neighborhoods
[18:01:05] <RNGsus> i mean technically you could if you wanted, but there is no real point
[18:01:26] <RubyPinch> weird naming stuff
[18:01:29] <samonuh> Cool, sorry for the misunderstanding. 
[18:01:34] <RNGsus> usually people just zone their shit into commercial, offices, industry and somtimes lower and upper residential
[18:01:47] <RNGsus> and even then usually they just have the same policies throughout them all
[18:02:10] <samonuh> Sounds like a boring approach
[18:02:45] <RNGsus> the districts are used for everything, even random things like garbage dumps, so it would be weird to call them neighborhoods
[18:02:52] <RNGsus> or boroughs really
[18:03:13] <RNGsus> somtimes the districts are so small i wouldnt even call them districts really
[18:03:14] <samonuh> I don't think it really matters what they're called. I just meant sectioning the city.
[18:03:20] <RNGsus> yep
[18:03:30] <RNGsus> you should see the water physics
[18:03:32] <RNGsus> its hilarious
[18:03:38] * RubyPinch ponders
[18:03:46] <RNGsus> out of all the things they could add, they added REALLY intense water physics
[18:03:54] <samonuh> lol
[18:03:54] <RNGsus> like out of all the random things, they made it super realistic
[18:04:07] <RNGsus> add in a sewage drain? it will rase the water level
[18:04:20] <samonuh> I saw in the trailers that cars drive through each other
[18:04:21] <RNGsus> it flows over terrain and makes waves
[18:04:26] <RNGsus> yep
[18:04:40] <samonuh> So...no traffic then? ;)
[18:04:44] <RNGsus> the traffic is shit but its okay because we have lakes filled with feces that power our electric dams
[18:04:49] <RNGsus> also yes, litlerally all traffic
[18:04:56] <RNGsus> the biggest problem you will face is traffic
[18:05:14] <RNGsus> you could say otherwise, but it really comes down to that
[18:05:22] <samonuh> I'll just build a million trains
[18:05:25] <samonuh> Problem solved
[18:05:29] <RNGsus> 0 money
[18:05:31] <RNGsus> not even
[18:05:37] <RNGsus> you would be lucky to have no money
[18:05:45] <samonuh> Cheat codes m8
[18:06:04] <RNGsus> to make all the people use them you would have to enact free transport, and there goes all your money
[18:06:09] <RNGsus> and if you dont people just might not use them
[18:06:17] <RNGsus> shit is cool man
[18:06:30] <samonuh> 40% taxes. Free everything
[18:06:38] <RNGsus> its not really in the city, all the traffic is usually on the off ramp going into the city
[18:06:53] <RNGsus> which is weird
[18:07:04] <samonuh> Commuting
[18:07:09] <RNGsus> you have to find a balance really
[18:07:34] <samonuh> I'm just gonna go Dubai on my city and have one huge central road that must be used by all to get anywhere. 
[18:07:43] <RNGsus> you need enough intersections so that there are enough that they dont get clogged, but not too many that cars stop all the time on a 6 lane road
[18:08:16] <RNGsus> basically the most efficient way right now is a city comprised of entirely 2 lane 1 way roads
[18:08:29] <samonuh> So...New York? ;)
[18:08:41] <RNGsus> i mean every single road
[18:08:46] <RNGsus> 0 two way roads
[18:09:23] <samonuh> What if I covered the entire map in road?
[18:09:27] <samonuh> 0 traffic
[18:09:31] <RubyPinch> I am so confused, there are local government areas, electoral divisions, lands administrative divisions, and the smaller suburbs and localities
[18:09:46] <RNGsus> Welcome to america
[18:09:49] <RNGsus> where you dont matter!
[18:09:56] <RNGsus> literally
[18:10:07] <RubyPinch> that was australia
[18:10:09] <RNGsus> electoral college is a bitch
[18:10:12] <samonuh> OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[18:10:19] <RNGsus> MUM
[18:10:21] <RNGsus> GET THE VCR
[18:10:31] <samonuh> No politics, m8. 
[18:10:43] <RNGsus> i didnt bring it up
[18:10:47] <samonuh> hue
[18:10:50] * RNGsus hoists RubyPinch on a stake
[18:10:57] <RNGsus> burn burn burn
[18:11:17] <RubyPinch> what
[18:11:18] * iamalion just happens to wander in with a torch
[18:11:22] <iamalion> hi guys wahts ghoing on in here!
[18:11:26] <RNGsus> i found it nice that the bulldozer icon turns into a backloader icon when you go to remove pipes
[18:15:03] <samonuh> They should combine the Sims with a city-builder, so you can design the city and personally design each building. Decades upon decades of fun!
[18:15:53] <RNGsus> personally design each building for your 500,000 city
[18:16:01] <samonuh> Yes
[18:16:43] <samonuh> Or, make it like real life and have servers where hundreds of people are contracted the design and build buildings
[18:19:08] <princesssluttershy> Should I get civ 5 enen though I don't like it because civ 3 keeps crashing?
[18:19:29] <RNGsus> uh
[18:19:34] <RNGsus> i dunno have you seen gameplay?
[18:19:50] <princesssluttershy> I've played about 8 hours of civ 5 and didn't like it
[18:19:53] <RNGsus> also it was just on sale for $12
[18:19:59] <RNGsus> well then dont get it
[18:20:53] <samonuh> I've never played Civ games ever
[18:21:12] <princesssluttershy> civ3 is the best one imo
[18:22:35] <RubyPinch> heroes of might and magic 2 is best civ game
[18:27:03] <princesssluttershy> I'll just play Diablo
[18:31:02] <RNGsus> the one thing i will say about cities skylines is that its trash system is completely broken
[18:31:21] <samonuh> Basically it's the worst game ever
[18:31:29] <iamalion> muahaha i just figured out how to schedule the technicians who can do line repair work
[18:31:34] <iamalion> no more transferring to tier for that for me
[18:31:35] <iamalion> woot
[18:32:39] <RNGsus> you need to pick up the citizens trash, so you put down a landfill, but wait, now that one is full so you need another, well you dont want a giant district of pollution right near your city do you? Better put these land fills far away BUT WAIT if they are far away they cant collect trash
[18:33:04] <samonuh> Just put them all the in center
[18:33:07] <samonuh> Trash mountain
[18:33:15] <samonuh> And during winter it can be a ski resort!
[18:33:16] <RNGsus> and now 1 citizen is sick
[18:33:20] <RNGsus> and now 450 are sick
[18:33:23] <RNGsus> everyone died
[18:33:25] <RNGsus> gg
[18:33:43] <RNGsus> even though you built hospitals, its just too late
[18:33:51] <RNGsus> once 5 get sick it just snowballs
[18:33:56] <samonuh> lol
[18:34:01] <RNGsus> and for whatever eason sickness is like, always deadly?
[18:34:06] <samonuh> Just have them executed
[18:34:12] <RNGsus> yeo
[18:34:21] <RNGsus> bulldozing the house is usually the solution
[18:34:29] <RNGsus> get sick? tough shit
[18:35:01] <samonuh> Game is ready to play
[18:35:10] <RNGsus> do you stream?
[18:35:14] <RNGsus> because i love watching new people play games
[18:35:20] <samonuh> Nah, I prefer to shut everything off 
[18:35:21] <samonuh> lol
[18:35:27] <RNGsus> computer off
[18:35:30] <RNGsus> better performance
[18:35:32] <samonuh> Yea
[18:35:40] <samonuh> 0% usage
[18:36:15] <samonuh> Nah, I use Razer Cortex
[18:36:21] <RNGsus> whats that
[18:36:22] <samonuh> Shuts off all non-essentials
[18:36:29] <RNGsus> oh
[18:36:36] <samonuh> Turns them back on when you turn off the game
[18:37:21] <samonuh> Well, I'ma go try this game out
[18:37:24] <samonuh> Any last tips?
[18:37:46] <RNGsus> dont spend a lot of money on something unless you are SURE its going to work at the beginning
[18:37:57] <samonuh> Cool
[18:38:16] <RNGsus> like i put down a new sewer because they needed it, but i forgot to power it, but i didnt have enough money to bring line over to power it
[18:38:23] <samonuh> lol
[18:38:32] <RNGsus> and because they had no sewage their showers had shit spraying everywhere
