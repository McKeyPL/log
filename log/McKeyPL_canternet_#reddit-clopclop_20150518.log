[00:15:01] <Evelina> That zebra thing is crazy. Do you think if you sucked off a zebra that you would get full from swallowing the cum?  For sure. I don’t think you could shallow all of that if you tried, if only for the enormous pressure alone.  #I would love to be under that silver shower though~
[00:15:14] * Evelina snugs Melon_Phone
