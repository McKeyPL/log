[08:00:10] <Pakistan> helo 
[08:00:24] <Pakistan> is there any flag for channel . to stop kicking ops
[08:00:40] *** Q0 is now known as Q0|Away
[08:00:56] <Pakistan> i want to set flag none of admin can kick any other admin
[08:02:35] <Pakistan> ?
[08:04:40] <Hoofy> hi
[08:04:54] <Pakistan> hello Hoofy how are you
[08:05:03] <Hoofy> great ^^
[08:05:34] <Pakistan> hoffy i want to sed mode of chatroom . by which all admins cant kick any admin
[08:06:41] <Pakistan> can any one help
[08:06:42] <Colgate> Pakistan: there is, it is called revoking their op status
[08:06:52] <Colgate> if you can't trust your ops to not kick each other, don't make them op
[08:07:56] <Pakistan> ok thanks Colgate
[08:08:35] <Pakistan> is there any mode i could stop users to stop bg clors
[08:08:47] <Colgate> +S
[08:09:02] <Pakistan>  like they can do this but  cant do this
[08:09:14] <Colgate> no
[08:09:29] <Colgate> also, this channel is +S, so that didn't show up anyways
[08:09:35] <Colgate> but it strips all color codes
[08:10:43] <Pakistan> i just want to stop using bg color . but want to allow text color
[08:10:48] <Fluttershi> on the no kicking eachother, i believe there's a flag you can but on individual people to make such things not work on them?
[08:10:53] <Colgate> Pakistan: can't do that
[08:11:08] <Colgate> you can set +a on everyone, yes
[08:12:06] <Fluttershi> set +a on someone and they can't get kicked, bans don't actually work on them, ect.?
[08:12:25] <Colgate> depends on the ban
[08:14:40] <Pakistan> Can't change mode for other users
[08:14:49] <Colgate> well yes, I t is a channel mode
[08:14:58] <Colgate> /mode #channel +a nick
[08:15:10] <Pakistan> ok thanks
[08:15:23] <Colgate> although you probably want to set it in chanserv via /chanserv flags #channel nick +a
[08:15:53] <Colgate> note that those ops can still kick each other if they want
[08:16:07] <Colgate> by using /chanserv deprotect, and then /kicking them
[08:16:29] <Colgate> there really is no technical way of preventing this unless you demote them to halfops instead
[08:16:47] <Colgate> halfops can't kick other halfops or higher, etc.
[08:17:58] <Pakistan> thanks

[11:28:59] <Fluttershi> looks like i would guess wrong
