[12:40:58] <Electron> show me new pony pictures if there are some
[12:41:06] <Electron> from season 5
[13:00:13] <Electron> is it okay to be 170cm tall and to have 40kg weight for a girl?
[13:02:23] <StarStream> check the BMI 
[13:05:11] <TheFlutterGuy> BMI is useless
[13:05:14] <Electron> IBM
[13:05:21] <TheFlutterGuy> even more so than IQ
[13:05:49] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: i'm pretty sure at 170cm and 40kg, by the BMI index, she would be morbidly obese
[13:06:34] <Electron> er... is it even possible?
[13:06:49] <TheFlutterGuy> possible? yeah, sure.
[13:08:37] <TheFlutterGuy> why shouldn't it be
[13:09:05] <Electron> what it implies?
[13:09:17] <TheFlutterGuy> that BMI is retarded and useless?
[13:09:24] <TheFlutterGuy> that she needs to loose weight?
[13:10:11] <Electron> I even do not know what BMI is ( ._.)
[13:10:30] <TheFlutterGuy> body mass index
[13:11:02] <TheFlutterGuy> calculation based on height and weight, to check how fat someone is
[13:11:06] <Electron> like your height minus 110
[13:11:10] <TheFlutterGuy> but it's about as accurate and valid as phrenology
[13:11:46] <TheFlutterGuy> and 170cm @ 40kg. I'd be afraid of snapping that girl in half if i touched her
[13:11:50] <TheFlutterGuy> ew

[13:17:19] <ArchPegasusMichael> xD
[13:18:42] <TheFlutterGuy> i found it online, so it must be true

[13:56:06] <Electron> vegetarian
[13:56:12] <StarStream> oh 
[13:56:17] <StarStream> i am not vegetarian 
[13:56:21] <StarStream> but i am left handed 
[13:56:37] <Electron> left-handed from birth or trained?
[13:57:43] <StarStream> birth 
[13:58:48] <Electron> hm... okay
[13:58:53] <StarStream> y?
[13:59:33] <Electron> I dunno your country population, is left-handed people dominating?
[14:00:58] <StarStream> remember one thing tho 
[14:01:06] <StarStream> right handed is very common 
[14:01:13] <StarStream> everywhere in the world
[14:01:27] <Electron> probably
[14:02:15] <Electron> in my country this is true
[14:06:01] <StarStream> still tho how come curious 
[14:07:28] <Electron> if a person is left-handed, does it mean that his parents and family are left-handed too?
[14:10:05] <ArchPegasusMichael> I don't think so

[14:25:06] <StarStream> yea
[14:34:50] <ArchPegasusMichael> Electron: when you're bored, start studying - you'll immediately find something entertaining to do instead
[14:35:39] <Electron> yes, I started to read a stempunk comic
[14:38:44] <TheFlutterGuy> handedness is genetic. 
[14:38:55] <TheFlutterGuy> so it will be mostly the same, no matter the country.
[14:39:58] <Electron> are you a veggie or left-handed, TheFlutterGuy?
[14:40:19] <TheFlutterGuy> right handed
[14:47:58] <StarStream> why keep saying veggie?
[14:49:09] <Electron> just asking

[14:49:44] <StarStream> vegetarian is a habit not genetic
