[04:27:15] <AppleDash> Guys
[04:27:22] <AppleDash> I need to SLI 2 9800 GTs with no SLI cable
[04:27:29] <AppleDash> I have a soldering iron and unlimited wire
[04:27:36] <AppleDash> Anyone know of a pinout?
[04:29:09] <nscoots> no connectors even? straight to board?
[04:29:14] <AppleDash> Mmhmm
[04:35:09] <JustAberrant> that seems fairly strange
[04:35:52] <AppleDash> Why?
[04:36:02] <AppleDash> Says Mr. I Soldered to a Raspberry Pi
[04:36:06] <JustAberrant> why not just get an SLI cable ;p
[04:36:15] <AppleDash> I don't know where
[04:36:18] <JustAberrant> hah, ok, point taken ;p
[04:36:33] <AppleDash> :P
[04:36:51] <JustAberrant> but that was an led, this is I presume a high speed data bus ;p
[04:36:57] <AppleDash> lol
[04:37:01] <Googie> I imagine the pinout is proprietary, but I also imaging that if you solder yourself, signal timing might be an issue potentially ?
[04:37:07] <JustAberrant> the kinda shit where they probably measure the amount of solder so as not to have different inductance and shit ;p
[04:37:12] <AppleDash> Googie, I hope not
[04:37:19] <AppleDash> JustAberrant, I really hope not :P
[04:37:48] <JustAberrant> if you rig it up with coat hangers or some shit, probably gonna have some data flow issues :>
[04:38:04] <Googie> I actually have a couple of spair SLI bridges, got them free with my card... and the card before it.
[04:38:04] <AppleDash> I am at least using wire :P
[04:38:24] * JustAberrant has never used sli, so yeah, I have basically a drawer full of the bridge dealies they all come with :D
[04:38:38] <JustAberrant> also how is SLI still even a thing a normal person would want to do
[04:38:48] <Googie> If you have a recent Nvidia card, maybe check the box ?
[04:38:51] <AppleDash> If anyone wants to send me one, feel free :P
[04:38:59] <AppleDash> Googie, I don't have anything
[04:39:07] <Googie> More expensive for me to ship than for you to buy locally :V
[04:39:17] <AppleDash> JustAberrant is semilocal
[04:39:30] <AppleDash> The last card I had was AMD which uses crossfire over PCI, and the one before that was a non-SLIable NVIDIA card
[04:40:50] <AppleDash> I just want to rig something up to hopefully be able to effectively use 1440p
[04:41:24] <Googie> For semi-modern 3D acceleration, 2x 9800GTs won't be enough
[04:41:46] <JustAberrant> I just looked and didn't find any :(
[04:41:48] <Googie> SLI isn't that great for the most part, and the 9800 is ancient.
[04:41:50] <JustAberrant> I probably tossed them :(
[04:41:51] <AppleDash> I just want my desktop to not lag :P

[04:42:30] <AppleDash> Dude
[04:42:38] <AppleDash> One of my machines here has an HDD running in it from 2000 still
[04:42:40] <Googie> It's a rebadged 2007 card
[04:42:41] <AppleDash> I mentioned it before

[04:43:27] <AppleDash> One 9800 :P
[04:43:28] <JustAberrant> my desktop is like 6 years old or so.. but I don't expect it to have good performance
[04:43:42] <JustAberrant> although it's just now starting to feel like it's holding me back
[04:44:08] <JustAberrant> I'd consider upgrade if I wasn't like.. you know.. about to buy a _house_ 
[04:44:10] <Googie> What are you hoping to improve in terms of performance ?
[04:44:20] <Googie> SLI only works for specific things.
[04:44:50] <AppleDash> What I already said
[04:44:59] <AppleDash> I want my literal desktop environment to not visually lag

[04:46:14] <AppleDash> Cinnamon*
[04:46:50] <JustAberrant> that would seem heavy for the man who wants a crisp desktop :)
[04:46:59] <AppleDash> :(
[04:48:06] <Googie> I'm not sure on the status of SLI support on Linux either. On Windows it's already pretty iffy. Applications need to specifically implement support to get any semi-decent speedup.
[04:48:33] <Googie> I can't imagine the Linux proprietary drivers are better :/
[04:49:25] <AppleDash> I think it works

[04:50:15] <AppleDash> the O was accidental and I was oopsing at the O
[04:50:21] <AppleDash> I never meant to say oops (or O)
[04:52:42] <Googie> I'm actually fairly surprised that Cinnamon lags on a 9800 though. It's old, but a DE shouldn't need /that/ much in the way of 3D acceleration.
[04:53:27] <AppleDash> 1440p though
[04:53:29] <AppleDash> It's limiting
[04:53:51] <nscoots> linux 10 years back implemented mildly reasonable sli support
[04:53:57] <nscoots> I can't imagine it has gotten worse?
[04:54:17] <Googie> For a DE though, 1440p should still be fine, especially since the 9800 was a high end gaming card in its day.
[04:54:30] <AppleDash> Was it really?
[04:54:33] <Googie> I'm pretty sure people played games at 1440p
[04:54:38] <Googie> Yeah
[04:55:00] <AppleDash> Interesting
[04:55:14] <Googie> Well, rebadged 8800gt, which I owned. I played games at 1200p and high/medium settings

[04:55:56] <Googie> If a DE is requiring more GPU power than Crysis... :V
[04:56:03] <AppleDash> xD
[04:56:06] <AppleDash> Cinnamon is pretty heavy
[04:56:17] <AppleDash> My base RAM usage is like 200M, with Cinnamon running it's 1.5G

[07:56:08] <Starthunder> And I `^H`ed a bunch and `grep -c`ed instead
[07:56:24] <Starthunder> Well, those basically just add options.
[07:56:30] <Starthunder> `egrep` is like `grep -E`, etc

[07:56:59] <JustAberrant> I thought egrep still had some bells and whistles that at least grep doesn't

[07:57:08] <Googie> They both point to the same binary though
[07:57:10] <JustAberrant> but maybe there is a flag in grep now to do those things
[07:57:12] <Starthunder> ^2
[07:57:13] <Googie> On most systems
[07:57:44] <Googie> And egrep does impact what options mean.

[10:56:07] <init3> What's up mniip?
[10:56:26] <mniip> (EE) no screens found
[10:56:34] <init3> Awhellnuh
[10:56:38] <mniip> when trying to launch a second (sic) X
[10:56:58] <init3> Oh, so your first X session works?
[10:58:16] <mniip> yeah it is managed by the DM
[10:58:43] <init3> Well, could you give me a rough idea of what you are doing? I don't have any experience really using multiple X servers but I'll help if I can. 
[10:59:34] <mniip> trying to run something in wine
[10:59:54] <mniip> it bugs out in windowed mode, and in fullscreen mode it doesn't let me alt-tab out
[11:00:05] <mniip> therefore I decided to run it in a speparate X
[11:01:46] <init3> I think you might have to start both X sessions independent of the DM. 
[11:02:13] <init3> Which DM is it?
[11:03:16] <Twilightlicious> o3o;l
[11:04:44] <mniip> lightdm
[11:05:33] <init3> Actually, you check out xnest? Just started reading about it but I think it is what you want. 
[11:05:43] <init3> *xnest
[11:06:04] <init3> http://box.matto.nl/xnest.html
[11:06:05] <PinkiePieBot> [ Fun with Xnest HowTo | box.matto.nl ]
[11:09:18] <init3> If that doesn't do the trick try starting both X sessions in a TTY.
[11:09:27] <mniip> the name suggests it uses a subset of the current screen
[11:09:58] <mniip> that's not what I'm after
[11:13:52] <init3> Okay, I was just suggesting it considering your original issue. If I am not misunderstanding that'd let you do a "fullscreen" window. In any case try disabling lightdm and starting X manually. Or see if lightdm has any documentation on making it autospawn a second session (which I'm not sure you want)
[11:15:36] <mniip> init3, I don't think that subwindow can capture mouse, can it
[11:16:55] <init3> Hmm... not sure. You might be able to force your WM to do it. Although I just tested in my system and was able to do it with no issue in another tty. 
[11:17:01] <init3> What is the command you are using?
[11:17:39] <init3> I kind of thought a DM might make that not work right but I'm not so sure I am thinking of this the right way. 
[11:17:57] <mniip> xinit wine thing -- :1 vt8
[11:18:10] <init3> Because you aren't trying to start a second /server/ Just another /client.
[11:18:33] <init3> And your current $DISPLAY is :0?
[11:21:34] <init3> I do rather like this method for launching games though. Seems to make more sense than having them on the same X server as all the other shit. 
[11:22:55] <init3> Also, are you launching the command within the TTY?
[11:24:47] <mniip> init3, sure I am trying to start a server
[11:27:10] <init3> Well only one X server can interact with particular hardware at a time under normal circumstances.

[11:27:34] <mniip> that's why vt switching is a thing
[11:27:35] <init3> There wouldn't be a need to have two servers running, just two clients attached to the server. 
[11:27:43] <mniip> uh
[11:27:54] <mniip> in X terminology clients are programs
[11:28:11] <mniip> drawing their windows on the server
[11:28:12] <init3> sessions to be sepecific. 
[11:28:37] <init3> I was just using client to contrast server. 
[11:28:56] <init3> I'm a sysadmin, it's just how I think.
[11:30:05] <init3> Anyhow, are you launching the command you told me on the TTY or within your X session? 
[11:31:52] <mniip> within the X session
[11:32:01] <mniip> it used to work that way before
[11:32:24] <init3> It should
[11:32:59] <init3> But try on the TTY and see if it works. I'm curious. Also I am completely wrong on how my terminology is being used. I fucking hate X. 
[11:33:08] <mniip> same
[11:33:11] <init3> Also I need sleep.

[11:33:29] <init3> Too much linux to sleep.
[11:33:49] <init3> Actually, this reminds me of a post I made to facebook several years ago I'll try to dig up. 
[11:34:12] <init3> But if it works via the TTY you know it isn't the X configuratiion that's the issue specifically. 
[11:35:04] <init3> Just the way it is getting launched which seems likely to me. (not that what you are doing shouldn't work, it /should/ but you know...)
[11:35:54] <mniip> I'm trying to kick portage into compiling some shit so that I can sleep a few hours
[11:36:59] <init3> Haha
[11:39:28] <init3> But I've noticed an issue trying to get any sort of cross-tty thing going from inside my session, but not from the no screens found thing. That error is kind of odd. Did the log have anything to add?
[11:40:22] <init3> I can always launch from within the TTY, but it seems to be ignoring my specification of a new $DISPLAY

[17:00:31] <cyborg_ar> two byte instructions were there in the original 8086

[17:06:39] <cyborg_ar> common instructions are shorter and terminate, uncommon/extended instructions get tacked onto the tree
[17:06:51] <cyborg_ar> further and further nested inside
[17:07:41] <cyborg_ar> if you're not careful to reserve slots for future use the tree gets capped and you cant add more instructions
[17:09:10] <Starthunder> No, I mean—
[17:09:19] <Starthunder> …oh, that's just a `mov` with a literal, isn't it.
[17:09:26] <Starthunder> There isn't actually a zero-this-register instruction.
[17:10:11] <cyborg_ar> i dunno if there is, but in architectures that didn't have one "officially" you just use the xor instruction over the register itself
[17:10:23] <Starthunder> Right.
[17:11:01] <cyborg_ar> that's usually a very short instruction
[17:11:08] <Starthunder> But if you do use `mov`, it's something like `mov $0 %eax`, right?
[17:11:10] <cyborg_ar> always shorter than loading a literal 0
[17:11:22] <Starthunder> Yeah.
[17:11:29] <cyborg_ar> yeah that should take two bytes maybe
[17:12:21] <cyborg_ar> i'm not very versed in x86 assembly since all the x86 processors i've dealt with were fast enough to just write what i wanted in C
[17:13:27] <cyborg_ar> though today i'm writing assembly (for other processor) not for speed, but for expressiveness reasons 
[17:13:59] <cyborg_ar> bit manips in C are awkward since there's no way to deal with the carry flag intelligently
[17:14:06] <cyborg_ar> or other flags
