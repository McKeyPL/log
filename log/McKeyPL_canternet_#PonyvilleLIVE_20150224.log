[21:00:36] <steeph> TheFlutterGuy: I met a guy who is known as the Flutterguy. Probably everybody who went to GalaCon 2014 or 2015 knows him. Am I right in guessing that you are somebody completely different?
[21:00:52] <steeph> I mean somepony, not somebody.
[21:01:07] <TheFlutterGuy> yup
[21:01:12] <TheFlutterGuy> completely and entirely
[21:01:21] <TheFlutterGuy> that said, there is a "FlutterGuy" on this networks too
[21:01:23] <TheFlutterGuy> who isn't me
[21:01:40] <steeph> Well, if you have hoofs - and it seemed like it when you just clapped them - that actually already answered my question.
