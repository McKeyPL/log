[01:37:54] <Starthunder> PHP has ridiculoud coersion rules.
[01:39:02] <JustAberrant> coersion eh.. 
[01:39:07] <JustAberrant> is that the new word for type automagic
[01:39:54] <Starthunder> Its type automagic is /too/ magic.
[01:39:56] <Phase4> PHP was (and to this day, is) designed with little care
[01:39:59] <Starthunder> So much so that it can be unpredictable.
[01:40:05] <Starthunder> It seems that way.
[01:40:28] <JustAberrant> yeah, it wasn't really designed so much as allowed to fester for awhile
[01:40:54] <JustAberrant> but it was never designed to do anything at the level it's being used for
[01:41:29] <JustAberrant> it was designed so dreamweaver jockeys could put little snippets of code in their html for guestbooks and link circles and all that other junk people used to do :>

[03:51:12] <JustAberrant> I found the show started a bit slow

[04:04:35] <AppleDash> go away
[04:04:37] <Phase4> can't help you with css :(
[04:04:41] <Phase4> js i can though
[04:04:59] <AppleDash> Well
[04:05:03] <AppleDash> This is a CSS and JS problem
[04:05:49] <AppleDash> Basically, on derpy.me, there's JavaScript being used to inject some CSS into the twitter ticker iframe to make it display properly
[04:05:50] <JustAberrant> Phase4: teehee
[04:06:10] <AppleDash> the issue is is that Firefox doesn't let you do that (inject stuff into an iframe)
[04:06:19] <AppleDash> So it looks stupid on Firefox
[04:06:24] <AppleDash> I need a solution to the problem
[04:06:33] <Phase4> and rightly so, you're not supposed to cross security contexts like that, even with css
[04:06:35] <AppleDash> If you want to know what I mean just view derpy.me in Chrome and Firefox.

[04:07:54] <AppleDash> And other stuff is meant to be smaller too
[04:08:23] <AppleDash> It just looks stupid in firefox because of the lack of CSS and I'd love to fix it
[04:10:47] <Phase4> AppleDash, from what i'm reading, chrome letting it work is a bug
[04:11:16] <AppleDash> It would be great if there was a fix that worked on both browsers that didn't involve exploiting a security vulnerability in one of them
[04:11:17] <AppleDash> :P
[04:11:48] <Phase4> make the iframe larger so you don't need smaller text?
[04:12:05] <AppleDash> The iframe can't be larger
[04:12:08] <AppleDash> then it would be too large

[04:25:00] <AppleDash> Oh
[04:25:02] <Phase4> AppleDash, what you have is a timing problem
[04:25:10] <AppleDash> I... don't think I do.
[04:25:27] <JustAberrant> specifically, you're coding like it was 1996? ;p
[04:25:30] <Phase4> in firefox, put a debug break on the jquery call to inject css

[04:27:50] <Phase4> the iframe doesn't exist in the page when it loads, something creates it
[04:28:28] <Phase4> AppleDash, try it if you don't believe me, or wrap it in a setTimeout
[04:28:36] <AppleDash> I tried
[04:28:38] <AppleDash> I do believe you
[04:28:46] <AppleDash> I'll just setTimeout it, yes
