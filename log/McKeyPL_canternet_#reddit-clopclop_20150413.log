[07:56:27] <cloppyhooves> G'night Princess c:
[07:56:39] <Princesssluttershy> Quick question
[07:57:04] <Princesssluttershy> if I die while I'm human or whatever do I lose all my humanity?
[07:58:22] <cloppyhooves> Your humanity is left in the bloodstain with your souls :o
[07:58:34] <cloppyhooves> (But you will have to use another humanity to return to human)
[07:58:35] <Princesssluttershy> ok
[07:58:45] <Princesssluttershy> I've just never had humanity before now :/
[07:59:16] <Princesssluttershy> Being human gives you more drops right?
[07:59:35] <cloppyhooves> Being human lets you summon others and be invaded
[07:59:44] <cloppyhooves> Having humanity (the number in the upper left) does increase item drop
[07:59:52] <Princesssluttershy> Ohh ok
[07:59:53] <cloppyhooves> Only up to 10, though
[08:00:28] <cloppyhooves> Things I want to try someday:
[08:00:30] <cloppyhooves> Quadsuiting
[08:00:41] <Princesssluttershy> What's that?
