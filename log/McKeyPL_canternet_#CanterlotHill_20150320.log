[03:52:59] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Basically years ago someone in Vietnam translated Japanese Pokemon Crystal into English.
[03:53:15] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> With very funny results.
[03:53:33] <thereallynewmop12100_> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: Picture? 
[03:53:34] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Like literal translations from the Japanese.
[03:53:42] <LuckySmith> Was it before, or after the US version was released?

[03:54:07] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> LuckySmith: Not sure when.
[03:54:33] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> thereallynewmop12100_: I am looking nothing to worry about

[03:57:13] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> LuckySmith: It also has some bad words.

[03:57:55] <Hamtramck> !t Scott
[03:57:56] <DinkyBot> is Scott " NOO "
[03:58:08] <Hamtramck> !t Scott is "YES"
[03:58:09] <DinkyBot> YES :p
[03:58:17] <LuckySmith> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: I don't remember that from Pokémon Crystal. Heh heh...
[03:58:43] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> LuckySmith: Like I said it is a bootleg translation.
[03:59:24] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> LuckySmith: And literal from Japanese.
[04:00:48] <LuckySmith> TokusatsuKuuga-RX: I see. I remember do some of my SNES games from Japan having a few f-words in them!
[04:00:51] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> LuckySmith: But yes it is funny to see.

[04:03:55] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> LuckySmith: Good to know.
[04:04:54] <LuckySmith> I just can't seem to find any up-to-date list of pony blogs. Most of the ones I find haven't been updated in years!
[04:05:43] <TokusatsuKuuga-RX> Oh my.
[04:06:49] <Eywind> What kind of 'blogs'?
[04:07:24] <LuckySmith> Ask blogs!
[04:07:33] <Eywind> oh there's a billion of those still around
[04:07:48] <LuckySmith> Yeah? Still being updated?
[04:07:53] <Eywind> yea probably
[04:08:01] <Eywind> They have a tumblr spotlight on eqd
[04:08:08] <Eywind> might be worth looking at the last few months worth
[04:08:35] <LuckySmith> Well, that's true. I sent in my blogs, and they were supposed to be in a spotlight a few months back, but it looks like it just never happened.
[04:09:19] <LuckySmith> I think I already follow most of those, though!

[05:07:28] <thereallynewmop12100_> !t rip chat
[05:07:29] <DinkyBot> yet agen the chat has confused me
[05:08:50] <Black> You should just throw out a subject or two and see what sticks Eywind.
[05:08:58] <Black> kind of like, .. what you just did.
[05:09:42] <Eywind> oh no it was more just the netsplit
[05:09:46] <Eywind> I don't really care about chat being dead
[05:15:14] <Eywind> FF15 feels like Skyrim -- run everywhere, jump over rocks to try and shortcut a little, really bad follower AI sometimes
[05:16:00] <Eywind> but there's cars so it feels like gta too lol
[05:16:14] <Snap_Shot> Could use the awesome AI system of either Bioshock Infinite or RE4
[05:16:53] <Eywind> well actually I got Type 0 (obviously since I have the 15 demo) and the AI on that does about the same amount of damage I would normally, just without some of the trickery to get one-shot kills
[05:17:05] <Eywind> on here I feel like I'm killing 3/4 of the enemies, and my dude started out 7 levels below everyone else
[05:17:30] <Eywind> so it can be a FF AI, just a better one lol

[18:47:21] <Eywind> please eat nutrition pill
[18:47:36] <Eywind> honestly I hate those restaurants
[18:48:00] <JockeTF> Eywind: Well, it can be fancy without it being like that.
[18:48:04] <Eywind> I know
[18:48:18] <Eywind> I've been to 'fancy' restaurants
[18:48:22] <JockeTF> Eywind: But yes, when it is like that, I hate those too.
[18:48:23] <Eywind> usually they're just like $150/person steakhouses lol
[18:48:29] <Eywind> where I get best steak
[18:48:32] <Eywind> best sides
[18:48:36] <Eywind> glass of wine if I want one
[18:49:24] * JockeTF remember being taken to one restaurant with very expensive "mini meals" on his birthday.
[18:49:40] <JockeTF> You were supposed to "taste many" of them.
[18:49:42] <Eywind> Ah
[18:49:49] *** Quits: MrMooMoo (Moo@MOOOOOOOOOO) (Quit: This means I went to sleep or something)
[18:49:50] <Eywind> but they were expensive lol
[18:49:57] <JockeTF> So you could get some variation.
[18:50:16] <JockeTF> Well, since I didn't pay (it was a bit of a gift) the price didn't really matter.
[18:50:31] <JockeTF> I only ended up getting one though since they took an hour to prepare them.
[18:50:39] * wobniaR eats the appetizers before the salad
[18:50:40] <Eywind> ah you were supposed to order a few at a time?
[18:50:44] <Eywind> Salad? pls
[18:50:46] <JockeTF> Wasn't really anything special once you got them either. *_*
[18:50:55] <JockeTF> Eywind: No, you were supposed to get them one at a time.
[18:50:57] <Eywind> best salad is spinach and artichoke dip from applebees
[18:50:59] <Eywind> Ah wow
[18:51:02] <Eywind> I would not wait an hour
[18:51:24] <Eywind> for really any kind of food lol
[18:51:29] <JockeTF> I made a sandwich when I got home because I was hungry. ;P
[18:51:33] <Eywind> lol
[18:52:21] <JockeTF> I'm guessing it wasn't supposed to take an hour.
[18:52:51] <JockeTF> But well, kind of "meh" getting just a tiny and expensive meal. :P
[18:53:03] <JockeTF> You wouldn't want to wait another hour, after all.
[18:53:07] <Eywind> Yea
[18:53:20] <Eywind> well one benefit of long cooking times and ordering one at a time is that it sells more alcohol
[18:53:57] <JockeTF> Yeah... I kind of just drink water with my meals. ;P
[18:54:02] <Eywind> yea
[18:54:05] <Eywind> I usually do
[18:54:21] <Eywind> sometimes I will indulge in my hedonistic tendencies
[18:54:54] <JockeTF> There are quite a few good fancy restaurants here though.
[18:55:03] <JockeTF> But I prefer the less fancy ones.
[18:55:18] <Eywind> yea
[18:55:19] <JockeTF> Fancy restaurants are really great for lunch though.
[18:55:33] <JockeTF> We usually eat at one every Friday.
[18:56:15] <Eywind> Ah nice
[18:57:00] <JockeTF> There's one called Aptit here which charges 9€ for lunch here.

[20:40:42] <Eywind> Well there's a lot more traffic in EQD
[20:40:54] <Derpyhut> i can be a usher at the theater

[20:44:26] <Eywind> and there's things to do in the chat when you watch the shows (like provide questions to Screwy for the guest, etc.) or just to talk to the same people that come every week

[21:25:27] <Eywind> it's not the only one LocDogX86X :P
[21:26:01] <NightmareMoon> But still, it's.... nostalgic, and it makes me feel alone. Because I'm reading this alone right now, instead of with the hundreds of people who were all reading it at once back when it came out.
[21:26:11] <Eywind> :(
[21:26:19] <NightmareMoon> It's like listening to a memory.
[21:26:25] <TheAndyMac> I kind of feel lonely these days as well...
