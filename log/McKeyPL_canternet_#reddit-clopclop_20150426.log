[21:03:29] <Melon_Phone> blargh
[21:09:46] <Frosty> Do you guys think that eating meat in the MLP universe is a taboo?
[21:10:09] <Vulpixbrew> likely for ponies
[21:10:28] <Psi> lol that was my first thought with the steak conversation
[21:11:19] <Frosty> Do you think it'd be taboo for a human to eat meat in their world?
[21:11:42] <cloppyhooves> I mean, they have cats
[21:11:45] <cloppyhooves> Those things need meat
[21:15:56] <Frosty> Yes, but hunting animals eat meat in our world. We don't thiunk much of it. But for an intelligent creature to eat another (assuming an intelligent creature is one that speaks), is unheard of. Humans don't eat human. That's insane. But we eat beef. It has essential protiens and such. Ponies don't eat beef because they don't need to. But, their cows talk. Would we be allowed to eat them? Some would say something like "If they die 
[21:15:56] <Frosty> naturally, sure!" but we don't do that to humans. A human dies from age or like, in a storm or something, we don't just go out there and rip off their arm.
[21:16:16] <Nikashi> I think pigs are non sentient
[21:16:21] <Nikashi> so bacon is on the table
[21:16:31] <Nikashi> they use cows for dairy
[21:16:36] <Nikashi> chicken for eggs
[21:16:48] <Nikashi> I mean they're not vegan, just implied vegetarian
[21:16:59] <Squirrelly> Then why do they have pig farms?
[21:17:04] <Frosty> right, but eggs aren't meat
[21:17:18] <Nikashi> Well if you've never seen a pig talk
[21:17:29] <Squirrelly> Why in god's name would you have pigs in your world if you're vegetarian?
[21:17:31] <Nikashi> then maybe just the ponies we've seen on camera are vegetarian
[21:17:36] <Frosty> For pets?
[21:17:39] <Nikashi> and someone still gets bacon
[21:17:47] <Frosty> Like cloppy said, Opal needs something to eat
[21:18:00] <Nikashi> yeah there's meat eating pets and animals
[21:18:05] <Nikashi> and
[21:18:06] <Nikashi> BACON
[21:18:08] <Squirrelly> still...
[21:18:21] <Nikashi> I still note that pigs have NOT been shown to be sentient
[21:18:55] <cloppyhooves> They've actually specifically answered the question about pigs
[21:18:58] <Frosty> Yes, fiar point. To my memory, Cows are it.
[21:18:59] <Nikashi> and cows are defintely... lower intelligence
[21:19:00] <cloppyhooves> I don't have a rouce
[21:19:09] <cloppyhooves> But the pigs are there because ponies like truffles
[21:19:19] <Frosty> Boom
[21:19:29] <Squirrelly> lol
[21:19:32] <cloppyhooves> Also, they're explicitly vegetarian
[21:19:32] <Frosty> I wasn't aware horses could eat chocolate.
[21:19:35] <cloppyhooves> Pinie said so :3
[21:19:44] <cloppyhooves> They can't eat a lot of things D:
[21:19:50] <Frosty> Pinkie said that?
[21:19:51] <cloppyhooves> Pinkie had a quince but those are poisonous to ponies
[21:20:19] <Frosty> Oh, dragons are intelligent, too
[21:20:29] <Nikashi> cloppyhooves: Ponies or just the girls?

[21:21:03] <Nikashi> we all eat oats and hay
[21:21:08] <Nikashi> but they clearly also eat grass
[21:21:09] <Nikashi> and flowers
[21:21:17] <cloppyhooves> "Both our diets I should mention are completely vegetarian"
[21:21:19] <Frosty> And veggies
[21:21:23] <Nikashi> ohh
[21:21:24] <Nikashi> hrm
[21:21:28] <Nikashi> well then
[21:21:31] <Nikashi> celestia gets bacon
[21:21:31] <Nikashi> then
[21:21:42] <Squirrelly> The fact that they specify that implies that there are some who are NOT vegetarian
[21:21:49] <Nikashi> yeah some other species
[21:21:56] <Nikashi> like um there are sentient bears
[21:22:00] <cloppyhooves> Or cats
[21:22:03] <Nikashi> so I would assume sentient wolves
[21:22:06] <Nikashi> I haven't seen sentient cats
[21:22:08] <Frosty> I highly doubt Timberwolves are veggitarians
[21:22:16] <Frosty> Lol, that spell.
[21:22:30] <Nikashi> we're talking about animals who can choose what to eat because they're of a higher intelligence.
[21:22:33] <Nikashi> right?
[21:23:11] <Frosty> Well, I only asked because I wasn't sure if I would be alloed to eat meat, being an intelligent creature.
[21:23:19] <Nikashi> Actually now that I think of it
[21:23:22] <cloppyhooves> http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120406194123/mlp/images/5/54/Lauren_Faust_on_the_Apple_family_raising_pigs.png

[21:23:58] <Frosty> Cloppy w/ the hard facts.
[21:24:38] <OmarianVolcae> Applejack uses them as sex slaves.
[21:26:20] <cloppyhooves> If Faust said it
[21:26:23] <cloppyhooves> You can't deny it :3
[21:26:28] <Frosty> nup.
[21:26:38] <Vulpixbrew> they get used in dog/cat food
[21:26:59] <Frosty> But I'm nt a cat or dog.
[21:27:12] <Frosty> So could /I/ eat them?
[21:29:22] <Melon_Phone> lemon seeds are in 
[21:30:01] <Melon_Phone> I think it's kinda like reverse vegan-ism 
[21:30:43] <Melon_Phone> everyone eats vegetarian stuff but it's popping up like hey this here is called meat it's really good and other ponies are like those guys are weirdos and so on 
[21:33:41] <Frosty> A friend of mine said this- " griffins must eat meat.  I think the ponys probably would eat seafood.  They aren't grazing all day, which means they are getting nutrients and particuarly protein from some source.  they have big brains, herbivores have smaller brains and eat less protein.  So they are either eating seafood, eggs, and stuff. or a lot of nuts.  They have shown pinkie and applejack using eggs before, and fluttershy had no 
[21:33:41] <Frosty> problems catching fish and feeding them to her ferrets so it seems likely they would have no problems eating eggs and fish
[21:33:41] <Frosty> . furthermore, they keep chickens on applejacks farm, if they aren't eating them then the eggs are the only value to them left, so they must eat them.  They also have pigs which means they are butchering pigs, wether they eat it or sell the meat to the griffins i dont know"
[21:34:58] *** Joins: preeb (beerpony@Pony-7s2.vq3.149.24.IP)
[21:35:58] <Frosty> Which is a good thought. I forgot about the griffins.
[21:37:51] <Vulpixbrew> jurassic park is on AMC right now
[21:38:09] <Melon_Phone> pigs are dead useful 
[21:38:34] <Melon_Phone> great garbage disposal, they'll eat practically everything, even bone
[21:38:59] <Frosty> Yes, but when they die, then what?
[21:39:03] <Frosty> You chop tem up
[21:39:08] <Melon_Phone> fat used for soap
[21:39:23] <Frosty> And the meat?
[21:39:34] <Frosty> "yeah.  and they are sentient creatures apparently.  I think the ponies probably dont eat anything that is sentient, which is most animals in equestria.  But so far fish aren't sentient.  Oh and pegasi are gonna need even more protein and vitamins than earth and unicorn, higher muscle use from flying and such.  They either spend all day eating, or eat a major nutriet source.  hay fries and hay pancakes dont cut it
[21:39:34] <Frosty> "
[21:39:38] <weisey> Sold to the diamond dogs and gryphon's 
[21:39:42] <Melon_Phone> pig heart valves can be used to replace humans' 
[21:39:49] <OmarianVolcae> It's like the island. 
[21:39:55] <OmarianVolcae> The pigs win a "Lottery"
[21:40:13] <OmarianVolcae> They get to go to a nice protected paradise if they win, but in reality they get slaughtered.
[21:40:28] <Melon_Phone> you can inflate their lungs to get old fashioned footballs 
[21:40:38] <Frosty> Well, there aren't very many humans in Equestria. No that we know of, anyway.
[21:40:48] <Melon_Phone> pig hair is often used to make beer and wine
[21:40:59] <Melon_Phone> getting rid of bodies
[21:42:40] <Melon_Phone> "a pet, pig shows and races, company to other animals and organic compost removal" 
[21:42:59] <Melon_Phone> but yeah in the end when most animals die they can be eaten 
[21:43:59] <Frosty> And so you'd think it'd be okay to eat pork?
[21:44:06] <Frosty> What about beef? That's the best one.
[21:45:09] <Melon_Phone> beef is good but herbivores are named herbivores for a reason 
[21:45:30] <Melon_Phone> although given evidence, humans are closer to herbivores than carnivores
[21:46:02] <Melon_Phone> with that in mind, it is possible that ponies could eat meat
[21:46:10] <Melon_Phone> digesting it is another matter 
[21:46:29] <Frosty> They just choose not to.
[21:47:45] <Melon_Phone> also it's a TV show for children of ~4 years old 
[21:48:34] <Frosty> But I need to know incase this ever happens.
[21:48:42] <Melon_Phone> what a friendly episode it would be when fluttershy discovers that clucky the chicken can't produce any more eggs and decides to have her for dinner with her 5 best friends
[21:48:53] <Frosty> Also, I was thinking about it while buying a steak, wondered what you guys would think.
[21:49:48] <OmarianVolcae> Lol Melon_Phone.
[21:49:51] <OmarianVolcae> I'd watch it.
[21:51:37] <Melon_Phone> a song scene where fluttershy plucks clucky's  feathers off and chops her head off
