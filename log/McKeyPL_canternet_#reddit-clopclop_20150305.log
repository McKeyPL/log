[20:56:19] <Vulpixbrew> all the pettings 
[20:56:22] <Vulpixbrew> http://i.imgur.com/77r2lqU.jpg
[20:57:00] <RNGsus> That is a nice game
[20:57:43] * Vulpixbrew notes it was only his 4th match
[20:57:53] <RNGsus> That is impressive 
[20:58:01] <RNGsus> Especially for a level 3
[20:58:51] <Vulpixbrew> good cover, great line of sight and for some odd reason they lined up on a ridge for me
[20:59:56] <RNGsus> http://i.imgur.com/SgnE3E1.jpg
[21:00:19] <RNGsus> Researched the best jet in game with a shittty float biplane
[21:00:44] <Vulpixbrew> nice
[21:01:49] <Vulpixbrew> but that didn't see action in WW2
[21:02:06] <RNGsus> What didnt?>
[21:04:13] <Araiya> I don't quite get the fascination with that game. o.o
[21:04:33] <RNGsus> Planes
[21:05:02] * Araiya points to her horn. "If I were meant to fly, I wouldn't have that." :)
[21:05:07] <Vulpixbrew> the Cl-13
[21:05:19] <Vulpixbrew> it didnt fly until 1950
[21:05:21] <RNGsus> Yeah well neither did the T 54 but gaijin dont give one single shit
[21:06:24] <RNGsus> The F 80, F 84, F 86 F8f 1b F8F 1 F9f both versions F9h B 57 both versions all didnt see service in ww2
[21:06:30] <RNGsus> and thats all just american planes
[21:07:32] <Araiya> My roomie plays the hell out of the game, and keeps trying to convince me it's fun. For me, it's not, though -- aside from the birthday joke they pulled a couple or few years back with the ponies, everything in the game that I've had access to flies like a school bus.
[21:07:56] <RNGsus> Well your roomie hasnt let you fly biplanes then
[21:08:01] <RNGsus> Also that was april fools X3
[21:08:09] <Araiya> I'm just not patient enough to fly schoolbuses until I can have a jet.
[21:08:31] <Araiya> I'm pretty sure I had access to a biplane. Still flies like a schoolbus.
[21:08:36] <RNGsus> how do they fly like schoolbuses?
[21:08:47] <RNGsus> What do you expect them to do, stop in mid air and reverse direction?
[21:09:35] <Araiya> Basically, they all feel like I'm flying the Lodestar from Planetside. Slow, ponderous, poor maneuverability, and slow. Did I mention slow?
[21:09:54] <RNGsus> ....
[21:10:07] <RNGsus> I cant tell if you are being sarcastic or not
[21:10:20] <Araiya> I'm being dead serious.
[21:10:25] <RNGsus> lol
[21:10:33] <Araiya> Every plane I flew seriously felt like I was flying the Lodestar.
[21:10:52] <RNGsus> yeah because 450 mph isnt fast enough
[21:11:11] <RNGsus> 700 mph isnt fast enough
[21:11:18] <Araiya> The game became very dull, very quickly. I'm at a disadvantage because I prefer sci-fi and futuristic things over WW2-era.
[21:11:37] <Araiya> Star Conflict, their other game, I was able to stay interested in for about a week.
[21:11:48] <RNGsus> your not at a disadvantage you just arent interested
[21:12:33] <Vulpixbrew> for me Araiya I could bore people to sleep with the European Theatre of Operation details during WWII
[21:12:40] <Araiya> Even my boyfriend has been playing a bit of WarThunder and World of Tanks. I just couldn't stay interested in either. Defiance, on the other hand, I can't explain why I'm still interested in it.
[21:13:00] <RNGsus> to each their own
[21:13:10] <Araiya> Nor can I explain why I've paid so much into the game. >_>;
[21:13:23] <RNGsus> just because you arent interested doesnt mean the planes are slow and fly like bricks
[21:13:42] <Araiya> Which reminds me. I should finish unpacking so I can pull out my hellbug figurine. :3
[21:14:32] <Araiya> Thing is, WarThunder was actually fun for me on my birthday that one year. The ponies actually didn't feel like I was slogging through syrup.
[21:14:52] <RNGsus> The ponies had the flight model of a me 163 which turn like shit
[21:15:21] <cloppyhooves> See you sexy ponies later!
[21:15:21] <RNGsus> Bye cloppyhooves 
[21:16:04] <Vulpixbrew> bye bye cloppy
[21:16:30] <Araiya> I can't explain it, really. Yes, the ponies had a poor turning radius, but my brain explained it away: Try turning stupidly hard when your wings are made of bones.
[21:16:52] <RNGsus> ?
[21:16:53] * Araiya shrugs. Is more of a sci-fi unicorn, with the exception of Spreadsheets Online.
[21:17:18] <RNGsus> No you dont make a point and disengage the conversation about it, i want to know how they were better
[21:18:20] <Araiya> That's the thing. I can't figure out why I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more when I was flying a pony, other than the forward motion actually felt like forward motion, even when the turning was horseapples.
[21:18:42] <Araiya> I keep the game installed, only to ask the roomie every year on my birthday: "Are the ponies back?"
[21:18:46] <RNGsus> Thats because what you were flying was the flight model of a literal rocket
[21:19:00] <RNGsus> Its on april fools, and unfortionately no, its never going to be back
[21:19:21] * Araiya clarifies: Her birthday is on april fool's day.
[21:19:37] <Araiya> It was the best birthday present a game has ever given me.
