[00:01:20] <endoriazel> *2.6.1
[00:01:30] <mniip> lol
[00:01:34] <endoriazel> so you're more than 2 majors behind
[00:01:41] <endoriazel> good job
[00:02:41] <endoriazel> anyhow
[00:03:02] <endoriazel> ffmpeg -i ... -c copy -c:v copy -c:a audicodec ...
[00:09:47] <mniip> updated ffmpeg
[00:09:48] <mniip> 0.8.17-6:0.8.17-1
[00:11:29] <JustAberrant> you must be using debian?
[00:12:14] <mniip> how did you know
[00:12:21] <mniip> :)
[00:12:23] <JustAberrant> hehe
[00:12:54] <JustAberrant> but seriously, that's messed up
[00:13:00] <JustAberrant> the oldest gentoo has is 0.10.16
[00:13:17] <JustAberrant> stable is 1.2.6 .. and I'm rnning 2.6.1 :>
[00:13:21] <JustAberrant> * running
[00:13:32] <mniip> I'm seeing something called '9-r1'
[00:13:48] <mniip> oops, that's virtual
[00:14:05] <mniip> buuuuut
[00:14:08] <mniip> 2.6.1 is ~amd64
[00:14:14] <mniip> ~~~~~~~~~~
[00:14:23] <JustAberrant> I know people joke around, but that's like 4 years ago
[00:14:25] <mniip> ~~~~ isbad
[00:14:43] <JustAberrant> @ 0.8
[00:15:12] <JustAberrant> :>
[00:15:51] <JustAberrant> I'm surprised debian even has ffmpeg in official repo though.. I thought they went all debian on it and switched to libav
[00:16:29] <JustAberrant> maybe they rolled back on that though *shruggles*
[00:17:38] * nscoots misses ffmpeg

[09:05:25] <Blackjack> Billing: Oh, you used 100GB over your cap but you've always only used less than half of your cap in the past? Well, I don't know why that happened, but for 10$ per month more you can get our unlimited plan, and if you upgrade now I'll waive the overage fees

[20:08:35] <DataByte> i automated the download, and asked if she'd be ok with allowing my program to also reset the stats when it downloads them
[20:09:05] <DataByte> she does not want me to download them, and wants to do it herself, for 'a specific reason' that she won't tell me
[20:09:15] <DataByte> i don't get users
