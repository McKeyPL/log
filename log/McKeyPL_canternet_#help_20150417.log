[01:41:37] <Gsc> anyone here to help
[01:41:57] <Dusk> Yep
[01:42:05] <Gsc> is there anyway
[01:42:11] <Gsc> that i can block longer msgs 
[01:42:37] <Dusk> As in...placing a character limit?
[01:42:38] <Colgate> uh, not really
[01:42:42] <Dusk> Yea no
[01:42:57] <Colgate> you kind of can if you do /mode #channel +g ?????????????????????????????????????????//*
[01:42:59] <Gsc> yeah
[01:43:03] <Gsc> character limit
[01:43:05] <Gsc> no
[01:43:06] <Colgate> but... that's not very nice, lol
[01:43:08] <Gsc> colgate i tried that
[01:43:10] <Gsc> but its for small
[01:43:10] <AppleDash> Colgate, isn't that a reverse character limit? :P
[01:43:15] <Gsc> i want 200 characters
[01:43:19] <Colgate> then no, there isn't
[01:43:29] <Colgate> AppleDash: the ? matches exactly 1 character
[01:43:32] <Colgate> not 0
[01:43:40] <Colgate> so multiple ?s is 1 character each
[01:43:42] <AppleDash> I know
[01:43:53] <AppleDash> But ??? would be min 3 chars not max 3 chars
[01:44:07] <Colgate> no, because ??? doesn't match "no"
[01:44:16] <Gsc> :wacko
[01:44:24] <Gsc> like if some one sends a very long message
[01:44:24] <Colgate> only 2 characters, ??? matches exactly 3
[01:44:27] <Gsc> then that person get mute
[01:44:36] <Colgate> you would have to write a bot to do that
[01:44:57] <AppleDash> Colgate: I am saying only messages with min 3 chars would be allowed
[01:45:05] <AppleDash> like if you have a * after it
[01:45:12] <AppleDash> Or...
[01:45:13] <AppleDash> Wat
[01:45:14] <Gsc> can u guys make a bot for me
[01:45:17] <Gsc> if some one has it
[01:45:20] <Colgate> if you have a * after it, then it would block any message 3 characters or longer
[01:45:30] <Gsc> that mute people that send more than 200 msgs in a channel
[01:45:32] <AppleDash> Isn't that what they want?
[01:45:43] <Colgate> AppleDash: yes, but +g only takes 64 characters iirc
[01:45:58] <AppleDash> Oh
[01:46:00] <AppleDash> I see.
[01:46:12] <RubyPinch> very short twitter messages only
[01:46:19] <AppleDash> I'm guessing +g is for glob or something, make a +r for regex blocking
[01:46:29] <Colgate> +g is glob, yes
[01:46:37] <Gsc> +r ?
[01:46:37] <Twili> I read in a book once that said +r is better.
[01:46:40] <Colgate> +r for regex won't happen because regexes can be very cpu intensive
[01:47:09] <Gsc> u should have +G too
[01:47:13] <Gsc> and kicks on repeat
[01:47:36] <Colgate> +G in inspircd is a global opt-in channel filter
[01:47:41] <Colgate> we do not have that enabled
[01:47:51] <Gsc> why don't you people enable it
[01:47:53] <Gsc> its very cool
[01:48:40] <Gsc> lol thanks for the discussion
[01:48:41] <Colgate> because maintaining a list of things that people want to filter is not something we have time for :P
[01:49:01] <Gsc> what do u have time for
[01:49:14] <Gsc> :wacko
[01:51:05] <Googie> Also different people have different ideas of exactly what should be blocked, and the +G filter uses the same list globally
[01:51:35] <Colgate> that too, just a problem all around, then there are the accidental things, "grape" when "rape" is blocked, etc.
[01:53:09] <Gsc> globally :O
[01:53:13] <Gsc> or in the channel
[01:53:32] <Colgate> in the channels that have +G set
[01:53:39] <Colgate> as said, it is an opt-in filter

[01:56:25] <Gsc> actually the
[01:56:28] <Gsc> thing is 
[01:56:33] <Gsc> if you have +G enable
[01:56:36] <Gsc> the best thing to do 
[01:56:38] <Gsc> if some one type
[01:56:40] <Gsc>  F u Ck 
[01:56:46] <Gsc> it will not show in the room
[01:56:47] <Gsc> also
[01:56:50] <Colgate> it doesn't work that way
[01:56:55] <Gsc> if you add ****** in the badwords
[01:56:58] <Gsc> it will kick the users
