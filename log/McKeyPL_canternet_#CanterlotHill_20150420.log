[12:43:19] <RandomNinja> 960 isn't that great though
[12:43:22] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Yea, I don't really want to waste money when the boost is minimal.
[12:43:42] <RandomNinja> like you get a lot for the money but you might as well get AMD at that price point
[12:43:46] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> He might've said 970. Either the 960 or the 970 I don't remember.

[16:30:24] <Trildar> Really though, it's almost always about voting for the least insane.
