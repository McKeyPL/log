[12:34:19] <RandomNinja> game of the year http://i.imgur.com/3rLhwAJ.png
[12:34:53] <Unixkitty> One of the first Skyrim problems I encountered.
[12:35:37] <Unixkitty> That game looks very beautiful though, certainly catching my attention
[12:35:47] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> What game is that?
[12:35:52] <Unixkitty> Witcher 3 I believe
[12:35:56] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Ah.
[12:36:01] <Unixkitty> Are you planning to play it, RandomNinja?
[12:36:20] <RandomNinja> not yet
[12:36:32] <RandomNinja> If I start playing now, I'll fail all my exams :/
[12:36:48] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Pff. Who cares about exams <.< >.>
[12:36:53] <Unixkitty> Oh I meant in general
[12:37:25] <RandomNinja> yeah
[12:37:34] <Unixkitty> Exams obviously get priority though
[12:37:35] <RandomNinja> protip: retail version has a ton of swag
[12:37:41] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I have my first exam on friday :/
[12:38:39] <Unixkitty> "swag"? Can't say any amount of "swag", whatever that may be" would be enough for convincing me to buy a retail version of a media nowadays
[12:39:26] <RandomNinja> not even real life swag? http://img.game.co.uk/images/content/SpecialEditions/WitcherWildHuntStEd_PS4.jpg
[12:40:03] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Pff.. ps4
[12:40:16] <RandomNinja> same for PC
[12:40:25] <Unixkitty> I do believe "any amount" includes any type as well
[12:40:34] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> ^^
[12:41:59] <RandomNinja> also probably cheaper then digital
[12:44:08] <Unixkitty> How so? Are there not supposed to be costs for producing discs, boxes, and all the trinkets that normally come with those retail versions?
[12:45:12] <RandomNinja> disc printing costs are negledtible on large scale
[12:45:57] <RandomNinja> the other stuff was originally to encourage purchase instead of piracy in eastern europe, then they stuck with it after the Witcher series  got popular in the west as well
[12:46:44] <RandomNinja> also, you're getting a digital copy included. Possibly 2.
[12:47:16] <RandomNinja> either way, if you do buy digital, don't buy it on Steam, buy it on GOG
[12:47:28] <Unixkitty> Why not?
[12:47:45] <Unixkitty> I like having my games in one place really
[12:47:53] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> You may get a steam key.
[12:47:57] <RandomNinja> you get a steam key as well, and GOG is cheaper
[12:48:11] <RandomNinja> on top of the DRM-free GOG version
[12:48:15] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> There's a lot of places you can get steam games cheaper than steam.
[12:48:23] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I use g2play for example.
[12:48:32] <RandomNinja> GOG is owned my CD Projekt
[12:48:33] <Unixkitty> Oh I do know that, I was not aware gog provides Steam keys as well
[12:48:35] <RandomNinja> by*
[12:48:37] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> or g2a, kinguin, or other similair stores.
[12:48:45] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Alright.
[12:49:02] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Just.. Don't buy stuff from OnePlay.
[12:49:34] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Especially not pre-orders.
[12:49:57] <RandomNinja> pre-orders aren't magic
[12:50:00] <Unixkitty> I don't really know that one, but good to know I guess?
[12:50:24] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Well, I pre-ordered GTA 5 in 2013. Had to wait a month after release before I finally got it.
[12:50:43] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> After I wrote to them every day that whole month.
[12:51:09] <Unixkitty> That is why if I do pre-order, I do it strictly in Steam
[12:51:22] <Unixkitty> Which still happens quite rarely.
[12:51:28] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> Yea, but I got it for less than 50% of the price though.
[12:51:55] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I think I gave about 46% of the total price or something like that.
[12:54:04] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> At least I still got the pre-order bonuses even though they said I wouldn't.
[12:54:18] <RandomNinja> well, either way
[12:54:19] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> So that's positive I guess.
[12:54:25] <RandomNinja> Tunnel Snakes rule!
[12:54:50] <Hisha_The_Unicorn> I just watched the new episode today.
