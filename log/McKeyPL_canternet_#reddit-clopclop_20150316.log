[02:45:38] <samonuh> Although I'm only at 2,000 people
[02:45:55] <samonuh> It's annoying cause my city so far is just two sloppy suburbs
[02:46:00] <samonuh> I want it to look better

[02:46:31] <RNGsus> thats from a while ago though
[02:47:08] <samonuh> Two questions
[02:47:19] <samonuh> How do you get rid of powerlines? They're so ugly
[02:47:27] <samonuh> And how do you build bridges?
[02:47:30] <RNGsus> bulldoze them
[02:47:35] <RNGsus> page up and page down when building roads
[02:47:44] <samonuh> But then my city won't have power
[02:47:53] <RNGsus> okay
[02:48:00] <RNGsus> you know
[02:48:14] <samonuh> I don't see any in yours, is why I'm asking
[02:48:15] <RNGsus> where are your powerlines

[02:48:49] <RNGsus> take a whole huge block of suberbs
[02:48:54] <Drago> wb
[02:48:59] <RNGsus> all the houses are close together
[02:49:00] <Vulpixbrew> ty
[02:49:12] <RNGsus> if you go into the view that shows you the electricity, it will show a blue outline
[02:49:19] <samonuh> Yea
[02:49:37] <RNGsus> as long as that connects, as long as you have a source of power somewhere in that big blob everything in it will be powered
[02:49:47] <RNGsus> so for example i have literally one powerline going to the big city
[02:50:11] <RNGsus> you just need powerlines to get the power from the plant to somewhere in your suburbs
[02:50:24] <samonuh> You'd laugh if you saw my city
[02:50:27] <samonuh> lol
[02:50:32] <RNGsus> i most likely would
[02:50:45] <RNGsus> you need no power lines anywhere in a city, just connecting from one part of your city to a plant
[02:51:36] <samonuh> ...I still don't quite understand what you're saying. 
[02:52:06] <RNGsus> uh
[02:52:19] <RNGsus> um
[02:52:28] <samonuh> If I have no powerlines in the city
[02:52:28] <RNGsus> take every power line out of your city and see the big blue blob
[02:52:36] <RNGsus> hnnnrg
[02:52:46] <RNGsus> you just need one to the city
[02:52:50] <samonuh> OH
[02:52:52] <samonuh> I GET YOU
[02:52:54] <samonuh> Hahahaa
[02:52:59] <samonuh> That works
[02:53:01] <samonuh> >???
[02:53:05] <RNGsus> ye
[02:53:07] <samonuh> I thought I couldn't do that
[02:53:16] <samonuh> So as long as they're all connected
[02:53:17] <samonuh> The blobs
[02:53:20] <samonuh> It works
[02:53:21] <RNGsus> yes
[02:53:23] <samonuh> Sweet
[02:53:25] <samonuh> Thank you
[02:53:45] <RNGsus> just be careful when you are making new districts, and the buildings might pop up far away when it is first growing, their blobs wont connect
[02:53:47] <samonuh> I was legitimately getting bummed out by how ugly the city was
[02:53:49] <RNGsus> in time they will though
[02:54:13] <RNGsus> u can build an entire city without lines

[03:18:57] <samonuh> Cool
[03:18:59] <Drago> I remember playing sim city 3000 in middle school computer class. I enjoyed it
[03:20:32] <Drago> We played it a lot but on particular "test" we were graded on our cities. I don't remember how though.
[03:20:43] <Drago> The teacher had a curly mullet
[03:21:39] <RNGsus> http://i.imgur.com/mg3cylT.jpg
[03:22:08] <RNGsus> i dont really play that city anymore because i made some huge mistakes in it
[03:22:17] <RNGsus> for example i enabled mods which disable achievements
[03:22:24] <samonuh> Ah, dang...

[03:22:33] <FineLine> [ My little brothel - A teenage Twilight and her mom ... ]
[03:22:39] <RNGsus> and all my roads are two way instead of one way, and i cant change that without literally removing all the buildings
[03:23:01] <RNGsus> and because of the shitty traffic there are dead bodies and traffic everywhere that cant be picked up
[03:23:08] <RNGsus> It's a fun, nice city
[03:23:18] <samonuh> lol
[03:23:32] <samonuh> I've been using six lane one ways
[03:23:35] <Drago> I feel like I have read enough about some city game. BBL
[03:23:41] <Drago> <3
[03:23:44] <RNGsus> >4
[03:23:47] <samonuh> Alrighty
[03:24:14] <RNGsus> 6 lane one ways are usless right now because traffic refuses to use more than one lane so you would actually be better off with 2 lane 1 ways
[03:24:29] <samonuh> I plan ahead
[03:24:49] <RNGsus> good for you planning ahead to whenever they remodel the entire traffic engine
[03:25:12] <samonuh> ?
[03:25:38] <RNGsus> '6 lane one ways are usless right now because traffic refuses to use more than one lane so you would actually be better off with 2 lane 1 ways'
[03:25:52] <RNGsus> traffic doesnt use more than one lane
[03:26:07] <samonuh> Why not?
[03:26:10] <RNGsus> 6 lanes or 2 lanes, it doesnt matter, and 6 lanes cause stop lights, which slows traffic while 2 lanes dont
[03:26:17] <RNGsus> 6 lanes also take up more room

[03:27:09] <samonuh> When will it be fixed?
[03:27:15] <RNGsus> nobody knows
[03:28:27] <samonuh> Seems ridiculous
[03:28:34] <RNGsus> ya
[03:28:42] <RNGsus> go ahead and look at  your 6 lanes
[03:28:48] <RNGsus> see how many lanes the traffic uses
[03:29:02] <samonuh> Why bother releasing the game without that feature?
[03:29:22] <RNGsus> shhh
[03:29:26] <RNGsus> shhhhhh
[03:32:47] <Katiepony> It depends how the rest of your roads connecting to it are designed.
[03:33:03] <RNGsus> How so
[03:33:11] <Katiepony> If you do it correctly, they use all 6 lanes.
