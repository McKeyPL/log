[00:01:03] <Electron> um... the country which is hated by everyone apparently
[00:01:33] <Electron> I got deep night here in this moment :)
[00:01:54] <firestorm> i dont share hatred with anyone, so youre going to have to clarify, as i am utterly clueless
[00:02:41] <Electron> well, I'm living on the geographical border of Europe and Asia
[00:03:12] <Electron> Asieurope
[00:03:20] <Electron> err....
[00:03:26] <Electron> Euroasia
[00:04:17] <Electron> the group of the mountains calls South Urals
[00:05:12] <Electron> and you?

[00:13:53] <Electron> and unstable weather in summer
[00:15:16] <firestorm> aww man that sounds awesome, in england, usually at the start of summer, we get this one day, and the sun is so hot it melts roads, the lakes start getting smaller, and cars paint chips off. then the rain comes back
[00:17:18] <Electron> wow, sounds like you are under magnifier glass for a short period of time
[00:18:28] <firestorm> anyway, im gonna have to go, its been really nice talking to you, ill probably see you on here some time, anyway, goodnight, i need sleep before college. bye :)
