[03:16:14] <Cloud_Zephyr> the longest i've probably been in a plane is 2 hours

[03:16:55] <MikeM> Except deep vein thrombosis isn't such a problem on a bus.
[03:16:57] <RandomNinja> that's usually unpossible because there's either a fat guy taking up half your seat or a kid kicking you in the back for 3 hours
[03:16:58] <One-Trick> i have an issue with being trapped in a plane for a long time as it removes all control of the situation, not the plane itself

[16:39:17] <Eywind> I have random encounters on
[16:39:32] <Eywind> and sometimes I'll wonder across one Thalmor getting killed and I'm pumped like early in teh game
[16:39:32] <Unixkitty> I am still not 100% sure though, because I kind of despise Thalmor.
[16:39:56] <Eywind> both sides suck
[16:40:03] <Eywind> kill them all
[16:40:04] <RandomNinja> stormcloaks suck less tho
[16:40:18] <RandomNinja> yeah kill them both, side with the Tunnel Snakes
[16:40:26] <Eywind> nah kill them early in the game
[16:40:27] <Unixkitty> I would really prefer to completely stay out of the war though, and go with that RandomNinja just said haha
[16:40:35] <Unixkitty> what*
[16:40:50] <RandomNinja> Eywind you can't though, because lol immortal quest NPCs
[16:40:58] <Eywind> kill them anyways
[16:41:09] <RandomNinja> which is one reason why I love new vegas

[18:28:39] <Lunatic> today i question science
[18:28:47] <RandomNinja> how so
[18:29:06] <Lunatic> I made fries and chicken in the oven
[18:29:13] <Lunatic> and
[18:29:30] <Lunatic> They required conflicting times and temperatures so I tried to find a happy medium
[18:30:07] <Lunatic> Thought I did good until I opened the oven and the fries were all hard as rocks and burnt. I take them and start eating them and then I found a fry that is still frozen solid

[18:37:11] <Lunatic> at 425 degrees American, they shouldn't be frozen
[18:37:28] <Eywind> Umm
[18:37:34] <Eywind> I'm guessing the fries needed a longer cooking time at a lower temperature?
[18:37:58] <Lunatic> uhh........
[18:38:00] <Lunatic> I think
[18:38:05] <Eywind> Exactly
[18:38:10] <Eywind> It burned cuz the temp was so high
[18:38:16] <Eywind> and it didn't spread into the middle of the fries
[18:38:21] <Lunatic> no
[18:38:30] <Lunatic> but the entire fry was cold and frozen
[18:38:33] <Lunatic> not just the center
[18:38:40] <Eywind> the point is
[18:38:47] <Eywind> finding a happy medium with the oven doesn't work

[23:57:25] <Eywind> Pony_OU812 master race
[23:57:27] <Ali> They're probably waiting for it to become poplular enough, and then hit it with C&D
[23:57:31] <Pony_OU812> ;)
[23:57:39] <Araxnus> Maybe
[23:57:42] <Eywind> not worth the C&D legal fees for little stuff
