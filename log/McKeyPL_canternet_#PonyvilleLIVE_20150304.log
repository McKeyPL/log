[08:04:16] <HomerMobile> I just uploaded a prank call video where I harassed a scam company
[08:08:45] <Electron> oh
[08:09:06] <Electron> I didn't know you like to do such things :)
[08:22:27] * Electron feels like — http://smiles.smile-o-pack.net/2903.gif
[08:29:05] <Electron> if only I could disable my feelings in mornings...
[08:30:13] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: that's me too

[10:47:50] * MirSar summond DR. Who, steals his phone box and travels 3 months forward in time ^^
[11:07:37] <Electron> do not play with time
[11:07:46] <Electron> it always ends up bad

[12:04:13] * Electron 's belly rumbles
[12:09:10] <MirSar> hmm, interesting question..
[12:09:10] <MirSar> If one travels forward in time 1 year and see that you are going to die, then travels back to your "own" time.
[12:09:10] <MirSar> Can you change what happens in the future? are what you see in the futura a result of you actually traveling forward in time?
[12:09:54] <MirSar> Or will a sepparate timeline be created because you know what is going to happen in the future?
[12:13:06] <Electron> this is exactly why you do not mess with time
[12:18:20] <Electron> there is theory that there is no randomness at all
[12:18:40] <Electron> so according to that theory you can calculate the future
