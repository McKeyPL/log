[00:03:38] <Twilightlicious> ughhhh
[00:03:40] <Twilightlicious> newest skype version
[00:03:42] <Twilightlicious> adds ads.
[00:03:45] <Twilightlicious> Lol
[00:03:59] <Twilightlicious> Annoyingly Giant ads.
[00:04:17] <Twilightlicious> Like 25% of your skype message window is reserved for ads.
[00:07:05] <JockeTF> Worst part is that there are no third party clients.
[00:07:37] <JockeTF> Seems like people always latch on to the most closed platforms when it comes to instant messaging. >_<
[00:08:24] <Twilightlicious> it wasnt that bad until Microsoft got ahold of it.
[00:08:51] <JockeTF> It was always bad in my opinion.
[00:09:00] <Phase4> it was always that bad
[00:09:07] <Twilightlicious> not this bad http://i.imgur.com/t8IvCXF.png
[00:09:17] <Phase4> no it was always that bad
[00:09:23] <Twilightlicious> like a large portion of my screen is now a giant advertisement
[00:09:37] <Twilightlicious> there used to be a tiny one at the top
[00:09:44] <Twilightlicious> that wasnt bad at all
[00:09:55] <Phase4> Twilightlicious, if you *have* to use skype, add a dummy apps.skype.com to the hosts file
[00:10:18] <Twilightlicious> that'll just cause the ads to not load
[00:10:26] <Twilightlicious> i'm upset about the loss of space more than anything
[00:10:29] <Phase4> and not take up space as a result
[00:10:39] <Twilightlicious> pretty sure they still will
[00:10:42] <Phase4> worked last time i had to use windows
[00:10:50] <Twilightlicious> this was added in an update
[00:10:53] <Twilightlicious> like 2 days ago
[00:11:17] <Twilightlicious> shows this if it fails to load http://i.imgur.com/XPfZx1V.png
[00:11:47] <Phase4> well fuck microsoft then
[00:11:57] <Twilightlicious> What do we replace skype with?
[00:12:03] <Twilightlicious> Predict the software economy! :P
[00:12:19] <Twilightlicious> Trillian had Skype support back in the day, i wonder if it stilld oes
[00:12:23] <Twilightlicious> Trillian had Skype support back in the day, i wonder if it still does
[00:12:32] <Twilightlicious> Oops, i thought this was skype and i corrected a typo XD
[00:12:35] * Twilightlicious spams
[00:13:09] <Phase4> they tore out some of the old api's allowing that
[00:13:49] * Blackjack pokes JustAberrant
[00:13:53] <Colgate> Twilightlicious: there's tox for a skype replacement, never used it myeslf though
[00:14:18] <Colgate> completely incompatible with skype though
[00:14:48] <Colgate> and yeah, they tore out the API completely in windows builds, and it is only barely still ther ein the linux ones
[00:15:23] <Colgate> one day they will do a mandatory update for linux that will nuke the API completely
[00:15:39] <Colgate> or they might never update the linux build again, I would be perfectly ok with that
[00:16:47] <Blackjack> ^
[00:17:13] <Colgate> until it had a security hole :(
[00:19:57] <Phase4> would not surprise me if they simply dropped the linux client
[00:20:34] <JockeTF> The good thing with putting huge ads into the client is that people may stop using it. ;P
[00:20:55] * nscoots grumbles about all you skype poni and having been dragged in
[00:21:04] <nscoots> does allow a nice way around cellular minutes though
[00:21:50] <Colgate> I avoid skype as much as possible, but it is useful for random voip stuff
[00:22:25] * nscoots does the irc shall not die chant in the corner
[00:23:07] <Colgate> no reason to use skype for text chat :P
[00:23:54] <johnsey> why use skype when you can use mumble, WebRTC and XMPP?
[00:24:45] <Kinsley> Because your friends use Skype, that's why.
[00:24:59] <nscoots> *parents use skype
[00:25:27] <Phase4> *bronystate staff using skype
[00:25:32] <Phase4> :(
[00:25:47] <nscoots> *friends at microsoft use skype
[00:33:17] <Twilightlicious> Everyone uses Skype

[01:28:55] <Starthunder> Microsoft put ADS into Skype?!
[01:29:00] <Starthunder> But you already have to PAY for shit!
[01:29:07] <Blackjack> They have had ads in Skype for many years.
[01:29:15] <nscoots> *cough* cable used to not have ads
[01:29:16] <Blackjack> they just made them bigger recently
[01:29:25] <Starthunder> Beyond 1:1 [video] calls and messages within Skype :/
[01:29:57] <Blackjack> ?
[01:30:00] <Starthunder> Fuck Skype
[01:30:06] <Blackjack> You don't need to pay for group chats, lol
[01:30:09] <Starthunder> And more importantly, fuck Microsoft
[01:30:23] <Blackjack> You only need Skype premium if you want to video call with like a group bigger than 10 or something
[01:30:40] <Starthunder> Fuck that.
[01:30:51] <Starthunder> The only thing I should have to pay for is the uplink.
[01:30:54] <Starthunder> And maybe not even that.
[01:30:55] <Blackjack> k
[01:31:22] <Blackjack> I shouldn't have to pay to go to the movies
[01:31:44] <Blackjack> Not like they need to hire staff or pay film companies or pay to lease the building or anything
[01:50:24] <Starthunder> No lease costs in this context, and all the devs are volunteers. It's called FOSS.
[01:52:51] <Kinsley> Those devs still deserve to paid. Or, at least, the projects need to be funded to point where a core group can sustain them.

[05:19:32] <Fallfeathers> how come everyone sucks at teaching programming
[05:22:37] <JustAberrant> honestly? I think it's pretty hard to teach programming at all
[05:22:57] <JustAberrant> I mean you can explain design concepts and talk about commonly used solutions
[05:23:13] <JustAberrant> but the core of it is something I think people just need to figure out themselves
[05:23:28] <Brolf_pog> yes ^
[05:23:58] <Brolf_pog> also, teaching programming isn't really easy when you consider there are so many programming languages for programming itself
[05:24:12] <Brolf_pog> but then a lot of people use programs for developing or programming
[05:24:55] <Brolf_pog> Regardless, it's a constant learning experience, so all that can really be taught is the basic concepts and similarities.
[05:27:43] <JustAberrant> interestingly enough, I feel like more advanced topics are far easier to teach someone
[05:27:54] <Brolf_pog> ^
[05:27:57] <Brolf_pog> because thats...
[05:27:58] <Brolf_pog> well..
[05:28:02] <Brolf_pog> the similarities... lol
[05:28:07] <JustAberrant> it's the, for lack of a better word, programmer mindset that is impossible to teach
[05:28:17] <JustAberrant> once someone has that, it's just adding tools to their toolset
[05:28:28] <JustAberrant> but until they have that, they just arn't gonna get it
[05:28:39] <Starthunder> Mmm.
[05:28:43] <Brolf_pog> I'm screwed in that department... i can't code when alone, i desire social interaction too much..
[05:28:56] <JustAberrant> :(
[05:29:19] * JustAberrant loves whiteboarding stuff out in small groups
[05:29:28] <Brolf_pog> i do like that XD
[05:29:29] <JustAberrant> I love the whole design process
[05:29:40] <JustAberrant> but once it's time to implement, I'm a big believer in one person one task ;p
[05:30:19] <Starthunder> I've never really worked in a group before
[05:30:22] <Brolf_pog> i can't stand programming alone though. idk why
[05:30:59] <JustAberrant> also I feel like it's important to avoid the pitfalls of design by committee
[05:31:49] * Starthunder puts up a sign reading /camel-free zone/
[05:31:59] <JustAberrant> :(
[05:32:00] <PinkiePieBot> Aww, don't be sad, JustAberrant, I'm here!
[05:32:13] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: also, you should ;p
[05:32:15] <Brolf_pog> what exactly are pitfalls of design anyhow?
[05:32:25] <Starthunder> Of /committee/ design.
[05:32:43] <Starthunder> There's the toolshed effect, for starters.
[05:32:48] <JustAberrant> Brolf_pog: if you get a bunch of people together but lack a strong overall plan or vision
[05:32:50] <Starthunder> Or was it called the bikeshed effect?
[05:32:57] <JustAberrant> Brolf_pog: things tend to spiral wildly out of control
[05:33:23] <Starthunder> I should, yes. :P
[05:33:30] <Brolf_pog> you mean...
[05:33:31] <Starthunder> I don't even understand how multiple people would work on the same file at once
[05:33:42] <Brolf_pog> not having a final/main plan?
[05:34:00] <JustAberrant> well, if you had a final/main plan, you wouldn't need to have a committee ;p
[05:34:14] <Brolf_pog> hey HEY! no need to be a smartass XD
[05:34:25] <JustAberrant> but you need someone to take ownership and you need to have a clear idea of what you actually want to get out of it
[05:34:36] <JustAberrant> and that somebody needs to keep everyone in check
[05:35:09] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: typically they don't, it's usually best to avoid people working on the _exact_ same areas of code
[05:35:31] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: but when they do, everyone works on their own version of the code and it all gets merged together
[05:36:09] <Brolf_pog> programming with others isn't hard
[05:36:25] <JustAberrant> well, from a technical standpoint anyway ;p
[05:36:25] <Brolf_pog> but really... most people like programming by themselves
[05:37:13] * JustAberrant would agree with that ;p
[05:37:29] <Brolf_pog> annoys me lol
[05:38:12] <JustAberrant> well, there are arguments for pair programming, but I've always thought it was BS ;p
[05:38:24] *** Quits: Crimson_Tail (ChaoticRift@Pony-gfi1ih.7h3b.037j.000a.2601.IP) (Quit: Oops, a kernel panic)
[05:38:29] <JustAberrant> two people working on different things is going to be more efficient then two people working on the same thing
[05:38:47] <Brolf_pog> not entirely either though
[05:38:52] <Brolf_pog> *coughs*
[05:38:55] <JustAberrant> unless they are very green and lack basic technical skill
[05:38:55] <Brolf_pog> let me try that again..
[05:39:02] <Starthunder> Oh, yeah. If they don't touch the same pieces of code, it's trivial to merge changes.
[05:39:06] *** ThunderBolt|sleeping is now known as ThunderBolt
[05:39:08] <JustAberrant> or it's a technically tricky thing
[05:39:28] <Brolf_pog> not entirely true either though. Certain thought processes that make coding easier are easier to achieve with two people
[05:39:47] <JustAberrant> but I think even on a complex project, the vast majority of code is pretty straight forward
[05:39:53] <JustAberrant> the design is where most of the thinking happens imo
[05:39:56] <Brolf_pog> that's true
[05:41:01] * JustAberrant has a negative view of pair programming because we tried it where I work for a short period of time
[05:41:09] <JustAberrant> it was imo an epic failure
[05:41:19] <Brolf_pog> heh lol
[05:41:52] <Brolf_pog> i could see that being a problem if people aren't used to it.
[05:42:28] <JustAberrant> if you had two people of about the same skill level, one coded while the other tried not to fall asleep
[05:42:59] <JustAberrant> otherwise you had one person being slowed down, or at least not helped, by the other
[05:43:37] <JustAberrant> or one person probably internally facepalming as their partner took 3 times as long to do what they would have already finished
[05:44:04] <Brolf_pog> yea, that plagues pair programming a lot
[05:44:37] <JustAberrant> either way, it didn't last :>
[05:45:13] <JustAberrant> it feels like it would work better in shops where they do a lot more "coding from the hip"
[05:45:36] <JustAberrant> we do a lot of up front design.. so the coding part isn't a lot of problem solving, which would benefit from more people
[05:45:50] <Brolf_pog> from the hip o.0?
[05:46:22] <JustAberrant> diving into something without much of a design
[05:46:29] <Brolf_pog> oh
[05:46:48] <Brolf_pog> that would be a spot where it would work the most
[05:47:18] <JustAberrant> "hmm, we're making a pony organizer, well I guess we'll need a pony class.. I'll start coding that.. it should have a method for writing itself to the database"
[05:47:41] <JustAberrant> "oh but wait, wern't we gonna have a persistence class somewhere that would handle that"
[05:47:47] <JustAberrant> "hmm, good point maybe we should..."
[05:47:51] <JustAberrant> vs
[05:47:56] <Starthunder> That sounds like how I code X.X
[05:48:07] <JustAberrant> "ok, lets implement this part of the spec"
[05:50:24] <Brolf_pog> whelp i'm enjoying my night
[05:50:30] <JustAberrant> Starthunder: it's not that uncommon ;p
[05:50:37] <Brolf_pog> i have a paper to write on infosteward ship
[05:50:52] <Brolf_pog> I ahve nothing i even want to research or write on...
[05:50:53] <JustAberrant> I see
[05:52:03] <JustAberrant> it's not necessarily invalid either, there's a pretty good argument for prototyping like that
[05:52:34] <JustAberrant> it can be useful in the design process to just code a rough version of something, especially of something that's tricky or not well understood
[05:52:49] <JustAberrant> and then take when you learn from that and apply it to the actual design
[05:52:53] <JustAberrant> then re-implement 
[05:53:00] <Brolf_pog> or sometimes getting a program to do something in the first place helps
[05:53:08] <Brolf_pog> thinking err..
[05:53:10] <Brolf_pog> logically...
[05:53:12] <Brolf_pog> isn't easy
[05:53:26] <Brolf_pog> logically is such a stupid way to describe it..
[05:53:45] * JustAberrant likes to do that for anything that interface with something else (hardware, some third party interface, whatever)
[05:54:03] <JustAberrant> because at least.. all .. the time the spec isn't 100% accurate
[05:54:16] <Brolf_pog> not to mention, sometimes what you have to work with
[05:54:19] <Brolf_pog> just doesn't work with you
[05:54:32] <Brolf_pog> like JustAberrant mentioned, hardware.
[05:54:43] <Brolf_pog> ... i'm getting tired...
[05:54:50] <Brolf_pog> not to mention, sometimes what you have to work with something
[05:54:53] <JustAberrant> and it's best to find out that you need to do some random thing or can't use an itnerface in the way you want or won't get data in the way you want before you invest a lot of time in design
[05:55:19] <JustAberrant> so throwing together a quick thing to talk to the device and handle the main use cases is worth it, even if you throw the code out imo
[05:56:09] <Brolf_pog> usually throws the code out >.<
[05:56:39] <JustAberrant> also means you can get on subcontractors and vendors asses earlier, which means you might actually get a patch before the project has been in use for 3 years :>
[05:57:46] <JustAberrant> but usually doesn't help, because you still need to roll with it, and they'll probably give you something after you've implemented a stable workaround to cover your ass
[05:57:52] * JustAberrant not venting or anything :D
[05:58:02] <Brolf_pog> oh no
[05:58:11] <Brolf_pog> i know that dilemma
[05:58:17] <Brolf_pog> it isn't just isolated in programming
[05:58:18] <Brolf_pog> just...
[05:58:24] <Brolf_pog> so... MUCH MORE ANNOYING
[05:58:29] <JustAberrant> hehe
[05:58:46] <Brolf_pog> it's one thing when you do /work/ arounds
[05:58:48] <JustAberrant> so many permahacks
[05:59:11] <Brolf_pog> it's another when you sit there for hours to days thinking on how to work around it, try to work around it, work around it, and the work around screws other things
[06:00:24] <JustAberrant> also I should bed :(
[06:00:42] * Brolf_pog grabs JustAberrant and carries him to bed, and tucks him in

[13:17:59] <PinkiePieBot> [ Digital driver's licences promised for NSW if Mike Baird's government is re-elected ]
[13:18:01] <Googie> Sounds like a horrible idea really.
[13:22:19] <Googie> In other news, driving without a charged phone is now a criminal offense :V
[13:29:03] <ThunderBolt> now i know where John Citizen lives 
[13:29:09] <Shival|Away> fake id becomes 1000 times easier due to screenshots
[13:29:10] <ThunderBolt> hehehe >:3
[13:29:29] <ThunderBolt> so day i was in subway, getting some lunch, this girl walks in i look at her and just ignore her, i see she stars looking at me, and she says "Jayden?, is that you?", so i look up at her again and it turns out its some chick i met on tinder, she just happened to walk into the subway i was at, at that exact moment, I reply "sorry do i know you?" he replys ,"yeah its Lilly From Tinder, just check your phone", i dont check my phone be because i remember 
[13:29:43] <ThunderBolt> starts*
[13:30:06] <ThunderBolt> "I'm Sorry there is somewhere i need to be" though there actually wasn't i just wanted to get away from this bitch since she seemed desperate for a Boyfriend, Im walking to my car when she runs up and asks me, Can i have your number i Like you and want to hag out some time, i say i'll send you it over tinder, i'm in a rush to be somewhere, she says Alright, I'm still deciding if i should send her my number
[13:32:21] <Googie> Shival|Away: It's worse, they'll probably physically have to take your phone and check :/
[13:33:34] <ThunderBolt>  Googie, Officer " Why are you on your phone while driving" You "sorry i was looking at my drivers liceanse" Officer "oh, ok drive safe" ( officer walks away)
[13:34:45] <ThunderBolt> alo my shitty spelling
[13:34:49] <ThunderBolt> is shitty
[13:53:32] <Shival|Away> im more thinking when buying alchocol noone will know how to properly validate the id
[13:54:20] <ThunderBolt> maybe we should have barcodes on our arm 
[13:54:34] <ThunderBolt> or something
[13:56:12] <Kinsley> I don't think that digital photo IDs in phones or other devices will replace physical copies, especially for a lot of tasks.
[13:57:09] <Kinsley> Not without some serious considerations for validation procedures.
[13:58:02] <ThunderBolt> tony abbott is a faggot
[13:58:15] <Shival|Away> which given our current brsindead govetment who decided that high sppeed broadband and a new network was unnessiary
[13:58:20] <ThunderBolt> who was born from a maggot
[13:58:38] <Kinsley> Something like an app that integrates a challenge-response system. Law enforcement officer asks you to enter a numeric code into the app, for instance, app generates a passphrase to repeat back.
[13:58:45] <Shival|Away> instead deciding to reuse like 40 year old copper
[13:59:20] <Shival|Away> shame that wouldnt wprk for anywhere else that needs a proof of id
[14:00:01] <Kinsley> Given that every liquor store and gas station gas has big old machines for lotto tickets?
[14:00:03] <Googie> Also the aforementioned "My phone's battery is dead"
[14:00:06] <Shival|Away> the system is a stupid joke. and waste of money like soo much doneby this shit government
[14:00:26] <Kinsley> Pretty easy to piggy back something into a system that interfaces with the state's information systems.
[14:01:30] *** Quits: LegionRed (LegionRed@The.DragonHorse.DraconisEquus) (Quit: The most Metal thing never.)
[14:01:37] <Shival|Away> not really given they couldnt even get publix transport systems to verify people properly
[14:01:53] <Kinsley> Alternately, go with something completely different, like displaying the ID on screen but you need to use NFC to pass real data to a reader that verifies it.
[14:02:00] <Googie> Hehehe, yeah. Every time I hear something about "Easy" "System" and "Government"...
[14:02:51] <Shival|Away> you may as well be csrrying around a passport at that point
[14:03:12] <Kinsley> I could, actually. I have the card and the book.
[14:03:24] <Shival|Away> me to
[14:03:33] <Shival|Away> ive used it once
[14:03:35] <Shival|Away> lol
[14:03:58] <Kinsley> I don't think I've used my US passport to actually travel internationally.
[14:04:18] <Shival|Away> took the government 4 months to verify my id when i got my passport
[14:04:20] <Kinsley> I've used it as ID when I replaced my driver's license and didn't trust the temp as ID when bar hopping.
[14:04:34] <Shival|Away> they rejected my origional birth certificste
[14:04:46] <Shival|Away> so i needed to get a reprint ehich they accepted
[14:05:33] <Kinsley> Took the State Department like, a month to get us our passports. Granted, we had literally just spent the last six months prior going through the naturalization process which involved a ton of background checks and shit.
[14:11:38] <Googie> Also TPG buying iiNet here. That doesn't really bode well long-term for Australian internet :/

[19:21:06] <Blackjack> In C, is it safe to cast one struct to another that is exactly the same as the first except the members are named differently?
[19:21:38] <Webster> Yes. But it's not a good practice.
[19:21:49] <Blackjack> Why is it not?
[19:22:05] <Webster> If one changes, it can cause problems.
[19:22:27] <Webster> If you're in complete control of the code of both, it's not the worst. Could make a struct that both contain.
[19:22:37] <Blackjack> I'm mostly upset at WinAPI prefixing its structs' members with stupid stuff like dw for a dword and str for a string
[19:22:37] <Webster> Then if one changes you'll get compile errors right away.

[20:29:20] <wolfyshy> which *almost* no API these days will accept
[20:37:59] <Blackjack> wolfyshy: I've seen str
[20:38:17] <Blackjack> I've also seen uc for unsigned char which is usually a string
[20:40:35] <wolfyshy> all I remember is n = int, ch = char, sz = string/LPTSTR, ul = unsigned long, l = long, and w = WORD
[20:40:58] <wolfyshy> where WORD can be anything depending on what version of the SDK, what version of windows, and what type of CPU is in play
