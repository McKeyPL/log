[03:19:37] <thaostra> Squirrelly, I'm willing to put my money where my mouth, because I have lots of experience with cooking steak and other assortments of meat. They didn't appoint me the family grillmaster for nothing
[03:21:48] * Vulpixbrew can cook a mean steak now
[03:21:59] <thaostra> My preferred cut of beef is the flat iron steak, as it's not expensive compared to a filet mignon, yet just as tender and flavorful
[03:23:27] <Michael> my steak cooking is about 4/10
[03:25:08] <thaostra> 9 out of 10 times I prefer my own cooking compared to whatever restaurants will serve. Usually they'll go overboard with rubs and marinades, but they can't compete with a well-seasoned cut that's been colored to perfection and basted in its own gravy
[03:28:18] <thaostra> Squirrelly, I can also do a wine or beer pairing. I find that a decantered carbernet or scotch ale go excellently with tender steak

[07:49:08] <Skieser> The smoothness is nice... But the soreness definitely isn't
[07:49:42] <Skieser> Plus it was done by like 3 students at once, and one of them accidentally caused some skin lifting on the bikini line...
[07:49:49] <Skieser> Ouchies >.<
[07:50:08] <cloppyhooves> D:
[07:51:03] <Vulpixbrew> ouch
[07:51:48] <Skieser> It was quite an experience though... Can't say that I've ever had 3 girls basically fondling me at once before xD
[07:52:04] <Skieser> Plus another was doing my eyebrows at the same time
[07:52:09] <Skieser> I've never felt like such a labrat x3
[07:52:25] <cloppyhooves> Being a labrat sounds hot :3
[07:52:29] <cloppyhooves> But I have a thing for medical play

[07:57:17] <Squirrelly> Oh god...

[07:57:59] * Vulpixbrew just had a sudden clop fic idea
[07:58:12] <Squirrelly> ?
[07:58:19] <Skieser> Well... I just got this money, and I've had my eye on a Chance the Stallion for like... 2 years
[07:58:30] <Vulpixbrew> do it
[07:58:38] <Skieser> And even though there are quite a few things I should be spending that money on, Chance is on sale for 15% off
[07:58:51] <Squirrelly> I'm so happy
[07:58:51] <Skieser> You think? xD
[07:58:56] <Vulpixbrew> twilight goes to the mirror pool and clones herself
[07:58:56] <Squirrelly> My birthday is in a month
[07:59:38] <Vulpixbrew> and takes the clone into the library for experments
[07:59:51] <thaostra> Squirrelly, Who's your favorite pony?
[07:59:57] <Vulpixbrew> and of course when i say that Iman she ends up having sex with it
[08:00:00] <Squirrelly> Probably Twilight
[08:00:07] <Squirrelly> And vulpixbrew
[08:00:11] <Squirrelly> That is my fantasy
[08:00:19] <Squirrelly> Except I want to be the one being experimented on
[08:00:42] <Skieser> Then perhaps your equestian life would start as a Twily clone
[08:00:48] <thaostra> It'll be harder for me to send Vulpixbrew
[08:00:51] <Skieser> And she would be performing sexual function experiments
[08:01:05] <Squirrelly> rofl
[08:01:14] <Skieser> Prodding intimate areas with various objects... All under the sterile white environment of the Ponyville medical centre
[08:01:22] <Squirrelly> Mmmmnnnnnf
[08:01:25] <Squirrelly> That sounds nice
[08:02:09] <Vulpixbrew> I wonder what would happen if someone cummed in the mirror pool
[08:02:13] <Skieser> If you don't mind me asking, is your OC male or female?
[08:03:00] <Vulpixbrew> my oc is male
[08:03:04] <thaostra> Squirrelly, I got a Twili plush but she just collects dust, so I think I could give her to someone else

[13:57:24] <BaronBacon> oh shit man
[13:57:45] <BaronBacon> :/
[13:58:13] <thaostra> They took his license away, assaulted him, impounded his truck, and put him in jail before he got bailed by my grandparents late at night
[13:58:34] <BaronBacon> assaulted him?
[13:59:30] <thaostra> There are a few possibilities of what happened, but what I've been told is that he had $300 on his person and when he refused to give it to him they ganged up on him
[13:59:51] <thaostra> There were no cameras, so it's his word against their's
[14:00:07] <thaostra> *give it to them
[14:00:32] <BaronBacon> thats pretty messed up man
[14:01:38] <thaostra> He's very likely to lose his job because he needs his license to drive equipment
[14:02:07] <BaronBacon> do you know how long he has lost it for?
[14:03:02] <thaostra> No idea, but I know that he faced years of struggling the first time he lost his license

[14:06:33] <thaostra> I don't know if I'd say we're close; lately we've been isolated, although that's been on him because he's been more of jerk than usual
[14:07:42] <BaronBacon> i'm real sorry to hear this :{
[14:09:22] <thaostra> I don't really feel sorry for him, as it's his responsibility to not get so drunk that he'd try to drive himself *to another bar*. Honestly, I'm more worried about his giflfriend because no one knows where she is
