[00:43:22] <Viewing_Glass> So, I had a nickname grouped to my account that I can no longer use. Is there any way I can get it back?
[00:44:57] <Dusk> Other than talk to the person who has it now
[00:45:30] <Viewing_Glass> Ah. I tried using WHOIS and WHOWAS to find out who has it, but it returned with nothing.
[00:45:42] <Dusk> Are you sure it's not just locked?
[00:45:54] <Dusk> Like someone tried to identify as that nick too many times?
[00:46:30] <Dusk> if so try /ns release thenickinquestion yourpassword
[00:47:32] <Viewing_Glass> Ah! It was locked. Thanks!

[09:38:22] <Fluttershi> what's the command for making chanserv give someone op again?
[09:40:45] <Dusk> I use the flags to do it more than XOP lists so:
[09:41:01] <Dusk> /cs flags #channel user +AOehiortv 
[09:41:16] *** Q0 is now known as Q0|Away
[09:41:54] <Fluttershi> AOehiotv, what all is that giving? isn't A for admin or something?
[09:41:59] <Dusk> No
[09:42:05] <Dusk> +a is admin
[09:43:02] <Dusk> A gives access to flag listings of users in the channel, O auto ops users, h gives access to chanservs halfop command, o gives access to chanservs op command
[09:43:21] <Dusk> Those are the flags given in the xop list for AOP
[09:43:26] <Dusk> So I gave that to you
[09:43:39] <Dusk> if you want them to just have op then add +Oo
[09:43:49] <Seoson> Fluttershi: Check http://wiki.foonetic.net/wiki/ChanServ_Commands#Roles for a detailed list of commands and flags for users/roles
[09:44:09] <Dusk> Yea there you go. I'm too tired to pull all of that out of my head 
[09:44:23] *** Sleepykitty is now known as Unixkitty
[09:44:46] <Unixkitty> Or you could simply do /cs flags #channel nickname AOP
[09:44:58] <Unixkitty> And not particularly worry about what each flag does.
[09:45:43] <Seoson> Keep in mind /cs is no standard. I always go the official way ;-)
[09:45:44] <Dusk> I think the main concern was that they thought A was admin
[09:46:12] <Dusk> that's fine Seoson, it works in most cases so it's what I use
[09:52:04] <Googie> /cs help
[09:52:14] <Googie> And /cs help flags

[12:11:12] <Googie> That's the issue, yeah
[12:11:31] <Googie> It's a contrib module which hasn't been updated to know how to mute on Insp.
[12:15:25] <AppleDash> I should look into fixing that
