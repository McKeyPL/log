[01:23:15] <Starthunder> Okay, let's try this again.
[01:24:26] <Starthunder> Nnnnope, getting the same thing. Anypony have any idea what that's about?
[01:25:38] * Starthunder also pokes AppleDash
[01:25:45] <AppleDash> Yes Starthunder?
[01:25:58] <AppleDash> That's expected behaviour.
[01:26:15] <AppleDash> It means it can't boot over the network... And since you're trying to do a USB boot, you don't want to boot over the network.
[01:26:22] <Starthunder> Right.
[01:26:25] <AppleDash> Make sure the USB drive is somewhere in the boot order in the BIOS.
[01:26:28] <Starthunder> It is?
[01:26:34] * Starthunder pulls up setup again
[01:26:41] <AppleDash> Then there should be no problem. Plug in the drive and pres the power button.
[01:27:47] <Starthunder> That's what I did.
[01:27:56] * Starthunder pokes around in setup.
[01:28:00] <AppleDash> And what's the issue then?
[01:28:08] <AppleDash> You'll get that error either way, it's not an issue
[01:28:27] <Starthunder> It seems to stop at the error.
[01:29:15] <AppleDash> Is there any more output?
[01:31:06] <Starthunder> Yeah, but it seems to be just copyright headings and such. I'll gist it in a sec if you want.
[01:31:11] <AppleDash> Sure
[01:31:12] <Starthunder> I don't see the USB as an option in the boot order.
[01:31:21] <AppleDash> What options are in the boot order?

[01:32:28] <Starthunder> That's it.
[01:33:00] <AppleDash> Is the USB drive plugged into a valid USB port? Does it have a good image on it? Can you boot other machines from it? How did you make the USB drive?
[01:33:07] <Starthunder> Oh, the USB shows up in the HDD order, though

[06:58:41] <Starthunder> :P
[06:59:00] <JustAberrant> isn't that pretty much exactly what dnsmasq is for?
[06:59:09] <JustAberrant> i.e. being a dns server without actually being a dns server
[06:59:23] <Starthunder> that's /DHCP/ * server
[06:59:26] <JustAberrant> and just forwarding requests on to an actual dns server if it's not in it's magical list

[08:05:02] <Phase4> or static addresses
[08:05:35] <Starthunder> I dunno about static. Attempts to join the network with a reserved address should be rejected

[08:07:53] <Starthunder> Yeah, but I wanna see that little `prefixlen 56` :c
[08:10:22] <Phase4> Starthunder, have to use dhcpv6 for that, not sure why dnsmasq wouldn't support it
[08:10:48] <Starthunder> Phase4: you just said Linux complains if it gets a router advertisement with anything other than a /64
[08:11:03] <Phase4> router advertisment != dhcpv6
[08:11:32] <Phase4> ra's are the stateless method, where routers broadcast the prefixes available on the link
[08:13:40] <Starthunder> ahh
[08:14:41] <Starthunder> > The mimimum size of the prefix length is 64.
[08:15:08] <Starthunder> Am I reading that right?
[08:17:29] <Phase4> not sure what context you're reading it in
[08:18:07] <Phase4> i've not done a lot of ipv6 work, but i am fairly sure dhcpv6 handles arbitrary prefix sizes
[08:18:21] <Starthunder> From the dnsmasq ponypage.
[08:18:39] <Starthunder> > For IPv6, the parameters are slightly different: instead of netmask and broadcast address, there is an optional prefix length which must be equal to or larger then the prefix length on the local interface. If not given, this defaults to 64. Unlike the IPv4 case, the prefix length is not automatically derived from the interface configuration. The mimimum size of the prefix length is 64.
[08:19:38] <Phase4> strange

[22:03:53] <Gigabit> Can I use two stereo speakers on my PC? And if so what would I need to do to make it work right.
[22:04:54] <JustAberrant> ?
[22:05:15] <JustAberrant> depends on what exactly you want to do with them
[22:05:30] <Gigabit> I have two speakers from an old table unit stereo unit. Want to set them up in the room but connected to my pc
[22:05:43] <JustAberrant> you can have several sound cards/devices connected to a PC
[22:05:44] <Gigabit> Want go use one of the audio ports in the rear of my pc
[22:05:52] <Gigabit> To*
[22:06:02] <Gigabit> So I guess what kind of cable would I beed
[22:06:04] <Gigabit> Need*
[22:06:33] <JustAberrant> do you want to be able to send stuff to them independently?
[22:06:46] <Gigabit> Nah
[22:07:05] <JustAberrant> you can just simply split them, but you'll get potato audio quality
[22:07:07] <Gigabit> Just want both to transmit the audio out
[22:07:39] <Gigabit> Well I'm currently using USB powered small speakers. Sound is not the best from those either 
[22:08:06] <JustAberrant> is it just powered via usb, or is it it's own audio device?
[22:08:24] <Gigabit> Powered via usb
[22:08:46] <Gigabit> And these other speakers are sitting here unused.
[22:08:49] *** Joins: Nelly (BlackCat@Anonlight.Starsarebeautiful)
[22:08:58] <Gigabit> So I figured if I could set them up in the room, why not
[22:09:10] <JustAberrant> are they about the same impedance? 
[22:09:19] <Gigabit> Not sure go be honest
[22:09:25] <JustAberrant> or can you control the level on them individually at least?
[22:09:34] <Gigabit> The markings on these small ones I am using now, have all but faded off
[22:09:40] <Gigabit> Nope I cant
[22:09:59] <AppleDash> You would most likely need an amplifier
[22:10:15] <Gigabit> Damn.. Wanted to just do some splicing of cords
[22:10:27] <AppleDash> It would probably be very quiet
[22:10:29] <JustAberrant> depends on how much impedance the speakers have and how much output your output has
[22:10:45] <JustAberrant> but yeah, you're basically taking a signal meant for one speaker and making it drive 2
[22:10:51] <Gigabit> Well I guess I could see about going to the resale shop and looking for an amp
[22:11:02] <JustAberrant> meh
[22:11:13] <JustAberrant> if they are shit speakers, just get a cheap $20 usb audio device
[22:11:38] <Gigabit> Not sure how good these old ones are. They haven't been used in 5 years or more
[22:11:46] <Gigabit> Been in a dry storage.
[22:11:56] <JustAberrant> driving two different speakers from the same output is gonna be shit regardless
[22:12:00] <AppleDash> JustAberrant, to me you seem like the type of person to use a 500$ DAC
[22:12:01] <JustAberrant> unless you get like a proper mixer/amp setup

[22:12:36] <JustAberrant> I do have 3 sound cards though :>
[22:12:42] <JustAberrant> well, not cards
[22:12:52] <Gigabit> Well I have 7.1 audio on my mobo.. I have 5 more audio ports I can use. Orange, black, and etc.
[22:13:08] <Gigabit> Couldn't I use one speaker per port?
[22:13:11] <JustAberrant> but yeah.. I have a tascam us-100 (cheap but effective guitar in), usual shitty onboard sound, and a decent sound card
[22:13:30] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: sure, but you'll need something like jackd to make that actually work sanely
[22:13:40] <AppleDash> I've never owned a sound card :(
[22:13:45] <AppleDash> Other than my internal ones :P
[22:14:02] <Gigabit> Okay so then would a simple aux cord work then?
[22:14:04] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: unless you actually want them to act as front/side/back/sub speakers
[22:14:34] <JustAberrant> Gigabit: I dunno, depends on what the speakers input is
[22:14:53] <Gigabit> Wish I had the money for a 2.1 sound system..found a nice altec Lansing one at walmart
[22:16:00] <Gigabit> Again not sure. No markings on the speakers
[22:16:19] <JustAberrant> it's usually gonna be pretty simple
[22:16:30] <Gigabit> Anyways ty for the info. I am not an audio guy at all x.x
[22:16:31] <JustAberrant> the individual speakers should have two terminals
[22:16:42] <JustAberrant> or two wires going into them
[22:16:44] <JustAberrant> or something
[22:17:15] <JustAberrant> the input into your pc will be a 3 part plug
[22:17:30] <Gigabit> Yep
[22:17:56] <JustAberrant> a so called "balanced" connector ;p
[22:18:05] <JustAberrant> so basically the two speakers will share a common ground
[22:18:17] <Gigabit> Don't head units usually send power to speakers too?

[22:19:05] <JustAberrant> not that I know ;p
[22:20:13] <JustAberrant> but yeah, if you look at the connector, you have the tip, middle bit, and the lst bit
[22:20:19] <JustAberrant> * last
[22:20:21] <JustAberrant> the last bit is the ground
[22:20:27] <JustAberrant> the ground from both speakers get hooked to that
[22:20:46] <JustAberrant> and I can't remember which way it is, but say the top is right and the middle bit is left
[22:21:29] *** Joins: locodashie11 (locodash11@Pony-q7h.1no.217.73.IP)
[22:21:30] <JustAberrant> so the remaining wire from your left speaker goes to the middle bit, and the remaining wire from your right speaker goes to the tip
[22:22:06] <Gigabit> Confused me but okay
[22:22:43] <JustAberrant> ok, well lets start at the basics..
[22:22:49] <JustAberrant> what actually comes out of your speakers?
[22:23:06] <JustAberrant> like.. is there a wire coming out of it with a connector (and if so, what type) or is it terminals or something else?
[22:23:22] <JustAberrant> and do the speakers share the same wire, or are they separate ?

[22:57:29] <JustAberrant> also cache's are buggy as hell :>
[22:58:05] <AppleDash> Don't put a cache in a cache
[22:58:16] <AppleDash> It permanently corrupts the outer cache and you can't put anything else in it ever
[22:58:35] <AppleDash> It stays at 0/10000 cache when you hover over it and you can't get it empty again and trying to put something else in it doesn't work
