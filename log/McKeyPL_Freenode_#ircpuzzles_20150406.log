[05:02:10] <Klaghills> eh
[05:02:59] <walle303> fwilson, what happend
[05:03:18] <fwilson> walle303: some fun in #antispammeta
[05:03:30] <fwilson> he nickspammed and was also an open proxy, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[05:03:36] <walle303> oh
[05:04:12] <walle303> fwilson, what do that do in #antispammeta
[05:04:16] <walle303> do they*
[05:04:20] <walle303> do they announce spammers?
[05:04:26] <fwilson> sometimes
[05:05:28] <walle303> fwilson, what do they do
[05:05:45] <fwilson> announce events of interest to channel ops
[05:05:48] <bcode> they look sternly at people who ask too many questions
[05:05:53] <fwilson> ^ that too
[05:05:54] <walle303> ah
[05:05:56] <bcode> does that suffice ^_^
[05:06:01] * fwilson looks sternly at walle303
[05:06:03] <fwilson> :p
[05:06:10] <walle303> that might be useful
[05:06:16] <bcode> it's probably not particularly interesting to you tbh
[05:06:26] <walle303> im a channel owner [its +s but that NlackBigger guy somehow found it]
[05:07:37] <fwilson> it won't announce events about your channel unless it's large enough and you ask the bot admins to put it there
[05:08:11] <walle303> i know
[05:08:22] <bcode> ask? convince? bribe? the choice is yours.
[05:08:28] <walle303> but it will tell me of people i should keep an eye out for

[16:31:27] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o yano
[16:31:35] *** yano sets mode: -o yano
[16:32:35] <nyuszika7h> yano pls
[16:32:37] <nyuszika7h> 15:54:12 -- irc: disconnected from server
[16:32:38] <nyuszika7h> 15:57:57 -- #ircpuzzles-recruiting: Cannot join channel (+i) - you must be invited
[16:33:03] <nyuszika7h> why is it +p anyway?
[16:33:14] <mooo> means you can't /knock I Think
[16:33:19] <ser_berry> unless everyone is opped there the knock would never be delivered to anyone
[16:33:19] <nyuszika7h> yes
[16:33:23] <nyuszika7h> yano is opped
[16:33:25] <nyuszika7h> or was last time I checked
[16:33:29] <ser_berry> a ha
[16:33:32] <mooo> oh, it still sends it to the ops?
[16:33:38] <ser_berry> it only sends to ops
[16:33:49] <mooo> seems not as useful then lol
[16:33:52] <nyuszika7h> and +p doesn't allow /knock at all
[16:34:04] <mooo> oh
[16:34:13] <nyuszika7h> mooo: well RFC 1459 wasn't designed with freenode's philosophy in mind
[16:34:18] <nyuszika7h> originally ops were always opped on IRC
[16:34:19] <mooo> so withotu +p it is only delivered to ops
[16:34:29] <nyuszika7h> KNOCK is a legacy thing really
[16:34:29] <mooo> and with +p it is delivered to noone
[16:34:36] <knivey> the fuk
[16:34:41] <mooo> yeah ... you can just pm an op asking to get in :P
[16:34:48] <knivey> i thought +p was private while +s was secret
[16:35:07] <mooo> I think it is, they do a lot of the same things or something though
[16:35:07] <nyuszika7h> yes, "private" means disable /knock
[16:35:14] <nyuszika7h> it also does some other things that +s also does, though
[16:35:15] <nyuszika7h> I think
[16:35:23] <mooo> I think he set +p because of something I said
[16:35:25] <knivey> hide it from inquiries
[16:35:27] <nyuszika7h> this is for charybdis / ircd-seven
[16:35:28] <mooo> I can't remember what though :P
[16:35:34] <knivey> +s just hides from whois
[16:35:35] <xnr> also on some networks you can really piss off the opers by doing /knock
[16:35:38] <nyuszika7h> I checked what +p does a few days ago, I don't remember
[16:35:48] <nyuszika7h> but +p doesn't provide any more privacy over +s
[16:35:50] <nyuszika7h> except disabling /knock
[16:35:55] <knivey> what is knock
[16:35:56] <knivey> lol
[16:36:01] <nyuszika7h> request invite to +i channel
[16:36:15] <nyuszika7h> the ircd sends some numeric to people who are opped in the channel
[16:36:26] <knivey> i think p hides things like /mode and /topic and /list
[16:36:30] <knivey> while s doesn't
[16:36:32] <nyuszika7h> nope, that's +s
[16:36:44] <knivey> s just hides it from a whois
[16:36:51] <yano> nyuszika7h: there
[16:36:54] <nyuszika7h> not on charybdis / ircd-seven at least, no
[16:37:03] <nyuszika7h> you may be thinking of other ircds
[16:37:10] <nyuszika7h> but I'm gonna check the code
[16:37:11] <nyuszika7h> yano: thanks
[16:37:22] <ser_berry> you could verify by looking at /quote help cmode
[16:37:22] <mooo> I also wonder what -recruiting is :P
[16:37:27] <knivey> i guess it could be different
[16:37:27] <yano> but yea, channels that are +i that aren't +p can become quickly annoying
[16:37:40] <nyuszika7h> well if people abuse it, yeah
[16:37:46] <nyuszika7h> but people could also just PM spam >_>
[16:37:50] <mooo> most people don't even know what /knock is to make it annoying
[16:37:50] <mooo> lol
[16:37:50] <nyuszika7h> at least /knock is rate-limited
[16:37:56] <yano> nyuszika7h: but they'd have to know who is in the channel
[16:38:03] <nyuszika7h> true
[16:38:05] <yano> i hate /knock
[16:38:06] <mooo> a lot of times it is obvious
[16:40:46] <knivey> ah yea nyuszika7h i was thinking of undernet modes
[16:40:54] <knivey> here +p is paranoid
[16:40:55] *** Joins: Sprocklem (~Sprocklem@unaffiliated/sprocklem)
[16:41:19] <knivey> When set, the KNOCK command cannot be used on the channel to request an invite, and users will not be shown the channel in whois replies unless they are on it. Unlike on some ircds, +p and +s can be set together. 
[16:45:50] <MinceR> freenode's "philosophy" assumes that services never goes down
[16:45:55] <MinceR> which is ludicrous
[16:46:34] <ser_berry> it doesn't go down too often though, and in a lot of high traffic channels people have bots with ops
[16:47:02] <ser_berry> in practice not keeping ops has never prevented me from using those abilities
[16:47:02] <yano> services don't go down frequently on freenode
[16:49:50] <mooo> I never used services to ban people until recently anyway, I worry more when my bots go down :P

[17:06:39] <Latin> yano: did you happen to post the answers?
[17:07:44] <mooo> a certain troll would be glad to give you all the answers :)
[17:08:43] <nyuszika7h> yano posted the answer to level 8 after the troll leaked i
[17:08:44] <nyuszika7h> t
[17:09:34] <mooo> probably that was a bad idea, maybe at the time it seemed like a good idea to do that :P
[17:09:40] <mooo> i'm on level 9 anyway
[17:09:48] <mooo> I tried a bit last night
[17:10:17] <nyuszika7h> mooo, do you want a small hint?
[17:10:29] <mooo> I was given like 3 hints last night :P
[17:10:46] <nyuszika7h> can you tell me what hints? (in PM)
[17:10:50] <nyuszika7h> or was it in the channel
[17:10:54] <mooo> and I think someone implied I was on the right track
[17:10:57] <mooo> it was in the channel
[17:10:59] <nyuszika7h> ah
[17:11:02] <nyuszika7h> I'll check it then
[17:11:49] <knivey> i quit after level 6
[17:12:05] <mooo> lol
[17:12:11] <knivey> lol
[17:12:16] <mooo> that's a good place to quit :)
[17:14:41] <nyuszika7h> mooo: you should have joined earlier! :P
[17:14:49] <nyuszika7h> they kinda gave it away in the channel, but still took me a while to realize some things
[17:14:54] <mooo> lol
[17:15:01] <mooo> was it given away to me also?
[17:15:04] <nyuszika7h> no
[17:15:04] <mooo> :P
[17:15:06] <mooo> ):
[17:15:07] <nyuszika7h> you joined later
[17:15:21] <mooo> but I was told I got all the hints revealed after the contest ended
[17:15:28] <mooo> maybe not all then :P
[17:15:32] <nyuszika7h> hmm, when did the contest end
[17:15:42] <mooo> when the answers were leaked?
[17:15:45] <nyuszika7h> idk
[17:15:46] <knivey> i was offline when the answers were leaked
[17:15:57] <knivey> missed the whole trolling
[17:16:00] <nyuszika7h> 2015-04-03 02:11:02 UTC
[17:16:28] <nyuszika7h> yes, it was after the leak
[17:17:14] <nyuszika7h> mooo: so do you want a hint or not :P
[17:17:29] <mooo> hmm, idk ...
[17:17:42] <mooo> if anything, just tell me if the thing I found is on the right track
[17:17:47] <nyuszika7h> what did you find?
[17:17:50] <mooo> and not the hints that just totally give it away
