[02:07:09] *** Joins: Shaico (Shaico@Pony-695.q16.71.50.IP)
[02:07:12] <StrykerVylon> There isnt a Mega Typhlosion.
[02:07:17] <StrykerVylon> At least not one im aware of.
[02:07:25] <Eywind> Exactly
[02:07:32] <StrykerVylon> Dont care.
[02:07:43] <Eywind> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:359Absol-Mega.png
[02:07:45] <StrykerVylon> Typhlo is my fave poke and has been for years.
[02:07:54] <Eywind> is a lot cooler
[02:08:21] <StrykerVylon> Mega Absol looks like he is trying to be a hipster punk.
[02:08:53] <StrykerVylon> Oh. Also add goth in there.
[02:09:00] <Eywind> ok
[02:09:19] * Eywind applies StrykerVylon to peanut butter and bread for a PB&J sandwich
[02:09:34] <StrykerVylon> That being said. At least it has a decent design. A lot better than Manectric anyway.

[02:11:26] <Eywind> no

[02:12:21] <StrykerVylon> Ew... Splicing Mega Slobro on Beyblade...
[02:12:37] <Eywind> next meme should be Rob using him
[02:12:58] <StrykerVylon> Also I never liked the Mega Sloburrito meme.
[02:13:06] <Eywind> don't care
[02:13:10] <Eywind> I just google imaged mega slowbro and got that

[02:13:45] <Hamtramck> Man okay
[02:13:51] <Hamtramck> Nostalgic highschool memory:
[02:14:09] <Hamtramck> Staying up all night playing tales of symphonia/reading seabiscuit for upcoming school year
[02:14:18] <Hamtramck> Sun's coming up outside, and I'm watching beybade on TV
[02:15:50] <thereallynewmop12100_> Eywind:  I doing a Super Nuzlocke EX  for Pokkemon Alpha Sapphire
[02:15:53] <thereallynewmop12100_> *Pokemon
[02:16:17] <Eywind> Hamtramck yeah man I remember staying up super late and playing games and stuff too haha, the good ol' days

[02:17:19] <Eywind> hahahaha
[02:17:27] <Hamtramck> It was less the playing games and... idk I didn't even lik beyblade, it was just ON. I liked staying up and watching the sunrise.
[02:17:31] <thereallynewmop12100_> My style of doing Nuzlockes. dodging trainers and different rules 
[02:17:39] <Eywind> what are the 'different rules'?
[02:17:40] <Hamtramck> I haven't done an all nighter in a long time
[02:19:53] <Eywind> Yeah me either, cuz I have responsibilities and things :/
[02:20:03] <Eywind> and I can't reset my sleep schedule as well anymore

[02:22:04] <Eywind> Oh
[02:22:08] <Eywind> No, you should release any that get KOed
[02:22:11] <Eywind> that's the point of Nuzlocke
[02:22:27] <Eywind> But you can do it however you want
[02:22:36] <thereallynewmop12100_> Super Nuzlocke EX. Yolo 
[02:22:40] <Eywind> But I don't get it

[23:49:16] <Cloud_Zephyr> haha
[23:49:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> my school is quite strict on technology. so if your seen with a laptop "a laptop :O this is madness"
