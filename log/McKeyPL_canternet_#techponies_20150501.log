[01:36:49] <Starthunder> Gigabit: best way to do that is get your webserver to listen on port 7787 and not 80
[01:37:22] <Gigabit> My webserver listens on a port other then 80
[01:37:24] <Starthunder> Keep in mind that this won't provide any actual security, only a bit of obscurity. Anyone who cares will be able to trivially find out that your webserver is running on 7787 by running a simple portscan.

[04:13:01] <cyborg_ar> haha
[04:13:25] <mniip> ok, let's try this
[04:16:21] <nscoots1> I dunno...
[04:16:30] <nscoots1> "what are you doing I'm not a DJ here at the office!"
[04:17:35] <cyborg_ar> my favourite verse is "can't use my dick to control my playlist"
[04:19:03] <cyborg_ar> also "you just rhymed up with up, you're really phoning this in. does mouse rhyme with mouse? NO IT'S THE SAME WORD"
[04:22:38] <mniip> hmm
[04:22:50] <mniip> I think I got canvas optimization to work
[04:23:03] <cyborg_ar> mniip: :D
[04:23:23] <cyborg_ar> what's that gif library for?
[04:23:24] <mniip> need to check with imagemagick
[04:23:37] <mniip> damn
[04:23:48] <mniip> imagemagick still comresses it down some ~1.7x
[04:24:00] <cyborg_ar> when did gif's patent expire, 2005?
[04:24:56] <cyborg_ar> 2004
[04:25:23] <mniip> cyborg_ar, not a gif library

[05:33:27] <JustAberrant> last word redundant ;p
[05:33:42] <Colgate> I have a single command, I want to read from a file until the file is empty, then I want to read from the keyboard
[05:33:51] <Colgate> how do? :/
[05:34:16] <Phase4> cat file -
[05:34:17] <mniip> cat file -
[05:34:21] <Phase4> mniip, /)
[05:34:41] <Colgate> wow, that is like... so incredibly simple I...

[05:34:44] * Colgate headdesks
[05:34:58] <JustAberrant> (cat file; cat)  ;p
[05:35:14] <JustAberrant> mine's more complicated.. so hah!
[05:35:45] <Colgate> hmm, actually, that doesn't seem to work
[05:36:02] <Colgate> I'm redirecting using "command < cat file -"
[05:36:08] <JustAberrant> use |
[05:36:16] <JustAberrant> for maximum pipe
[05:36:26] <Phase4> Colgate, that will try read a file named cat into command
[05:36:41] <Phase4> i'm not sure what it does with the trailing arguments
[05:36:58] <Colgate> er, I had `` around that
[05:37:11] <Colgate> which of course... hangs
[05:37:14] <Colgate> now that I think about it
[05:37:15] <Phase4> :P
[05:37:29] <Colgate> since that command wouldn't end until after I do an eof
[05:37:31] <Phase4> cat file - | command is the correct solution
[05:37:47] <Phase4> unless you want to ctrl+d before it runs
[05:38:19] <mniip> Phase4, the other arguments are passed to command
[05:38:32] <mniip> Colgate, are you even shell scripting
[05:38:48] <mniip> a < b
[05:38:50] <mniip> is not a | b
[05:38:53] <mniip> and is not a <<< b
[05:38:58] <Colgate> no, that's what I had before
[05:39:01] <Colgate> and I wasn't thinking
[05:39:22] <Colgate> all I did before was read a set of commands from a file
[05:39:44] <Colgate> but now I wanted to add in commands from the keyboard afterwards
[05:42:45] <cyborg_ar> for maximum pipe

[15:24:17] <PinkiePieBot> [ US aviation authority: Boeing 787 software bug could cause 'loss of control' | Technology | The Guardian ]
[15:24:51] <fiyahsparkle|work> Sounds like a feature amirite? :P
[15:31:13] <DataByteBrony> 'undocumented feature'
[15:47:49] <Kinsley> "if left on for 248 days"
[15:50:29] <Kinsley> What that article fails to talk about is that 1. Boeing found the bug in LAB TESTS 2. That bug would probably never affect regular commercial aircraft because of the existing maintenance requirements

[15:54:07] <Phase5> Kinsley, "... addresses a condition that only occurred in the lab ..." it's not upfront about it but it is there
[15:55:23] <Kinsley> Still, it's pretty rare that a local news station gets the story reported better than a major publisher like The Guardian.

[16:14:31] <tiwake> like fanuc
[16:15:20] <Kinsley> Because a CNC machine isn't hurtling at several hundred miles an hour, miles above the Earth, carrying hundreds of people.
[16:15:28] <tiwake> boeing is just a company like fanuc... hitting the news for stuff like that is kinda lame

[23:53:32] <Kinsley> CLONING. As in, it shouldn't alter the original to make the copy. I totally get that you can't fit 700 GB into 250 without trimming some shit.

[23:54:47] <Kinsley> That's my fucking point: Samsung's utility will delete your shit from the original drive during the process. I only discovered in a later screen that the utility can make the backups, but that's hardly a saving grace. Why the fuck does it need to wipe the source drive?
