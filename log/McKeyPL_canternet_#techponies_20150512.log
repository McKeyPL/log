[05:18:06] <Lapsus> that's less fun, though

[06:45:23] <Gigabit> Anyone have a recommendation for compression method in 7zip to compress around.. 159gb of applications?
[06:45:51] <Twilightlicious> er...
[06:46:01] <Twilightlicious> There's really only like two compression methods, LZMA and LZMA2
[06:46:32] <Gigabit> Which would be the best, as in smallest size when done.
[06:46:47] <Twilightlicious> There's no way to determine that.
[06:47:00] <Twilightlicious> That results between LZMA and LZMA2 are so close that it depends on file types and such
[06:47:24] <Gigabit> Exes and files that associate with them.
[06:48:44] *** Quits: ThunderStorm (lightning@property.of.moonlightning) (Quit: The Nightmares will collide. And become a Dream.)
[06:48:49] <Gigabit> Its basically the program files folder from windows
[06:49:04] <Twilightlicious> I would recommend LZMA2 with Ultra compression level, Solid Block Size, and a Dictionary the maximum size based on how much ram you can afford to spare while it processes (Notice the "Memory usage for compressing" changes as you adjust Dictionary size), if you have a ton of spare time on your hands to do this in, You can also change the CPU threads to 1, greatly decreasing the RAM usage, and thus allowing you to further increase the 
[06:49:04] <Twilightlicious> dictionary size.
[06:49:08] <Twilightlicious> -spam-
[06:49:49] <Twilightlicious> for example, these are the settings i use when compressing pretty much anything http://i.imgur.com/2C9UZ64.png
[06:50:38] <Twilightlicious> note that if you ever wish to extract single files or folders from the archive, setting the block size to Solid may be a bad idea.
[06:51:11] <Twilightlicious> as the entire archive has to be decompressed up to the point that the file you need is extracted
[06:51:27] <Gigabit> Hmm.. This is odd.. I cloned my ssd to my backup hard drive.. Cannot see the hard drive in explorer.
[06:51:38] <Twilightlicious> Is it Windows?
[06:51:40] <Twilightlicious> Check the Disk Manager
[06:51:59] <Twilightlicious> it might need to have a drive letter assigned
[06:52:02] <Gigabit> Wtf.. Its listed as offline o.o
[06:52:22] <Twilightlicious> I think you can right click it to bring it online, but i could be wrong.
[06:52:33] <Gigabit> Ya i did, that was odd
[06:52:35] <Twilightlicious> if it's a backup of a system drive, i wouldnt recommend having it Live
[06:53:24] <Gigabit> Only need it live to copy over the last bit of data, unless I should do that from a live CD?
[06:54:41] <Twilightlicious> I don't think i can really give a recommendation on that :P
[06:55:08] <Twilightlicious> I wouldn't personally ever use a Linux distro to manage an NTFS Drive
[06:55:36] <Twilightlicious> No offence to linux peoplez <3
[06:56:12] <Gigabit> Okay so if I add to archive all these files, it leaves them in the folder and makes an archive too correct?
[06:56:40] <Twilightlicious> Yes, it won't delete the files.
[06:56:50] <Twilightlicious> It'll make an archive wherever you choose to save it
[06:57:32] <Gigabit> I haven't made an archive in so long lol
[06:58:00] <Twilightlicious> There's an option to delete the files after it's done
[06:58:02] <Twilightlicious> but
[06:58:09] <Twilightlicious> I've never used it.
[06:58:16] <Gigabit> Solid block size?
[06:58:39] <Gigabit> Wait never mind you said its a bad idea
[06:58:41] <Twilightlicious> i'd set it to solid if you never need to use the Archives contents
[06:59:15] <Twilightlicious> If you will need to occasionally extract things from it, i would set it to 1GB or 4GB or something.
[07:00:10] <Gigabit> Basically I'm only doing this so that way if Linux minutes fucks up on me, I can restore windows 7 and all my apps back
[07:00:35] <Twilightlicious> Windows 7 has a built in backup option, i think.
[07:00:42] <Twilightlicious> to backup the entire system drive
[07:00:44] <Twilightlicious> onto another HDD
[07:01:00] <Gigabit> I need it compressed
[07:01:01] <Twilightlicious> I've never used it myself, though.
[07:01:14] <Twilightlicious> Alrighty, but you'll need to know how to restore it
[07:01:22] <Twilightlicious> Windows won't boot with the C:\ contents alone.
[07:01:41] <Gigabit> And its 2 drives, 40gb ssd and 140gb of data on a hdd
[07:02:16] <Twilightlicious> i wouldn't worry too much about the HDD
[07:02:17] <Twilightlicious> if it's the SSD you're installing Linux to.
[07:03:07] <Gigabit> I have no free space on the hdd, it is all the applications I have installed in windows 7, but on the HDD because size issues
[07:03:35] <Gigabit> And I am wanting them backed up because some are games and I do not have good internet to redownload
[07:03:37] <Twilightlicious> Gotcha.
[07:03:51] <Twilightlicious> You have a place to store the archive, yes? :P
[07:03:55] <Gigabit> If I had good internet, I would care less :
[07:04:11] <Gigabit> Yep, Hitachi death star 200gb 
[07:04:19] <Twilightlicious> External HDD?
[07:04:27] <Gigabit> For now, until I can get another medium.
[07:04:44] <Gigabit> Its internal ATM but I have an enclosure I can use
[07:05:14] <Twilightlicious> You can use 4 cores to greatly increase the backup speed, but it'll lower the dictionary size (which, probably won't hurt too much)
[07:05:28] *** Joins: Phase4 (Phase4@Pony-4eren4.internode.on.net)
[07:05:33] <Twilightlicious> or 8 cores, or 2 cores, or whatever you have lol
[07:06:39] <Gigabit> Lol the system cannot allocate the required amount of memory

[07:06:49] <Twilightlicious> do you know how much ram you have? :P
[07:06:55] <Gigabit> 12gb
[07:07:09] <Twilightlicious> Keep an eye on that memory requirement for compressing
[07:07:26] <Twilightlicious> you can make the backup fail, or cause your PC to become unstable, if you use too much

[23:35:41] <init3> http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
[23:37:04] <Gigabit> How well does linux handle applications being on another physical drive other then the one the OS is installed on?
[23:37:39] <Lapsus> I'd imagine it doesn't give a shit
[23:37:45] <Lapsus> neither does windows, really
[23:38:00] <Colgate> ^
[23:38:00] <Gigabit> I know windows doesn't I do it already thats why I asked
[23:38:01] <Finwe> This is indeed the case.
[23:38:07] <Phase4> yeah, it's the program itself that tends to care
[23:38:13] <Colgate> linux doesn't care at all where the program is
[23:38:25] <Gigabit> Because I would need to install Wine to my secondary HDD due to size issues on my SSD
[23:38:50] <Colgate> you could have a nfs share bound to a server which has sn sshfs share to another server that has the program plugged into a thumb drive
[23:39:33] <Gigabit> And I was told that on some games I could just use the windows folder of the game directoy in wine and it would work. Albeit a few more setup tasks
[23:39:44] <Colgate> wine is actually pretty tiny, most of the space is used up by the programs you run with wine, which is in general, stored in your home drive
[23:39:49] <Colgate> er, home directory*
[23:40:12] <init3> Gigabit: The kicker with wine is that any wineapp needs to be on a linux file system. 
[23:40:23] <Colgate> wineapp?
[23:40:35] <init3> Like, you can't run it off NTFS. 
[23:40:38] <Colgate> why not?
[23:40:42] <init3> The program's install dir. 
[23:40:53] <init3> I think it is a permissions thing. 
[23:40:58] <init3> I've tried. 
[23:41:27] <init3> Since there are no unix permissions. 
[23:41:28] <Colgate> I'll mount my windows hdd today when I get home and try to open things off of it
[23:41:38] <init3> Yeah, PM me if it works. 
[23:41:52] <init3> I'd rather do it that way but I am pretty sure you can't. 
[23:42:06] <Gigabit> Well I plan on formatting the partition that the games/apps are on to ext4 and just making the directory for games be there again but for wine
[23:43:44] <init3> No issue there then.
[23:44:01] <Phase4> init3, iirc the bigest source of problems was ntfs3g not supporting mmap
[23:44:11] <Gigabit> But if Colgate gets it working that way, then I won't have to :P
[23:44:14] <Phase4> not quite sure why that was the case but apparently it was
[23:44:32] <Phase4> steam in particular required MapViewOfFile
[23:44:32] <init3> Yeah. I think I read something about that. 
[23:44:33] <Colgate> /shrug, dunno if I'll have any success, doing a few searches atm :P
[23:44:40] <Phase4> should be fixed now though
[23:44:40] <Gigabit> XD

[23:48:34] <Gigabit> regardless, I am swapping to linux tonight. I really hope the amd drivers are good though..
[23:52:54] <Gigabit> I take the silence as a bad thing :(
[23:53:03] <init3> Uuuh
[23:53:19] <init3> They are drivers
[23:53:24] <init3> They exist. 
[23:53:29] <Gigabit> XD
[23:53:48] <Phase4> they're moving toward an open source kernel driver, with a closed source gl library
[23:53:58] <Phase4> something i wished nvidia would do
[23:54:11] <init3> I mean, if you ever played with them a few years ago they are definitely better than that. 
[23:54:21] <init3> Just a pain sometimes. 
[23:54:52] <init3> I still can't run the latest xorg or kernel because of them most of the times.
