[06:24:31] <thaostra> Although not enough to be a Black Lotus, methinks
[06:24:46] <Squirrelly> I think the most expensive I've seen was at a big event, where the artist for black lotus was signing cards, and a guy brought in TWO alpha lotuses that were like BGS 9.5

[06:24:51] <Squirrelly> It was crazy

[06:30:55] <Squirrelly> It'll be my first piece of power, though, which is AWESOME.
[06:31:02] <Squirrelly> I'm trading a so-so modern deck for it.

[06:32:01] <Squirrelly> Is it weird that I know all this stuff and am a girl? I saw that apparently only like 38% of magic players are female
[06:32:17] <Squirrelly> And most of the other girls I know who play are pretty casual
[06:32:19] <Quinn> that's more than I imagined it would be
[06:33:09] <thaostra> What's weird is that there aren't enough girls. We need more people to realize this game's greatness
[06:33:32] <Squirrelly> ^
[06:34:42] <Squirrelly> Quinn, it's actually probably higher than the real number, because there's plenty of girls I know who "play" in that they sometimes borrow their boyfriend's deck and play one or two games very badly. I just want to face other girls who are on my level or higher. I want more girlfriends who play magic WELL.
[06:34:47] <plushie_pegasus> I was shocked when i was told they had national tournaments
[06:34:52] <Squirrelly> Oh yeah
[06:34:57] <Squirrelly> Not just national. International.

[17:55:50] <Melon_Phone> I kinda wanna start learning a programming language
[17:56:12] <Melon_Phone> dunno which one tho
[17:57:14] <RubyPinch> I would say, Python or C or ASM
[17:57:29] <Melon_Phone> or maybe just to play some games

[21:05:35] <Drago> Nikashi I was just talking about discs still being used. I'm confused as to why you mentioned internet speed
[21:05:48] <Drago> I am a believer in cartridges of some type
[21:05:59] <Nikashi> Oh
[21:06:07] <Nikashi> Discs are easier to mass produce
[21:06:13] <Melon_Phone> I like to think sd cards have a future
[21:06:16] <Nikashi> I thought you were meaning discs vs digital
[21:06:27] <Drago> oh
[21:06:34] <Drago> no
[21:06:55] <Drago> I'm glad to see the 3DS uses a cartridge and SD card
[21:07:43] <Nikashi> yeah but 3DS doesn't really use too much storage heavy features
[21:07:49] <Nikashi> like uncompressed audio 
[21:07:51] <iamalion> talking to a russian guy with an interpreter conferenced in. awesome 
[21:07:53] <Nikashi> and video
[21:08:15] <Drago> little thing like a square inch witha whole gameon it. doesn't get scratched or smudged. But yeah, cost of manufacturing. Discs are cheaper to make, like you said Nikashi.
[21:09:58] <Nikashi> also, and this might be more a marketing thing, a tiny piece of plastic in a home gaming console would feel wierd. It did with SMS and TG-16
[21:11:33] <Drago> never heard of those, lol
[21:12:01] <Drago> I thought it was neat how small the discs were for gamecube
[21:16:41] <Vulpixbrew> gamecube disc were cool
[21:18:43] <weisey> Those mini discs are the bane of many a console pirate's existence
[21:20:00] <Drago> I dislike theft.
[21:20:18] <weisey> Nikashi: there's places (aka most) of the us that only have like 3mbps max, averaging 1.5
[21:20:31] <weisey> Try titan fall on that shit
[21:22:36] <weisey> Ah but drago, is it theft if the pirated content is no longer sold in any (reasonably easily attainable) form
[21:23:02] <weisey> Like many old console games
[21:23:42] <weisey> A lot of Game cube games are hard to find these days
[21:23:52] <weisey> Not to mention older consoles
[21:24:41] <Melon_Phone> my internet speed is accosting to speedtest isss

[21:26:16] <Melon_Phone> they don't even wanna rate it
[21:27:05] <weisey> Ah
[21:27:06] <weisey> Why is your up higher than your down
[21:27:11] <Drago> http://i.imgur.com/QPVCkwX.jpg
[21:30:33] <thaostra> Drago, I don't see the big deal with pirating old games. The problem with piracy is that it often means a lost opportunity for a sale, but I don't think it applies so much to games that have been on the market for many years for reasons like the original developer went out of business, they no longer sell the game, or all of the momentum and attention has gone away and they're focusing on newer titles anyway
[21:31:32] <Melon_Phone> weisey it's almost a complete opposite of daily life! :D 
[21:33:21] <thaostra> Console games also have the problem of being locked to a particular platform, so games would essentially die with the consoles if no one tries to make copies
