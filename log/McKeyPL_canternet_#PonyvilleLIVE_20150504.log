[14:36:39] <TheFlutterGuy> sorry, was in transit
[14:37:07] <Electron> is it possible to make Internet-shop from my local PC?
[14:38:10] <TheFlutterGuy> i'm not understanding your question
[14:38:12] <TheFlutterGuy> like, at all
[14:38:26] *** Joins: ThunderBolt (ThunderBolt@Sliverpony)
[14:39:48] <Electron> :(
[14:40:01] <Electron> shucks
[14:40:10] <TheFlutterGuy> rephrase?
[14:40:47] <Electron> there is gonna be a site-catalog on my PC
[14:41:33] <Electron> this site should be accessible over the Internet
[14:41:36] <TheFlutterGuy> sure
[14:41:50] <Electron> can I add pay system to that site?
[14:41:54] <TheFlutterGuy> sure
[14:42:18] <Electron> nice, this is what I wanted to hear
[14:42:21] * TheFlutterGuy rocks out to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEvgYwXqO2E
[14:44:30] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: i have like 3 domains. i just moved one of them to a VPS yesterday. still got two running on my home server
[14:44:44] <TheFlutterGuy> that's just http domains. i have more services/servers
[14:45:48] <Electron> are those domains located in your home server?
[14:45:55] <TheFlutterGuy> two of them yes
[14:46:03] <TheFlutterGuy> moved one to a VPS during my server crash
[14:46:17] <TheFlutterGuy> mostly because i already had a new version of the site, in a half developed state, on the VPS.
[14:46:23] <Electron> and the third is moved to some company's server
[14:46:30] <TheFlutterGuy> yeah
[14:46:50] <Electron> how much it costs?
[14:46:59] <TheFlutterGuy> depends on what you want
[14:47:20] <TheFlutterGuy> found a nice 20$ a year, that includes wildcard ssl in the price(wildcard ssl alone is usually 150$+ a year)
[14:47:29] <TheFlutterGuy> sadly it is openvz, not xen/kvm
[14:47:38] <TheFlutterGuy> http://lowendbox.com/ <- look for yearly deals here
[14:47:44] <TheFlutterGuy> http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/50472/vmbox-co-ovz-ssd-cached-free-wildcard-ssl-20-year-la-2-ipv4-s-1gb-ram-40-year-nl-phx-la <- i just bought this
[14:48:48] <TheFlutterGuy> it's a very nice machine. totally OP for the price. 2 ipv4's(why would you need more than 1?) 5 ipv6's
[14:49:01] <TheFlutterGuy> you could setup a vpn on it, possibly watch hulu and netflix, etc.
[14:49:20] <TheFlutterGuy> You can use "iodine" to do dns tunnel(for filtered networks).
[14:49:33] <Electron> HostUS – $35/year 2GB OpenVZ in Dallas, Los Angeles, or Atlanta
[14:49:45] <TheFlutterGuy> you need 2GB ram?
[14:49:58] <TheFlutterGuy> Are you going to be running java?
[14:50:02] <Electron> hm...
[14:50:14] <TheFlutterGuy> you need ssl?
[14:50:37] <TheFlutterGuy> really, you should take a gander here too. you can sort and filter, is nice(but not the same offers) http://lowendstock.com/
[14:50:40] <Electron> I need secured transactions
[14:50:53] <TheFlutterGuy> then you need SSL
[14:51:01] *** Quits: ThunderBolt (ThunderBolt@Sliverpony) (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
[14:51:12] <TheFlutterGuy> that can be done for free through some services. but if you need multiple subdomains, you should get a wildcard
[14:51:18] <TheFlutterGuy> do you need multiple subdomains?
[14:51:51] <TheFlutterGuy> really, i need to get my certificate ordered. my domain is currently clean text, not ssl. :(
[14:52:11] <Electron> if a catalog would use multiple domains
[14:52:23] <TheFlutterGuy> catalog can mean a lot of things... i wouldn't know.
[14:52:58] <TheFlutterGuy> i mean, really, you could just do "myshop.el/couldhavebeenasubdomain/butisfolders/"
[14:53:08] <TheFlutterGuy> unless you really "need" subdomain
[14:53:13] <Electron> yes, I know
[14:53:18] * StarStream bored 
[14:53:29] * StarStream super bored 
[14:53:34] <Electron> then one domain should be enough
[14:53:35] <TheFlutterGuy> if you "need" subdomain. then your only real option, IMO, is http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/50472/vmbox-co-ovz-ssd-cached-free-wildcard-ssl-20-year-la-2-ipv4-s-1gb-ram-40-year-nl-phx-la
[14:53:51] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: in that case. you can get ssl from here https://www.startssl.com/
[14:53:55] *** Joins: ThunderBolt (ThunderBolt@Sliverpony)
[14:54:06] <TheFlutterGuy> it's an annoying and hard process, and you need to get email(MX DNS records) working on your domain first!!
[14:54:11] <Electron> same as yours
[14:54:53] <TheFlutterGuy> not really no. i mean, i DO have an active certificate from them. But not gonna use it, as it only covers one subdomain.
[14:55:00] <Electron> I mean you linked just like yours
[14:55:18] * TheFlutterGuy tilts his head
[14:55:47] <TheFlutterGuy> Yeah, i should do SSL wildcard certificate before i go to Lunia
[14:56:18] <Electron> what are you doing with your domain atm?
[14:56:27] <TheFlutterGuy> http://onion.nu
[14:56:31] <Electron> if it is not private info
[14:57:15] <TheFlutterGuy> really, my site(because of the I2P gateway) is going to be using a SHIT load more memory than you.(if all you are doing is a simple webshop)
[14:57:49] <Electron> you provide I2P gateways for strangers?
[14:58:11] <TheFlutterGuy> sure
[14:58:15] <TheFlutterGuy> it's only inproxy
[14:58:41] <Electron> yes, I wanna make a simple webshop
[14:58:54] <Electron> wthout any sophisticated things
[14:59:06] <TheFlutterGuy> i mean, if you are really wanting to do something shady on I2P, or Tor, you would be an idiot to go thorugh my site.
[14:59:38] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: like. i don't want people going here http://qia2vpjf3bubn5he.onion.nu/
[14:59:40] <Electron> nope, I will not do any shady things :D
[15:00:10] <TheFlutterGuy> Sooo. you have a choice my little ruskie
[15:00:23] <TheFlutterGuy> 20$ for 1 year. one host, totally overpowered for you. got ssl, everything you could possibly want
[15:00:38] <TheFlutterGuy> or go here http://lowendstock.com/ and find something usable. and do free ssl from startssl.com
[15:00:48] <Electron> I am calculating the price
[15:01:04] <Electron> seeing my exchange rate
[15:01:16] <TheFlutterGuy> oh, the $20(instead of 120$ which is the normal price, without the coupon) is permanent!
[15:01:24] <TheFlutterGuy> so it will NOT increase to 120$ after a year. it will stay at 20$
[15:01:50] <TheFlutterGuy> http://lowendtalk.com/ <- this site is good too
[15:01:53] <TheFlutterGuy> if you are bookmarking
[15:02:23] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: well, it's good that you have new ponies this satuday then
[15:02:27] <TheFlutterGuy> :þ
[15:02:35] * TheFlutterGuy laughs maniacally
[15:02:51] <StarStream> what ?
[15:03:00] <TheFlutterGuy> there are no ponies this weekend
[15:03:08] <StarStream> oh ya 
[15:03:10] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: i'm surprised you knew about I2P at all
[15:03:33] <Electron> well
[15:03:45] <Electron> MirSar hooked me on TOR
[15:04:03] <TheFlutterGuy> heh, really, the reason i made this site. for fun, to see if i could.
[15:04:14] <Electron> and that Onion net stuff
[15:04:19] <TheFlutterGuy> i already had Tor and I2P running 24/7 anyways. so.. lets add a frontend
[15:04:33] <Electron> the darkest side of the internets
[15:04:44] <TheFlutterGuy> so, you've been on freenet?
[15:05:20] <Electron> I did not dig much on it
[15:05:58] <TheFlutterGuy> I2p, i do some torrent seeding
[15:06:02] <TheFlutterGuy> Tor, mainly to browse thepiratebay
[15:06:14] <TheFlutterGuy> but really, i mostly play with it "for the lulz"
[15:06:19] <Electron> good pirate site actually
[15:06:20] <TheFlutterGuy> hence, my website. it's just for the lulz.
[15:06:20] <StarStream> u guys have seedbox?
[15:06:36] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: weellll, the 20$ host i pasted is allowed to be used as a seedbox
[15:06:39] <TheFlutterGuy> but no, i don't
[15:06:39] <Electron> it was blocked and reborn, right?
[15:06:46] <TheFlutterGuy> i have no need. i'm on 100/100mbit
[15:06:47] <TheFlutterGuy> ;-;
[15:06:48] <TheFlutterGuy> sooo slow
[15:07:03] <StarStream> which site flutterguy ?
[15:07:04] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: yet to be determined what will happen
[15:07:09] <TheFlutterGuy> http://lowendtalk.com/discussion/50472/vmbox-co-ovz-ssd-cached-free-wildcard-ssl-20-year-la-2-ipv4-s-1gb-ram-40-year-nl-phx-la
[15:07:16] <TheFlutterGuy> allows torrenting. but they do limit it
[15:07:30] <StarStream> question which kind of seedbox they allow ?
[15:07:34] <TheFlutterGuy> -Torrents (Must be limited to 20Mbps total to prevent disk IO abuse)
[15:07:35] <StarStream> do they allow private?
[15:07:50] <TheFlutterGuy> i... what the frell kind of a provider would allow public torrents, but not private...
[15:08:08] <Electron> no shady things, as you said
[15:08:10] <Electron> :)
[15:08:20] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: i'm not saying it's a good seedbox. just that they allow it.
[15:08:22] <StarStream> mine is pretty insane tho 
[15:08:33] <StarStream> need to find a good and cheap seedbox
[15:08:42] <TheFlutterGuy> well, i'm used to my 300/300mbit. so never needed one.
[15:08:47] *** Joins: Lunia (ellen@ChumPony.Enterprises)
[15:08:51] <Electron> and I need to find good CMS for a webshop
[15:08:59] <TheFlutterGuy> HAH
[15:09:05] <StarStream> hmm.. can use vps as seedbox ?
[15:09:14] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: ehm, yes, you can.
[15:09:32] <TheFlutterGuy> as long as the TOS allows it anyways
[15:09:42] <StarStream> oh
[15:09:51] <TheFlutterGuy> again, it does allow it with vmbox
[15:10:01] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: so, if you have any interest in a seedbox. you should go with taht
[15:10:04] <StarStream> cause i need a seedbox for private torrent site
[15:10:06] <TheFlutterGuy> also, because multiple ip4's 
[15:10:15] <StarStream> the vmbox ?
[15:10:18] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: 2 ip4's, for 20$ a year
[15:10:22] <TheFlutterGuy> yeah, the vmbox
[15:10:28] <TheFlutterGuy> but again, only 20mbit allowed for torrent
[15:10:32] <Electron> I have no intentions to seed anything yet
[15:10:55] <Electron> my Internet will blow up because of it I guess
[15:11:06] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: hence why you use a seedbox
[15:11:08] <StarStream> the site i am using is pretty hard to enter
[15:11:12] <TheFlutterGuy> it does the torrenting, then you just http/ftp the file down
[15:11:18] <StarStream> but idk the tos for that site tho 
[15:11:28] <Electron> oh...
[15:11:40] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: ssh -D1080 <your vmbox ip>, then point your browser to 127.0.0.1:1080 socks proxy
[15:11:43] <TheFlutterGuy> be happy
[15:11:51] <Electron> you are using the resourses of other machines to seed?
[15:11:54] <TheFlutterGuy> oh... i thoughty ou meant private tracker site
[15:12:02] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: i'm not, StarStream is though.
[15:12:08] <TheFlutterGuy> that's what a seedbox is
[15:12:15] <Electron> alright then
[15:12:33] <StarStream> yea.. cause when u have a private torrent site u kind of need to maintain the ratio 
[15:12:58] <TheFlutterGuy> bah. why am i sounding like i work for vmbox :(
[15:13:09] <Electron> the ratio also depends on what you are seeding, no?
[15:13:22] <TheFlutterGuy> depends on how fast you upload, and how many people want data from you
[15:13:50] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: the purpose of a seedbox is to keep your ISP happy. to have the least amount of bandwidth use on your ISP connection.
[15:13:54] <StarStream> yea.. but as i said for private site wise its hard 
[15:13:58] <StarStream> to leech 
[15:14:01] <Electron> yes, hence if no one wants your content then something is wrong
[15:14:04] <StarStream> i mean to get the ratio 
[15:14:07] <TheFlutterGuy> usually because people have crappy uploads from their ISP. thus would have to seed for YEARS to try and get back to 1:1 ratio
[15:14:28] <StarStream> u guys wanna know about the site ?
[15:14:43] <TheFlutterGuy> well, not gonna use it. sorry. ;)
[15:14:50] * TheFlutterGuy has enough servers with good connections already
[15:15:16] <Electron> is it something secret?
[15:15:19] <Electron> :P
[15:15:39] <StarStream> its a video game torrent site
[15:15:46] <StarStream> private torrent site
[15:15:55] <TheFlutterGuy> heh, definetly don't care then. xD
[15:16:04] <TheFlutterGuy> but thanks for the offer
[15:16:14] <StarStream> that site is known as the holy grail for rhythm gamers
[15:16:25] <TheFlutterGuy> i can ask a friend though
[15:16:53] <StarStream> oh ?
[15:16:56] <Electron> oh right, I remember you mentioned that
[15:17:06] <Electron> something about dance games
[15:17:11] <StarStream> yea
[15:17:31] <StarStream> that site contain tons of arcade rips 
[15:19:03] <Electron> okay, I'm gonna digest this information
[15:19:13] <Electron> and it's time to go home
[15:19:22] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: feel free to ping me with more questions
[15:19:23] * Electron hovers home slowly
[15:19:35] <Electron> really, TheFlutterGuy?
[15:19:36] <TheFlutterGuy> though really. work hours are best for me, i'll be very AFK when i go to Lunia.
[15:19:47] <StarStream> hmmm.. 
[15:20:04] <TheFlutterGuy> Electron: oh, you can get dedicated servers for like 5$ a month. if you want. xD
[15:20:09] <StarStream> how do u set up vps as seedbox?
[15:20:24] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: ehm, install torrent client
[15:20:32] <TheFlutterGuy> there. that was all the steps required
[15:20:34] <Electron> you want some random ruskiy to bother you, TheFlutterGuy? that's weird
[15:20:57] <StarStream> note: i am using windows tho 
[15:21:02] <StarStream> so yea
[15:21:18] <TheFlutterGuy> well, you could buy a windows machine ;)
[15:21:30] <TheFlutterGuy> but they cost like way more. and is a total waste
[15:21:34] <TheFlutterGuy> but really, it comes down to one of these
[15:21:38] <TheFlutterGuy> yum install vuze
[15:21:41] <TheFlutterGuy> apt-get install vuze
[15:21:49] <TheFlutterGuy> pkg install vuze
[15:21:55] <TheFlutterGuy> depending on your OS/Distro
[15:22:22] <StarStream> my laptop is running on window 7 
[15:22:27] <ArchPegasusMichael> TheFlutterGuy: rtorrent
[15:22:34] <ArchPegasusMichael> xD
[15:22:47] <TheFlutterGuy> ArchPegasusMichael: is what i use
[15:22:53] <TheFlutterGuy> and sabnzbd
[15:23:01] <TheFlutterGuy> and i2psnark(for i2p)
[15:23:20] <TheFlutterGuy> really, i don't think anyone is sharing all MLP on I2P. i should get on that.
[15:23:38] <StarStream> dang man .. i dont know what to get 
[15:23:46] <StarStream> should i get a seedbox or vps ?
[15:25:28] <TheFlutterGuy> ehm..
[15:25:33] <TheFlutterGuy> do you have a need for a vps?
[15:25:49] <StarStream> idk 
[15:25:56] *** Quits: ThunderBolt (ThunderBolt@Sliverpony) (Quit: Thundarrrrr)
[15:25:58] <TheFlutterGuy> like, if all you want is "seedbox", you might (i don't know) be able to find that cheaper. 
[15:26:02] <TheFlutterGuy> hehe
[15:26:16] <StarStream> yea i am trying to hunt for a seedbox
[15:26:21] <TheFlutterGuy> StarStream: http://lowendtalk.com/search?Search=seedbox
[15:26:48] <TheFlutterGuy> that place should have guides on how to turn a VPS into seedboxes. and providers who allow being seedboxes.
[15:30:08] <StarStream> yea
[15:30:32] <Electron> okay, transit time
[15:30:39] <Electron> see you later
[15:31:39] <StarStream> then again .... i am wondering tho 
[15:31:43] <TheFlutterGuy> hehe
[15:31:58] <StarStream> do rtorrent or rutorrent work on windows ?
[15:32:17] <TheFlutterGuy> i wouldn't know
[15:33:05] <TheFlutterGuy> If you setup the machine yourself, you could go with vuze
[15:33:20] <TheFlutterGuy> that is java. runs on windows and linux. And it can connect to I2P too.
[15:33:23] <TheFlutterGuy> but java is a hog.
[15:33:28] <StarStream> yea
[15:33:35] <StarStream> wat about deluge?
[15:35:38] <TheFlutterGuy> don't know it
[15:37:31] <TheFlutterGuy> sorry, i'm doing like 3 things right now, so i'm not going to google stuff.
[15:37:52] <StarStream> its ok 
[15:40:10] <TheFlutterGuy> if deluge works in linux, i don't see why you couldn't use it.
[15:40:33] <TheFlutterGuy> i know from personal experience that rtorrent is very nice. and can do everything you need. That said, there may be better options out there.
[15:43:07] <ArchPegasusMichael> Deluge is very good
