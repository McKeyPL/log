[07:40:52] <Quinn> that comic made me think about our RP last night for some reason :3
[07:41:03] <Vulpixbrew> oooo???
[07:41:24] <Quinn> yea :3
[07:41:35] <Vulpixbrew> it was hot.......
[07:41:59] <Quinn> it was
[07:43:38] <Quinn> 69'ing is one of my favorite sexual activities :3
[07:43:47] <Vulpixbrew> it is always fun
[07:43:51] <Quinn> having a juicy cock hovering above my mouth
[07:43:56] <Quinn> yespls
[07:44:28] <Vulpixbrew> mmmmmmhmmmm
[07:45:11] <Quinn> and then I think
[07:45:20] <Quinn> if my mom knew how much I loved cock
[07:45:23] <Quinn> she'd probably pass out
[07:45:54] * Vulpixbrew chuckles
[07:46:51] <Quinn> or anyone I know, honestly
[07:47:06] <Vulpixbrew> your love of cock?

[07:50:27] <Quinn> a lot of people I know don't approve of me being bi, so that's mostly why :c

[07:52:12] <Vulpixbrew> I don't think they understand how I can like all

[07:52:30] <Quinn> hm
[07:52:39] <Quinn> for the people I know it's just general homophobia
[07:53:01] <Quinn> my mom /really/ hates it
[07:53:20] <plushie_pegasus> You are lucky to be gay, as a Plushophile i gotta stay in the closet, I don't dare tell people IRL thai i'm a plushophile

[07:55:20] <CozyLoaf> Hello :) 
[07:55:46] <plushie_pegasus> Are you new here?

[07:55:54] <FineLine> Vulpixbrew: I'll pass that on when iam[a]lion is around.
[07:56:09] <CozyLoaf> Ahh no, plushie I've been around before 
[07:56:24] <CozyLoaf> Just been absent for a while 
[07:56:30] <Quinn> another thing plushie_pegasus, most people would probably find it kind of strange at first, which doesn't help. Being LGBT is at least widely known, so people are used to it
[07:57:37] <IceFlurries> so...I guess this doesn't exist: a casual dom/sub relationship that's built on submitting more emotional-wise, that extends into actions, etc over time...and where it's more gentle/sensual rather than "oh I'm gonna humiliate you", but that anything would be for one anothers' pleasure...
[07:58:07] <Quinn> IceFlurries: pretty sure it does, and if it doesn't you could always create it with your partner if they were interested
[07:58:21] <IceFlurries> Well...I meant in looking for something.
[07:58:36] <Quinn> what do you mean?
[07:58:38] <IceFlurries> I'm just at a loss :D
[07:58:49] <IceFlurries> Like...I'm just floating about in society
[07:59:13] <Quinn> well, what you described isn't easy to find straight up
[07:59:33] <Quinn> and ontop of that it's probably not terribly healthy for your first relationship, though I could be wrong 
[08:02:39] <plushie_pegasus> BRB
[08:02:42] <Quinn> you really have to trust/know someone before you can establish stuff like that
[08:02:58] <Quinn> and you most likely can't do that without already being in a relationship with them in some capacity
[08:06:32] <IceFlurries> Yep! :D I totally agree

[08:16:53] <Vulpixbrew> It's been over a year since my last relationship ended, I think i'm goign to try out getting a boyfriend
[08:17:07] <Quinn> :o
[08:17:09] <Quinn> do it
[08:17:20] <Quinn> I want to see you with a cute guy :3
[08:18:53] <Vulpixbrew> yay!!!
[08:19:19] <Vulpixbrew> at this point I'm not really sure where to begin I tried the whole online dating thing
[08:20:01] <Quinn> I don't really know myself D:
[08:22:03] <Vulpixbrew> doesn't help the last guy I even talked to IRL for anything had a boyfriend, and I was the subject of a big fight......................
[08:22:12] <Quinn> D:
[08:22:15] <Quinn> that sucks :c
[08:23:17] <Vulpixbrew> sad part about it is he said they had broke up a month ago
[08:24:00] <Quinn> :c
[08:24:36] <Quinn> my ex bf was apparently just waiting for any opportunity he could get to leave me and be with some other guy
[08:24:47] <Vulpixbrew> damn
[08:25:03] <Quinn> then the suicide attempt happened and he couldn't handle it so he left and moved in with "his friend from college"
[08:25:16] <Quinn> check his facebook profile a week later, yea "friend"....
[08:27:11] <Quinn> oh well
[08:27:22] * Vulpixbrew huggles Quinn
[08:27:31] <Quinn> he's probably a better bf than I was
[08:28:06] * Vulpixbrew thinks Quinn would make a pretty awesome BF
[08:28:20] <Quinn> evidence suggests otherwise
[08:29:34] <Quinn> they seem super happy with each other
[08:29:48] * Vulpixbrew shurgs
[08:30:02] <Quinn> I actually met them at the shopping center a few weeks ago and he just ignored me
[08:31:36] <Vulpixbrew> dang..........
[08:31:50] <Vulpixbrew> well sounds like your better off wthout him
[08:31:56] <Quinn> doesn't feel like it
[08:32:15] <Quinn> wish I could have been better to him
[08:34:35] <Quinn> that guy is doing something that I couldn't
[08:34:40] <Quinn> I just wish I knew what it was
[08:35:14] <Vulpixbrew> may he's a top and I know you are a bottom
[08:35:41] <Quinn> I was the top in that relationship, not because I liked it but because that's what he liked

[08:38:04] <Vulpixbrew> and the second the happiness fell he went running.......
[08:38:29] <Quinn> I think he wanted to leave for a while
[08:38:35] <Quinn> idunno :/
[08:38:53] <Quinn> he started to see how fucked up i actually was and that's probably when he stopped liking me
[08:39:48] <iamaphone> Let me know if this cuts off:
[08:39:50] <iamaphone> Discharged, nothing wrong. Had ct and xray. Dr says she might have hurt herself coughing or something. She's at home in a lot of pain but has a prescription for pain meds. I just wasted 45 minutes driving around to 24 hour pharmacies only to find them closed. Eventually just went back to the er and asked what the Fuck I do with this piece of paper. At a pharmacy now, waiting 45 minutes for them to fill the goddamn prescription so I can t
[08:40:54] <iamaphone> And on top of that this er visit means I am now broke for months since insurance doesn't get along with this hospital monopoly 
[08:41:36] <Vulpixbrew> ouchies
[08:41:58] <iamaphone> Ns to top it off I'm so frazzled that I nearly plowed into a car at 50mph because I spaced out 
[08:43:45] <iamaphone> She's ok but she's in a crazy amount of pain WO I need these meds for her
