[05:48:37] <metal_craze> this isn't my usual thing as it is very hard to get right
[05:48:39] <Artimae> A little faster and it could be Venice Rooftops from the AC2 soundtrack
[05:48:43] <Spritefire> this bit reminds me of that little soft part in "Where I Belong"
[05:48:48] <Snowblitz[EoH]> I think I would play Monster Hunter while listening to this!
[05:48:49] <Flutterknight> That was something I *really* would've liked to do at BronyCon. Play the pony DDR someone had setup, but I wore a dress all 3 days. XD
[05:48:54] <BronyDanceParty> Nice
[05:48:58] <metal_craze> that sounded beautiful

[05:53:54] <Flutterknight> I used to be really good at DDR. I was a heavy doubles player when I was in better shape in my early 20's.
[05:54:08] <Artimae> But Starborne is a beast on DDR

[05:54:09] <Flutterknight> I need a girlfriend, I hate being alone.
[05:54:16] <RockinBrony> Good instrumental songs are really hard to compose, this one was very well made
[05:54:17] <Spritefire> starborne IS best on DDR
[05:54:24] <Spritefire> but my girlfriend gave her a run for her money
[05:54:26] <ForestRain[EoH]> Yes she is.

[06:12:10] <CitizenSmiley> Not my kind of music but puttine personal opinion aside.. These songs are really well made and sound great!!
[06:12:12] <Flutterknight> Yeah, kinda, Fritzy.
[06:12:13] <Snowblitz[EoH]> I'm so confused!!!
[06:12:19] <Infinitepony[EoH]> FritzyBeat[EoH]: that's your inner Canadian

[06:12:39] <Cyril> thanks CitizenSmiley! that means a lot!
[06:12:42] <One-Trick> -10c is too cold -.-
[06:12:42] <Flutterknight> I need to look at Tsitra's stuff again. I stopped looking at it because his stuff felt stagnant to me for a while.
[06:12:48] <Cyril> if you know folks who like this sort of stuff let them know
[06:12:49] <Flutterknight> Good to see he's branching out.

[06:13:55] <Flutterknight> I haven't been to Florida in at least 15 years.
[06:13:55] <FritzyBeat[EoH]> these lyrics remind me of the type of meaning Rush would go for~

[06:16:34] <Spritefire> as much as id LOVE to be horse famous enough and be recognized throughout the fandom, ive realized that these "horse famous" folks are just...you know...us
[06:16:50] <Artimae> I'll take horsefame anyday
[06:17:01] <Flutterknight> I'd like to have people recognize me, if only to feel like someone actually cares about anything I do.
[06:17:02] <Spritefire> they just happen to have a talent that some of us dont have
[06:17:03] <Artimae> Only to alleviate the fanfiction side of things
[06:17:09] <Artimae> So much porn over there...
[06:17:09] <Araxnus> Sooooooooooooo
[06:17:13] <Snowblitz[EoH]> Spritefire: Fame is meh. Horse fame isn't really anything. It's like High School with popular kids. 
[06:17:22] <Spritefire> I do Lets Plays and make pony references while doing so

[06:38:41] <Spritefire> "Hey BlackGryph0n. Quick question for you. See, my girlfriend here has a huge crush on you and is way too shy to ask, so she wants to know if she could have your autograph"
[06:39:04] <Flutterknight> And you're still alive? I commend your girlfriend's restraint.
[06:39:11] <Spritefire> i know, right? XD
[06:39:35] <Spritefire> well i DID spoil her that weekend sooooo...eh
[06:39:35] <DinkyBot> !muffinkiss
[06:39:35] * DerpyBot regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches DinkyBot, showing her most adorable kissing face
[06:39:36] <DinkyBot> EEEWWwwww! Momma, tha's gross .. but funny!!
[06:39:49] <Flutterknight> Hehe
[06:39:52] <MishaDash> Araxnus, you're now the second person to just tell me out of nowhere that my OC is hot.  D.Notive was the first.  At BronyCon.  While I was sitting outside in street clothes with no pony merch on, not even my BronyCon badge, having a cigarette.  He walks up to me and says, "Misha, I don't want to sound like a creep or anything, but your OC is really attractive."
[06:40:11] <Spritefire> only in the brony fandom, folks
[06:40:13] <Flutterknight> That does sounds like something D.Notive would do.
[06:40:17] <Swift> could be iinteresting to meet BlackGryph0n
[06:40:31] <Swift> or Feather
[06:40:35] <Spritefire> oh and i should mention that the next night she actually raved with blackgryphon
[06:40:41] <Spritefire> soooo it all turned out well XD
[06:40:49] <Swift> she has a great voice!
[06:40:53] <Flutterknight> I spent the entire con walking around with the guy dressed as Lyra with the cardboard sign this past year. XD
[06:41:01] <Araxnus> MishaDash: LOL. It is true. Also wow. Yeah d.notive is pretty cool like that.
[06:41:24] <Spritefire> who else did i meet....my favorite artist in the entire fandom
[06:41:31] <Flutterknight> Oh?
[06:41:34] <Spritefire> but um..im not sure if i can mention the artist name here
[06:41:47] <Flutterknight> Why wouldn't you be able to?
[06:41:54] <MishaDash> I never thought anyone with any sliver of fame would walk up to me and apologize for soundling like a creep before complimenting me about something.  Like, I honestly thought that would always go the other way around.
[06:42:02] <Spritefire> take a certain cowpony and just add an E and D at the end
[06:42:19] <Flutterknight> Hehe
[06:42:36] <Spritefire> flutter, you saw my skype avatar. need i say more?
[06:42:38] <Swift> although I'm more fan of Baasik
[06:42:43] <Flutterknight> Eeeeyup.
[06:42:52] * Heat_Wave eats Misha's OC.
[06:42:54] <MishaDash> The OC: http://i.imgur.com/gDY3VQP.png
[06:42:55] <Swift> I don' know why
[06:43:04] <Araxnus> MishaDash: Haha yeah :3
[06:43:08] <Heat_Wave> Wow, that is hot.
[06:43:15] <Flutterknight> IMmortal is pretty much my standard walking music at this point. ^_^
[06:43:23] <Spritefire> its the dark color combined with the color of the eyes and the bedroom eye look
[06:43:25] <Flutterknight> O_O
[06:43:30] <Flutterknight> Wow. Yeah. That's hot.
[06:43:30] <MishaDash> Vectorized: http://i.imgur.com/5XgcDfM.png
[06:43:32] <Spritefire> dark colors are often found to be more attractive, for some reason
[06:44:22] <Araxnus> Heat_Wave: I know right?! I am jelly of both your OCs ;)
[06:44:28] <MishaDash> And, for no reason whatsover, DJ Nexus (Fillydelphia Radio)'s OC in a donut: http://i.imgur.com/AppLRqE.jpg
[06:44:36] <Swift> my favorite song of the album IMmortal is "Quest"
[06:44:45] <Swift> and Taking Off
[06:44:47] <Flutterknight> Maybe that's why no one pays attention to things I do. All of my ponies are pretty much lighter colors.
[06:45:00] <Flutterknight> I love the entire album, but Quest is my favorite to sing.
[06:45:15] <Araxnus> Lol. Donut Poni.
[06:45:25] <Spritefire> http://matsuban.deviantart.com/art/Commission-Happy-Yearlings-514227653
[06:45:27] <Swift> Zero Gravity is great too
[06:45:31] <Flutterknight> I really need to find a time when there aren't many people home and try to record some singing.
[06:45:32] <MishaDash> Flutterknight, from what I can tell, it's either dark colors or white with a colorful mane (examples: Rarity herself, DoubleCleff's OC, etc)
[06:45:35] <Spritefire> i just had that commissioned recently. my OC and my girlfriends OC
[06:45:45] <Flutterknight> White with a colorful mane I sorta have.
[06:46:03] <MishaDash> (how could I miss Vinyl Scratch in that list...)
[06:46:09] <Flutterknight> My main OC is a white unicorn with a blonde mane with a rainbow stripe. :3

[06:46:20] <MishaDash> That... sounds Aryian.
[06:46:27] <MishaDash> Blue eyes, too? lol
[06:46:28] <Spritefire> except the rainbow part
[06:46:39] <Flutterknight> Know, though I do know the person behind "Aryanne" on FimFictions. >.>
[06:46:46] <Flutterknight> *No, though...
[06:47:10] <Flutterknight> Yes, blue eyes too. Actually most of my ponies ended up with blue eyes for whatever reason.
[06:47:10] <Spritefire> if i was on voice, id do a spot on german accent just for the irony
[06:47:23] <Swift> Flutterknight: Marie Sue? lol
[06:47:26] <Flutterknight> It's *probably* because I'm a sucker for blonde, blue eyed girls.
[06:47:27] <MishaDash> I'm going to share this image.  I would like you all to understand the importance of it, before I share why it's even more important for me: http://i.imgur.com/QvJKDtx.jpg
[06:47:28] <Flutterknight> No.
[06:47:32] <Araxnus> Not my OC but This is our Music and Radio OC for The Hill. Glimmer Aura <3 https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/551776478552023040/WTw6XvhU.png
[06:47:37] <Flutterknight> Not a Mary Sue. :P
[06:48:01] <MishaDash> Now... I never share my real name, but for the purposes of this I'm going to have to.  The movie Twilight.  Sparkly vampire and some girl who fell in love and an apple and a werewolf and an atrocious plot.
[06:48:15] <MishaDash> So... what's the vampire's name?  What's the werewolf's name?  Care to guess what my first AND middle names are?

[06:48:50] <Araxnus> Oh and Aerial Soundwaves of PVFM ia cute yet badflank https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-ad-B3IIAAXZ2m.png:large
[06:48:53] <Spritefire> the only way i remember those is from that stupid mcdonalds promotion they had a few years back
[06:49:03] <MishaDash> It was Burger King.
[06:49:04] <Spritefire> "team jacob" or "team edward"
[06:49:09] <Spritefire> was it BK?
[06:49:15] <Spritefire> eh. i can never keep the 2 straight
[06:49:34] <Flutterknight> I actually got so used to being called "FK" back when I streamed a lot that when I was deciding on what to change my name to after I transitioned, I had to make that my first two initials. XD
[06:49:36] <Spritefire> all i know is one chain had ponies and the other didnt XD
[06:49:36] <FritzyBeat[EoH]> c:
[06:49:36] <MishaDash> "Are you Team Edward?  Team Jacob?"  "I'm BOTH gorramit LEAVE ME ALONE!"
[06:49:42] *** FritzyBeat[EoH] is now known as FritzyBeat
[06:50:29] <Spritefire> its like that taco shell commercial..."why not both?"
[06:50:36] <Araxnus> lol. All this reminds me of is the fanfic "My Roommate is a Vampire" Team Vampire :3
[06:50:50] <MishaDash> Now, having this name wasn't bad.  However, whenever I got carded by a young girl I always hesitated.
[06:51:01] <MishaDash> ...and then it happened.
[06:51:01] <Flutterknight> Hehe
[06:51:22] <MishaDash> I swiped a credit card for a purchase at a fast food place.  The girl asks for my ID, which is good because I actually write on the back of my cards "See ID".
[06:51:40] <Spritefire> uh oh
[06:51:47] <Flutterknight> Just think, before long the frequency of kids named "Edward", "Jacob", and "Bella" is going to spike drastically. XD
[06:51:50] <Araxnus> This is fun.
[06:51:55] <MishaDash> She sees my name... [redacted] EDWARD JACOB as it's brazenly placed on bold letters of a FLorida driver's license.  Her eyes light up.  A grin spreads across her lips.  Oh god no.
[06:52:10] <Spritefire> XD
[06:52:54] <MishaDash> "oh my god oh my god oh my god so which one are you!? You're Edward, aren't you?  Yeah, you're not hot enough to be Jacob."  "...can I just get my chicken sandwich please?"
[06:52:56] <Flutterknight> I'm thankful no one seems to pay the slightest attention to my ID when I've had to show it, because it's old and still shows my old (still legal becasue money) names and "male" picture. =/
[06:53:17] <Spritefire> Misha, this is a classic case of Schadenfreude
[06:53:29] <Flutterknight> XD
[06:53:33] <Spritefire> because im damn near dying over here XD
[06:53:40] <MishaDash> godzundheit
[06:54:06] <Araxnus> Pay with cash everywhere ;)
[06:54:15] <Spritefire> also quick poll, raise your hoof if you now have the song from Avenue Q stuck in your head
[06:54:19] <MishaDash> Since moving to NJ/NYC I haven't had to deal with it.
[06:54:35] <MishaDash> Spritefire, Well I do now!  THANKS.
[06:54:37] <Flutterknight> I would love to live in/near NYC.
[06:54:43] <Spritefire> youre QUITE welcome, Misha :3
[06:54:52] <Flutterknight> I'm a city girl. I currently live in the middle of nowhere. =/
[06:55:04] <MishaDash> I was supposed to see Avenue Q with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day.
[06:55:18] <Flutterknight> Yeah, I'm not sure which song you meant, but I have "The Internet Is For Porn" in my head. >.>
[06:55:25] <MishaDash> Then New Years happened and I was forced to admit to myself that... yeah... I'm gay. lol
[06:55:32] <Spritefire> lol flutters 
[06:55:45] <Spritefire> you should come on up here. Philadelphia is awesome
[06:55:49] <Flutterknight> Hehe
[06:56:25] <Flutterknight> I want to live up north in a major city. As an atheist lesbian trans woman, the south is NOT where I want to be. XD
[06:56:38] <Flutterknight> And I like being able to walk places.
[06:56:42] <Spritefire> again, come to philly
[06:56:52] <Araxnus> Northwest. I say Seattle.
[06:57:04] <Infinitepony[EoH]> aww Flutterknight, the South ai't so bad
[06:57:11] <MishaDash> ...okay, Spritefire, in South Philly on the waterfront is an outdoor club/bar/lounge/something... and I cannot for the life of me remember the name. Are you familiar with it?
[06:57:15] <Infinitepony[EoH]> just gotta get out of the rural areas
[06:57:17] <Flutterknight> It is when you have a descriptor like mine. XD
[06:57:25] <Spritefire> theres a few clubs and lounges 
[06:57:33] <MishaDash> This was right on the water.
[06:57:39] <Spritefire> hmmmm...
[06:57:40] <MishaDash> Had like 3 different outdoor bars.
[06:58:51] <Spritefire> the only clubs im aware of are the strip clubs...Club Risque in particular

[07:00:24] <Spritefire> theres a dave and busters
[07:00:45] <Flutterknight> I'd like Dave & Busters if I could find one with a decent arcade.

[07:13:04] <Spritefire> short girls are best ^^
[07:13:21] <Spritefire> especially when cuddling ^^
[07:13:24] <Flutterknight> Hehe.
[07:13:37] <Flutterknight> Cuddling is nice. :3
[07:13:57] <MishaDash> Cuddling is extremely underrated.
[07:13:59] <Spritefire> although despite being so small..if she sleeps in my bed....she somehow takes up the whole damn thing >_<
[07:14:09] <MishaDash> guilty
[07:14:13] <Flutterknight> I know that feeling.
[07:14:19] <Spritefire> i have no idea how she does it 
[07:14:33] <Flutterknight> The last girl I slept with was probably 5'4" and she managed to take up most of the bed.
[07:14:39] <MishaDash> 6'2", 160lbs, 30" waist, consumes an entire queen sized bed.
[07:14:46] <Spritefire> XD
[07:15:37] <Flutterknight> That sounds like me, except I'm shorter, 10lbs heavier, and have a slightly bigger waist. (I've got the...err..."assets" to make it look decent, though. :P)
[07:15:48] <Spritefire> if she wasnt asleep i would drag her backside to this chat or into a skype call or something
[07:15:57] <Flutterknight> I can totally take up an entire queen size bed, though. :P
[07:16:17] <MishaDash> My boyfriend, however... would be the Silent Bob to my Jay.  Shorter, much stalkier, and literally consumes half the queen sized bed with his arms tucked in.  But I don't mind... something about being wedged between him and the wall... <3
[07:16:30] <Flutterknight> Hehe.
[07:16:47] <Spritefire> yeah minor problem with that here. my bed isnt against a wall
[07:16:48] <Flutterknight> I miss having someone to sleep with.
[07:17:33] <Spritefire> awww. i would totally offer a friendly cuddle ^^
[07:17:55] <Flutterknight> I'm not great at "friendly" cuddles. XD
[07:17:58] <MishaDash> It's a terrible thing to miss.  I was single for years, entirely because of a lack of trying.  When I was in Florida, I wanted to come out but... it's Florida.  They just (and very grudgingly) passed gay marriage rights.

[07:18:55] <Spritefire> random thought (this is how my head works when im sleep deprived)
[07:18:58] <Flutterknight> I desperately need to escape the south.
[07:18:58] <MishaDash> ...they want to make it legal for someone to sue a trans person who doesn't use their biological restrooms in public... and if the establishment knows the person is trans and allows them to use their gender identified restroom, they could get sued as well.
[07:19:05] <Spritefire> Misha, i talked to you once before...a looooooong time ago
[07:19:16] <Flutterknight> Yeah. I saw. I'd slap that congressman if I saw him.

[07:21:45] <MishaDash> Spritefire, I barely remember, but I do remember something about that.
[07:22:04] <Spritefire> lol we need to get together at the next bronycon and like..go out for dinner or something
[07:22:11] <MishaDash> Problem is I've been heavily involved with Fillydelphia Radio for about two years and anything music related just gets dumped in to that category in my mind.
[07:22:18] <Spritefire> just like..everyone in this convo
[07:22:25] <MishaDash> hehe
[07:22:26] <MishaDash> agreed

[07:22:56] <Flutterknight> Well, I really do need to get to bed now. Night, y'all. Feel free to hit me up on Skype or Twitter or whatever if you want. Searching "Fey Prevesk" is basically guaranteed to find me nearly anywhere. ^_^
[07:22:56] <MishaDash> Wait... I thought I said I'd never go to BronyCon again after two years in Baltimore...
[07:23:12] <Spritefire> night flutter
[07:23:13] <MishaDash> oh you are so getting followed
[07:23:28] <Flutterknight> Searching Flutterknight tends to work too, though less reliably.
[07:23:43] <Spritefire> but aye. last year my girlfriend and i went out to dinner with a group from the DC bronies
[07:23:45] <Flutterknight> I'm definitely that on dA, though, as shown by the link of Heat Wave earlier. XD
[07:24:04] <MishaDash> I found youuuuu
[07:24:14] <Flutterknight> I saw! I found you back. :P
[07:24:17] <MishaDash> hehehe
[07:24:29] <MishaDash> Last year...
[07:24:35] <Flutterknight> Okay. Bed. Those sexy lesbian dreams won't dream themselves. :P
[07:24:45] <Flutterknight> Gnight
[07:24:48] <Spritefire> well..last year as in 3 months ago
[07:24:49] *** Quits: Flutterknight (rdgqyruhrtp@Pony-jjsb59.ip.windstream.net) (Connection closed)
[07:24:51] <MishaDash> okay so I made arrangements with the Fillyradio crew and the EoH crew to meet up at the Uno's place in that mall-thing down the street from BronyCon.
[07:24:52] <Spritefire> 4 months ago..
[07:24:54] <Spritefire> whatever it was
[07:25:03] <Spritefire> oh yeah that sort of mini mall
[07:25:19] <MishaDash> While waiting for our large party to get seats, I sat at the bar and had a drink.  Our table was ready before I finished and everyone moved to sit except me and like two others.
[07:25:48] <MishaDash> Then our waitress comes to me and asks, "Are you Misha?"  "Yes..."  "We have a problem."  "What's that?"  "They're fighting over which table you're going to sit at."
[07:26:03] <Spritefire> *facehoof*
[07:26:09] <MishaDash> ...and they were actually arguing over it.
[07:26:43] <Spritefire> i dont even
[07:26:52] <MishaDash> So I look at my group.  One table is mostly minors.  The other is not.  So then I say, "Okay gents... I believe I made it a rule that whoever sits at my table has to try a glass of Sangria, and I only see one table legal enough to do so.  YOINK!"
[07:27:49] <MishaDash> But yeah, I also have a lot of /bad/ memories of Baltimore and it's made me wary of attending yet another BronyCon there.
[07:28:02] <Spritefire> *drool* sangria...
[07:28:23] <MishaDash> But... then I realized... most of my bad memories were from my extremely anxious girlfriend who couldn't be away from my side for more than 3 seconds, even when she wanted to hang out with her own friends.
[07:28:38] <Spritefire> oh thats where i got lucky at
[07:28:55] <Spritefire> my girlfriend was perfectly fine with chilling with some of her other friends that were there
[07:29:10] <MishaDash> You are lucky.
[07:29:27] <Spritefire> hell she was eager to play against starborne on DDR...and she nearly beat star o_o
[07:29:27] <MishaDash> This year, if I go, I'll be going it alone.  My boyfriend, due to his own stupidity in the past, is on probation so he can't leave the state.
[07:30:05] <MishaDash> I have not played DDR since 2005.
[07:30:19] <MishaDash> And I know there's no possible way I can beat CandyStar on Heavy anymore.
[07:30:33] <Muffin_Spectacles> I remember DDR....back before I let myself go. I was often entrancing my coworkers playing on the DDR machine at my workplace a decade ago.
[07:30:52] <Spritefire> ive never played DDR nor do i intend to try..Rock Band is my game
[07:31:25] <MishaDash> I worked at a call center when DDR came out and I got hooked.  I'd combine all of my breaks into one big hour and a half long lunch, then go to the arcade 5 minutes away and play about $5 worth of games at $0.50 each.
[07:31:49] <Spritefire> lol wow
[07:32:01] <MishaDash> I... may have broke one of the pads getting over zealous during one Dynamite Rave set...
[07:32:05] <Spritefire> XD
[07:32:31] <Spritefire> ok its settled. if we're both able to get to bronycon, we have to meet up somehow lol
[07:33:21] <Spritefire> it'll be the first year i'll have "Spritefire" on my badge instead of "shaun"
[07:33:27] <MishaDash> Doing doubles, naturally, and using the bars to bounce myself off a back to a forward when I slipped and all of my weight hit the left arrow of the right pad and I... kinda went through it... a bit...
[07:34:20] <Spritefire> *shrug* i just dont have the coordination for ddr. simple as that
[07:34:22] <MishaDash> Though to the arcade's credit, they had the pad fixed the next day.  I don't even know how but it must not have been the first time.

We were playing just to pass time before GameStop opened and something fast was the next song... The Offspring maybe?  Greenday?  SOmething 90's and grungy and fun.  And then he broke the foot pedal.  We kind of looked at each other, then he said "Maybe it's time to

[15:40:25] <Sketchy_Sounds> "The wise speak when they have something to say. Fools speak because they must say something."

[15:40:47] <duskchaser> thanks 
[15:41:04] <duskchaser> so how are you
[15:41:05] <Sketchy_Sounds> I would advise you to put it into practice.
[15:41:19] <duskchaser> errrr ok
[15:41:29] <Sketchy_Sounds> Or put in simpler terms, if you have nothing of worth to say, do not say anything.

[19:01:17] <FruitNibbler> Almost all military stuff operates on a proprietary code of a heavily modified Linux-like code 
[19:01:52] <FruitNibbler> They aren't stupid to use any of the systems "as is"

[19:04:02] * chibi_shou yet again helps
[19:04:08] <StrawberryDitz> Amusingly an article in one of the old issues of Natural History I got from the library for free, Neil DeGrasse Tyson claims that humanity is actually spurred onwards in scientific development primarily by nay-sayers and that is why planes and things became possible. Lots of people figured they wouldn't be possible, that humans belonged on the ground, etc. He says the fact that everyone was...
[19:04:11] <StrawberryDitz> ...optimistic instead of pessimistic about space travel is why it hit a brick wall and never developed as far as everyone thought it would.

[19:04:45] <RandomNinja> yeah nothing motivates as well as someone saying you can't do it
[19:05:28] <FruitNibbler> You can't do 60 pushups RandomNinja !!!
[19:05:30] <StrawberryDitz> It's actually an interesting concept though. Like if someone other than yourself sets out this amazing goal that they think you can reach from seeing your abilities, you burn yourself out rapidly attempting to reach it and then never do.
[19:05:33] <RandomNinja> pls
[19:06:10] <FruitNibbler> Yeah passion for something is a better motivator in a long run
[19:06:27] <Cloud_Zephyr> im gonna need a screw extractor

[19:56:05] <StrawberryDitz> My main issue in the town I live in now is the mail people have no consistent time. Where I used to live it was like clockwork.
[19:56:14] <RandomNinja> partly because of EU free trade zone
[19:56:18] <StrawberryDitz> Now I'm sometimes lucky if they come before 2PM EST.
[19:56:27] <WildSoft> The parcel was to big for the mail slot. So the mailman (or woman) wrote a mailnotice that I could get it at the nearest postal service (in Sweden it's in like food stores, kiosks and stuff). It was there they hadn't scanned it on arrival
[19:56:30] <OctaveSymphony> Only annoyance was a few months when everything I ordered had yellow tape with "This package has been inspected by customs" on it
[19:56:31] <RandomNinja> ew non-GMT
[19:56:50] <RandomNinja> btw WildSoft did you get any customs fees?
[19:56:56] <StrawberryDitz> 7Pm GMT if you want.
[19:57:16] <OctaveSymphony> I've only had to pay customs once \o/ when buying electronics from the US
[19:57:22] <WildSoft> RandomNinja nope
[19:57:26] <OctaveSymphony> Other stuff from the US was customs free
[19:57:45] <WildSoft> nothing extra
[19:57:49] <RandomNinja> I think it's mostly value dependent
[19:58:00] <WildSoft> not sure
[19:58:03] <OctaveSymphony> Methinks all electronics are subject to fees though
[19:58:08] <WildSoft> think it is what kind of stuff it is
[19:58:11] <OctaveSymphony> Was some special fee on it
[19:58:29] <StrawberryDitz> They might be boombs.
[19:58:38] <RandomNinja> boombs?
[19:58:41] <WildSoft> I've paid nothing more then the price on HB
