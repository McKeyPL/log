[16:28:31] <PinkiePieBot> [ Talk:Shielded cable - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[16:29:34] <DataByte> if you do, then i'd say normally it'd be best to do it from one end
[16:33:01] <DataByte> if you have a situation that could need it (say, large e/m field nearby?), then you'd really want to have one end bonded in some fashion.. too much static buildup can actually jump through insulation

[16:38:18] <DataByte> as for shielding from an EMP... build your house 50ft below ground, with a 1/4 inch steel shell over 1/2 inch lead over a 1/2 steel inside, and your own nuclear reactor (since solar panels would be fried by an EMP)
[16:39:31] <tiwake> shielding a house isnt that big of a deal... rolls of steel can be obtained cheaply and easily
[16:40:17] <tiwake> the thing I'm wondering about is EMP traveling through the power lines
[16:40:33] <DataByte> why i suggested your own power ;)
[16:40:48] <DataByte> surge arrestors can only handle so much
[16:41:34] <tiwake> I wonder if they make something like an opto-isolator for a main power thing
[16:41:46] <DataByte> they'll destroy themselves trying to save your equipment, but enough voltage can actually jump the air gaps
[16:42:03] <DataByte> and i've never heard of something like that.. well, microwave, maybe

[16:52:52] <DataByte> no, not too efficient
[16:53:52] <MistVeil> What would be a good price for a HP Proliant ML150 G5? It has 2 320GB HDDs, a total of 5 GB RAM (all modules occupied), and an Intel Xeon E5205 Quad-core 1.86Ghz CPU.

[17:15:13] <tiwake> actually, most of the time I'm too lazy to shave, so I have a beard thing going on right now
[17:15:34] <DataByte> i used a beard trimmer for a while, and jumped to straight edge
[17:15:51] <DataByte> don't like safety razors that much
[17:15:53] <tiwake> I kinda started with a straight edge
[17:16:08] <tiwake> well
[17:16:10] <tiwake> kinda
[17:16:39] <tiwake> these days if I want to shave I go half way and just use some clipper blades
[17:16:57] <DataByte> my dad showed me a safety.. i didn't like that it felt how little control i had over the blade
