[22:00:41] <iamalion> omfg i just found the solution to an issue we have been having for a while
[22:00:42] <iamalion> WOOT
[22:00:55] <iamalion> Wow so that totally worked! Basically what was happening, is for some reason it had a reserved IP on the GW. checking its address on the GW, it had an IPV6 one, but no IPV4. Not even an apipa one. I looked at the reservation and it was blank. So I had him disable ipv6 on the laptop, and then tried to set that mac addr to dhcp but it just wouldnt take effect. Ended up just setting an ip in the static field, he reconnected, and boom internet access. G
