She also brought up how my cousin has been failing to grow past a patchy stubble. I'm amused that I barely have to try to grow a beard that the ladies adore

[19:26:19] <OmarianVolcae> I was playing with a bunch of S4s yesterday.
[19:26:22] <OmarianVolcae> And I beat them all.

[19:29:45] * OmarianVolcae licks his fox allllll the way up his spine.
[19:37:48] * Vulpixbrew shivers and blushes deeply
[19:40:29] <RNGsus> I told a friend that he should go south and ill stay in a town, and when he doesnt go south and he stays in the town im in and i panic kill him on sight everyone hates me
[19:40:39] <Frosty> Awww son. The fat frog is so good.
[19:43:48] <Frosty> None of you know what that is, so lemme lay some srs shit on you guys. The Fat Frog is this sammich, right? Hoogie bun. Yeah. Some Irish Fries, and some chicen fingers. That ain't all, tho. It also has three different cheeses on it. You think that's enough cheese? No? No problem, because there are also some mozz stics on to the chicen fingers. And just when you think they're done, BOOM! Special sauce. And I ain't talkin' about 
[19:43:48] <Frosty> jizz. That's a byproduct produced when you take a bite of this fuckin' delicious monstrocity.
[19:45:51] <Frosty> Oh, and did I forget to mention bacon?!
[19:51:51] <Vulpixbrew> shit frosty I just ate and that made me hunbgry
[19:52:05] <Frosty> f'real tho.
[19:52:08] <Frosty> It's amazing
[19:52:28] <iamalion> that sounds good
[19:52:38] <iamalion> just make sure it follows the code Frosty
[19:52:40] <iamalion> Article I, Section B, Line Item xii, clearly states that a "sandwich shall have not less than two (2) separate, detached, and autonomous segments of bread or any other form of a starchy, bread-like product, inbywhich the contents of said sandwich are adequately secured for ingestion."
[19:53:14] <iamalion> that sandwich sounds a bit extreme so we  need to be cautios
[19:55:05] <Frosty> They were not adequately secured. Until they put the toothpicks in it.
[19:55:49] <iamalion> good good
[20:00:48] <Vulpixbrew> I tell you what i did one time, I took a pound and half of ground beef, mixed it in some BBQ sauce, some Stubbs dry rub and juice from a habanero, with chopped up bacon, I then weaved a bacon matt, oh yes I went there, and I cooked all that shit in the oven, now for my buns I just couldn't use any plain old buns I used 2 Red baron personal pizzas topped with pepperoni and to top it 
[20:00:48] <Vulpixbrew> off at the last minute the burger got more sauce and a massive cheese topping then back in the oven just to melt the cheese
[20:02:19] <Frosty> I lold at the pizzas.
[20:03:08] <Vulpixbrew> to this day it is still one of the best things I cooked
[20:04:12] <Frosty> I never coo. Cooing is for girls.
[20:04:18] <Frosty> Cook*
[20:04:24] <Frosty> And Thaostra, apparently

[20:34:47] <princesssluttershy> I wouldn't call her hot... But shes not ugly
[20:35:46] <Frosty> I mean, sure. You wouldn't call your own sister hot. But would others describe her as such?
[20:35:59] <princesssluttershy> Maybe?
[20:36:08] <Frosty> She 18 yet?
