[01:18:19] <ShivalPonyWolf> problem is that its often used on minors withotu cocnent becuase its not needed for your own child

[01:25:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> to find anything useful
[01:25:29] <Colgate> it would have to be fairly targeted to get useful stuff

[06:15:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats why glue records exist

[06:15:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> they are jsut NS records but they get put into .com. zone
[06:15:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> or whatever the zone is above your domain
[06:16:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> they need to exist as A records and NS records on your domain to

[06:23:22] <Moonlightning> …meh, I guess requiring that of servers and clients would be a big, breaking change
[06:23:35] <Phase> that's what they do isn't it?
[06:23:56] <ShivalPonyWolf> Moonlightning: becuase if its a circulr query they dont know where to go its why the info has to exist in the parent zone
[06:25:09] <Moonlightning> ShivalPonyWolf: but if the servers were required to additionally return the address records for the nameservers, and the clients were required to understand that, they would just…/have/ the information they needed.
[06:25:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> ~becuase that would then break regular lookup if your name servers were not on your own domain
[06:25:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> like is the normal case
[06:26:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> it would also then start returning large records and going up to the root servers too much

[07:24:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> Moonlightning: from my undersatnding its all really the same thing
[07:24:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> its just making sure the parent zone has the NS records for the domain you are after
[07:25:19] <Moonlightning> Yeah, but that's dirty and wouldn't be necessary if the standard mandated behavior like I've shown
[07:25:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> but if your hosting the zone under the same zone
[07:25:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> how does it know the adress of the server to get the zone from
[07:28:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> what your showing is exactly what a glue record is a record in com's zone for ns0 and ns1 .example.com
[07:28:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> and the ip address they point to
[07:29:01] *** Joins: LightningCrash (lightning@Pony-35aoef.ph.cox.net)
[07:29:44] <ShivalPonyWolf>     ns0.example.com AAAA 2001:db8:ecc5:abb1:4e53::
[07:29:44] <ShivalPonyWolf>     ns1.example.com AAAA 2001:db8:ecc5:abb1:4e53::1
[07:29:44] <ShivalPonyWolf>     ns0.example.com A 192.0.2.78
[07:29:44] <ShivalPonyWolf>     ns1.example.com A 192.0.2.79
[07:29:47] <ShivalPonyWolf> that is the glue part
[07:30:24] <Moonlightning> Right, but if the standard required those records to be served on request for the example.com nameservers, there would be no need to serve them from the com zone
[07:31:18] <ShivalPonyWolf> but what if example2.com was the NS record
[07:31:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> or even more normal if it was in .net's zone
[07:31:58] <ShivalPonyWolf> it means if ns0.example2.com changed its ip then everyone who used that would have to update their NS record
[07:31:59] <Moonlightning> example.com NS example2.com  # this?
[07:32:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> it would mean the entire .com zone would need to be dynamicly updatable
[07:32:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> depending on other zones
[07:32:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> glue is designed to be static
[07:33:24] <Moonlightning> No? Because NS records are always hostnames
[07:33:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> example.com NS ns0.example2.net
[07:33:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> yes exactly
[07:33:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> a glue record is for mapping that to an IP
[07:33:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> so if you included it always by defualt
[07:33:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> youw oudl need to know that ip all the time
[07:33:54] <ShivalPonyWolf> and that ip is outside your control
[07:33:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> as its on anotehr domain
[07:34:08] <Moonlightning> Well, since glue is designed to be static… :p
[07:34:18] <ShivalPonyWolf> exactly
[07:34:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> so you want to implemnt dynamic into a static entry
[07:34:31] <Moonlightning> I don't see changes taking long to propagate as a problem.
[07:34:39] <Moonlightning> They do, anyway.
[07:34:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> its a problem when its in the .com level
[07:35:19] <Moonlightning> Clients will get old address records anyway, in other contexts!
[07:35:22] <Moonlightning> Happens all the time.
[07:36:07] <ShivalPonyWolf> remember how much load .com is under as well. if it had to constantly go out to other domains to find the ip of the NS record for each domain under it
[07:36:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> glue is optional becuase most of the time its not needed

[07:37:47] <Nelly> thanks Pinkie
[07:37:47] <PinkiePieBot> My pleasure.
[07:39:12] <Moonlightning> ShivalPonyWolf: but it has to do that anyway, because it has to know what to serve if it gets asked for…
[07:39:17] <Moonlightning> I'm confused 6_9
[07:39:44] <Moonlightning> com needs to know the address records for ns*.example.com
[07:39:53] <ShivalPonyWolf> no it doesnt
[07:40:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> only if ns*.example.com is the same domain its being queried for
[07:40:25] <Moonlightning> Let's say it is.
[07:40:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> then thats why glue exists
[07:40:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> if not it just tells the client to go look up example2.com
[07:40:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> and the client goes over to example2.com
[07:41:03] <SilverEagle> evening techpones
[07:42:04] <Moonlightning> Well, just slap a fairly long TTL on those address records
[07:42:26] <ShivalPonyWolf> how does the data get there in the 1st place then
[07:42:48] <Moonlightning> Same way the rest of the records for example.com got to the come NS
[07:42:50] <Moonlightning> com NS *
[07:43:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> the records for example.com arnt in .com
[07:43:17] <Moonlightning> Then how does anypony look up example.com?
[07:43:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> .com has a zone record saying example.com exists and where its NS records are
[07:43:31] <ShivalPonyWolf> but it doesnt know aynthing else
[07:43:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> or any IP's 
[07:43:53] <Moonlightning> Is that true of all TLDs?
[07:43:56] <ShivalPonyWolf> yes
[07:43:56] <Moonlightning> Or specific to com?
[07:43:59] <SilverEagle> oh lord I've stepped into some sort of DNS discussino
[07:44:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> its for everyy zone
[07:44:03] <Moonlightning> Then how does DNS work? :P
[07:44:04] * SilverEagle steps back out quietly
[07:44:13] <ShivalPonyWolf> becuase . has static entries to ips
[07:44:21] <ShivalPonyWolf> that every dns server knows about
[07:44:34] <Moonlightning> I don't know anything about example.com, but I need address records for foo.example.com
[07:44:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> its the master list
[07:44:40] <Moonlightning> Who the hell do I talk to?
[07:44:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> you 1st talk to example.com for foo.example .com
[07:44:59] <ShivalPonyWolf> if you dont knowwhere example.com is
[07:45:01] <ShivalPonyWolf> you ask .com
[07:45:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> if you dont knwo where .com is you ask .
[07:45:07] <Moonlightning> But com doesn't know :P
[07:45:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> com knows the NS entry
[07:45:21] <ShivalPonyWolf> but not any of the specific ips
[07:45:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> unless there is a glue record
[07:45:30] <Moonlightning> com only knows that example.com exists and its nameserver is foo-host.com
[07:45:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> yes
[07:45:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> unless there is a glue recrod
[07:45:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> then it knows wehre ns0.example.com is
[07:45:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> and it gives that to the client
[07:46:00] <Moonlightning> com knows foo-host.com exists and that its nameserver is ns0.foo-host.com
[07:46:02] <Moonlightning> but nothing else
[07:46:09] <ShivalPonyWolf> no
[07:46:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> in that case it also has a glue recorrd for the ip
[07:46:24] <Moonlightning> …okay then!
[07:46:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> but if its foo-host.com ns to ns0.example.com
[07:46:30] <ShivalPonyWolf> then it doesnt have the ip info
[07:46:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> and your client tgoes and asks example.com for ns0.example .com
[07:46:46] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[07:46:56] <Moonlightning> so it DOES have IPs.
[07:47:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> only in the event its its own nameservers
[07:47:10] <Moonlightning> And it has NS records for everything.
[07:47:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> and thus glue recrood
[07:47:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> foo-host.com's entry in .com wont have a glue record for ns0.example.com
[07:47:55] <Moonlightning> Right.
[07:48:06] <ShivalPonyWolf> ybut .com will have a glue record for ns0.example.com
[07:48:11] <ShivalPonyWolf> but it cant automaticly link those queries
[07:48:16] <ShivalPonyWolf> it requires the client to make 2 queries
[07:48:19] <Moonlightning> Why not?
[07:48:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> becuase it might not be authoritive for the doamin in question
[07:48:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> so it doesnt lik arbitarily
[07:48:55] <ShivalPonyWolf> link
[07:49:15] <ShivalPonyWolf> you queried for foo-host.com
[07:49:22] <ShivalPonyWolf> it cant return anything outside of foo-host.com
[07:49:32] <Moonlightning> foo-host.com NS ns0.foo-host.com
[07:49:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> dns servers cant return anything outside the domain queried for
[07:49:50] <Moonlightning> com should return address records with the NS records in this case
[07:49:53] <ShivalPonyWolf> unless its a cname record
[07:50:10] <Phase> some clients accepted non-authoritive responses, it's called cache poisoning
[07:50:12] <ShivalPonyWolf> yes becuase in that situation you would have a glue record
[07:50:38] <Phase> worse, i think some caching servers accepted them
[07:50:48] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase: yes its called RR records
[07:50:50] <Moonlightning> Why not always return glue records with NS records?
[07:50:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> or additional responses
[07:51:10] <ShivalPonyWolf> becuase glue records are only required whne a ns server for a domain is on the same domain
[07:51:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> and aas i said before it cant return outside of the domain you query for
[07:52:11] <Phase> some servers probably do accept arbitrary responses
[07:52:21] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase: yeah as i said RR records
[07:52:22] <Phase> wana be .com for a bunch of people? find one of those
[07:52:40] <Phase> ShivalPonyWolf, arbitrary NS records
[07:52:52] <Moonlightning> but you DID query for that domain
[07:52:56] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase: possibly but that would be bad design
[07:53:01] <Moonlightning> foo-host.com NS  # query
[07:53:09] <Moonlightning> ; *
[07:53:22] <Moonlightning> ; Reply should include NS and address records
[07:53:29] <ShivalPonyWolf> Moonlightning: and if the NS record for food-host.com is ns0.foo-host.com
[07:53:32] <ShivalPonyWolf> then it returns the glue record
[07:53:44] <ShivalPonyWolf> but if foo-home.com NS ns0.example.com
[07:53:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> then example.com is outside foo-host.com
[07:53:58] <Moonlightning> …okay, let's start being consistent.
[07:54:06] <Phase> ShivalPonyWolf, yeah, it was before i understood dns that i read about it but that's more or less what i read was happening
[07:54:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> i typoed alot there
[07:54:53] <Phase> may have just been A records
[07:55:24] <Phase> ShivalPonyWolf, http://goo.gl/ybZdLQ
[07:55:34] <ShivalPonyWolf> lol
[07:56:10] <ShivalPonyWolf> Moonlightning: remember a glue record is just an A record inside the parent zone
[07:56:17] <ShivalPonyWolf> its not a special type
[07:56:24] <Moonlightning> Yeah.
[07:56:34] <Moonlightning> (address record, not necessarily A)
[07:56:36] <ShivalPonyWolf> you cant have A records under a domain that doesnt match
[07:56:41] <ShivalPonyWolf> A or AAAA
[07:56:52] <ShivalPonyWolf> i dont think it can be Cname

[07:59:26] <SilverEagle> oh thank god it's you borg
[07:59:39] <SilverEagle> all the techie chats are either silent or talking about C++ memory allocation or DNS
[07:59:42] <SilverEagle> I'm losing my mind
[07:59:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> WeAreBorg: does it show up in disk manager
[07:59:52] <WeAreBorg> it does not show up
[07:59:53] <Colgate> what's wrong with DNS? >.>
[07:59:57] <ShivalPonyWolf> then its buggered
[08:00:00] <Moonlightning> C++ memory allocation is interesting
[08:00:04] <SilverEagle> Colgate it's boring
[08:00:14] <Moonlightning> ShivalPonyWolf, WeAreBorg: I dunno about that…try messing with it on a *nix system first :p
[08:00:17] <SilverEagle> I don't care if it's the backbone of the internet
[08:00:18] <Phase> borg better have backups
[08:00:37] <SilverEagle> also yes borg have you spun up one of those linux liveCD recovery tool images on it
[08:00:39] <ShivalPonyWolf> a drive will spin up as soon as it has power. doesnt mean the controler is good or there hasnt been a major failure
[08:00:55] <Colgate> critical stuff being boring, eh, that's fine by me :P
[08:00:59] <WeAreBorg> ok second question, I have a bunch of dynamic invalid disks 2 of which were in a windows sw raid
[08:01:02] <Phase> WeAreBorg, is it random like normal reading or does it have a pattern
[08:01:12] <Phase> ah, you're skilled
[08:01:15] <Phase> does it show up in disk manager?
[08:01:17] <WeAreBorg> Phase, it might be a pattern
[08:01:45] <ShivalPonyWolf> possible corruption of the header data but thats very open issue
[08:02:30] <WeAreBorg> phase, it does not show up in disk manager, disk manager spins upon refresh while it is connected
[08:03:17] <Phase> dead sectors maybe?
[08:03:42] <Phase> probably need linux for this, not sure if you can work with malfunctioning disks on windows
[08:04:25] <ShivalPonyWolf> does it show up in device manager is the next point
[08:04:33] <ShivalPonyWolf> or is it floating around as an unkonwn device or not at all
[08:05:10] <Moonlightning> You're wasting time at this point. Get a *nix system up and attack the disk to it.
[08:05:14] <WeAreBorg> I am using a usb adapter and it does show up once powered on
[08:05:26] <Moonlightning> Oh okay.
[08:05:33] <Phase> usb->sata?
[08:05:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> oh i hate those things
[08:05:50] <WeAreBorg> usb->sata shows up in device manager
[08:06:02] <ShivalPonyWolf> soo unstable
[08:06:05] <ShivalPonyWolf> espessily cheap ones
[08:06:15] <Phase> ShivalPonyWolf, there's a few good ones that actually show up as sata interfaces instead of usb-storage
[08:06:46] <Phase> those ones you can use on failing drives
[08:06:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> Phase: very few
[08:06:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> those are the good ones
[08:07:04] <ShivalPonyWolf> but 99% are cheap nasty ones
[08:07:11] <WeAreBorg> i have TRk laying around here
[08:07:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> ive got a lovely usb to sata connector
