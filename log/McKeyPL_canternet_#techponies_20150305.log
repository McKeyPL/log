[06:42:22] <init3> Anyone here use Squid? I have used it before years ago, but now that I have more experience with it I am a bit concerned about how it intercepts HTTPS now that I am a more security conscious. Thoughts?
[06:58:50] <ShivalPonyWolf> thats only if you connect to it over https and have it caching
[06:59:14] <ShivalPonyWolf> most swuid setups its http to squid and its encrypted inside that tunnel
[06:59:33] <ShivalPonyWolf> why https over https
[06:59:38] <ShivalPonyWolf> pointless overhead

[07:07:40] <init3> Adblocking
[07:08:05] <init3> Considering a lot of sites are doing HTTPS everywhere, and HTTP only blocker is pretty useless. 
[07:08:42] <init3> I have been using a dnsmasq include and a tiny perl webserver that serves a transparent 1x1 pixel to fill in the spot.
[07:08:46] <ShivalPonyWolf> most adblockers inject directly into the rendering engine not the packet strea.
[07:08:49] <ShivalPonyWolf> stream
[07:09:25] <init3> Even network-wide blockers?
[07:09:30] <ShivalPonyWolf> no
[07:10:00] <ShivalPonyWolf> ad blocking is normaly left to the client
[07:10:20] <ShivalPonyWolf> not often is it network wide via a proxy or trandparent proxy
[07:10:27] <ShivalPonyWolf> clients can do it mcuh eaiset
[07:10:43] <ShivalPonyWolf> becausr a network device cant rrally assess javascript
[07:10:57] <init3> Sure, it's not perfect.
[07:11:24] <ShivalPonyWolf> its seems better to do on the client then the possiblr security isue of certificate and ssl injection
[07:11:38] <init3> I have done it sucessfully with squid before and am currently using dnsmasq, but that has problems in that it completely blocks access to servers, sometimes causing issues playing videos. 
[07:11:42] <ShivalPonyWolf> just have a central adbloxk list all clients talk to
[07:11:51] <ShivalPonyWolf> yeah
[07:12:07] <init3> This doesn't help on mibile devices.
[07:12:40] <ShivalPonyWolf> you could use iblocklists adware blick list and ip firewall

[07:15:29] <init3> Also, the other tablet mainly used on this network is a craptastic verizon one with as far as I know, no known root for.
[07:15:49] <Colgate> hmm, what's wrong with squid https proxies?
[07:15:56] <Colgate> totally use them for corporate networks
[07:15:59] <init3> Even if I could accomplish it with root/jailbreak it is a giant pain in the ass 
[07:16:15] <init3> Right, I have before.
[07:16:15] <Colgate> require everyone to go through it, everything else is blocked
[07:16:34] <init3> Though in this case it isn't corporate, just my home. 
[07:16:57] <Colgate> bit overkill for home, yeah, unless you really want a cacheing server or something
[07:17:36] <init3> But yeah. I did a contract at a senior center to install content filtering because some old dude was constantly spending hours in the wide-open computer lab looking up porn.
[07:18:43] <init3> And yeah, I may set up caching too. The machine isn't exacly too powerful, but the last time I did it it was on a 500Mhz OpenBSD box I think.
[07:18:58] <init3> At home I mean.
[07:19:04] <Colgate> caching is just memory really anyways
[07:19:09] <init3> Still it worked fine.
[07:19:16] <init3> Yeah true.
[07:19:23] <init3> That server only hae like 512. 
[07:19:29] <init3> derpy has...
[07:19:48] <init3> 3G
[07:21:01] <init3> Currently running all the daemons it usually does and has 2402 free. So I suppose it's worth it.
[07:21:26] <init3> I wonder if you could/if it is a good idea to set up the proxy to cache on a ramdrive.
[07:24:00] <Webster> A PCI(e) RAM drive, or just a virtual drive in RAM?
[07:24:09] <init3> Virtual
[07:24:27] <Colgate> doesn't squid already cache to memory?
[07:24:28] <Webster> That would be pretty useless.
[07:24:52] <Colgate> assuming you configure it to :P
[07:24:59] <init3> Maybe. I do notice it uses a ton of disk space, but maybe it uses it kind fo like swap.
[07:25:05] <init3> Ahh
[07:25:16] <init3> I wonder how I had it set up before. 
[07:25:34] <init3> That was basically before the start of my Linux career.
[07:25:56] <init3> Actually, I may have been in high school so may have been before any career.
[07:26:44] <init3> Plus, I feel a lot of people seem to forget one of the most important parts about all this shit...
[07:26:48] <init3> It's fun.
[07:30:42] <init3> That's proably the main reason I have a public wifi network with a virtual wireless AP, seperate VLANS, restrictive firewall and QoS rules and naturally different subnets.

[22:07:27] <Twilightlicious> "as far as anonymity goes", that isn't the reason i'd use tor so i'm still gewd.
[22:07:42] <Twilightlicious> Lucritive ban evasion

[22:07:53] <Twilightlicious> <3
[22:08:28] <Twilightlicious> pretty much any IP my ISP assigns me is listed on DroneBL
[22:08:45] <Twilightlicious> due to some expremental autodetection that i can be used as a Proxy some how.
[22:09:02] <Twilightlicious> pretty sure thats because my ISP uses shared IPs and what-not.
[22:09:06] <Twilightlicious> like Verizon does.
[22:10:16] <urioxis> Oh sure, there are plenty of other reasons to use tor :)
[22:10:34] <urioxis> But I like to be aware of what things are good at and what they're not, you know?
[22:10:47] <urioxis> attack 1: http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf
[22:11:00] <urioxis> attack 2: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/ccs06hotornot.pdf
[22:11:22] <urioxis> attack 3: https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=556&format=pdf
[22:12:35] <urioxis> I'm sure there are more, and these may have been fixed, but they highlight that there will probably always be weaknesses in tor hidden services

[22:25:14] * Colgate is trying to read these at works >.>
[22:25:23] <Colgate> too many distractions, zzz
[22:26:31] <urioxis> Well do I know that feel, friend
[22:27:18] <Colgate> #2 I feel like would be mitigated if the tor service wasn't running on metal
[22:27:41] <Colgate> since the other activity on the host machine would cause those fluctations as well
[22:28:19] * urioxis nods
[22:28:33] * Colgate still needs to read #1 and #3
[22:29:41] <urioxis> It's also sometimes hard to distinguish theoretical attacks from ones with POCs that exist (or worse). Of course, the worst attack to date was simply a JavaScript browser exploit stuck on compromised services
[22:30:09] <urioxis> And that's hardly unique to tor. Just more dangerous as it can totally decloak you straight away
[22:31:02] <Colgate> yeah, that wasn't a fault of tor

[22:50:40] <Twilightlicious> Not to sound opinionated, but i think it's cute that Crytek is trying to compete with Unreal
[22:50:46] <Twilightlicious> >3>
[22:51:29] <Kinsley> The thing I find hilarious is that UE4 gives you /full source access/.
[22:51:49] <Kinsley> Valve has long allowed developers to use the Source engine at no charge.
[22:52:15] <Kinsley> But Crytek is charging money for what the Source engine has done since, what, Half-Life 2's release?
[22:52:29] <Webster> But but but it's so pretty! ;p
[22:52:58] <Twilightlicious> not really
[22:53:01] <Twilightlicious> not anymore
[22:53:11] <Twilightlicious> The CryEngine isn't that great looking.
[22:53:28] <Twilightlicious> "REALISTIC FOLIAGE" is all they even claim anymore
[22:53:35] <Twilightlicious> and to be real, Unreal's foliage looks better now.
[22:53:54] <Kinsley> And as much as the CryEngine was born on PC... it's not well optimized OR the features they shove in make it run poorly on all but the most powerful machines.
[22:54:06] <Twilightlicious> Yeah
[22:54:14] <Twilightlicious> Unreal can do twice the quality at half the cost.
[22:54:27] <Twilightlicious> maybe a slight exageration
[22:54:29] <Twilightlicious> but not by much
[22:54:38] <Kinsley> Which, while we all love the biggest, baddest hardware, nVidia seems to have it right.
[22:55:01] <Kinsley> The most common setup for a PC gamer is a mid-range card, their x60 or x50 type cards.
[22:55:02] <Twilightlicious> and then there's the Unity engine, jumping up and down beside its bigger brothers "What about me!?"
[22:55:33] <Twilightlicious> "I have terrible graphics, AND terrible performance! =D"
[22:56:20] <Kinsley> Well, with Unity, and largely for any other game, it should be less about the technology under the hood and more about the art and aesthetic design.
[22:56:29] <Kinsley> Like, Team Fortress 2.
[22:56:47] <Twilightlicious> Unreal is not only offering full source access to pretty much everyone, but theyre allowing you to profit up to like, 2000$ i think
[22:56:54] <Twilightlicious> without giving them a penny. :P
[22:57:04] <Kinsley> $3000 per quarter.
[22:57:12] <Twilightlicious> yeah
[22:57:13] <Twilightlicious> that.
[22:57:28] <Twilightlicious> thats pretty Epic (see what i did there?)
[22:57:35] <Kinsley> Hahaha.
[22:58:04] <Kinsley> Not a bad model, if you think about it.
[22:58:07] <Twilightlicious> I have yet to run any UE4 based apps or games on my desktop yet
[22:58:14] <Twilightlicious> but i look forward to seeing how it performs on my setup
[22:58:37] <Kinsley> With it supporting DirectX 12 and based on those numbers? Probably really well.
[22:58:57] <Twilightlicious> yeah just like Windows 10 being "Free", I assume Epic makes money from companies like EA/Ubisoft using their engine
[22:59:30] <Twilightlicious> they don't make their money from consumers
[22:59:33] <Twilightlicious> or whatever lol
[23:00:07] <Kinsley> Hmm. I don't recall any recent releases from Ubisoft that use the Unreal Engine.
[23:00:08] <Twilightlicious> so it's a good move for them, getting more people using the engine and being excited about it.
[23:00:15] <Kinsley> Nor EA, for that matter.
[23:00:15] <Twilightlicious> It was just an example lol
[23:00:31] <Twilightlicious> i couldn't think of any big companies that used UE besides Bioware
[23:00:34] <Kinsley> I know 2K has XCOM and Borderlands running on Unreal...
[23:00:57] <Twilightlicious> 2K* I mean
[23:00:59] <Twilightlicious> :P
[23:01:02] <Twilightlicious> Bioshock used UE.
[23:01:35] <Twilightlicious> DNF used Unreal 2
[23:01:36] <Twilightlicious> lolol
[23:01:47] <Kinsley> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games
[23:01:48] <PinkiePieBot> [ List of Unreal Engine games - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
[23:02:17] <Twilightlicious> I've been thinking about getting the GTX 960
[23:02:30] <Twilightlicious> But i dunno how much performance i'll get out of it compared to my current 560 Ti
[23:03:11] <Twilightlicious> they have DNF listed as Unreal 1
[23:03:15] <Twilightlicious> and that's not true lol
[23:04:31] <Kinsley> Probably because at one point in its development it DID.
[23:04:41] <Twilightlicious> The original DNF was Unreal 1
[23:04:47] <Twilightlicious> back in like 1999
[23:05:04] <Twilightlicious> but they shouldn't list it like that
[23:05:28] <Kinsley> Anyway, jumping forward three generations would probably give you some decent bumps across the board.
[23:05:47] <Kinsley> Especially if you found one of those EVGA models with 4GB of VRAM.
[23:06:08] <Twilightlicious> i was gonna get a GTX 760 i think
[23:06:15] <Twilightlicious> but my  560Ti was faster in benchmarks
[23:07:19] <Twilightlicious> But i think the 960 is faster
[23:07:28] <Twilightlicious> But it doesnt have two Moniter outs
[23:07:30] <Twilightlicious> only one
[23:07:54] <Twilightlicious> So i was going to use both cards simultaniously, But i think i only have 1 PCIe slot.
[23:08:16] <Twilightlicious> Plus, i dunno about my Power Supply running both anyway
[23:08:26] <Twilightlicious> My 560Ti is a power hog lol
[23:10:14] <Kinsley> nVidia won't let you run two different cards in SLI, so you couldn't use your existing 560 Ti and a new 960 together like that.
[23:10:47] <Kinsley> But the 960 has one DVI, one HDMI, and three DisplayPort outs. So get an adapter?
[23:14:12] <Twilightlicious> i wasn't refering to SLi.
[23:14:20] <Twilightlicious> I was just going to use it for a 2nd moniter lol
[23:14:26] <Twilightlicious> :P
[23:14:44] <Twilightlicious> and 3rd moniter >=3
[23:15:04] <Twilightlicious> Also, DX12 lets you combine GPUs no matter what type
[23:15:06] <Twilightlicious> ;P
[23:15:09] <Twilightlicious> DX12 <3
[23:15:34] <Twilightlicious> will tempt me to enable my Onboard
[23:15:41] <Twilightlicious> actually, why don't i just use my onboard for my 2nd moniter.
[23:15:44] <Twilightlicious> duuuhhhhh
