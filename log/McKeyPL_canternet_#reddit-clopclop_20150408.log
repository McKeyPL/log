[05:43:55] <samonuh> Downside: I have to watch over freshmen
[05:43:55] <Lumia> Yeah
[05:44:39] <Lumia> Upside: freshman are sex addicts

[05:48:01] <samonuh> Seems fun
[05:48:07] <Vulpixbrew> tfw ou didn't really enjoy college cause you went to a tenchianl school
[05:48:22] <Vulpixbrew> and studies my ass off

[05:50:27] <weisey> well
[05:50:34] <weisey> i guess it depends what program
[05:50:35] <samonuh> My dad wanted me to go for engineering for the money
[05:50:45] <samonuh> Glad I never take his advice
[05:50:46] <weisey> nah
[05:50:51] <weisey> IT is where the money at
[05:51:06] <Squirrelly> Yeah if I'd stayed a programmer I'd have been making at LEAST $65-$70k a year coming out of college
[05:51:07] <samonuh> That would be appealing if I cared about money
[05:51:15] <Squirrelly> I would've felt like crap though
[05:51:28] <Squirrelly> I went to an insanely good school
[05:51:37] <samonuh> Cambridge?

[23:17:24] <Puddles> but muscle is why I refuse to get a scale.
[23:17:32] <Puddles> :l
[23:17:41] <Puddles> numbers just make me mad
[23:17:46] <Puddles> its like, yay my pants are loose
[23:17:51] <Puddles> but wat, gained 15 lbs
[23:17:56] <Puddles> wah.
[23:18:09] <Vulpixbrew> I dont mind weighing 200 lbs as long as I can benchpress like a 250
[23:18:21] <Puddles> I dont bench press.
[23:18:30] <Puddles> I walk a lot
[23:18:39] <Puddles> or did
[23:18:43] <Puddles> now less so much
[23:18:51] <Puddles> I forsee a jellybody in my future
[23:18:57] <Puddles> though im eating better so probably not
[23:19:06] <Puddles> idk
[23:19:27] <Puddles> I cleaned up my diet a lot 'cause me and dude are trying to make midgets
[23:19:33] <Puddles> and i dont want to be all tired and shieet
[23:20:51] <iamalion> check out what I spent the last 30 hours printing! http://i.imgur.com/A8xjLLk.jpg
[23:21:06] <Drago> I am lucky. I sit at a constant 160 pounds pretty much regardless of what I do.
[23:21:09] <ponder> Oh, nice.
[23:21:44] <Drago> If I want I can cut down 10 pounds or so to get real cut up but otherwise I am so very lucky
[23:22:07] <Drago> That's cool iamalion!
[23:22:12] <Puddles> If I smell food I feel my fat cells getting excited.
[23:22:16] <Puddles> :l
[23:22:22] <Vulpixbrew> then again i mostly run so my legs are muscle and the rest of me
[23:22:23] <ponder> I am a bit jiggly, myself.
[23:22:30] <Puddles> holy shit that's cool.
[23:22:48] <Drago> I have medical problems that keep me from eating that much though
[23:22:49] <Vulpixbrew> is like I have a bit of a gut I hate
[23:22:51] <iamalion> i gotta clean it up and acetone it then it will be dun
[23:22:52] <iamalion> done
[23:22:58] <Drago> But still..
[23:23:08] <ponder> Anyway, I gotta pop off. Se y'all sexy ponies later.
[23:23:13] <Puddles> Kay
[23:23:28] <Puddles> My problem is I don't really get hungry or full.

[23:23:36] <Puddles> and stop eating when I remember to stop eating.
[23:24:40] <Puddles> When I actually do feel hungry, it's rare and I don't recognise it right away.
[23:24:54] <Puddles> I'll be like sfklsdfjshdfkjs my stomachs been bugging me all day grr
[23:25:28] <Vulpixbrew> I just realized something Ive had nothing but choclate cake today

[23:30:20] <Puddles> oh, theres those weird fruit bars
[23:30:33] <Puddles> but their texture makes me feel like I shouldn't have teeth to really enjoy them
[23:30:41] <Puddles> but im not used to oats melting in my mouth I guess.
