[23:19:43] <Ponder> aww
[23:20:01] <AKSandler> What's wrong? 
[23:20:08] <AKSandler> don't be sads ;-;
[23:20:16] <Ponder> That AK in your name raised my hope and dashed it quite expertly.
[23:20:30] <Ponder> but not really. Is only a joke.
[23:21:18] <AKSandler> What that you would finally get to meet a clopper? haha. Lucky me, my step brother is a clopper, though he isn't a brony .-. strange
[23:21:26] <AKSandler> He shares the best with me
[23:21:34] <Ponder> hehe, neat
[23:23:10] <AKSandler> Indeed it is. We don't share often however. Only a comfortable amount
[23:24:10] <Ponder> I would probably find it very awkward to share porn with my siblings
[23:24:55] <AKSandler> He is more like a friend since he came into my life when I was 12? 13? idk, I'm 15 now. But we're not blood related 
[23:25:26] <Ponder> Aww, I'm sorry to say, but it looks like you're too young for the chat, then.
[23:25:31] <Melon_Guy> woah
[23:25:31] <Melon_Guy> yo you know this is a +18 channel
[23:25:45] <Ponder> Yeah, this is an 18+ chat only.

[23:26:09] <Melon_Guy> and in the header
[23:26:16] <AKSandler> Oh shizzies. That's unfortunate/
[23:26:37] <Ponder> It is.
[23:27:19] <AKSandler> Well, if you guys want to talk still, my internet friend fb is Akaylynn Fischbach. 
[23:27:40] <AKSandler> Can't believe I missed the age thing haha
[23:28:08] <Melon_Guy> yeah mate
[23:28:11] <Ponder> No worries.
