[00:03:00] <Waffles> How do I get a channel list?
[00:03:05] <Colgate> /list
[00:03:09] <Waffles> thanks
[00:04:02] <Waffles> is there a way to sort the list?
[00:04:17] <Colgate> that would have to be done by your client
[00:04:19] <Waffles> like /list -u or something
[00:04:44] <Waffles> Ah, default web client so I guess I'm screwed. Thanks. :)
[00:05:12] <Colgate> you can use a filter to narrow it down
[00:05:25] <Colgate> like "/list >10" for only channels with 11 or more people
[00:05:33] <Colgate> or /list *word*
[00:05:46] <Waffles> Ah, okay, cool! Thanks!

[22:09:30] <Shan> hey
[22:09:33] <Shan> i registered the channel
[22:09:50] <Shan> how can i login through my channel pasword
[22:10:40] <Fluttershi> channel password? how'd you do that?
[22:10:44] <Fluttershi> k?
[22:10:44] <Twili> I read in a book once that said k might be worth bookmarking, then, so you don't end up having to search for it later
[22:10:55] <Colgate> there are no channel passwords
[22:11:11] <Colgate> least not in chanserv
[22:11:23] <Colgate> you just log into your nickserv account
[22:11:39] <Fluttershi> i think if you /did/ do somethin, it'd be /join #channel password
[22:11:45] <Shan> NO MAN
[22:11:51] <Shan> i am founder of one channel
[22:11:55] <Shan> but mistakenly
[22:11:58] <Shan> i added one wrong admin
[22:12:04] <Shan> and now i am aop on that channel
[22:12:11] <Shan> my owner rights are removed
[22:12:24] <Shan> that's not only my channel that is also my website
[22:12:28] <Shan> is there anyone to help
[22:12:30] <Shan> Shutter is away
[22:12:33] <Fluttershi> you gave someone else owner and they hijacked the channel on you?
[22:12:45] <Shan> he didn't hijack the channel yet
[22:12:49] <Shan> but my rights are not there
[22:12:54] <Shan> i want my rights back
[22:12:58] <Colgate> what channel?
[22:13:02] <Shan> #gupshupcorner
[22:14:14] <Shan> what now ?
[22:14:15] <Shan> Shutter
[22:14:16] <Twili> Ponies say Shutter was slaps zyphex around with a +b
[22:14:26] <Shan> where are you man
[22:14:36] <Colgate> an owner removed your channel access
[22:14:44] <Colgate> this is a risk you take when you make someone an owner
[22:15:00] <Shan> what now ?
[22:15:17] <Colgate> you can ask them to give it back to you, or make a new channel
[22:15:36] <Shan> WHAT DO YOU mean
[22:15:41] <Shan> you people are not going to help me
[22:15:51] <Shan> you can see that i regsitered the channel to my name
[22:16:21] <Fluttershi> y'all got hijacked
[22:16:50] <Colgate> sure, I can see that
[22:17:02] <Colgate> but you gave them owner, that gives them /complete/ control over the channel
[22:17:09] <Colgate> including eprmissions to make /you/ not owner
[22:17:21] <Shan> well i don't know anything
[22:17:28] <Shan> i want the same channel with my founder access back
[22:17:30] <Colgate> this is why we do not recommend doing this
[22:17:39] <Shan> that is my site
[22:17:49] <Colgate> there is nothing we will do
[22:17:56] <Colgate> you gave him owner, he removed your owner
[22:19:14] <Shan> Colgate what do you mean
[22:19:17] <Shan> you guys own channel 
[22:19:20] <Shan> and can do whatever u want
[22:19:55] <Colgate> that is correct, however, we will not
[22:20:11] <Colgate> you can create a new channel and register it
[22:20:27] <Colgate> and be the owner of that one, and this time, not give owner to people you cannot trust
[22:21:32] <Shan> Hey man
[22:21:36] <Shan> i will get it back
[22:21:43] <Shan> but if you are not going to help me out then i am in a risk
[22:22:04] <Shan> Should i think about moving my site to other server is this the way you treat the people who uses your server
[22:22:08] <Shan> ask shutter he is my very good friend
[22:23:42] <Colgate> that is a risk you take when you are giving people the +F founder flag
[22:23:47] <Colgate> we cannot protect you from yourself
[22:24:30] <Shan> what do you mean
[22:24:35] <Shan> you can see 
[22:24:41] <Shan> the channel is registered on my name
[22:24:46] <Colgate> not anymore
[22:24:48] <Shan> but still you are denying
[22:24:53] <Shan> Hell man ?
[22:24:59] <Shan> What the heck is this ?
[22:25:05] <Colgate> you gave someone +F, they removed you
[22:25:08] <Shan> instead of helping me out
[22:25:14] <Shan> what do you mean
[22:25:18] <Shan> i gave them for settings
[22:25:39] <Colgate> you should have given them +*, not +*F
[22:25:44] <Colgate> in that case
[22:26:03] <Shan> ok i did a mistake
[22:26:06] <Colgate> giving anyone +F gives them 100% complete control over the channel
[22:26:12] <Hck> +F is like root
[22:26:15] <Shan> but it doesn't mean
[22:26:21] <Shan> that i will not get my cahnnel back
[22:26:21] <Colgate> including control to remove you from the access list
[22:26:37] <Hck> Probably yes
[22:26:39] <Colgate> it isn't your channel anymore
[22:26:48] <Shan> it is my channel
[22:26:59] <Shan> and gupshupcorner.com belongs to me
[22:27:01] <Shan> i own that site
[22:27:05] <Colgate> Founder    : Freak, Fair_Friend
[22:27:10] <Colgate> it belongs to them
[22:27:35] <Shan> ok when they will come online
[22:27:37] <Shan> they will add me back
[22:27:42] <Shan> but very poor support man
[22:27:47] <Shan> i didn't know you people would do such a things
