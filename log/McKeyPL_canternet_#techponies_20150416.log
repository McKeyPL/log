[02:42:41] <Hickory> I find it odd that it's okay to discriminate against scientology because it's really wierd and has some people in it that has done some bad things, but they go to great lengths to protect Islam

[02:50:54] <Phase4> cyborg_ar, it doesnt have to guess, c has a well defined calling convention
[02:51:04] <cyborg_ar> true
[02:51:15] <cyborg_ar> i call it a guess because many people dont read it

[07:41:12] <AppleDash> Define "lag"
[07:41:25] <Phase4> a frame ever other second
[07:41:49] <AppleDash> It happens sometimes, usually I find reconnecting fixes it, and if not, restarting the client
[07:42:03] <Phase4> got an i7-4810MQ and 870M, not like my pc is slow
[07:42:53] <Phase4> AppleDash, restarting doesn't seem to help
[07:42:59] <Phase4> starts lagging again soon after
[07:43:00] <AppleDash> I don't care if you have an 8 core Xeon E5 and quad SLI titans, Minecraft is still terribly coded :P
[07:43:21] <Phase4> yeah but other modpacks aren't this slow
[07:43:31] <AppleDash> I've not had such an issue on a similar machine
[07:43:33] <Phase4> and they don't have fastcraft insalled, whatever fastcraft is
[07:44:19] <AppleDash> fastcraft does what its name implies
[07:44:24] <AppleDash> It's supposed to make the game faster
[07:45:49] <tiwake> lag as in not rendering video as fast as the display screen's refresh rate?
[07:46:20] <AppleDash> Yes
[07:52:39] <Phase4> AppleDash, also i nicked a generator, alloy smeltery, and leadstone cell
[07:52:49] <Phase4> and had to put a bit of fuel in your reactor
[07:52:52] <AppleDash> Phase4, fine with me
[07:53:00] <AppleDash> Yeah, the reactor isn't setup to fuel itself yet :P
[07:55:40] <Phase4> well it is but you were out of yellorium
[07:56:06] <Phase4> used what was in your capacitor to process half a stack and mostly fill it

[10:34:54] <Phase4> near your base, there's an ender quarry over the sea
[10:34:59] <AppleDash> Yeah
[10:35:02] <AppleDash> What's wrong with it?
[10:35:03] <Phase4> and about way too many iron chests to handle the output
[10:35:13] <AppleDash> Oh yeah, that was Jordin
[10:35:13] <Phase4> i mean, it works
[10:35:16] <Phase4> but wow
[10:35:19] <AppleDash> I had like 8 diamond chests
[10:35:23] <Phase4> i wouldn't have built it
[10:35:30] <AppleDash> then he decided to remove them and nail on a fuckload of iron chests despite me saying not to
[10:35:41] <Phase4> you mined some ae presses XD
[10:35:46] <AppleDash> I saw that, lol
[10:36:07] <AppleDash> I like my system for powering the thing honestly, I'm way too proud of it

[10:36:20] <Phase4> mind if i nick those presses?
[10:36:26] <AppleDash> Go right ahead
[10:36:41] <Phase4> now i just need a logic press
[10:36:48] <AppleDash> Go to our house

[10:42:15] <JustAberrant> and eliminated a lot of game elements

[10:43:24] <JustAberrant> also, are you doing anything about ender chests on the server?
[10:43:45] <AppleDash> Phase4: Just a note BTW, re: your lag issues earlier, I'm playing at 3k on similar hardware and nothing bad has happened really
[10:43:49] <AppleDash> JustAberrant, "doing anything"
[10:43:55] <AppleDash> I can make a registry like yours if you wish

[10:44:26] <JustAberrant> well, as before, I plan on using a shit tonne of them, just don't want to screw up anyone elses stuff

[22:08:14] <Quindo> .... huh, Booleans are not working...
[22:10:09] <AppleDash> Quindo: What?
[22:10:27] <Quindo> I have no idea...  The code is so simple it should work.
[22:10:37] <AppleDash> Show code?
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 	public void IsOff(){
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 	//Debug.Log("Off" + index);
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 		if (value) {
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 			value = false;
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 			stateChange = true;
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 		} else {
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 			stateChange = false;
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 		}
[22:11:02] <Quindo> 	}
[22:11:20] <AppleDash> Uhh, what language?
[22:11:23] <Quindo> c#
[22:11:37] <AppleDash> What's the expected behaviour and what's happening instead?
[22:11:46] <Quindo> oh wait, I copied the wrong function.
[22:12:06] <Kinsley> Quindo: try using Pastebin or Gist instead.
[22:12:16] <Quindo> I will Kinsley.
[22:12:38] <Quindo> basically, the expected behavior is that whenever Value changes from either true or false then statechange will display as true for 1 frame, then switch to false.
[22:13:36] <Quindo> http://pastebin.com/L1qBtTHV
[22:13:37] <PinkiePieBot> [ public void IsOn(){ if (!value) { Debug.Log("+On" + index); value - Pastebin.com ]
[22:15:20] <Quindo> what is happening is both value and statechange are always equal to each other, and Debug.Log("-On" + index); is never being ran...
[22:15:40] <Quindo> it is weird, but I must be messing something up because it should be really simple.
[22:15:58] <AppleDash> I dunno, I'd need more context probably
[22:16:35] <Quindo> hmmm I think I may have found the issue, testing it.
[22:16:48] <Quindo> aha, got it.
[22:17:04] <AppleDash> yay
[22:17:14] <Quindo> The storage array was being reset to the default every single frame.
[22:18:14] <Quindo> I knew it was something simple stupid like that but I could not find the problem XD
[22:18:43] <Quindo> Sometimes you just need to talk it out to someone to notice the issue.
