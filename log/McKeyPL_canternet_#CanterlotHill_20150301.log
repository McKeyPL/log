[01:59:37] <Hamtramck> I want to get some koss portapros
[01:59:44] <Cloud_Zephyr> ha wut a nerd. i can identify headphones
[02:00:32] <Hamtramck> I have a pair of some kind of Sennheisers, but they're too tight to be comfortable and uh, also I broke the plug a few weeks after I got them and had to replace it so idk if that affected the quality
[02:00:38] <Hamtramck> also have some sony earbuds which are what I mostly use
[02:00:45] <RandomNinja> nut light is good
[02:00:49] <RandomNinja> but*
[02:00:58] <RandomNinja> oh tight
[02:00:59] <Cloud_Zephyr> m50x £100 headpone master race
[02:01:05] <RandomNinja> pls
[02:01:17] <wobniaR> They're not the best but they're nice
[02:01:32] <Cloud_Zephyr> theres better headphones for £100? :O
[02:01:55] <RandomNinja> DT770, some would argue
[02:02:11] <One-Trick> i like my v8's a lot, i just hate the curly cord
[02:02:28] <Sleepypony> hd-650s for me
[02:02:39] <Sleepypony> and these cans are like 17 years old
[02:02:51] <RandomNinja> hd650 is like 3 price ranges higher though
[02:03:27] <Hamtramck> I don't want to spend a lot on headphnes because they tend to break on me
[02:03:28] <RandomNinja> that said I do want a pair
[02:03:29] <Sleepypony> for cheap, then yea DT770
[02:03:41] <Hamtramck> Like what broke the sennheisers was accidentally pulling the plug out f the socket.
[02:03:45] <Hamtramck> It bent.
[02:03:53] <RandomNinja> so get ones with detachable cable
[02:03:56] <Sleepypony> well, my HD-650s did raves, concerts
[02:04:01] <Sleepypony> and are fine
[02:04:21] <Sleepypony> they lived through the rave era in the uk
[02:04:23] <RandomNinja> aren't they rigid metal all the way through?
